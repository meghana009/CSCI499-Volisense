except as may be otherwise stated by the company now i ll turn the call over to chris mccann chris mccann chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining our call this morning before we jump into the results for the third quarter i d like to take a moment to level set our view of the significant changes or stages that our company has seen over the past several years essentially we see our business and the macro economy that we operate in in four stages pre covid during covid the current environment which i will optimistically call late covid and the fourth stage our outlook for the future prior to covid our company had set a goal to accelerate revenue growth while continuing to grow ebitda and free cash flow for the second half of fiscal 2018 through the first three quarters of fiscal 20 we significantly accelerated our growth rate from low single digits to high single digits with our forward looking guidance at the time calling for double digit growth we did this by leveraging the strength of our all star family of brands and evolving our business platform into a highly scalable and leverageable e commerce platform that is built for growth the world has changed dramatically in the spring of 2020 with the advent of the covid pandemic and we all had to adapt to lockdowns work from home social distancing mask and so much more than we ve all had to live through from a business standpoint we had to pivot quickly to address dramatically increasing demand from consumers stuck at home while being sure to protect our associates across the company once again the resourcefulness and dedication of our team helped our customers stay connected with the important people in their lives and we saw our revenues our bottom line results and our customer file accelerate significantly today as we are entering what we hope are the late last stages of the pandemic our world and the macroeconomy has changed dramatically once again disruptions in the global supply chain geopolitical turmoil and an unprecedented rapid rise in price inflation have combined to deliver a broad range of challenges to the macroeconomic environment from rising costs to slowing consumer demand as we look ahead to the future we know that we need to address the challenges we face in the near term while continuing to invest in our business in the long term that has been our business philosophy from day one and it has enabled us with the talented team and experienced team that we ve assembled and the unique business platform that we ve built to weather the challenging periods in the past and emerge as a bigger stronger and better company that we are today with that said let s turn our attention to the most recent quarter s results which as we stated in this morning s press release were below our expectations during the quarter we saw solid growth for the valentine s day holiday and our 1 800 flowers brand and based on the industry data that we ve seen we continue to extend our market leading position in the floral category however the holiday period strength was offset during the quarter by the slower consumer demand across all categories for everyday gifting occasions reflecting growing consumer concerns with rapidly rising inflation and geopolitical unrest in terms of the bottom line our results for the quarter reflected a continuation and in some areas such as fuel prices an escalation of the inflationary pressures that we discussed back in january while we expect these challenges to persist in the near term we re beginning to see early improvements in certain areas including some softening in ocean freight rates and port disruption and improved outbound shipping efficiency trends that we certainly hope will continue more importantly we re taking proactive steps to address these issues and we are well positioned because of the scale of our business and the strength of our unique business platform to weather the current macroeconomic environment and as we emerge as we have in the past a bigger stronger and better company to provide some perspective on our scale our revenue in the third quarter while essentially flat with the prior year period was up more than 68 compared with our fiscal 2020 third quarter in fact over the past three years we have essentially doubled the size of our company with revenues now exceeding 2 billion while macro market conditions have slowed consumer demand in the near term we anticipate driving growth on top of last year s more than 42 increase for our full fiscal 22 year we ll continue to leverage the unique assets that we ve assembled on our platform including our all star lineup of market leading brands in floral gourmet food and personalized gifts and we continue to expand our product offerings through accretive acquisitions that our customers are embracing such as shari s berries personalization mall and our most recent acquisition vital choice our large customer base which also has more than doubled in size over the past few years and includes extensive and increasingly valuable first party data here we are combining behavioral and demographic data with machine learning technology to create highly personalized campaigns and experience for our customers on our sites and throughout our communications touch points our celebrations passport loyalty program which continues to grow at a strong pace with membership up more than 40 year over year importantly as we always point out the behavior of our passport customer continues to be strong in terms of frequency retention and average spending all well above non passport customers and passport continues to feed our very best customer cohort those who purchase from multiple product categories or brands and those that have our highest frequency retention and average spend we ve also been improving the user experience on the new celebrations passport app that we launched in january some of the new features we ve added include the ability to search for any product across our family of brands on the app including wine and we ve deployed new ways to connect with our customers directly through the app we provided help finding gifts and advice on how to celebrate we present custom app specific promotions and events and we push tailored notifications based on past experiences along with the passport app we continue to view the overall celebrations passport loyalty program as a key element in our strategic focus on customer engagement and enhancing the total customer experience along that line we also continue to expand our initiatives to create a true community through a broad range of non transactional engagement experiences and content through the third quarter we reached more than 80 million consumer engagements driven by our content and social campaigns and a growing number of influencer campaigns we are now fast approaching our target of more than 120 million consumer engagements for the full fiscal year 22 now these engagements really help us to build relationships with our customers beyond the transaction and give us the opportunity to really deepen that relationship we believe the combination of these unique assets and initiatives position us well to manage our business and drive long term revenue growth terms of bottom line results while we anticipate facing continued cost headwinds in the near term our strong balance sheet enables us to invest in our operating platform to address these issues and build for the future these investments include initiatives to automate our warehouse and distribution facilities which reduces our exposure on the labor front to utilize our strong balance sheet to build and bring in inventory early to get ahead of the ongoing global supply chain issues and to optimize programs to enhance our outbound shipping operations and manage rising third party shipping costs over the long term we anticipate these initiatives will enable us to improve our gross margins and drive enhanced bottom line performance now i d like to turn the call over to bill for his review of some of the key metrics from the third quarter bill shea chief financial officer thank you chris our results for the fiscal third quarter both top and bottom line were below our expectations revenue in the quarter were down 1 compared with the prior year period reflecting solid growth of bucketing 5 for the valentine s day holiday in our consumer floral business and contributions from vital choice which we acquired back in october these positives were offset by the shift of easter to later in our fiscal fourth quarter this year compared with last year when most of the holiday sales fell in our third quarter but with deferred revenues coming into the quarter compared with the prior year when customers particularly in our harry and david brand we re willing to accept delivery of holiday season gifts well into january and slow e commerce demand for everyday occasions throughout the quarter reflecting growing consumer concerns with rising inflation and geopolitical unrest but as a reminder q3 revenues were up 68 over q3 of fiscal 2020 the final quarter prices into the pandemic and up 52 on an organic basis if we exclude p mall and vital choice revenues in terms of our bottom line results gross margins in the quarter were impacted by several factors including the continued disruptions in the global supply chain the escalation of commodity costs increased costs for inbound and outbound shipping including an acceleration in fuel surcharges related to rising oil prices increased year over year labor rates across the company and the write off of certain inventories of expired perishable products reflecting softer than anticipated demand levels in addition during the quarter we continued to see digital marketing rates up more than 30 compared with the prior year period levels which impacted effectiveness in driving traffic to our sites as chris noted we do not expect these headwinds to go away in the near term however as we enter our fiscal fourth quarter we do see some opportunities for improved performance including the benefits of the easter shift into the period our strong inventory position and the spring season s key holidays including mother s day father s day graduations and wedding season where we anticipate stronger consumer demand as we saw in the past two quarters for key holiday occasions in addition we are continuing to work diligently to mitigate higher costs through the investments in our business platform that chris described as well as through our strategic pricing initiatives now breaking down some key metrics from our third quarter as we have already noted total consolidated revenues were 469 6 million down 1 compared with 474 2 million in the prior year period validated gross profit margin for the period was 32 8 a decline of 610 basis points compared with the prior year period reflecting the aforementioned cost headwinds operating expenses as a percent of total revenues improved 60 basis points to 38 4 of total sales compared with 39 in the prior year period operating expenses excluding stock based compensation the cost associated with the one time employee class action legal settlement and the appreciation and depreciation of investments in the company s non qualified compensation plan improved 10 basis points to 38 1 of total sales compared with 38 2 in the prior year period combination of these factors resulted in a net loss for the quarter of 23 4 million or 0 36 per share compared with net income of 1 4 million or 0 02 per diluted share in the prior year period adjusted net loss for the quarter was 21 million or 0 32 per share compared with adjusted net income of 1 5 million or 0 02 per diluted share in the prior year period and adjusted ebitda for the quarter was a loss of 12 million compared with adjusted ebitda of 15 4 million in the prior year period regarding our segment results in our gourmet food and gift basket segment where revenues for the quarter were a 167 4 million down 4 5 compared with a 175 2 million in the prior year period this primarily reflected softer consumer demand throughout the quarter combined with the shift of the easter holiday and low deferred revenue entering the quarter compared with the prior year period this was partially offset by higher year over year wholesale revenues and revenues associated with vital choice gross profit margin was 25 3 a decline of 1 410 basis points compared with 39 4 in the prior year period this primarily reflected increased cost of labor inbound and outbound shipping fuel and charges associated with the write off of expiring inventories segment contribution margin was a loss of 17 1 million compared with segment contribution margin of 12 1 million in the prior year period reflecting the reduced revenues and gross margin as well as the higher year over year digital marketing costs adjusted segment contribution margin for the quarter was a loss of 14 2 million excluding one time costs associated with the settlement of an employee class action compared with segment contribution margin of 12 1 million in the prior year period in consumer floral and gifts total revenues were 264 2 million an increase of 1 5 compared with 260 4 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting solid growth for the valentine s day holiday partly offset by softer everyday gifting sales gross profit margin was 36 7 down 110 basis points compared with 37 8 in the prior year period primarily reflecting increased shipping costs and segment contribution margin was 20 5 million down 8 9 compared with 22 5 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting reduced gross margin and higher year over year digital marketing costs in our bloomnet business revenues for the quarter were 38 4 million down 1 compared with 38 8 million in the prior year period profit margin was 38 7 down 560 basis points compared with 44 3 in the prior year period primarily reflecting product mix and higher inbound shipping costs as a result segment contribution margin was 9 8 million down 18 8 compared with 12 million in the prior year period turning to our balance sheet our cash and investment position was 93 million at the end of the third quarter compared with 173 6 million at the end of fiscal 2021 lower cash balance primarily reflects our investments in inventory to help offset the headwinds associated with supply chain and labor combined with a higher capex spend primarily related to automation efforts and our investments in our orchards an increase in our stock repurchases amounting to 35 million year to date and repayment of term debt inventory was 214 4 million up 60 million compared with the end of fiscal 2021 primarily reflecting our decision to use our strong balance sheet to invest in inventory and help mitigate the continuing challenges in the supply chain terms of debt we had a 167 2 million in term debt and zero borrowings under our revolving credit facility regarding guidance we re updating our guidance for fiscal 2022 full year based on the results we have reported for the first three quarters of the year as well as our outlook for our current fiscal fourth quarter we anticipate achieving total revenue growth in a range of 3 to 5 compared with the prior year adjusted ebitda in the range of 110 million to 115 million and adjusted eps in the range of 0 55 to 0 60 per diluted share we anticipate that free cash flow for the year will be down significantly compared with the prior year based on our updated guidance and our efforts to use our strong balance sheet to invest in inventory support our growth plans and to address the continuing headwinds we see in the macro economy i will now turn the call back to chris chris mccann chief executive officer thanks bill to sum up our results for the fiscal third quarter were below our expectations despite the solid growth that we saw for the valentine s day holiday we continue to see significant cost increases as well as softer consumer demand for everyday occasions reflecting the macroeconomic conditions we are proactively addressing these challenges by using our strong balance sheet to invest in initiatives that will help us mitigate rising costs and implementing innovative marketing and merchandising programs designed to engage and build deeper relationships with our customers to help drive improved growth during the quarter we attracted nearly 1 5 million new customers and added more than 225 000 new members to our celebrations passport loyalty program and we continue to expand our cross category and cross branded merchandise programs fully integrating our new vital choice brand onto our platform as we enter our fiscal fourth quarter we have several innovative marketing and merchandising initiatives that we are very excited about including our new partnership with global superstar dolly parton which we kicked off to celebrate international women s day in april dolly collaborated with our team to curate several exclusive floral arrangements and she dropped her newest album run rose run along with a companion novel that was available for our customers to buy digitally on the 1 800 flowers site she also promoted her collaboration with us on her social channels reaching millions of her loyal fans and we have a new partnership with famed iron chef geoffrey zakarian who is now serving as our culinary ambassador for harry david zakarian worked with our team to create a special collection of harry david products including items from our wolferman s bakery and new vital choice brands and just in time for mother s day staying at the forefront of innovation we ve launched two exclusive collections of nfts featuring unique artwork that celebrate moms looking ahead the current macro economy is highly unpredictable with that said it s important to note that we have faced challenging macro market conditions in the past and because of the strength of our unique business platform combined with our talent and experienced team we have emerged a bigger better and stronger company as a company we are continuously evolving through compelling messaging and unique gift offerings for every emotion we are dedicated to helping inspire our community of customers to give more connect more and build more and better relationships we are confident that we will continue to grow our company and build shareholder value over the long term in closing as in my past calls i d like to give a shout out to all of our associates across the company we have a tremendously talented team that continues to work diligently to address the challenges that we are seeing in the macro environment and drive long term growth i thank them for their hard work their innovative thinking and their laser focus on our community of customers now i d like to introduce you to tom hartnett tom was promoted to president of the company earlier this week having previously served as group president for our consumer floral and gifts segment since joining our company in 1991 tom has held number of positions of increasing responsibility and made many significant contributions to our business not the least of which has been a tremendous growth and expanded market leadership in our 1 800 flowers brand which he has overseen tom has also been instrumental in building our company s digital marketing expertise championing cross brand cross category product innovation to provide more gifting solutions for our customers and driving initiatives that further our commitment to customer service excellence tom and i have worked very closely over the years and i look forward to many many more years of partnership as he takes on this new role i am confident that his appointment will serve our stakeholders well as we further integrate our brands and our operating platforms jade we can now open the call for questions please thank you questions answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from anthony lebiedzinski of sidoti please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti and company analyst yes good morning and thank you for taking the questions i guess first just a quick housekeeping item can you give us a sense as to pricing versus volume just for the quarter if you have that available chris mccann chief executive officer sure good morning anthony thanks for your question bill you want to take that bill shea chief financial officer sure anthony aov was up ten plus percent offset by a decline in units it s kind of combination of both the strategic pricing initiatives that were that were put in place but also product mix as we re selling more and more bundled products and kind of featuring more higher priced items on the site chris mccann chief executive officer i think it s important to know we always look you think you re familiar anthony to make sure we have a broad range of products at all price points so as bill points out when we see the higher price point items growing we push those a little bit more but especially in this macro environment that we re working in it s important to have a good selection of entry level price points as well anthony lebiedzinski sidoti and company analyst thanks for that and then just in terms of the gross margin pressure that you guys saw in the quarter quite a bit more than what we had expected i think it s the first time you guys called out specifically write off of expiring inventories what was the magnitude of that bill shea chief financial officer there was a number of factors that impacted gross margins we mentioned them in our formal remarks both inbound and outbound shipping being influenced by fuel surcharges certainly labor commodity cost increases with inflationary as well as just availability of some supply such as wheat and eggs with the shortage of hens but additionally the write of some perishable inventory the large majority of investments we ve made in inventory is in nonperishable items however coming out of the holiday season we did expect stronger consumer demand we maintained some of the labor some of the seasonal labor that we had at the holiday time as once you let go of that labor you don t get it back and we built some inventory with some perishable products in there expecting higher demand when that did not come we did have some write offs probably amounted to about 5 to 6 million during the quarter which is probably 130 basis points of the 600 or so points that we re down in margin anthony lebiedzinski sidoti and company analyst got it ok and then you guys talked about the easter shift just wondering how significant that was and then as far as the lower deferred revenue just wanted to get a sense of what the impact of that was and i have one more question after that chris mccann chief executive officer yeah bill will cover that and that s important to hit that lower deferred income point as well bill shea chief financial officer so we went into the quarter with about 10 million of lower deferred revenue again from harry david a year ago customers were willing to accept order in december but accept in january when we were light on inventory that s one of the reasons we ve been making investments in inventory so we went into the quarter about 10 million less in deferred revenue the easter shift on the other side probably about 6 million or so 6 million plus moving out of q3 into q4 overall the easter holiday was up slightly year over year between march and april the combination about 6 million moved into the month of the fourth quarter anthony lebiedzinski sidoti and company analyst got you and then just bigger picture so chris you talked about some of the initiatives that you re working on to improve the cost issues whether it s automation or other things so what s the timing of that and when could we see some tangible improvements in terms of your cost i know you don t have a crystal ball exactly but it s just got a sense can you give us a sense as to when we could actually see some potential improvements from these initiatives to try to offset the cost headwinds that you guys are seeing chris mccann chief executive officer sure anthony thank you again as we look at it the biggest challenge that we ve been having and we re getting our hands around is the gross margin impact with that said we did show improvements in our opex ratio as we look at some of the investments that we re making automation of our warehouse and distribution centers is an example and we talked about the benefit and the impact we re seeing from that early on again the example we gave from back in the christmas holiday was last year out of our largest dc in ohio we were able to ship 80 000 packages a peak day this year we were able to do several days i think like six days over a 100 000 peak day with 30 less staff so we re seeing the benefits of that and that s continuing to roll through and we re automating more of our facilities in medford automating our facilities in atlanta etc another more recent example of where we re seeing the benefits of that start to come in is from valentine s day where on our peak day we were able to handle 30 000 customer interactions completely automated because of our ai engine powering our ivr and our chatbot capabilities so it was 30 000 customer interactions completely automated we would ve needed a thousand more people just for that one day to handle that if we weren t investing in this automation capabilities so you re starting to see that rolling and it s hard for me to put a timeline on it because it s an iterative process and it s happening every day bill shea chief financial officer i think anthony if we break down the components of where the cost pressures are and where the margin pressures are you have inbound ocean freight that obviously is up dramatically over 12 months ago 18 months ago if you look the experts do believe that that s going to over time self correct probably not for this holiday season but over the longer term will self correct maybe not back to 18 months ago rates but certainly significantly drop off of what current rates are when you look at outbound freight those rates are rates were going to continue to be high but they re influenced by fuel and fuel has spiked during the quarter so probably if our outbound rates were probably paying 15 more per package right now than we were a year ago probably 40 of that is just tied to fuel and ultimately fuel is cyclical and fuel will self correct the write off of perishable products we got to readjust what that so that s an item that we can self correct labor rates probably are going to remain high we re not expecting relief from that standpoint but as chris mentioned that s where a lot of the automation projects we have both on the warehouse distribution where a lot of our employees are as well as the service center on outbound rates what our initiatives are is that while rates are higher will working with fedex and our internal logistics team so just to kind of improve and our manufacturing just to improve our operations so that we can get products out the door faster than we can we can forward deployed product and inventory closer to the consumers so we can ultimately almost skip down a level of service with fedex so you can move overnight deliveries to ground deliveries you can move grounded standard ground deliveries to ground economy delivery so it s cheaper service from fedex yet still meeting customers expectations so i think the two areas where that won t self correct by themselves labor and outbound shipping we have initiatives in place to help offset those costs going forward chris mccann chief executive officer bill on that last point that you just worked with fedex as an example to optimize our capabilities we ve seen good results recently on time delivery rates with fedex which then improves the customer experience cuts down on customer service contacts etc so it really improves the whole operating capability in our operating costs bill shea chief financial officer it s good point chris what we used to see prior to the pandemic was 98 on time delivery throughout the pandemic we were seeing deliveries that were in the mid 80s and some cases low 80s we ve seen a rebound back over 90 on time deliveries and we continue to work with fedex and fresh fedex to continue to get those on time deliveries back up to historical levels chris mccann chief executive officer it s important factor anthony lebiedzinski sidoti and company analyst got it thank you that s definitely very helpful color and thanks a lot and best of luck going forward chris mccann chief executive officer thanks anthony operator the next question is from alex fuhrman of craig hallum please go ahead alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst great thanks very much for taking my question here it sounds like valentine s day was pretty strong whereas everyday gifting is really where the company struggled in the quarter can you unpack that a little bit more for us can we interpret that as january early february were a little bit stronger before some of these macroeconomic headwinds really started to weigh on consumer demand or is it really more the story of consumers is continuing to spend around key events like valentine s day and mother s day and really just pulling back on self consumption in every day occasions chris mccann chief executive officer thank you alex i think first off if we just step back and look at the quarter to your point and what we ve seen during the quarter is rising inflation the geopolitical unrest and all of that certainly the price of gas going up impacting the consumer with all of that said and the points that you made we continue to see us growing market share in the environment tom why don t you speak a little bit too as what we saw for valentine s day and what that portends for us as we go forward into the spring holiday season of mother s day etc tom hartnett president yes hi alex yes as mentioned in our formal remarks we grew valentine s by 5 and we are continuing to think and see from our data that we re taking market share in the category as we ve said it does look like the everyday occasions are getting a little softer for us but we have seen as bill mentioned good response for easter and we re expecting a solid mother s day chris mccann chief executive officer yeah and i think also as we look at everyday motions alex keep in mind last year when we were comping against those everyday occasions last year we re seeing significant growth and that s why it s important as bill pointed out that during the quarter which grew 68 over two years ago the flowers brand grew over 50 to two years ago and harry david grew at about 75 to two years ago and most of that growth that we ve seen last year was really the majority of the accelerated growth was in those everyday occasions so we re seeing that come back to more pre covid levels i would say bill shea chief financial officer i think harry david was a proxy for the entire food group it was also up around 75 over two years ago alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst ok that s really helpful thanks and then it sounds like the passport program continues to show nice growth year to date the slowdown you ve seen in demand over the past couple of weeks and months has that been seen more or less equally among your passport members and your multi brand customers as well as your maybe just kind of once and twice a year type customer chris mccann chief executive officer go ahead tom why don t you cover some of that tom hartnett president we re still we remain very pleased with our passport results and how we ve grown we said we ve grown membership for the quarter 40 plus we ve added 225 000 passport members in the quarter and so we continue to see a good resonance there and we also continue to make strides in our checkout flow and how we market to customers in order to make our existing customers or our new customers more aware we re also seeing good growth in converting new customers to the passport program so we have continued to see good results there and obviously that portends well for us on these customers are great for multi brand customer buying which is our strongest cohort chris mccann chief executive officer alex as we look at our customer file as tom points out we re continuing to see strength in our multi brand multi category customers out past book customers the softness year over year and i want to point out it s not exactly soft year over year it is more of a new customer acquisition than it is in what we re seeing from our existing file so with that said even with digital advertising rates increasing about 30 as we said in the markets increasing we still acquired 1 5 million new customers during the quarter so that shouldn t be understated so we re looking at that opportunity in the end one of the things we ve talked about in the past i double checked this recently just to make sure this data is holding up the new customers that we ve been acquiring since the pandemic are actually still performing better than the new customers acquired pre pandemic we re seeing slightly still higher retention rates during that so that s the thing one of the components that really gives us confidence as we move look forward to say we re getting will get back to normal growth rates this is the size of our customer file which again has doubled over the last couple of years as we ve doubled the size of our business over the last three years or so the brands the platform we built so the core that you re getting to all those customer metrics and that s what really drives our confidence going forward alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst great thank you very much operator the next question is from linda bolton weiser of d a davidson please go ahead linda bolton weiser hi thank you so i was just curious about looking ahead i know you don t want to get into giving guidance yet for the next fiscal year but i guess initially maybe analysts would have thought you would have some cost comparison relief a little bit in the upcoming december 2022 quarter because you had such a hard time with costs this past year but now i m thinking that even if costs and fuel and labor just stay where they are that you may have unfavorable comparisons coming up on the cost side on surcharges and things like that this holiday can you just generally comment on whether that s a correct assumption thanks bill shea chief financial officer linda our policy is not to give guidance on fiscal 23 we ll do that in the august call i think what we ll see by generally speaking with this holiday season we have efforts to help offset some of these costs we re going to continue to invest behind those efforts to help offset some of these costs as i mentioned in my earlier comments some of these cost pressures that we have will ultimately will self correct by themselves the timing of which is tough to predict and hard to some of these will not go away by the holiday time but i think we have certain initiatives in place that we re going to continue to effort to try and offset these costs to mitigate some of these cost increases and we continue to test strategic pricing initiatives to help offset some of these costs as well chris mccann chief executive officer i think that s an important factor bill so i think that assumption isn t exactly accurate linda because i would assume that we re not getting any benefits from the efforts that we re putting in and i think we re getting tremendous benefits from the efforts we re putting in to make sure that we get our hands around the cost so if the external pressures remain the same i think our internal mitigation efforts will give us improvements and i think as we look forward overall what we re seeing is again the benefits that we ll get as we come out to some better comps as we ll see going forward the growth rates that we re seeing from the customer file again seeing that earned growth from our customer file is giving us extreme confidence you couple that with what we ve done with the platform that we continue to expand on the m a capabilities we ve done with businesses like shari s berries like personalization mall our newest acquisition vital choice putting which we just integrated on to our platform all of this has been successful for us and will continue to be successful as we get our hands around the cost structure linda bolton weiser just your comment about using the strength of your balance sheet to continue to build inventory to me that seems odd because at the same time you re making a statement about consumers being pinched more because of price inflation so i m just wondering like are you building inventory in the team all pipe items which you need to have ready for the holiday or what is it specifically that you feel like you need to build more inventory in bill shea chief financial officer well a lot of it is addressing the supply chain issues to make sure we have the inventory what we what we faced holiday plus ago was a lack of inventory what we faced this past year was the timing of inventory with all the supply chain challenges that we had so we didn t have the inventory in play when we needed it so inventory delays were happening we had labor that we hired we couldn t produce on time so it was very disruptive to the operations so having the inventory in play so that we can build and plan our operations is clearly a benefit in the upcoming year versus the past chris mccann chief executive officer bill plan the operations and manage the inventory and the labor appropriately linda bolton weiser ok and then finally i was just curious in terms of tom hartnett s experience within the company has he spent all of his years pretty much on the floral side or has ever had a stint kind of working or managing within the gfgb business chris mccann chief executive officer tom has been involved in just about every area of the business in the 30 years that has been with the company so he has been involved in the food businesses to shari s berries business most recently he quarter backed that acquisition and obviously the shari s berries business the fruit bouquet business deal he overseas personalization mall as he moved to the non food category this is a guy who started sitting here looking at time giving him his praises here started in finance for us is it s basically had every role you could conceive in the company over time and what this change does really for us it s really brings all the operating business units under one leader it really helps us drive the enterprise growth in the cross brand capabilities that we ve been looking at moving forward on allow some of more dynamic pnl management being able to quickly adjust on the fly where we re putting investments where we re seeing opportunities for me it allows me more time linda to spend more focused on it as i have throughout my career on innovation on customer centricity our strategy work our m a a development capabilities and overall growth focus with the company so tom has extremely well deserving this position i couldn t think of anybody more better suited for it linda bolton weiser sounds good thank you very much chris mccann chief executive officer excellent operator the next question is from michael kupinski of noble capital markets please go ahead hello michael your line is open we ll move on to dan kurnos of the benchmark company please go ahead dan kurnos the benchmark company analyst thanks good morning two short term questions chris can we go back to your comments around marketing we know that performance marketing and digital channels and social in particular are a converting less b the rates are extremely high right now yes you added a lot of new customers you did talk about a little bit more challenge coming from those new customers rather than from your existing base so how do we think about is there any contemplation in the near term on either a pullback in spend or how are you thinking in terms of ltv given this environment i know you re trying to think several years out but just maybe help us think through the way that you re assessing your marketing or customer acquisition strategy right now chris mccann chief executive officer great thank you dan it s a great question as we look at the environment and as we look at it really from an ltv perspective and looking at the long term as you pointed out that really helps guide our decisions day to day we pointed out in our last quarter how once we hit the more challenging consumer period of the month of december and the advertising costs going up we intentionally pulled back on some of our customer acquisition efforts as it was just getting too expensive even in this quarter when i talk about the softness again the 1 5 million new customers is a great number it s less than we acquired last year where we saw more opportunity so we turned our dial back where we saw the customer acquisition costs being effective for us from the long term ltv i can tell you we know our competitors are not able to compete in this market at these at this cac level that we re working at so again a big part of that is because of the platform and the brands that we have and the ability to drive ltv as we drive this passport capability and the multi brand capability so we re really looking at what s the cac we re willing to spend on the long term scenario for us as we continue to see the development of the file and the cohorts bill shea chief financial officer yeah dan the only other thing i d add is as you mentioned we continue to see performance marketing costs rise we re aware of that it s forced us just to be better marketers around better targeting opportunities so we re doing better in targeting those new customers that we believe have the right ltv or clv for the future and that allows us to spend our dollars more effectively dan kurnos the benchmark company analyst got it that s helpful i ll get back to the tangential question to that in a second and just ask the side one here on p mall obviously this is not really a great environment for p mall i know you guys have been looking to potentially beef up your personalization vertical perhaps this market if it continues to be messy will offer some more opportunities out there for multiple compression in your competitors but just curious a how that process is going and b how you re evaluating p mall under the current environment or landscape chris mccann chief executive officer i ll ask tom he has been closer to p mall certainly but i look at we re still extremely pleased with how p mall has fit into the platform and how it s performing in its future tom specific comments on what we re seeing the p mall now especially for the upcoming season that we see tom hartnett president again it s similar to what we re seeing for the rest of the organization we are seeing a little softness on the everyday occasions good performance on the major holidays we are focused on the p mall customer it s a little bit lower household income generally speaking so we re taking a lot of steps to attract a higher household demographic in that and add to our product assortment there as well as look at other potential targets in the marketplace chris mccann chief executive officer since p mall s keep in mind as i mentioned upcoming holidays wedding season father s day june is p mall s strongest month so we see a good opportunity there as we look forward to your point on potential m a targets whether in the personalization category dan actually we look at it as across the board in any of our categories or adjacencies we do think we re in a strong position as a company right now to watch what happens during the market what happens to valuations we do think that the m a market could present opportunities for us as we go through the sloppiness that we re seeing in the market today dan kurnos the benchmark company analyst got it that s helpful and then just lastly for me we ve seen this before you guys have been through this before always difficult to predict how the economy is going to react you ve seen lots of wide ranging recession calls what have you even though we re at record low on appointment and there s still two years worth of savings out there but regardless not to ask about specifically 23 but just in general you guys are going to post the more modest albeit still really strong two year stack growth so you ll have technically easier comps as you go into next year i m just wondering if you have any altered views on the longer term sustainable growth outlook for the business based on what you re seeing now bill shea chief financial officer i think in a long term outlook it stays consistent we re extremely proud of what we ve built with the capabilities we have we have high confidence in our abilities to return to the growth rates that we want as we move forward here we have the right products we have the right brands we have an expanded customer file we have a great experienced team in place as you pointed out we ve done this before we ve been in business for 46 years now we ve been through some ups and downs one of the key things about our category it never really participates in the high highs of a robust economy but nor do we participate in the very lows of a recessionary economy either and then as we ve expanded our product categories food generally tends to do better in a tougher economy as people consumers put more value on something you can need but with all the things that we look at the platform the customer file the brands that we have the improvements in cx that we ve made our outlook our confidence in the future has not diminished at all dan just go back to two years ago or even four years ago we started to initiate a higher growth rate from the second half of fiscal 18 through the start of the pandemic we were increasing our organic growth rate we had gotten it up to high single digits we had guided prior to the pandemic to double digit growth in the third quarter of our fiscal 20 and for the second half of fiscal 20 for the fourth quarter we achieved that in the march quarter of fiscal 20 where we posted 12 growth rate and we re got again guided for the fourth quarter to be a double digit we are a bigger better stronger company today based on a lot of the initiatives that chris has outlined so we view this as the consumer certainly has pulled back due to the geopolitical unrest and some of the macro economy issues that have happened but we re there to take advantage of the opportunities going forward chris mccann chief executive officer and in this current year over we re still growing over the last year which was a 42 growth rate dan kurnos the benchmark company analyst i tend to agree with all of that especially what you said bill thing that s missing now is chris go over pusher brother for a name change thanks everyone appreciate the chris mccann chief executive officer thank you dan operator the next question comes from michael kupinski of noble capital markets please go ahead michael kupinski noble capital markets analyst thank you and i got dropped right when you introduced me sorry about that just a couple of clarifications one is did you say that you shifted accounted for roughly 6 million revenue in the quarter i just wanted to clarify that chris mccann chief executive officer the question was did you say 6 million shifted quarter to quarter bill shea chief financial officer yeah for the easter impact yes from q3 to q4 michael kupinski noble capital markets analyst yes and is there any way to quantify for us the amount of savings that you might be able to get from the heightened capex that you planned through automation and reduced cost and so forth is there any way to quantify that chris mccann chief executive officer michael it s a this is a long term investment that we have we ve automated the hopewell facility i think we ve described this in the past that we did 30 plus percent more volume out of that facility on peak days with 30 to 40 less labor that s clearly being offset by labor rates at this point so it s hard to put just a straight dollar amount we re investing in our atlanta facility to do many of the similar things to automate that facility and to significantly increase the amount of capacity that we have with less labor and then a number of the initiatives that we have on with our service center platforms it s hard to quantify that at the current time but i think all these initiatives are there to basically help offset the higher labor rates that we re seeing significantly higher labor rates which we don t believe the hourly labor rates are going to go down much michael kupinski noble capital markets analyst i guess obviously you had seasonal you had these seasonal things going on every quarter but were there any standouts in terms of performance among your brands popcorn anything in particular that stood out to you that performed better than what you thought chris mccann chief executive officer i think most importantly because of the quarter and because of the holiday the valentine s day flowers brand was really the standout brand during the quarter again because it s stimulated by the valentine s holiday and that s why again it really has us very optimistic as we now move in as we are in the middle of mother s day currently and the spring holiday season and then moving into the father s day capabilities that we have of personalization mall the wedding season etc so for this quarter it was really the floral business valentine s day it really encouraged us as well as now as we look going forward some of the other product lines coming into play bill shea chief financial officer yeah the only one i would add to that would be shari s berries that aligned itself with the floral holidays as well the chocolate covered strawberries are a good product for valentine s day and mother s day in both the last year and this year the date placement of valentine s was not exactly great being on a monday doesn t help things and we re looking forward to just date placement help in the next four to five years michael kupinski noble capital markets analyst got you and it sounded like dan may have asked a portion of this question and i apologize if i am asking you the same question but the company has been opportunistic in making acquisitions and typically during periods where you had to be a lot of looking forward obviously and so is it too early at this point for you to be making acquisitions given that maybe some of the sellers aren t inclined to sell currently just because they haven t received enough pain so to speak of pressure and headwinds like you might be seeing or do you think that you would still look at acquisitions even in this environment given that you re maybe more focused on managing the business and offsetting some of the headwinds you re seeing yourself chris mccann chief executive officer thank you michael i think we were always looking in the market when is the right opportunity from an m a point of view i think we ve proven over time to be very diligent and very deliberate in our decision making there i do think we re starting to see the beginnings of people really kind of realize they re not going to sell their business off the covid bump and evaluations are maybe starting to come into play a little bit we might need a little bit more time but i think we re seeing the beginning of that and i think it s important to step back and look again at what we ve done from an m a point of view again if you look at what we ve done with shari s berries we took a business that was failing there kind of resized that business when we integrated it into our platform which complete integration all we took was the url and the customer file were really the only assets we took there and completely put it on our operating platform and have grown that business significantly i think you could expect we re looking to do the same thing with the small acquisition we did this past year with vital choice where we just now just recently integrated that onto our platform and now we ll begin the capabilities to grow that business similar to how we ve grown shari s berries and then in between those two we acquired personalization mall which was an appendage to the platform giving us all the capabilities in the personalization space that we didn t have and as dan pointed out we ve mentioned in the past that s an area we think is a separate part of our platform that we can look to grow again through organic business development to capabilities or through m a so i think we re a strong company and we will continue to come at it as stronger and better than we have just like we have in the past and m a will be part of that equation for sure michael kupinski noble capital markets analyst your timing on acquisitions has been great going back to even harry david so that s all i have thank you chris mccann chief executive officer thanks michael operator the next question is from doug lane of lane research please go ahead doug lane lane research analyst hi good morning everybody i think we ve talked about a lot here so i d just like to focus on the gross margin in the gourmet food and gift baskets segment the 25 gross margin is well below anything i ve seen quarterly going back at least five years so there s something going on there so i want to try drill down on is this reset of the gross margin in gourmet food and gift baskets permanent or are they re cross currents going on here that will go away in the next quarter or two bill shea chief financial officer yeah doug this is clearly the lowest margin we ve seen in most of the items that we talked about with regard to the overall gross margins all of those impact the food brands far greater than it does on the floor side of the business so again inbound shipping is high and it s not going to go away and then in the next quarter or two but i think eventually it will self correct to some degree it s not going to go back to 30 thousand a container but it s not going to be a 25 thousand a container we re seeing a little bit of relief on that right now in the off season and we hope that that continues it s hard to predict what the spot market will be and whether the carriers will honor contractual rates but right now we are seeing a little softness on over where we spent and what we incurred last year outbound shipping rates are up and there s a lot of surcharges associated the biggest surcharge right now is fuel so as i mentioned probably 40 of our increase in outbound shipping rates is related to fuel eventually that will self that that will correct fuel is not going to always be at 5 a gallon so that will self correct but the timing of which is tough labor we are seeing higher labor we ve talked about that last quarter and this quarter that our labor rates are significantly up year over year they probably are not going to go down significantly we have seen a little bit of relief in one of our markets in the chicago market but where we have a bulk of our hourly labor in ohio and in oregon we have not seen much relief there so our efforts are focused there on automation and basically doing more with less we need to utilize less labor in our manufacturing and distribution chris mccann chief executive officer we re reconfiguring how we do some of our product development etc so all of these capability is focused on how do we mitigate the labor bill shea chief financial officer right commodity cost increases are cyclical we re seeing it right now we re seeing double digits mid teen increases in lot of the commodities we know there s a wheat shortage part of that is the geopolitical issues that we have we know there s an egg shortage because of a shortage of hens we see other commodities that are up but those will over time self correct again not necessarily in the next quarter or two timing is hard to predict but those will self correct and again back to even the outbound shipping and i mentioned this earlier while rates will be higher on a same level of service we are working with fedex we are working internally on our operations so that we can utilize less expensive services from fedex to still meet customer expectations but lower our rate so there are correctable actions clearly our focus is on the ones that with outbound rates and with labor rates that we don t think will self correct so that we need initiatives in play to mitigate those costs other ones will self correct it s just a matter of the timing doug lane lane research analyst ok that s very helpful thank you and lastly on inventories they re up 75 year over year and your sales are down 1 so where are you building inventories and what is the risk of future inventory write offs because you have such a big perishable component of your business bill shea chief financial officer yeah so most of the inventory that we re investing we re about 60 million over where our year end number was we re about 150 something million at june last year we re about 214 right now in inventory so most of the investments are really in hard goods non perishable items think the write off that we took on inventory on the perishable items was coming out of the holiday thinking demand is going to be stronger than it was and maintaining some of the seasonal labor because we were concerned that we lost the labor we would not get it back so we built some products using some of the perishable products that we the inventory that we had and the demand wasn t there on that so i think that is correctable from our standpoint but we re thinking investment in inventory really is to address there are going to continue to be supply chain challenges and disruptions in the market we all felt many companies felt it we felt it last year we want to have the inventory in play so we can manage our operations and manage our labor better chris mccann chief executive officer our inventory strategy along with many others has moved from a just in time inventory to kind of a just in case inventory doug lane lane research analyst ok that s helpful thank you guys chris mccann chief executive officer thanks doug bill shea chief financial officer ok doug operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to chris mccann for closing remarks chris mccann chief executive officer thank you jane and thank you everyone for joining us today as you can see we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of optimism in the future of our business right now our focus

chairman and chief executive officer thank you chas and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today in the first quarter we continued to advance our strategy through science innovation and technology we delivered a solid first quarter despite omicron which had a significant impact across both businesses in january and continue to impact drug development outside the u s throughout the quarter we remain focused on growth opportunities while continuing to take actions to mitigate inflation in the base business each month of the quarter was progressively better than the previous one this positions us well for continued success throughout the year in the quarter revenue totaled 3 9 billion adjusted earnings per share reached 6 11 and free cash flow was 239 million diagnostics base business volume increased 4 4 versus last year as both routine and esoteric testing saw a significant uptick after an initial slowdown in january in drug development our book to bill remains strong at 1 23 on a trailing 12 month basis our backlog increased to 15 2 billion an increase of 8 7 compared to last year covid related vaccine work was lower versus a year ago across the segment with the largest impact in clinical trial testing solutions or ctts which primarily consists of our central laboratories operations while we continue to see some impact from omicron and the conflict in ukraine throughout the quarter overall drug development recovered nicely in march giving us confidence in our 2022 performance and guidance turning now to covid 19 our pcr volume was approximately 70 000 per day for the quarter testing rates have since declined and we expect the decline to continue for the remainder of the year time to results for covid pcr tests is currently one day on average we are maintaining our ability to process 300 000 pcr tests per day pending supplies and labor to help the country remain prepared for potential new waves of infections or new variants as a public health emergency persists i ll now highlight examples of progress on our strategy in oncology we are fortifying our leadership position by harnessing the scope and the scale of our comprehensive capabilities during the quarter we closed the acquisition of pgdx and the integration is going smoothly pgdx portfolio of liquid biopsy and tissue based products enhances our leading oncology capabilities and puts us at the forefront of helping to drive better outcomes for people with cancer we believe that pgdx kitted solutions will allow laptop to expand genomic profiling globally and help our pharmaceutical clients identify more personalized treatments for patients in addition we recently announced a new collaboration with xcell biosciences to advance the development of cell and gene therapy research this follows our previous investment in company and is designed to help clients more effectively bring innovative cell and gene therapies to market next labcorp continues to intensify its customer focus and embed data and digitalization throughout the business in february we launched our innovative labcorp on demand digital health platform we have a pipeline of tests focused on preventive wellness and health monitoring women s health and family planning and men s health and we plan to add to those throughout the year separately we introduced a new risk scoring task this quarter for people with advanced liver fibrosis due to nash this test helps go out an assessment of the risk of liver disease progression and allows for earlier intervention that can support better patient outcomes and we became the first u s commercial laboratory to offer quantitative tests for detecting and measuring unintentional gluten consumption which can help with the management of celiac disease labcorp continues to be committed to pursuing short and long term high growth opportunities during the quarter we entered into and expanded several strategic relationships with hospitals and health systems last month we announced our strategic relationship with prisma health the largest health system in south carolina as a part of the arrangement labcorp agreed to acquire select outreach business assets and provide ongoing technical support to their hospital laboratories this allows us to offer business patients and providers the benefit of enhanced care across multiple pinnacle areas we also expanded our relationship with atlanticare in new jersey in the quarter by agreeing to acquire select assets of the organization s clinical outreach business in addition we ve agreed to purchase the outreach business of st dominic hospital in jackson mississippi this builds on our 2020 acquisition of the outreach program of franciscan missionaries of our lady health system as i previously reported in february we entered into a comprehensive laboratory relationship with ascension one of the u s healthcare s largest systems the long term relationship will include our management of hospital labs in 10 states as well as the purchase of select outreach laboratory business assets and we continue to make progress on planning efforts for this collaboration as expected these transactions are scheduled to close later this year our pipeline of acquisition and investment targets remains robust and that should result in a very active 2022 we re committed to investing in our employees and continuing to operate responsibly so that we can provide the highest quality services to patients and to customers we recently issued our 2021 corporate responsibility report which offers insight into the following our practices and processes to manage our company with integrity our sustainability journey including our pursuit of a science based target to reduce carbon emissions

work the report is available through our investor relations website and i d encourage you to read it to better understand labcorp s progress and commitments in these important areas in addition we continue to take other actions designed to enhance shareholder value this quarter we are providing additional information about the quarterly revenue contribution of each drug development business unit and earlier this month labcorp initiated a quarterly dividend and announced a cash dividend of 0 72 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of this year to sum up our base business continued its recovery across diagnostics and drug development progressively in the quarter despite some headwinds we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities and our current momentum in the base business combined with our recent hospital systems business development announcements sets us up well for success throughout the year so with that glenn will take you through the details of our first quarter results glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you adam i m going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance for reference we ve also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our investor relations website revenue for the quarter was 3 9 billion a decrease of 6 3 compared to last year due to lower organic revenue as the negative impact from foreign currency translation was offset by acquisitions covid testing revenue was down 43 compared to covid testing last year while the base business grew 4 5 compared to the base business last year operating income for the quarter was 688 million or 17 6 of revenue during the quarter we had 67 million of amortization and 39 million of restructuring charges and special items excluding these items adjusted operating income in the quarter was 794 million or 20 4 of revenue compared to 1 2 billion or 28 4 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in covid testing higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic base business growth and launchpad savings the tax rate for the quarter was 23 1 the adjusted tax rate excluding restructuring charges special items and amortization was 23 4 compared to 24 5 last year the lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and stock compensation we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25 excluding any impact from potential tax reform net earnings for the quarter were 492 million or 5 23 per diluted share adjusted eps which exclude amortization restructuring charges and special items were 6 11 in the quarter compared to 8 79 last year operating cash flow was 356 million in the quarter compared to 1 2 billion a year ago the decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings primarily impacted by covid testing and higher working capital requirements which were mostly timing related capital expenditures totaled 117 million compared to 95 million last year as a result free cash flow was 239 million in the quarter we continue to expect to generate between 1 7 billion and 1 9 billion of free cash flow for the full year during the quarter we invested 455 million on acquisitions we were also in the market repurchasing approximately 600 000 shares as part of our 1 billion accelerated share repurchase program which was completed april 1 at the end of the quarter we had 1 5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining now i ll review our segment performance given the enterprisewide strategic focus on oncology we are reclassifying our oncology investments in r d spending these investments that are not supporting current revenue are being reclassified from our segments to corporate unallocated this represented 4 million of corporate unallocated expense in the quarter in our supplemental deck we have also included additional business information for both segments for diagnostics we provided a breakout of base business esoteric versus routine testing revenue as well as payer mix for drug development we included revenues for its three businesses early development or ed clinical trial testing solutions or ctts and clinical development and commercialization services or cdcs in addition we ve provided quarterly book to bill quarterly net orders and pass throughs i ll begin the segment review with diagnostics revenue for the quarter was 2 5 billion a decrease of 11 compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 11 5 partially offset by acquisitions of 0 5 covid testing revenue was down 43 compared to covid testing last year while the base business grew 5 6 compared to the base business last year relative to the first quarter of 2019 the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 3 7 primarily due to organic growth total volume decreased 5 compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 5 3 partially offset by acquisition volume of 0 3 covid testing volume was down 38 compared to covid testing last year while base business volume grew 4 4 compared to the base business last year compared to the first quarter of 2019 base business volume levels were relatively flat as the decline we experienced in january due to omicron rebounded in february and in march price mix decreased 6 versus last year due to lower covid testing of 6 3 partially offset by acquisitions of 0 2 and organic base business growth of 0 1 base business price mix was up 1 2 compared to the base business last year benefiting from an increase in test per session esoteric testing growing faster than routine testing and acquisitions diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was 683 million or 27 8 of revenue compared to 992 million or 36 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in covid testing covid testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to maintain capacity base business margins were down slightly due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic growth and launchpad savings now a review the performance of drug development revenue for the quarter was 1 5 billion an increase of 1 5 compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 4 3 and acquisitions net of divestitures of 0 1 partially offset by lower covid testing of 1 7 and foreign currency translation of 1 2 base business revenue compared to base business last year grew 3 3 or 4 5 on a constant currency basis the growth was led by ed we also experienced good growth in cdcs although constrained by omicron and the conflict in ukraine ctts was relatively flat as traditional base business growth was offset by lower covid 19 vaccine and therapeutic work as well as the conflict in ukraine relative to the first quarter of 2019 the compound annual growth rate for drug development base business revenue was 10 7 primarily driven by organic growth adjusted operating income for the segment was 169 million or 11 6 of revenue compared to 234 million or 16 3 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower covid testing reduced covid vaccine and therapeutic work the impact from the conflict in ukraine higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs which were partially offset by organic base business growth and launchpad savings while margins were down in the quarter we continue to expect margins to be up for the full year compared to 2021 as the segment benefits from top line growth targeted price increases and launchpad savings we ended the quarter with backlog of 15 2 billion and we expect approximately 4 9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months now i ll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance which reflects our solid first quarter performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of march 31 2022 for the remainder of the year the enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions share repurchases and dividends we expect enterprise revenue to decline 1 5 to 5 5 compared to 2021 this is a narrowing of the prior range with the midpoint growth rate increasing 50 basis points this guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow 8 to 10 while covid testing is expected to decline 60 to 70 we expect diagnostics revenue to decline 11 5 to 15 5 compared to 2021 this is a narrowing of the prior range and an increase at the midpoint by 100 basis points this guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow 4 to 6 while covid testing is expected to decline 60 to 70 at the midpoint of our base business guidance range the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4 5 primarily driven by organic growth we expect drug development revenue to grow 6 to 8 5 compared to 2021 this is a reduction at the midpoint of 100 basis points primarily due to the 70 basis point change in foreign currency translation from the prior guidance in addition the guidance change reflects the conflict in ukraine which was partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of pgdx this guidance range of 6 to 8 5 growth over last year includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 110 basis points compared to last year this guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow 6 5 to 9 compared to 2021 we expect to benefit from growth in all 3 businesses led by ed and cdcs at the midpoint of our base business guidance range the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11 primarily driven by organic growth for adjusted eps we are narrowing our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by 0 38 compared to the prior guidance our guidance range is now 18 25 to 21 free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at 1 7 billion to 1 9 billion for additional comparison purposes we ve also included in the supplemental deck on our investor relations website a view of our 2022 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results in summary the company had another quarter of solid performance we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business for the remainder of the year while covid testing volumes are expected to decline we expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our newly initiated dividend operator we will now take questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from brian tanquilut with jefferies your line is open unknown speaker this is jack slevin on for brian nice job on the quarter so as i look at this acknowledging some of the specific headwinds and appreciate all the color you gave around the numbers for covance when we look at it can you just give us a little more color on how we think about the progression there throughout the year and can you remind us on large pharma has been a point of focus for you in addition to oncology can you remind us of exposure there and how that might impact growth rates beyond 22 adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes this is adam thanks for the question so a few things if you look at the business in general for our drug development we had a good quarter despite some of the headwinds that we knew were occurring so back in february you may recall we discussed that we expected the first quarter to be the toughest because we already have seen some impact from omicron and we saw it in both our drug development and our diagnostics business but the good news is that each month of the quarter got progressively better for both of the businesses and the interesting thing is if you look at the impact it impacted parts of our business differently so for example our ctts or our central laboratory business was the most impacted by omicron and we saw it there first and then for drug development we saw for diagnostics we saw the impact obviously in the united states where our business is and that went away very quickly after january we saw the base business and diagnostics bounce back very fast drug development ctts was a little bit different because it s a global business and we saw continued impact from omicron in parts of europe and then as we got to the end of the quarter we saw some due to ukraine as we look at the rest of the year we re confident because as we looked at march we saw strength versus january we saw strength in march versus february and we re on a good run rate now we believe that there ll be some continued impact from ukraine in particular in the second quarter so the second quarter will be a little bit more difficult in the third and fourth quarter but we expect to continue to see progress as we go through the year operator our next question comes from jack meehan with nephron research your line is open jack meehan nephron research analyst thank you and good morning so i have a couple of questions on the drug development business the first is on margins so understand some of the pressures you talked about at the start of the year but when i look at some of the peer reports so far this earnings season it does look like your drug development margin pressure was more pronounced than others have reported so was curious to get your thought as to what might have been unique to the labcorp business that drove kind of more pressure than others adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes as i mentioned before we saw some of that pressure starting in the beginning of the year when we were here in february we mentioned that but we have a very large ctts business central laboratory business larger than most others and we saw the largest impact from omicron in that business and i ll give you two examples one is if you look at our ctts central laboratory business you saw that the growth rate for that business now that we re providing by segment growth rates was less than the other segments that s because we had such a strong first quarter of last year we were prepared with omicron to do as much central laboratory work as we did in the first quarter of last year this year because we saw the impact of omicron in december and january and we kept as many people as we could prepared in case the boosters caused a huge amount of volume it did not cause a huge amount of volume as the boosters came out this year in fact it was a lot less than what we saw with the initial vaccines in the beginning of last year and then the second thing is we have a early development business ed business and we saw some impact on inflation in that business particularly as you think about utilities and research and product costs we re going to offset that with price reduction or price increases but also by cost reductions and as i said at the beginning of the year the inflationary pressures hit you all at once and it takes you time to launchpad to get the cost out we saw improvements across all the businesses as we went through the quarter month over month so therefore we are confident that we re on a good run rate as we re going through the rest of the year jack meehan nephron research analyst great that s helpful sticking with drug development can you talk about what impacts the lockdowns in china may be having on the business just how are you managing your labs in the region and has it impacted your access to large molecules or i m sorry large models at all adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes sure jack if you look at our business in china first of all i want to let all of our employees know that we re thinking of them we re here to support them and doing everything we can to help them in fact we have some employees that are basically living in the laboratories right now so that they can continue to keep the work going while the lockdowns are occurring we have not seen a significant impact on our business due to the lockdowns at the moment but we re going to continue to monitor that very closely it has not inhibited our ability to do the studies that we need to do at this point in time jack operator our next question comes from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley your line is open ricky goldwasser morgan stanley analyst yeah hi good morning so a couple of questions here first on and just kind of like thinking right you talked about kind of like these headwinds in the quarter sort of covid ukraine and then inflation can you just maybe either quantify each of these areas of headwinds i think that s going to be really helpful for us as we think about it for the rest of the year and then on the lab side i think in the supplemental pocket you compare lab volumes to 2019 baseline which is very helpful can you just give us a little bit more color on the core volume performance versus 2019 by market is heading down 50 basis points on volume 1q 22 versus 1q 19 if you can talk about what you re seeing versus baseline by market or on an organic basis as well adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks for the question ricky i ll start with the lab volumes and then i ll ask glenn to jump in with regard to some of the quantifications that you asked for so with regard to diagnostics you saw revenue for the quarter was strong it was about 2 5 billion the base business revenue grew about 5 6 versus last year and then in a compounded rate versus 2019 it grew 3 9 and if you look at our base business volume it s up about 4 4 versus last year but i think what s important is if you look at the volume versus 2019 you saw we were about flat and as you may recall ricky in february we said that what we saw in january for our base business versus 2019 was down 8 so that tells you the strength that we had in february and march in the base business and how we saw it come back so strong which gives us the confidence we really didn t see a difference between esoteric our non esoteric business we didn t see a big geographic change i mean there are certain breakouts that are happening with omicron in the northeast of the country for a period of time and then it might have moved to the southeast but nothing that i think is important for you to note i d say overall across esoteric non esoteric across the regions we ve seen a very strong bounce back in our base business in february and march and you see that by the fact that we were flat for the quarter versus 2019 when january was down 8 versus january 2019 glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer ricky this is glenn i guess just to follow up a little bit on that too so the 8 decline that we saw in january was not compounded so it was the total decline but as adam said the progression in february and march got us on a compound annual growth rate to be just down to 0 5 so relatively flat with the expectation as we continue to go through the year that obviously will become a positive number as we continue to experience the recovery there on a volume basis so pleased with what we re seeing there on the drug development side quantifying call it the vaccine and the impact of ukraine were probably the two more meaningful ones that impacted us for the quarter from a vaccine standpoint probably around 30 million of headwind from that and ukraine probably closer to rounding to around 10 million so when we think that both of those primarily impacted the ctts business obviously affected others as well but while we were call it flat in revenue on a constant currency basis in that business if you backed out the vaccine related and the ukraine we d be 7 to 8 call it organic constant currency growth rate which would be more in line with what we would have expected the business to do ricky goldwasser morgan stanley analyst and can you just remind us when we think about the margin it s kind of like a preclinical central lab versus clinical glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer so we don t break out the margins for the businesses as you saw in the additional material that we provided we went out and looked obviously at our peers and what s provided and just looking at what additional information and we felt the revenue breakout by business was important and beneficial because you get to see the magnitude that it is for each of the pieces as well as now tracking the growth profile from a margin standpoint our belief and obviously our peers that do similarly look at it on a segment basis because there s so much that are shared assets between the businesses that we feel that providing it as a trend if you will on the segment is a more meaningful number and then as you look at the growth rates of the different pieces you can kind of get a sense of how we re leveraging overall in the businesses ricky goldwasser morgan stanley analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from eric coldwell with baird your line is open eric coldwell robert w baird and company analyst thanks very much i feel like we re falling a bit short on the disclosures on why the lab or the cro margin is as poor as it is this quarter i m hoping we can get into some details on that the i guess the first question you talked about early development having some inflation costs and it sounded like maybe some research model supply access pricing issues are you at a suffering from being at a disadvantage for not having your own animal model business is that one of the bigger issues in early development that you don t have the same supply that perhaps some of your larger peers have glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no eric appreciate the comment and obviously the 11 6 margin obviously it s down from where we ve been so when you look at the pieces of it so the research product is a meaningful part of it so we re incurring much higher cost for that and so as adam commented earlier from a timing standpoint we now have to go through change orders but effectively we believe that we can pass on those higher costs to the customers and a lot of contracts that s explicit with the research products to do that so one of the reasons why we re constrained in the quarter was that higher expense without being able to transfer over we also talked about utility costs so just general inflationary but wouldn t diminish as well just the impact from the ukraine from the vaccine and also the first quarter historically has been a lighter quarter relative to how we end the year and then each quarter we pick up so as we commented that first of all our full expectation for the full year continues to be that we ll see margins higher than the prior year our expectation frankly is that margin should be higher year on year beginning in the second quarter and going forward and what gives us the confidence and adam alluded to this earlier is that when you look at the run rate that we ended in march even though we still have some of those headwinds passing on some of those costs we re frankly at a margin level that gives us high degree of confidence even for the next quarter but let alone for the full year that you ll start to see margins back to comparable to the prior year would hopefully up a little bit from each of the quarters as we go forward eric coldwell robert w baird and company analyst and if i could just stay on the same vein and one follow up the same topic it s related to central lab obviously shipping freight transports gone up i m not sure to what extent you ve been able to pass on those costs but we also heard this morning from icahn that in their lab operations they did have some supply component issues more particularly around complex oncology components in central lab kits i suspect you ve faced a similar experience but i was hoping you could give some color on that experience what you re seeing if it had an impact how long you might expect that to continue if so adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes so if you look at the supply there were issues in supply chain i d say for the last 6 months or so but we were able to find other ways to meet the demand in those kits but it didn t mean at times there were higher impact to margins because for example if it s not a typical kit you have to do some additional work to get it approved and sometimes you have to do those manually so we were doing a lot more kits manually than we typically would particularly if you have to put a replacement piece in there but the good news is we were able to keep up with the demand from our pharma customers we re able to meet their needs which was important to us but there certainly was some short term impact as we re doing a lot more kits manually than we historically would do and when you do more kits manually then you put in more quality assurance where you check more of the kits to ensure if they re going out appropriately so there is some expense that s incurred with that but it didn t impact our customers and what i would say eric the most important thing to me is that we saw the progression in the margin month by month we don t provide monthly margins but we look at it very closely so it s that that gives me the confidence that we re on the right track and that we re able to meet the commitments that we ve set forth glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and eric just one last thing on just the supply issue what we ve seen is because we run primarily have on a just in time inventory level within our ctts our central lab business and obviously when we started to see the global supply chain issues it had an impact on us we ve now built up those level of inventories now for three to six months given the still the uncertainties of what s going on globally so we ll carry that higher inventory to obviously make sure we can be focused on meeting the customers demand and doing it efficiently adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer and having our diagnostic business where a lot of the tubes and the things that you need are very similar we re able to use supplies across the businesses when appropriate as well eric coldwell robert w baird and company analyst thanks very much adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks eric operator our next question comes from rachel vatnsdal with j p morgan your line is open unknown speaker hi this is noah on for rachel i just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the backlogs and could you maybe provide any additional color on your current customer base and as well as your backlog and sort of the composure by end market for like pre revenue biotech versus pharma companies and then maybe any additional metrics that you can think of of how we should think about that percent trending throughout the year and going forward adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes first of all i d say that the rfps that are coming through are very strong and if you look at our cancellation rates they re very low so we feel very good about the flow of business and the flow of rfps and the flow of the trials coming our trailing 12 month book to bill was strong at 1 23 as you may recall i say that we need to be at 1 20 or slightly higher and we remain at that number and then if you look at our backlog we have 15 2 billion which was almost a 9 increase versus the prior year our net orders were 7 2 billion if you look across the businesses the breakdown by customer type is a little bit different so for example in early development we have more biotech and smaller to midsized biotech than we do large pharma if you look at our ctts which is our central lab or cdcs which is our clinical business we tend to have more pharma than we do the small biotechs or the middle sized biotechs but i would say across the 3 businesses we feel good about the rfps that we re seeing we feel good about the backlog that we re seeing and we re confident that the backlog supports the long term guidance that we provided unknown speaker awesome and you re seeing that sort of continue adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes i expect that to continue that we ll continue to have a strong book to bill that will continue to be above the 1 2 threshold that we anticipate to be so i feel good about that unknown speaker awesome thank you operator our next question comes from derik de bruin with bank of america your line is open unknown speaker hey good morning this is jon on for derik appreciate the new disclosures but i wanted to ask what your underlying assumptions are for the full year in your ed ctts and cdcs we know that your early stage and late stage should be going faster than central lab but yes wanted to look into your assumptions there and also in mid april fda issued a warning about the possibility of false results from nipt i was wondering what sort of exposure you have there through sequencing that d be great adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes so i ll start with that and i could see it s a very small very very very small amount of revenue it s a test that we do for screening and it s utilized in the united states but it s not very large at all so we ll continue to make sure that we have the test available that we are making it available to physicians that are looking to use those tests but it s not there s no impact in terms of our overall total business with regard to the individual segments we believe the fastest growth segment in revenue is going to be clinical the ctts or the cdcs business because we re not necessarily the market leader there and we have the ability to grow fastest there if you look at the slowest growing business of the three it will be ctts because we are the market leader there we have a large market share in that business so there s not as much room for growth and then the ed business is somewhere in between because we re no 1 to 2 and then sometimes ed grows a little bit faster than the cdcs and it goes back and forth unknown speaker understood thank you operator we have a question from patrick donnelly with citi your line is open patrick donnelly citi analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions obviously a lot covered on the cro piece so maybe i ll ask on the lab side just on the covid assumptions appreciate the transparency on the range there can you just talk about the cadence through the year are you assuming kind of a bump near the end of the year around flu season how are you thinking about that kind of as we go out even in the endemic phase in terms of seasonality i m just trying to figure out the best way to model that piece adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes no thanks patrick for the question and as we said for the first quarter we averaged 70 000 tests per day and by the end of the quarter that was down significantly than where it was at the beginning of the quarter and we expect there s going to continue to be a decline through the year the reason that we give a range and we ve given a range of down 60 to 70 versus last year is because there s a whole range of possibilities on how you can get to that range so one of the possibilities is as you say there s a uptick in november around the flu season but at that point in time if there s not the emergency declaration the price might be lower if the emergency declaration continues but there s not an uptick in november the price would be at where it is now so the bottom line is the 60 to 70 range that we ve given has a whole bunch of ways that you can stay within there my assumption is that the emergency declaration will continue through this year we ll see if that occurs or not and i think volume will continue to decline throughout the year patrick donnelly citi analyst great thank you operator thank you and there are no other questions in the queue i d like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer thank you catherine so first of all thank you again for joining us today i m really encouraged by our progress and the important work of our more than 75 000 employees around the world i can tell you they are our greatest asset and we re focused on supporting our employees that are facing additional complexities and difficult situations we have people in shanghai ukraine russia and we re really making sure that we re thinking about them as they face these complexities we look forward to speaking with you soon and we appreciate your time today so thank you operator duration 50 minutes call participants chas cook vice president investor relations adam

regarding shareholder value following chris gwen will provide some comments on the company s outlook and guidance i ll then review core s two operating segments detailing our progress and discussing the continued successful introduction and deployment of core lab s technologies as well as highlighting some of core s operations and major projects worldwide then we ll open the phones for a q a session i ll now turn the call over to gwen for remarks on forward looking statements gwen gresham senior vice president and head of investor relations before we start the conference this morning i ll mention that some of the statements that we make during this call may include projections estimates and other forward looking information this would include any discussion of the company s business outlook these types of forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from our forward looking statements these risks and uncertainties are discussed in our most recent annual report on form 10 k as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the sec and the afm we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our comments also include non gaap financial measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included in the press release announcing our first quarter results non gaap measures can also be found on our website with that said i ll pass the discussion back to larry larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer thanks gwen as 2022 began the global pandemic continued to impact our business landscape during the first quarter global caseloads rose very sharply as the omicron variant spread across all regions this impacted both our clients and internal core lab operations more than 15 of core lab s global staff tested positive for covid 19 in q1 a more than 400 increase in cases among our employees compared to q4 in 2021 in addition other core lab staff had to quarantine because of either direct exposure to individuals that has tested positive or because of government imposed shutdowns on average infected employees miss between five and 10 days of work being a business that runs on people more than say equipment rental day rates and mechanical horsepower the high number of q1 covid 19 cases had a meaningful impact on our business the sharp rise in covid 19 cases and the associated quarantine requirements among core lab staff increased operating costs as overtime expenses among uninfected staff were incurred to meet project time lines fortunately the recent covid 19 illnesses experienced by our staff have largely been mild and of short duration with no deaths or hospitalizations reported in q1 cases peaked in january and february and declined throughout march the surge in covid 19 cases also negatively impacted our clients and continued to pose headwinds to project advancement still global demand for hydrocarbons continues to rise signaling positive trends for future oilfield activity over at least the next several years compounding the q1 challenges caused by the sharp rise in covid 19 cases the military conflict in ukraine impacted both of core lab s business segments in reservoir description cyber attacks against client facilities in europe that preceded direct military engagement disrupted demand for crude assay laboratory work in western europe as well as in ukraine and other parts of eastern europe after military actions commenced sanctions and other crude oil supply disruptions further impacted demand for ambient condition laboratory crude oil analysis in ukraine core lab suspended operations out of concern for our employees safety the suspension of operations is ongoing the realignment of traditional crude oil logistical patterns is still impacting demand for analytical services in several countries particularly in europe because global crude oil demand has not been fundamentally altered we anticipate the return of client demand for these services as supply patterns realign in production enhancement direct product sales for q1 into ukraine were halted currently forecasting when or if these sales and previously committed future product orders might be completed is impractical despite these challenges core remains ready to fully service our clients needs core continues to execute on its key strategic objectives by one introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets two maintaining a lean and focused organization and three continuing to delever the company for the first quarter of 2022 core lab s year over year revenue increased by 6 for the remainder of 2022 we expect continued improvement in both business segments in both the u s and most international arenas although the conflict in ukraine and the collateral impact on core s european and russian operations now pose headwinds to year over year growth expectations in those areas now to review core lab s strategies and the financial tenets that core has used to build shareholder value over our 26 plus year history as a publicly traded company the interest of our shareholders clients and employees will always be well served by core lab s resilient culture which relies on innovation leveraging technology to solve problems and dedicated customer service i ll talk more about one of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call while we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities core will remain focused on its three long standing long term financial tenets those being to maximize free cash flow maximize return on invested capital and returning excess free cash to our shareholders before we move on i want to thank core s management team and employees for their hard work during the unprecedented challenges of the past two years q1 of 2022 required great agility and responsiveness to continue to serve our clients needs i also want to thank them for the dedication loyalty and adaptability in meeting all of our clients needs and for the personal sacrifices that many have endured as we navigate the moment and prepare for a more active market i ll now turn it over to chris for the detailed financial review chris hill chief financial officer thanks larry before we review the financial performance for the quarter the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any fx gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20 so accordingly our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods additionally the financial results for the first quarter of 2022 include a charge of 3 9 million for noncash stock compensation expense associated with the future vesting of performance shares for certain employees who have reached their eligible retirement age the financial results for the first quarter also included a charge of 3 3 million for severance and facility consolidation expense and a bad debt expense of 800 000 associated with receivables due from clients in ukraine the severance and facility consolidation expenses are associated with our ongoing efforts to gain operational efficiencies and optimize core s global network these items have also been excluded from our discussion of the financial results so now looking at the income statement revenue from continuing operations was 115 3 million in the first quarter down approximately 7 9 from 125 1 million in the prior quarter but up 6 4 year over year the sequential decrease is associated with typical seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of each year additionally our international operations were disrupted more than expected due to a strong resurgence of covid cases during the quarter the russia ukraine conflict also progressed into direct military action during the first quarter which negatively impacted both product sales and services however the u s land market continues to show strength and although completion activity began the year at levels lower than last quarter activity improved up and was up nicely as we exited the first quarter of this revenue service revenue which is more international was 84 7 million for the quarter down approximately 5 sequentially from 89 3 million last quarter the decrease in service revenue is primarily associated with typical seasonal declines but also continued covid restrictions and disruptions in many regions our service revenue associated with crude oil assay work particularly in europe was also negatively impacted by an elevated level of cyber attacks and the russia ukraine conflict service revenue in the u s increased 8 sequentially which helped partially offset the decline in international service revenue product sales which is equally tied to u s and international activity were 30 6 million for the quarter down 14 7 sequentially but up over 25 from last year our international product sales are typically larger bulk orders and can vary from one quarter to another last quarter we delivered several large international orders which did not repeat in the first quarter as a result international product sales were down 26 6 sequentially the sequential decline also includes the suspension of product sales into ukraine product sales in the u s increased over 4 sequentially and was led by sales of our energetic products which increased over 7 sequentially so for the quarter the improvement in the u s product sales helped offset the sequential decrease in international product sales moving on to cost of services ex items for the quarter was approximately 81 of service revenue up from 78 last quarter cost of services in the first quarter of 2022 increased as the company fully restored employee based salaries the company has restored most of the temporary cost reductions established during the pandemic so as we progress through the remainder of the year we would expect incremental margins to improve and trend toward historical levels cost of sales ex items in the first quarter was 92 of revenue compared to 76 last quarter the increase this quarter is a combination of disruptions to our manufacturing caused by the surge in covid reduced manufacturing efficiencies associated with a lower revenue base and rising costs of raw materials transportation packaging and labor costs we anticipate improvement in the manufacturing absorption rate in future quarters in line with our projected growth in product sales g a ex items for the quarter was 8 7 million a decrease of 2 2 million from last quarter of 10 9 million g a ex items is anticipated to be approximately 40 million for the full year of 2022 depreciation and amortization for the quarter was 4 6 million and pretty flat compared to 4 4 million last quarter ebit ex items for the quarter was 7 2 million down from 14 2 million last quarter yielding an ebit margin of over 6 on a gaap basis we recorded an operating loss for the quarter of 400 000 interest expense was 2 6 million relatively flat from last quarter income tax expense ex items was 9 million for the quarter and on a gaap basis we recorded a tax benefit of 1 2 million for the quarter the tax benefit recorded in the quarter includes the release of withholding tax related to unrepatriated earnings of our russian subsidiary which are not expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter however we continue to project the company s effective tax rate to be approximately 20 income from continuing operations ex items for the quarter was 3 6 million down from 9 3 million last quarter on a gaap basis we recorded a 1 8 million loss from continuing operations for the quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex items was 0 08 for the quarter and on a and the gaap loss per diluted share from continuing operations was 0 04 for the quarter turning to the balance sheet receivables were 98 9 million and increased approximately 2 million from the prior quarter our dsos for the first quarter were 72 days up from 67 days achieved last year we anticipate that our dso will improve and return to a level of 70 days or lower in future quarters inventory at march 31 2022 was 48 2 million up approximately 3 million from last quarter end inventory turns for the quarter remained consistent at 2 4 which is comparable to last quarter as previously highlighted the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials labor packaging and transportation which are increasing the cost of inventory additionally challenge in the supply chain persists which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions suspension of product sales into ukraine for orders that were already processed also accounts for some of the increase this quarter we continue to anticipate inventory turns will improve as we progress through 2022 in line with improved activity levels for both the u s land and international markets and now the liability side of the balance sheet our long term debt was 191 million at the end of the first quarter and considering cash of 22 million net debt was reduced to 169 million or a decrease of 3 million from last quarter our leverage ratio was approximately 2 2 compared to 2 1 last quarter and our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at 135 million as well as 56 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility since the covid pandemic started in 2020 core lab has reduced net debt seven out of the last eight quarters maintaining our focus and our stated commitment in reducing the company s leverage ratio we will continue with our longer term strategy to delever the company looking at cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 cash flow from operating activities was 5 3 million and after paying for 2 3 million of capex for the quarter our free cash flow was 3 million we will continue managing capital expenditures to be aligned with activity levels for the remainder of 2022 for the full year we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 13 million to 15 million core will continue its strict capital discipline and asset light business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives this also marks another quarter where core lab generated positive free cash flow and we are projecting to continue generating positive free cash as we look ahead to the remainder of 2022 and beyond we believe evaluating a company s ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing company s financial results particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations i ll now turn it over to gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook gwen gresham senior vice president and head of investor relations thank you chris as the russia ukraine geopolitical conflict continues and the sanctions on russia have expanded the global crude oil market continues to tighten with demand for crude oil approaching pre covid 19 levels resulting in higher crude oil commodity prices with consistent elevated crude oil commodity prices and the tightening of crude oil supply the industry is preparing for an increase in activity driven by demand resulting in a multiyear cycle these crude oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count with more oilfield equipment coming under contract and expanded capital spending plans for 2022 core sees these as leading indicators of a growing international market with core lab having more than 70 of its revenues exposed to international activity both business segments remain active on international projects as additional field development projects emerge wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before reservoir description participates in the cycle the expansion of international development both short and long cycle projects provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond with a particular focus on south atlantic margin latin america and the middle east core s north america revenue is correlated to completion and stimulation events with large scale reservoir rock and reservoir fluid characterization studies rather than with immediate changes in rig count wells need to be drilled and subsequently completed stimulated and cored or have fluid samples collected before we can realize a revenue event core projects to continue benefiting from increased onshore activity albeit led by private operators and somewhat moderated by capital discipline for larger publicly traded operators for the second quarter of 2022 core projects our business to improve primarily from increasing levels activity levels in the u s and moderate improvement in international offshore and deepwater markets potentially offset by uncertainties associated with the russia ukraine conflict core projects second quarter 2022 revenue to range from 119 million to 125 million and operating income of 9 4 million to 11 8 million yielding operating margins of approximately 9 eps for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be 0 12 to 0 16 the company s second quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange the second quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20 looking forward core s outlook for the remainder of 2022 remains positive with sequential improvement expected in the second quarter followed by further acceleration during the second half of the year furthermore we continue to anticipate a multiyear international cycle unfolding supported by crude oil market fundamentals with that i ll turn it back over to larry larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer thanks gwen first i d like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions integrity and superior service to our clients the team s collective dedication to servicing our clients has been very visible during the current challenges and is the foundation of core lab s success turning first to reservoir description for the first quarter revenue came in at 74 8 million down 7 sequentially operating income ex items was 3 9 million and operating margins were 5 restoration of employee costs along with the covid related costs and inefficiencies as well as the disruptions tied to the russia ukraine conflict impacted margins during the quarter the sharp increase in covid 19 cases in q1 slowed in the early part of q2 across many regions although parts of europe and asia pacific are still experiencing relatively high caseloads as previously mentioned core lab operations in ukraine have been suspended and demand for some services in europe and russia are being impacted by the military conflict and the associated sanctions as we look ahead while still well below pre covid levels we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for reservoir description a trend that we project will play out throughout 2022 and beyond particularly in the middle east and north and south america regions during the first quarter of 2022 core conducted a large core and reservoir data analysis workshop for the kuwait oil company this comprehensive week long workshop was the culmination of a multiyear multiwell analytical program that included proprietary core lab technologies and interpretation techniques the focus was on hydrocarbon potential and pay recognition in prospective unconventional and tight conventional reservoir targets core lab leveraged its proprietary oracle based web enabled rapid database platform to organize well geological and petrophysical data fracture analysis and interpretation was conducted utilizing core s proprietary dual energy ct scanner services which allow for 3d visualization of conventional cores and calibration of third party borehole image logs core lab developed advanced petrophysical log models that included fluid flow prediction as well as an assessment of well productivity koc stated that the workshop was a great success and that their technical teams were incorporating and building upon the recently concluded work an expansion of the study is currently being planned to include other koc fields and also to address additional reservoir challenges core lab is pleased to be assisting koc s technical experts on these evaluation programs in other first quarter news core lab is expanding its penetration of carbon capture and sequestration opportunities on multiple fronts during the first quarter core announced the initiation of a joint industry carbon capture and sequestration consortium to analyze geologic risks and challenges associated with subsurface carbon sequestration this multi company project in collaboration with dr birol dindoruk of the university of houston will leverage core s global expertise in subsurface characterization with a focus on reservoir capacity injectivity and containment integrity as well as rock fluid and fluid fluid compatibility in addition during the first quarter core was also pleased to publicly announce a strategic alliance with talos energy inc to provide technical evaluation and assurance for carbon capture and sequestration opportunities along with these recent announcements on carbon capture and sequestration opportunities during the first quarter of 2022 core under the direction of the carbonnet project commenced the next phase of advanced laboratory testing on conventional core extracted from the gular appraisal well located in the gippsland basin offshore southeast australia if successful the carbonnet project would bring together multiple carbon capture projects in victoria s latrobe valley transporting co2 via a shared pipeline and injecting it into deep underground offshore storage sites in the bass strait a substantial risk in any co2 sequestration project is failing to properly assess the complexities of the targeted geological subsurface formation and the in situ pore fluids core lab s 80 plus years of expertise in evaluating subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural porous media is essential for assessing these types of co2 sequestration projects now moving to production enhancement where core lab s strengths in both energetic systems and completion diagnostics helped customers optimize their well completions revenue from production enhancement came in at 40 5 million down 10 sequentially but up 27 year over year operating income ex items was 3 1 million and operating margins were 8 for the first quarter of 2022 for more than 20 years core s production enhancement team has been an industry leading innovator in both energetic system products and diagnostic services which aim to improve completions and better monitor well performance leveraging core s combined expertise in these two fields core lab is pleased to announce the introduction of its patent pending gotrace product solution gotrace is an innovative organically developed technology that directly incorporates core s diagnostic services into the company s energetic system products the integration of core s proprietary perforating products and diagnostic tracers into one system allows core s clients to cost effectively introduce unique diagnostic tracers into specific perf clusters and for the first time allows them to do this simultaneous with the perforating process furthermore by providing diagnostic evaluation at the cluster level gotrace reveals significantly more granularity when evaluating a completion program as compared to stage level diagnostic treatment alternatives recently totalenergies utilized core s gotrace technology in a recompletion project in the barnett shale by deploying the gotrace system totalenergies was able to determine whether the new perforating clusters were effectively stimulated core s diagnostic analysis of the restimulation treatment confirmed the clusters created with gotrace were effectively stimulated thus optimizing well performance that concludes our operational review we appreciate your participation and anthony will now open the call for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question will come from stephen gengaro with stifel you may now go ahead stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst thanks and good morning everybody a couple of things for me if you don t mind and what i would start with is when we think about the macro and you sort of it seems like a lot of the large integrated oil service names you re talking about mid teens international growth in the back half of 2022 and honestly probably for the full year as well how should we think about your rd business in the context of that larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yes good question stephen i think maybe let s go around the world here so i think we re in line with those expectations but i ll put an asterisk on that now so as we look around the planet so for north america so outside the u s no change in our perspective so in line with the ranges that i think are pretty broadly held around the industry south america no change maybe a little upside there middle east no change maybe a little upside there asia pacific no change the asterisk i would put on is our view of the international market as it relates to russia ukraine and europe we ll have to soften those expectation from this point based on what we see today so when we add it all up i think double digit growth for the segment now becomes more challenging and maybe unlikely stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst and have you said or can you give us some color on kind of the amount of business you re doing or were doing in russia and how you re handling that larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yes so what we ve said is in russia and the near russia region that historically has been 5 to 8 of our business stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst ok great thank you larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer stephen sorry just one other qualifier on that so beyond the work directly in the region there in russia and the ukraine and nearby areas the we see this realignment as russian oil is not reaching europe because of sanctions we think it has to realign with oil coming from other areas because the demand has not gone down if anything it s probably inching up and so we think that has to realign that could pose call it a rebound in the demand for crude oil assay work into europe that we saw a drop off in the first quarter stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst ok that was going to be one of my follow ups was sort of what you re seeing to offset but that s one of them ok and the other question just on the incremental margin front or the margin front going forward the headwinds you re seeing albeit look like in both segments in the first quarter how do they sort of start to fade away as you get into the second and third quarters and you start to get more normal incrementals what s the visibility on that and what s sort of driving that chris hill chief financial officer well and this is chris stephen and we do feel more confident going forward now that we ve kind of restored employees base compensation they re still not fully restored there s a little bit coming through if you think about restoring the match on retirement plans think of that as 401 k plans but that is those are smaller add back we re also looking at whether or not we need to make sort of annual merit adjustments later this year as well so we re evaluating that i think as the year progresses but those are going to be some headwinds but the big things that we ve done get employees back to full pay are kind of behind us so as you start to see top line grow we should start to see incremental margins not only improve but start to trend back i think we ve talked some about inflation that s real not just here in the u s but around the globe so costs are going up it s probably impacted our production enhancement group and the inventory more than some of the services but it s real so that s some of the headwinds we have but really nothing s changed the leverage is still there in our reservoir description group and we would still expect manufacturing efficiencies and things to improve as you start to expand top line in production enhancement as well stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst thanks and just one final quick one there just because you mentioned this you said fundamentally nothing s changed so i just the competitive landscape internationally on the rd business and the way the world has evolved the last couple of years with covid and all the issues we ve dealt with has anything changed sort of competitively or fundamentally in your international rd business larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer steve it s all on activity levels from the clients so yes i think covid played on their activity pace projects that may have been on the drawing board got pushed to the right we are seeing things pick up in places but it s largely an activity level the operational leverage is still there in the particularly on the rd side of the business stephen gengaro stephens inc analyst great thank you for taking the questions operator our next question will come from taylor zurcher with tudor pickering holt you may now go ahead taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst hey good morning hi larry chris and gwen first question production enhancement i m really just curious about the sort of margin road path or glide path forward so in the back half of last year i mean you were doing pretty solidly in the double digits from an operating income margin perspective and obviously there were some issues at play here in q1 but in the background you ve got a really constructive u s land completions activity backdrop so volumes should be improving quite nicely over the back half of the year and chris you highlighted some of the inflation dynamics at play but just curious exiting this year if we compare that to the second half 2021 or the 2021 exit and what that might look like for production enhancement this year on a year over year basis chris hill chief financial officer yes i think just first off and then others might have some stuff to add but we re still kind of looking at production enhancement from sort of resetting in q1 i would say margins where we would still expect margins to expand in that 25 to 30 on products and they can be a little bit higher on the services side so if you start to kind of dial that in you can take a view on where we might be at the end of the year but inflation i would say has been the biggest factor we did have manufacturing disruptions in q1 so there should be some improvement let s say those disruptions don t reoccur in q2 and going forward there should be some improvement there but hopefully inflation sort of starts to stabilize and we don t see that continuing larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yes i d add to that to chris comments there and taylor thanks for reinforcing how well the our business did last year on the production enhancement side and a real strong year i think outperformed the sector part of that is we had a very strong fourth quarter with international sales we try to get across that point here that those can be a bit lumpy so we did not have a repeat of that in q1 we expect that in subsequent quarters this year plus we had product sales into ukraine which obviously that were planned for the first quarter obviously didn t happen and so i think to echo chris points there we re going to have there s a little bit of natural lumpiness as international orders ship we didn t have that in q1 we expect them in some of the upcoming quarters so i think we ll see if you look at the trend you ll see an improving performance there over the next several quarters taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst understood and my follow up is on ccus you highlighted in the script some of the progress you made during q1 and i just got a simple question which is what s next you ve made a lot of progress thus far i imagine it s going to take time to generate some meaningful revenues from all things ccus moving forward recognizing that you re already working on some projects as we speak but just curious what s next on ccus and how that might look moving forward larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yes i think it s execution time for this it was a some of it and taylor just to maybe refresh on the audience a little bit is over the past 15 years or so we ve done the occasional carbon capture storage evaluation program core and fluid analysis a couple of things have changed in the landscape one is government regulations are driving many more of those projects than existed over the last say couple of decades and the other thing that s changed is what had been i ll call it nontraditional clients approaching us about those projects when they came up is now our traditional oil and gas clients are dialing that into their portfolio of projects that they re going to be working on so the inaugural six members of our ccs consortium study are all oil and gas companies that would not have had any carbon capture and storage dialed into their plans several years ago so i think across the oil industry and across the non oil industry the client base for the ccs projects is growing most of those are in the planning phase still as those start to go into the assessment phase that s when we hit our sort of our stride there when they re actually taking core and fluid samples and now we re very well set up to do that with our strategic alliance with talos our consortium study plus i ll call it proprietary work that we re doing like the carbonnet project that s been going on for several quarters there s more of those in the queue i would say that our target board for projects is probably eight to 10x what it was just 18 to 20 months ago taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst that s encouraging one last question for me if i can which is on gotrace it might be early days but i just have never really heard much about that sort of technology out there in the market so i m just curious if you could highlight for us the sort of value add that that technology provides that you highlighted the work you re doing with total but curious if there s any other anecdotes you can share as it relates to customer conversations you might be having with customers outside of total but it sounds like an intriguing technology and would love to hear a little bit more about it larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yes so a lot to like about that and boy you talk about a core lab like example of how we run our business and drive innovation it really motivates a lot of the staff to brainstorm problems and so one of the problems with completion diagnostics in the past i won t call it a problem more limitations is probably a better way to put it is you would pump in tracers at the stage level and so you did not get the granularity as the number of clusters and stages have gone up you didn t know whether you could tell if the stage was contributing but you didn t know the individual clusters so that prompted some look at how we might get that better granularity more at the cluster level and so we had to figure out whether we could get our diagnostic tracers to survive that very energetic event when the gun is triggered and the energetic goes off so as to not destroy the tracers that we were trying to in place at that same moment and so as i mentioned in the call here for the first time in the industry there s now an opportunity to perforate and place the energetics into those perforations all at the same time do that simultaneously and so what the clients are seeing there is the saving on rig time opportunity on this and that you don t have to perforate and then come out of the well and then pump down tracers into the perforations to see if they re in communication and so there s an advantage there and the granularity that they re getting and the reason you didn t hear about it was we were holding it pretty quiet and confidential we re the only company that does both energetics and tracer diagnostics so we feel like we ve got a real competitive advantage there we re just now getting in a position where we ve got i will call it the manufacturing capabilities and the analytical capabilities all lined up to service that client so yes early i ll call it early hours early minutes of the introduction in this more to come on that and we think it s got great promise there s nothing like it in the industry taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst very interesting thanks for the answers larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks taylor ok i think we ve got a pretty full slate of earnings calls this morning so we don t have anything else on our call list so we ll wrap up here in summary core s operational leadership continues to position the company for improving client well activity levels in both the u s and international markets in 2022 and beyond we have never been better operationally or technologically positioned to help our global client base optimize their reservoirs and to address their evolving needs we remain uniquely focused and are the most technologically advanced client focused reservoir optimization company in the oilfield service sector the company will remain focused on generating free cash and returns on invested capital in addition to our quarterly dividends we ll bring value to our shareholders via growth opportunities driven by both the introduction of problem solving technologies and new market penetration in the near term core will continue to use free cash to strengthen its balance sheet while always investing in growth opportunities so in closing we thank and appreciate all of our shareholders and the analysts that cover core lab the executive management team and the board of core laboratories give a special thanks to our worldwide employees that have made these results possible we re proud to be associated with their continuing achievements so thanks for spending time with us and we look forward to our next update good bye for now operator duration 45 minutes call participants larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer gwen gresham senior vice president

a key asian market remains under covid 19 restrictions what happened hawaiian holdings ha 2 00 isn t sure when a key international market will relax its travel restrictions that uncertainty weighed on hawaiian shares this week with the stock down more than 10 for the week as of thursday afternoon so what hawaiian is a niche carrier serving a very important role in connecting its home state to the u s mainland but vulnerable to competition from larger airlines with more robust route networks in normal times hawaiian is able to offset some of that domestic competition with a substantial international transpacific operation but the pandemic has limited where hawaiian can fly internationally hawaiian this week posted better than expected first quarter results but suspended full year guidance due to uncertainty about when it would be able to resume normal operations to asia hawaiian said second quarter capacity would be down 11 5 to 14 5 compared to the same three months of 2019 prior to the pandemic mostly because japan has not yet eased pandemic related travel restrictions japan accounted for about 70 of hawaiian s pre pandemic international business and ceo peter ingram remains confident that once travel is allowed there will be substantial opportunities for hawaiian strong demand for leisure travel to hawai i is poised to propel our domestic revenue to record levels as the effects of the pandemic are more muted now than at any point in the past two years ingram said based on these trends we anticipate a resurgence of international demand as restrictive travel policies continue to loosen now what hawaiian is a well run airline facing a difficult operating environment demand from the u s to hawaii is strong but due to international restrictions elsewhere a lot of u s carriers have boosted their capacity to the islands in hopes of capturing more of that demand hawaiian has the balance sheet to survive until conditions normalize but is unlikely to be able to do much to spark growth until we see the world return to pre pandemic business as usual given the uncertainty about when that will happen and the constant threat of a new uptick in covid 19 cases investors aren t seeing much reason to buy in despite what was a solid quarter for the airline

ford is suffering because of rivian and it may make a move that could crush rivian shares what happened when rivian automotive rivn 8 00 stock crashed last week i believed it had further to fall the electric vehicle ev stock tumbled 5 4 as of 11 05 a m et today before recouping those losses by two hours later even then rivian shares though were still down about 7 through the week rivian announced a partnership this morning but investors seemed to care less about it and more about the bumpy road ahead for the company especially the looming threat of a large investor off loading its stake in rivian so what today rivian announced a partnership with clearloop under which the ev maker will buy its first megawatt of solar energy to provide electricity for its charging network planned for tennessee state parks the move is part of rivian s carbon neutrality goals this partnership doesn t affect rivian s business much but it could have still sent the languishing stock higher any other day today though investors are focused elsewhere specifically on how rival ford f 3 01 is racing ahead even as rivian struggles to make a mark in the ev market here s what s ford s been up to in the past two days on april 26 it officially started producing its much awaited all electric f 150 lightning pickup truck a competitor to rivian s r1t pickup truck ford has nearly 200 000 orders for the f 150 lightning pickup and stopped taking further orders some months ago as demand exceeded expectations and production capacity on april 27 ford beat adjusted earnings estimates for its first quarter and projected 10 to 15 growth in vehicle wholesale volumes for the full year however the automaker suffered a net loss of 3 1 billion in the quarter on account of the dramatic fall in the value of its investment in rivian ford owns a nearly 12 stake in rivian so how could ford s losses on its rivian investment affect investors in the latter it shouldn t until ford decides to off load its stake in rivian the market now fears ford might take that step given the steep recent decline in rivian s stock price that s hitting ford s bottom line hard and that it might happen as early as the first half of may during which ford s 180 day lockup period on its rivian ipo investment expires now what ford has massive ev plans and on april 27 it reiterated its goal to produce 600 000 evs by the end of 2023 and 2 million evs by the end of 2026 and at the production launch event of f 150 lightning ford ceo jim farley even hinted that the company plans to build a second electric truck that s enough reason for the market to turn wary about rivian which is struggling to ramp up production among rising costs and supply pressures so even though rivian shares might be bouncing back today in line with the broader market by the time you read this i d expect it to remain volatile even weak especially as its quarterly earnings day on may 11 nears

first quarter earnings call our first quarter results were an all time record for any quarter in asbury s history we continue to experience strong consumer demand although our ability to meet this demand was constrained by very low new vehicle inventory for the quarter we grew adjusted ebitda by 195 million to 336 million and adjusted eps from 4 68 to 9 27 an increase of 98 we delivered 8 2 adjusted operating margin up 210 basis points we increased revenue by 1 7 billion to 3 9 billion and increased gross profit by 409 million to 792 million we drove f i gross profit per vehicle to a record 2 481 up 742 we continues to have a disciplined approach around sg a resulting in a decline of 520 basis points from the prior year s first quarter this was the first full quarter reflecting all of our 2021 acquisitions under the asbury umbrella and the strategic fit is clear we are excited about our team and our ability to execute on our 25 plan we see tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we roll out clicklane to all acquired dealerships and integrate tca into the legacy asbury stores due to our record performance and strong cash flow our balance sheet remains strong our adjusted operating cash flow for the first quarter was 406 million an increase of 290 million over the first quarter of 2021 our net leverage ended this quarter at 2 2x during the quarter we repurchased 200 million of our stock which completed our share reauthorization as we announced in our earnings release this morning our board of directors has approved a new 200 million share repurchase authorization as we announced in our earnings release this morning our board of directors have approved a new 200 million repurchase authorization our near term priority is to continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and use our strong free cash flow to lower our net debt level and return cash to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases at the same time we ll continue to monitor the m a market as we believe there are potential opportunities that would enhance our already strong dealership portfolio due to the strong pace of acquisitions last year we exceeded our five year acquisition target in the first year of the plan today we ll be providing an update to our strategic growth plan that i will briefly discuss later in the call we continue to operate in an unusual macro environment and experienced strong demand across all of our revenue streams we do not anticipate a meaningful recovery in inventory levels in 2022 and believe these levels are unlikely to fully normalize until 2023 in these unusual times our industry has benefited which is reflected in our first quarter results and demonstrates the value and the resilience of the franchise model we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results for our shareholders be outstanding partners with our oems to steward their great brands and offer an environment where our team members can thrive while providing the most guest centric experience in automotive retail dan dan clara senior vice president of operations thank you david and good morning everyone first thank you to all of our dedicated teammates who work so hard to fulfill our commitment to being the most guest centric automotive retailer this quarter was a busy one for asbury as we continued to integrate acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2021 worked to close on our divestitures and developed a plan to expand clicklane to acquire stores and tca to legacy asbury stores now i ll turn to our same store performance compared to the first quarter of 2021 unless stated otherwise starting with new vehicles in the first quarter new vehicle inventory remained well below normalized levels and consumer demand continued to outstrip supply at the end of march our total new vehicle inventory was 207 million and our days supply was at 10 days down 24 days from the prior year quarter given this dynamic our new vehicle volume declined 20 year over year however we experienced a significant increase in our new average gross profit per vehicle which increased 2 995 from the first quarter 2021 to a total of 5 750 we anticipate new inventory levels to remain low through 2022 and we are focused on maximizing profitability while also remaining steadfast in our commitment to our guests and our mission to be the most guest centric automotive retailer turning to used vehicles our used vehicle retail volume increased 6 which contributed to a 32 increase in used vehicle retail revenue used gross profit pvr increased by 209 to 2 228 compared to the first quarter of 2021 resulting in a 17 increase in used retail gross profit our total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at 378 million which represents a 28 day supply up one day from the prior year our used to new ratio for the quarter was 114 shifting to f i our strong consistent and sustainable growth in f i delivered an increase of 634 to 2 376 per vehicle retailed from the prior year quarter i d like to thank our f i team for this tremendous result in addition in the first quarter our total front end yield per vehicle increased 2 096 per vehicle to a record of 6 253 moving to parts and service our parts and service revenue increased 14 in the quarter the warranty revenue which is outside of our control dropped 12 our customer pay revenue continued its strong rebound posting 17 growth which is triple our normal growth we achieved over 176 000 online service appointments a 29 increase over the prior year quarter benefits of increasing online service appointments include enhancement to the customer experience higher customer retention higher conversion rates and higher dollars generated per repair order which ultimately provides higher returns to our shareholders we now have four full quarters with clicklane at all legacy stores and we couldn t be more pleased at the results we re seeing we sold over 5 600 vehicles through clicklane in the first quarter of which 38 of them were new vehicles and 62 were used in fact march was clicklane s best month ever we believe sales of new vehicles were depressed due to a lack of inventory 92 of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were incremental to asbury s dealership network average transaction time remained roughly in line with prior quarters as we saw a half minute increase to 8 5 minutes for cash d and about a half minute decrease to 13 6 minutes for finance deals in q1 clicklane deals had a front end yield of 3 804 and an f i per vehicle retail of 2 291 which equates to a 6 095 of total front end yield the average clicklane customer credit score continues to be over 700 which is higher than the average credit score at our stores the average down payment for new vehicles was 8 921 and for used was 6 869 81 of consumers seeking financing received instant approval while an additional 9 require some off line assistance 90 of those that applied were approved for financing 43 of clicklane sales had trade ins with 62 of such trades reconditioned and retailed to consumers and 95 of our clicklane deliveries are within a 50 mile radius of our stores thus allowing us the opportunity to retain our new customers in our parts and service department clicklane customers are converting at nearly double the rate of traditional internet leads but we won t see the full potential until inventory levels normalize we are excited about the continued growth of clicklane and the opportunity to accelerate that growth as we roll it out to our newly acquired stores i will now hand the call over to michael to discuss our financial performance michael michael welch senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you dan to our investors analysts team members and other participants on our call good morning i would like to provide some financial highlights which marked another record quarter for our company for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter please see our financial supplement our press release today and our investor presentation on our website as dan mentioned the first quarter was a busy one with a number of internal initiatives going on overall compared to the first quarter last year we generated significant adjusted operating cash flow of 406 million a year over year increase of 290 million which combined with the proceeds from divested stores allowed us to pay down 374 million of debt and our used vehicle floor plan line and repurchased 200 million of our shares adjusted net income increase 134 to 212 million and adjusted eps increased 98 to 9 27 the net income for the first quarter of 2022 was adjusted for onetime pre tax gains totaling 34 million or 1 11 per diluted share primarily related to the sale of four dealerships in the quarter net income for the first quarter of 2021 was adjusted for onetime pre tax gains of 4 6 million or 0 17 per diluted share primarily related to gain on legal settlements and pre tax real estate related charges of 1 8 million or 0 07 per diluted share excluding real estate purchases we spent approximately 21 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately 805 million of liquidity comprised of cash excluding cash at total care auto floor plan offset accounts and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility also at the end of the quarter our pro forma adjusted net leverage ratio stood at 2 2 times down from 2 7 times at year end as david stated today we announced that our board has approved a new 200 million share repurchase authorization for 2022 we are planning on capex of approximately 175 million this amount excludes real estate related purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider to be financing transactions one item that has a bit of a change is how we account for tca revenue and expenses and we ve included a breakdown of tca versus dealership operations in our earnings release this quarter was our first full quarter of tca for the quarter tca made 16 million of pre tax income which included 2 7 million of unrealized losses on equity investments excluding the unrealized losses tca would have made 19 million for the quarter we are currently working on the system integration and state licensing requirements for the asbury rollout of tca and plan to start our pilots for rollout in 2q in closing i would also like to thank all of our teammates throughout asbury who dedicate themselves to building a brighter future for ourselves our communities our shareholders and all of our stakeholders i will now hand the call back over to david to discuss the update to our strategic plan david david hult president and chief executive officer thank you michael as we mentioned on our last earnings call today we are providing an update to our strategic plan which can be referenced on slides 12 through 25 of our investor presentation the acquisitions we made in 2021 almost doubled our annual revenue today asbury automotive is a much larger more productive and financially sound company with more opportunities to drive top line growth one example with tca we are able to stay involved in the entire customer life cycle as well as now benefit from the claims side which was never available to us before regarding clicklane given the metrics we spoke about earlier we see a significant opportunity to leverage the high conversion rate as we roll out to the stores we acquired and provide a common digital platform our original plan for revenue growth or revenues was to grow from 8 billion to 20 billion by 2025 because of the significant progress we made in 2021 on a pro forma basis we are now just over 15 billion in revenue i will now simply refer to slide 24 and of the presentation deck our new revenue goal is 32 billion by 25 representing an incremental 12 billion the 12 billion is comprised of an additional same store growth of 2 billion an additional 3 billion in clicklane revenue and 7 billion from acquisitions in terms of earnings per share we are targeting eps to be greater than 55 per share this assumes a one time leverage if we were to increase our leverage to two times and use those proceeds to purchase additional stores or buy back our stock our eps could exceed 72 per share now referring to slide 25 our free cash flow generated from our business of 3 billion and a modest increase to two times leverage for an incremental 3 billion we would have over 6 billion in cash to deploy between 2022 to 2025 so in closing we believe that we have the right brands in the right states with the right people to execute our strategy to grow and improve our business we are generating strong cash flow that will continue to lower our net leverage while allowing us the flexibility to balance acquiring additional assets and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases finally i would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my fellow asbury teammates it is through your efforts that asbury continues to produce strong results for our shareholders while bringing us closer to our goal of being the most guest centric automotive retailer thank you all very much this concludes our prepared remarks we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions operator questions answers operator thank you and we can now take our first question from daniel imbro of stephen inc please go ahead daniel imbro stephens inc analyst yeah hey good morning guys and congratulations ona great quarter david hult president and chief executive officer thank you daniel imbro stephens inc analyst david i want to start on the used side of the business i mean the organic used growth uptick was near the best of the peer group and gpu really hung in there so could you talk about maybe what you re seeing in terms of used demand and how are you guys successfully capturing that used sale while maintaining gpus dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah good morning this is dan i ll be glad to take that question so we re pretty satisfied with the results even though we continue to focus on the acquisition of the inventory we all know that is in used cars where the return is generated close to 85 86 of our acquisition is coming through the consumer whether it is in the form of our leased earnings trades or buying cars through directly from the consumers and we know and we believe that that is what is allowing us to continue to report the margins and the pvrs that you are seeing today in addition to that the benefits the clicklane brings to be able to provide a digital retail environment online we see the benefit of that as well from a used car perspective so overall we will continue to focus on that strategy and continue to execute as we move forward david hult president and chief executive officer the one thing i ll add to that we decoupled our trade tool inside of clicklane to allow consumers to sell their vehicles direct to us we ll talk about it in detail at the end of the second quarter because we re fully launched in the month of april and we had it going at pilot stores or half our company if you will in the prior quarter or the current quarter we re talking about the first quarter we re seeing tremendous results in acquiring cars direct from consumers which is helping stabilize our inventory but most importantly our ability to create margin or gross profit per vehicle on used vehicles is really all about the acquisition of the car the market dictates a price if you cannot acquire the car at the proper price you will dramatically be impacted in the margin is our belief so we re really trying to be opportunistic and really make it easy for consumers to sell their vehicles to us which we believe is helping support our gross profit per vehicle daniel imbro stephens inc analyst great that s really helpful and then my follow up i wanted to ask on the rollout of tca you have some really bullish commentary in the slides about the opportunity but should we expect this rollout to be linear or is there a training of store employees or some kind of infrastructure that needs to be stood up first at the asbury stores before we can really accelerate the rollout of the product dan clara senior vice president of operations i ll start and then michael can jump in and clean up anything i screw up i ll tell you the easiest piece of it will be the rollout of the stores because the folks in the stores are used to selling the product so that will be very quick and efficient we ve really been working on the backside of the plumbing i mean it s a stand alone insurance company to get it right in all the stores before we start to implement it michael discussed in the script that in q2 we will start to roll out the legacy asbury stores our goal isn t the quarter to quarter race it s the long term vision of where we re going as an organization we plan to roll out the whole company within 12 to 18 months so somewhere in that time frame 100 of the asbury stores will be on tca michael welch senior vice president and chief financial officer and just a reminder from a as david said 12 to 18 months for the rollout to the stores from the impact on the financial statement because we have to defer the revenue there will be a lag in terms of when you ll see those results kind of come through the financials because we now have to defer that revenue over the life of the contract and so from a p l perspective it s probably two to three years away before you start seeing the positive results through the p l daniel imbro stephens inc analyst got it that s helpful thanks so much guys david hult president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we can now take our next question from john murphy bank of america please go ahead john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning guys maybe just to follow up on the tca to stay on the same topic i mean the funding and the balance sheet i mean that s going to be in tax advantage state or offshore i m just curious how in addition to sort of the benefits of just the ongoing earnings the potential tax implications or the lack thereof might be even more beneficial than what we just see in the earnings dan clara senior vice president of operations so currently tca is set up in as a utah entity and so that s the current setup we re looking into the kind of tax advantage pieces to kind of handle with the bigger scale now and so currently we do not have any of those baked into the forecast but something we are looking at from a perspective of currently it s utah and doesn t make sense to have any of it elsewhere john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ve got to imagine it makes sense to have it elsewhere right i mean it can be meaningfully positive to right the ongoing earnings distribution as far as cash versus what you would rather otherwise the tax david hult president and chief executive officer yes there was tax benefit john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that s huge right i mean on just the structure of that forget about the rollout isn t it dan clara senior vice president of operations so there s two pieces of tca there s a true regulated insurance company and then it s an f i product piece and so yes there s some tax benefits which got away the cost of the setup and the different pieces and then what that read is worth on a tax basis so i agree with you that there s some benefits there we just got to go through and kind of figure out the pieces of that and give it get it set up for a bigger company john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it ok that seems like there might be more upside and i get to the sort of second question on slide 25 when you re looking at this range i understand the benefit of leverage and being maybe more aggressive in expansion but david as you look at this how do you think about leverage i mean going from one to two turns going from 55 to 70 plus it seems like two turns is not too aggressive or really risky i mean how are you thinking about leverage in general as you re redeploying capital for growth here david hult president and chief executive officer yeah and just to clarify the leverage is 2025 so back to kind of a more normalized margin environment so that two times leverage is on a normalized basis i agree with you that two times is not an overly aggressive target i think that two to three times leverage is still kind of where we want to be in a normalized environment but being below two times just allows you the flexibility to go after larger acquisitions where if you re kind of up near that three times you don t have that same flexibility so i think a one to two times leverage is the right place to be to have the opportunity to go after those larger deals dan clara senior vice president of operations and i would just add i mean our history is we re a conservative company and any targets we put out there we certainly hit or exceed and usually exceed them it s difficult to know what the environment is going to be at that moment in time this was a conservative approach to us and certainly in this 25 year plan we ve normalized margins as well this whole plan is not baked on current margins we certainly brought them back down to a normalization in the future years coming up to 25 john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and i mean i guess the big of the question is what does normal mean going forward is it 2019 and prior margins is what you re thinking there or is there some potential benefit from automakers now being much more disciplined on supply versus demand and maybe getting a little bit better growth on the new side and then the mix of the business obviously shifting to used in part more parts and service that means that there could be just from a mixed basis upside in margins is that how you re thinking about it is it you just kept the 2019 levels to just get the benefit from the mix of what you re driving in the business or there is some potential slight upside from the 2019 levels dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah no and everyone keeps referring to 2019 and i brought this up a few times i ll bring it up again we will never see 2019 margins again in our company we re a different company not because of our size but because of the accretive acquisitions that we ve done we sold off all of mississippi which was our lowest margin platform and we ve increased through park place lhm and stevinson all of them are accretive in margins to where we were in 19 we re also from a productivity standpoint under the legacy asbury stores alone it hasn t been integrated in any of the acquisitions yet but from a productivity standpoint from 2019 we ve had a 50 increase on the variable side for production per employee for sales advisors so that s significant and we see more upside where technology is going and where clicklane is going so i would tell you john and i ll just speak specifically to asbury we re in that high 4 5 margin business my belief is we ll be somewhere in the 6 or higher range on new car margins when things normalize now as it relates to margins on used cars i would simply tell you the cost of sales are reflection of margin our gross profit now is in the 2 200 range we don t see that materially changing much when we get back to a normalized environment john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and that just gets to my last question on the sg a front i mean how do you i mean we always like to think about it as a percent of gross margin i mean it s a reasonable way to think about it but then there s an absolute dollar level and then there s all this technological efficiency that you just kind of highlighted how should we think about sg a going forward i mean the dumb guy simple way is hey it s mid 50 to 60 maybe it s higher than that maybe it s slower than that but how do you think about that because it s much more complicated than just hey it s a percent of gross a good starting place to talk about it but i mean how do you think about it dan clara senior vice president of operations sure i ll start and michael can finish it the way we ve modeled this and looked at it and we re tracking exactly where we expect it to be at this point so it gives us confidence that we re on the right track to execute the 25 year plan we believe that there is an opportunity to improve sg a significantly over where we were in 2019 but somewhere around where we are today so i don t see it what s going on in the macro sense what s going on in the economy what interest rate different things look like at that moment in time but as we sit here today and we forecast it out and you see our soft plan that we forecasted that doesn t assume a recession so assuming as we sit here today we model this out we have the opportunity both through efficiency of our software production per employee to have a tailwind with sg a john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst so baseline we should think about high 50s and with an opportunity to maybe grind better as grosses improve and you get efficiency in the system is that a fair way to say but you re not even really assuming that just yet dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah so look we have it what we did these five year plans we don t aggregate the numbers we do it literally by store by market i would tell you if things play out the way we anticipate we should be in the mid 50s to upper 50s somewhere in that bracket john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s very helpful thank you so much david hult president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we can now take our next question from ryan sigdahl of craig hallum capital group please go ahead ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst good morning guys congrats on the results progress david hult president and chief executive officer thank you dan clara senior vice president of operations thank you ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst curious on two kind of i guess financial questions one divesting seven stores what s the annual revenue you re going to lose from those and then secondly on parts and service same store sales strong at 14 even excluding tca but the gross margin was a bit weaker kind of year over year anything to call out there michael welch senior vice president and chief financial officer so on the divestitures just i ll give you just a quarter for the quarter those stores represented 162 million of revenue on the quarter so that just kind of gives you a run rate for the quarter to back that number on ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst and similar for the other three i guess are they all similar sized michael welch senior vice president and chief financial officer that includes all that includes the four stores sold in the quarter plus the three stores that we sold on april 1 so that s all seven stores what they represented in the quarter ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst got it and then on parts and service michael welch senior vice president and chief financial officer we have 3 75 billion dan clara senior vice president of operations ryan this is dan i ll take the other parts and service so the parts and service margin is a direct reflection of just the mix that we re seeing as you see on our tables our wholesale parts grew up 25 which carries your lowest margin and then in addition to that when you see some of the warranty pullback that we have experienced out there with some of the oems the mix of that warranty pullback in the margin that we carried in there is what is bringing us down david hult president and chief executive officer and i ll say with the miller organization we re happy to sacrifice that margin they re impressive as it relates to wholesale parts and many other areas but that s just one that sticks out and there s certainly a lot of learnings there for us for our legacy asbury stores as well ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst great one more for me so on clicklane a lot of good incremental progress there curious on the traffic sources to get break out kind of what percent of that is organic versus paid sem or other paid channels dan clara senior vice president of operations so ryan this is dan again i ll start and then david can clean it up since we launched clicklane we have not gone out there and spent millions of dollars advertising clicklane and the vast majority of our advertising dollars go from a store standpoint go for the digital transaction and the digital traffic that we ve pushed to our websites so i will tell you that the vast majority of the traffic is coming from organic growth and the traffic that we pushed to the website david hult president and chief executive officer and just to put a harder number on it i d tell you about 25 is for paid search there just hasn t been a logical reason for us to really promote it without any inventory and i can t stress it enough that the 5 600 sales are simply the 90 legacy asbury stores we haven t rolled it out to any of the acquisitions yet again because of tca the forming clicklane being a fully transactional tool not a lead generator it takes time to do that we ll start to roll out our first store toward the end of this quarter but none of the additional 70 stores that we purchased are on clicklane at all so that growth that number is solely the legacy stores ryan sigdahl craig hallum capital group analyst great thanks guys good luck david hult president and chief executive officer thank you dan clara senior vice president of operations thank you operator we can now take our next question from glenn chin of seaport research partners please go ahead glenn chin seaport global securities analyst hi thank you good morning folks and congratulations on the upsize plan nice to see such an ambitious plan very encouraging and thank you for all the detail around it david i just want to probe your comments a little about normalized margins what those might be going forward i mean i understood that you will benefit from these terrific acquisitions you ve made but maybe just from a broader industry perspective i mean is it safe even to use or look at 2019 as a baseline only because prior to that i mean new margins at least if not as much on the used side but new margins were in secular decline for a very long period is that to say that you think 2019 may have been the bottom david hult president and chief executive officer i would say a bottom and kind of the end of an era you ve had a tremendous amount of acquisitions and growth and consolidation since 19 you ve had really disruption of electric evs coming in consumers preordering at more acceptable margins for lack of a better term the question is if you believe normalized margins are end of 23 24 what does that mean how many electric cars are going to be on the road what s the incentives going to be for the government the stronger the incentives the more it supports margins i just don t think as an industry you ll see 19 again for a long time i think a lot has changed since then and you see the profit from our partners with the manufacturers they found ways to be more efficient in what they do so i think between technology finally catching up to an archaic space meaning automotive retail the introduction of evs the consumer perception demand and their comfort level acquiring online and oddly enough when you go online and won t price it for lack of a better term you end up at a better margin place than letting someone negotiate so i just think our industry has been hampered the last year or two with what happens with ev does the franchise model go away as i sit here today and i worry about the franchise model i feel better every day about the franchise model and know the meaningful role that we play and the strong partner that we can be and just looking at some of these start up electric companies and how they re struggling and what they re going through and the quality of the products that our manufacturers make and our ability to present those products and sell them i just think we re in a different space and now you add technology to it and you add efficiency to it and you change how you compensate people i just see this as a much better value proposition and i use this term around here so i ll use it again right now we re a plane taking off and we re in the clouds it s a little bumpy and everyone can t see above the clouds yet but when we get above the cloud in the next 18 to 24 months i think things are going to look really good for our industry as a whole that s my belief glenn chin seaport global securities analyst ok yeah understood and i appreciate the thoughts and then next i apologize if i missed it but did you guys talk about how the upsize plan will be funded do you think it can be funded internally or organically or do you anticipate having to access the capital markets david hult president and chief executive officer no if you look at the onetime leverage number that is all the acquisitions are paid for out of free cash flow so no additional debt needs our equity needs to be raised glenn chin seaport global securities analyst ok very good also good to hear and then lastly just on acquisitions and dispositions any thoughts gentlemen on where those acquisitions will be or the types of stores that you re going to be looking at or looking to build out the network or really just bulking up in markets where you already exist david hult president and chief executive officer i m doing this for 36 years on the retail side you created a lot of relationships and a lot of friends and a lot of dealers see value in partnering with us we have the ability through relationships today to go out and purchase another 5 billion if we wanted to today our goal is not to grow quickly our goal is to grow thoughtfully and be great capital allocators for our shareholders so i think that the timing cadence and pace is important i think the states where you ve seen us grow in our thought process of balancing the brands with the right states you won t see us differ from that and acquisitions going forward will be accretive for us the one thing i don t think our space gets a lot of look at is portfolio management what do they buy what do they sell what did that do from an accretion standpoint not from a top line revenue but what did that really do to them as a whole and so i think you ll see us really manage the portfolio well you ll see more divestitures over time probably at some point in the future and you ll certainly see more acquisitions as well but that s just really maximizing the portfolio to generate the highest returns and create the most stable company for our employees and our shareholders glenn chin seaport global securities analyst ok very good and then lastly still on acquisition and disposition can you confirm this bunch of seven stores that you disposed of is that portfolio management or fine tuning david or is it you need to comply with oem framework agreements david hult president and chief executive officer yeah and in this particular case without getting too much into the weeds it had nothing to do with framework every manufacturer and we re thankful to represent the toyota and lexus brand and we love them and the relationship and the senior management teams but when we went into this it s a timing situation we were competing to buy lhm with a group of people we didn t know who we re competing against and didn t know we were getting the deal the stevinson deal was in my 20 group in the 90s when i was the gm of a turner store there was a relationship there that came together quick we didn t want to pass on that opportunity not knowing if we re going to get the miller organization then fast forward we signed stevinson and then we got the miller one so we knew we had an issue because the manufacturer has a limit to how many stores you can own and reach in so we knew that we would have to sell some stores did we want to sell any of them of course not but we had to comply and respect the relationship that we do with the manufacturer and we fully aligned quickly with what we needed to do they were tremendous partners in working with us to divest of those stores so we think it all happened quickly and timely because of the strong relationship and we re happy with where we are today with our portfolio glenn chin seaport global securities analyst ok terrific thank you for all the feedback david hult president and chief executive officer thank you operator we can now take our next question from rajat gupta of jpmorgan please go ahead rajat gupta jpmorgan chase and company analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question the first question was on just the used car used vehicle unit growth trajectory you re currently run rating roughly close to 150 000 annual units with the acquisition targets in the four year plan you probably that run rate becomes like 200 000 220 000 and by 2025 we re expecting that to move from that 220 000 to like 340 000 which is roughly like a 15 cagr how should we get conviction around that particularly when supply is a bit tight here in the near term it just seems like a bit of a hockey stick around to be out here so maybe if you could help bridge that and i also like to put that in the context of clicklane how much conviction you already have that incremental contribution is going to come through thanks then i have a followup dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah good morning rajat this is dan i ll take the first part of the question and then david can clean it up let s look at the big picture from a market level we talk about 40 million used cars that are sold on an annual basis 45 to 50 of those transactions happened between private parties we believe that as the digitization of our industry continues to evolve and with us having been one of the very few that have a fully transactional tool as that consumer continues to adopt and accept the digital transaction online those private party customers are not going to want to transact between private parties because that is not going to be available for them so that is going to give us a competitive advantage that we will certainly take and go after so we see being able to pull from that market share for a lack of a better term that is out there david hult president and chief executive officer and i ll add to it and if you look at slide 19 i don t know how well it s showing up but there s a hockey stick arrow in there so i like your terminology with that i would tell you the reduced cars that are out there now clearly won t be a problem in the future when you normalize sar and you get the fleets back up to normal levels and you get those cars coming back to market that aren t coming back to market now make it much easier when you go from 91 stores to 225 ish stores while i understand the cagr comment in there you got 40 million typically on an average year plus of used sales so when you talk about incremental growth or market share gain on the franchise side you re somewhat restricted because of your pma but you re unrestricted as it relates to pre owned so we looked at our growth from 2019 2020 average per store where we re at where we re going and again i ll say it again i know it s repetitive but the 5 600 was with 90 legacy stores none of the acquisitions going forward and with no new car inventory to have on there and when we originally launched the tool we re selling more new than used on clicklane so we ve done this exercise by store we re looking at sar and making our assumptions we understand and we ll talk about it next quarter the number of cars we re acquiring directly from consumers this isn t an overly aggressive number for us we feel like this is logical to be it and i made a comment earlier the miller organization is phenomenal and a lot of things in wholesale parts is one of them employee retention taking care of the guests or others but a huge opportunity for them is the used to new ratio even in the quarter and it shows between our total and our same store they are a pretty good distance behind us in used to new ratio so we ll work with that very talented team over time to dramatically improve that used to new ratio when you take their size of an organization they get them up to our used to new ratio there s a meaningful tailwind there as well rajat gupta jpmorgan chase and company analyst got it got it that s helpful color and then maybe just last one on parts and services you have mid single digit growth down in there for the next few years it seems a bit conservative like pre covid the average franchise dealer averaged 5 6 and with inflation and with customer pay and with the wage continue to ramp back and just the opportunity to gain share from smaller independent just curious as to what s governing that mid single digit target is that conservative or just what s factored into that that would be helpful to know thanks david hult president and chief executive officer it s an excellent question and quite honestly one we debated for a while there s a lot of factors i ll start with the answer and then dabble for a minute the answer is it s extremely conservative we had a 30 growth rate in the last four years for consumers as far as what they re spending with us per transaction we see a lot of where it s coming from and why and we see how it s going forward and as we sit here today and i said this before every quarter we track the dollars per repair order on combustible engine hybrid and fully electric vehicles and we didn t talk about it but this quarter was no different the dollar values are significantly higher on the fully electric vehicles the question will be as cars become the average age of the car we all know how old it is right now does that start to change in 24 and 25 with the availability of all the cars that are going to be out there in the heavy what we believe to be federal incentives to buy these cars and if there s a lot of car transactions in those years will that materially change the dollars spent in the service department because maybe the average miles coming to the shop are lower now there s 270 million plus cars on the road again the average age is much older approximately the average age of a car that comes to our service department is 70 000 miles so we ve made a lot of again this five year plan is almost like a balance sheet statement it s a moment in time as we sit here today and we plan out through 25 we put together what we believe is a conservative plan and we ve literally looked at it by store by market and what our potential is to grow so it s a very fair comment it is extremely conservative there potentially is upside in it there s just so many factors that come into play we just didn t feel confident enough to raise it without being able to back it up rajat gupta jpmorgan chase and company analyst got it got it make sense it looks like you win either way either more units or more service so it shows the resiliency of the model great operator and we can now take our next question from stephanie moore of truist please go ahead stephanie moore truist securities analyst hi good morning i think continuing on the same kind of question toward here on evs maybe you could talk a little bit about the conversations you re having with the oems right now about the introduction of evs over the next several years i think you have a nice perspective just given your breadth of oem brand coverage so maybe what our expectations from the oems in terms of capital investments on your end everything from just the stores to charging stations thoughts about agency models direct to consumer or preorders i would love to get just general color on ev introduction david hult president and chief executive officer sure i think we do a good job in running the business day to day and the manufacturers do a great job at looking ahead and planning for the future getting us ready for the future and building quality products we ve been installing charging stations for four years at our dealerships and very mature with that at this standpoint i would tell you tesla has done extremely well they ve been a great disruptor but they haven t had anyone to compete against no one has really been in that space offering a lot of products and going at them over the next couple of years you re going to see that change materially as far as what comes to market sitting in my seat i get the opportunity to drive a lot of cars that have either just come out or are coming out for a year or so and i would just say from a fit and finish and a quality standpoint i m extremely excited with the electric products that are coming out from the manufacturers and i believe that they re better than the fit and finish and quality of the tesla product everyone has their own opinion it s just one person s opinion i m not knocking them but that again excites me more about the future and what s happening and like anything else like our software and like the battery technology everything is going to improve over time the government wants to go down this road so we believe the incentives are going to be there for a while so we think we re really well positioned with this what i would call a mature supply chain meaning the brick and mortar is out there you see carvana you see tesla you see all these start up electric companies or direct to consumer companies realizing the need for brick and mortar that s already mature that s already out there the investments have already been made where we re at and we ve been at the last couple of years just making significant investments in our team training our folks to sell electric vehicles and training them on the technology most importantly training our technicians to work on these very complicated and quite honestly dangerous cars to work on so again extremely optimistic about the space haven t seen from almost every manufacturer from a quality standpoint what they re coming out with for electric cars i think it s going to be a fun time to see how these legacy oems really stay at all against the disruptors stephanie moore truist securities analyst great no that s really helpful and then i think switching gears a topic that s been coming up i think more as of late has just been the affordability of vehicles in this environment obviously new prices are quite high used have also increased pretty meaningfully now we have rising interest rates what are you what do you view kind of where it stands on just overall affordability and just on the new and used side and do you think that changed at all during the quarter or in april dan clara senior vice president of operations sure the reason we quoted that the average down payments 9 000 i m rounding numbers so 9 000 down payment on a new car is significant we didn t see that pre pandemic almost 7 000 on a used car what that tells me is the consumer has a lot of cash to spend and even though inflation is running high their incomes have gone up dramatically and they ve been sitting on cash and the age of the car is there so we ve had 0 interruption with raising rates as it relates to the consumer side of things or the desired demand to buy vehicles i can t predict the future i don t know what s going to happen in ukraine it s certainly affecting us on the supply chain issue with some brands so there s a lot of variables still out there but we re optimistic where we sit today how strong and resilient the consumer is how much cash that they have and their propensity and willingness to want to buy 90 of our business a little bit over 90 is prime business so we re a very small player in the subprime business i m sure it affects subprime more in folks living paycheck to paycheck which where the inflation would affect them more but we re not seeing any issue at this point stephanie moore truist securities analyst great appreciate all the color today thank you david hult president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we can now take our next question from bret jordan of jefferies please go ahead bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys david hult president and chief executive officer good morning bret jordan jefferies analyst on the 17 customer pay growth could you tell us what was price versus traffic dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah i would say it was 60 price meaning the consumers were spending more and probably almost 40 traffic as far as bret jordan jefferies analyst do you feel like for like same skew price like an inflation number in there or is it just that obviously the 60 would include mix shift as well but is there a feeling for like what pricing on the same job would be dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah there s no inflation in there at all we haven t adjusted our prices as it relates to that to align with inflation bret jordan jefferies analyst ok and then i think investor perception is that battery electric vehicles don t need any service and you re saying that they have a higher repair bill is that something you see going forward or do you think this is just because these are new vehicles with bugs that will be worked out over time i mean as you look at the bev population are they additive to your service business long term or negative dan clara senior vice president of operations yeah i again one person s opinion my belief is the propensity or the frequency of them coming to the shop will be less but the time in dollars will be greater not just what they spend but what we end up charging because of sophistication to work at it and putting electric aside and not talking about autonomous there are some technology features in cars today breaking where your car can break with someone in front of you lane changing the shifting and learning you that s all technology that could have bugs in them so while the cars really get heavy content with technology not just the battery piece it allows for more opportunity for things to go wrong and when you talk about driving a 5 000 pound vehicle at 60 miles an hour down the road there s a lot of liability in touching those cars so you ve really got to be thoughtful and think about what you re going to do over the airwaves that are nice to have and what you re going to do that may have a real liability issue in driving the vehicle so we see that we re really positioned well we re not surprised by the additional dollars to your point technology will get better over time it s going to take a while and then you factor in the roads and the potholes and the weather they all play a role with the software and technology in these vehicles as far as their performance bret jordan jefferies analyst right thank you david hult president and chief executive officer thank you operator we can now take our final question from david whiston of morningstar equity research please go ahead david whiston morningstar analyst thanks good morning on clicklane is the conversion rate so much higher versus traditional digital because of the tool itself being so good which i think it is or is it because your customers are already more committed to buying than other customers would be just because they do enter the clicklane portal dan clara senior vice president of operations david good morning this is dan i ll start and then turn it over to david so if you look at our data from clicklane with the average credit score being over 700 you think about that consumer that consumer is in the very they know that we have a fully transactional tool which gives us a competitive advantage from that perspective so that consumer does not want to go through the traditional process and go spend three or four hours in a store and are taking full advantage of the technology that we have out there that makes it a lot more efficient to buy and acquire that inventory where they want to how they want to and at the time of the day that best benefits the guest so we believe that it is that the tool is attracting a very good credit score customer but in addition to that just the fact that it is one of the very very few fully transactional tool is giving us the better results as well david hult president and chief executive officer and i would just say just to add on top of that we had prior tools and then what i would call more lead generators to what a lot of the tools are out there now we saw a lower credit score customer we saw lower down payments i think the consumer appreciates their time and to be able to do a transaction in 14 minutes instead of sitting in a show room for two hours is meaningful if you have a fully autonomous transactional digital platform you don t have a need for a call center if you have a call center that only frustrates the consumer more think about if you re trying to buy any kind of product online you can t finish it you need to get on with a call center to figure things out that s not a fun experience it s frustrating so we don t have a call center we believe that the tool speaks for itself and it s only going to continue to grow and that old stupid adage we re all consumers we d love to buy things we don t love to be sold things so the ability in your own safe environment to go through a tool select which one that you want to use decide what f i products if any you want be able to sign in your home and pay for it is meaningful we have this software called invite to pay which people pay via text and email in 2018 we did 12 million annually on this invite to pay tool online or via text we did over 100 million last year because it s convenient so we re constantly focused on that north star it s not about what s best for us to generate the most money what s best for the manufacturer for them it s what s best for the consumer and our logic is if we give them the best tool and be most transparent logically they want to transact with us more and again going back to that concept people like to buy we believe that s why the f i number is so high we re not repitching we re not selling there s no interruption on that f i process that almost 2 300 per in f i is the customer self selecting themselves so we think that s the power and no different than the first smartphone or any technology this is year one as people become more comfortable with the software the software improves later in this quarter we ll roll out our second iteration of our f i platform on clicklane it s a significant improvement to our card version so we re constantly working on it and we will continue to improve the tool as well but it s just logic based convenience time transparency is going to win out every time for the consumer david whiston morningstar analyst yeah i totally agree with you that i see what you mean by the efficiency and the convenience and it s attracting perhaps a more wealthier or higher credit quality customer but at the same time doesn t the digital aspect also attract make it easier for some people who have lower credit quality who are afraid to go to the store it doesn t sound like that s happening with clicklane i m just curious is clicklane quickly maybe crowding out that lower credit quality customer dan clara senior vice president of operations no that s a great comment and it s one that we really never talk about i m going to we all journey through life we have our ups and downs and we never judge any one situation in why they might be affected by a low credit score so this isn t to disparage anyone but i would and i entered the car business in the mid 80s from the mid 80s until today anyone that is in a position of need as it relates to being assisted with financing they re the first people to reach out for help that was pre websites and them showing up at the store and disclosing their situation after websites them reaching out via lead saying help me that business has been there for decades it will always be there and it doesn t stop with clicklane we didn t get everyone financed we got 90 of the people financed 90 of the people needed assistance 10 of the people we could not get financed what i would tell you is most people that have a situation they want to personally talk about it and so that s when more human intervention and understanding and empathy gets involved to understand their situation to best assist them the software isn t a machine learning tool at this point to where i can identify that and work through subprime customer s issues david whiston morningstar analyst ok thanks that s helpful operator we have no further questions at this time i would like to now hand the call back to david hult for any additional or closing remarks david hult president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator this concludes today s discussion we appreciate your participation today and look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter have a great day operator duration 70 minutes call participants karen reid vice president corporate financial planning and analysis and treasurer david hult president and chief

chief operating officer who will review our first quarter financial results mike mike wallace chief operating officer and chief financial officer thanks vince and good morning everyone i would like to now take a few minutes and provide a recap of our first quarter 2022 financial performance which we reported earlier this morning i encourage you to review our 10 q when filed as it contains significantly more information about our business operations and financial performance than we will cover on this call for the first quarter of 2022 total gaap revenue was 33 8 million compared to revenue of 36 million in 2021 revenue for the quarter consisted of wireless revenue of 18 8 million and software revenue of 15 million with respect to wireless revenue first quarter 2022 revenue of 18 8 million compares to 20 1 million in 2021 this performance reflected a lower level of pajer unit churn on a year over year basis in fact the net pager decline during the first quarter was 1 1 one of our lowest quarterly declines as we have stated previously these continued strong trends in our wireless business are being driven by the combination of solid gross additions from our sales organization continued minimization of churn with existing customers and maintaining stable unit pricing furthermore as we progress in 2022 and 2023 we expect our new gen a pager which was announced in late 2021 to be a significant factor in minimizing churn and maintaining average revenue per unit or arpu moving on to software software revenue for the first quarter was 15 million representing a 5 9 decrease from 2021 this decline was largely driven by our prior focus on spok go which has now changed going forward first quarter software maintenance revenue the largest component of software revenue was 9 2 million versus 9 4 million in the same period of the prior year or 1 7 lower maintenance revenue being flat to down continues to be in line with our expectations given gross churn and uplift levels remaining consistent with prior quarters regarding our professional services revenue which was 3 3 million versus 4 4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and as we stated in our earnings call in february related to our 2022 financial guidance we assumed an intentional reduction in professional services revenue to better align with our current backlog and to drive a higher rate of net cash flow in alignment with the shift in our strategic business plan and again it s important to remember that professional services has not historically driven meaningful cash flow on a stand alone basis but more so has been viewed as an opportunity to expand our license footprint through customer engagement as well as to fulfill upgrade obligations under our maintenance contracts which is critical in maintaining our existing customers and lastly license and hardware revenue was 2 4 million compared with 2 2 million in the same period of the prior year or 11 3 higher as we saw a higher mix higher bookings mix of licensing hardware as we begin to refocus solely on both care connect suite across the organization and begin the plan to bolster our care connect suite product line through directed r d spend operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 totaled 42 5 million and includes 4 5 million in severance and restructuring costs compared to 37 8 million in operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 first quarter adjusted operating expenses which excludes depreciation amortization accretion and severance and restructuring costs and includes capitalized software development cost totaled 37 1 million compared to 38 million in the first quarter of 2021 it is important to remember that although we made the announcement last quarter of the pivot to our new strategic plan the majority of ongoing payroll costs primarily related to employees no longer with us continued through mid april due to employee notification in adherence with the federal warrant act given this performance free cash flow defined as a net change in cash from december 31 2021 to march 31 2022 excluding the payment of our dividend of 6 5 million in march was a negative 6 7 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared with a negative 4 4 million in the same quarter of 2021 clearly those ongoing costs previously mentioned have the effect of depressing our free cash flow and we expect those to reverse going forward as such given the material changes pursuant to our new strategic business plan it is important to understand the pro forma cash impact of the negative 6 7 million in free cash flow just mentioned for the first quarter had these strategic changes been made as of january 1 2022 including the cash impact for terminated employees of approximately 5 5 million and non payroll spok go costs of approximately 1 1 million there would have been an incremental 6 6 million cash benefit to free cash flow in the first quarter of 2022 resulting in essentially break even free cash flow and additionally from a free cash flow perspective spok s cash outlays for yearend accruals made in the first quarter each year for 2022 totaled approximately 5 5 million and thus our cash balances excluding the payment of dividends historically billed in the second through the fourth quarters and we expect this trend to continue going forward in 2023 and beyond this first quarter dynamic will continue albeit at reduced levels due to the lower number of employees in the company now turning to our guidance for 2022 as a reminder the figures i am going to discuss today are included in our guidance table in the earnings release and are unchanged from the previously provided 2022 financial guidance given during our call in february however just to reiterate we expect total revenue to be in the range of 126 million to 139 2 million of which we expect wireless revenue to range between 71 6 million to 77 million where the midpoint reflects an annual revenue attrition rate of approximately 5 7 when compared to 2021 consistent with our recent trends software revenue is expected to range from 54 4 million to 62 2 million where the midpoint reflects annual revenue attrition of approximately 5 million from 2021 we expect adjusted operating expenses for the full year of 2022 to be in the range of 118 8 million to 128 6 million and capex will be in the range of 3 4 million to 4 2 million as the majority of capex is related to our wireless business which is unchanged from previous years as mentioned earlier fiscal year 2022 continues to remain a transition year for spok given the implementation time required to execute our strategic shift to a cash flow focused model however we anticipate that this transition will be completed by the end of 2022 with the majority of reductions already behind us with that said we expect the company to be cash flow positive by the third quarter of 2022 cover the majority of the third and fourth quarter dividends through free cash flow generation and we ll reach the full cash flow run rate by the end of 2022 as we head into 2023 upon the full execution of the pivot of our strategic plan we continue to expect annualized cost savings to be between 40 3 million to 44 3 million on a pro forma basis so as we move through this transition we will continue to update shareholders on our progress also the board along with its capital allocation committee will continue to assess the best way to drive shareholder value from a capital allocation standpoint now turning to our estimates for severance and restructuring costs for 2022 as previously provided on our call in february as you can see from the slide we have lowered our range of severance and restructuring costs from our initial estimates of 6 4 million to 10 2 million down to 6 2 million to 7 5 the reduction in the high end of the range is largely a result of current estimates related to spok go contractual terminations and exit costs which have been largely completed at this point also it is important to note that while high end of the range specifically for severance and personnel costs remain unchanged the low end of the range has been increased the reason for this change is the number of employees that voluntarily left the company prior to their actual termination date and thus would not have required severance payment was lower than expected with that i ll turn the call back over to vince for some closing comments vince vince kelly president and chief executive officer thanks mike i want to remind investors as we progressed through our pivot we have a long history and track record of running this company for free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders this gives us confidence we will be successful in the execution of our strategic pivot since our creation in 2004 spok has returned 630 million of our free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases we will continue to do so as i mentioned upfront our current dividend yield is very attractive and we expect to be able to pay that level for the foreseeable future as we focus on our new plan capital return to stockholders in the first quarter of 2022 totaled 6 5 million in the form of the company s regular quarterly dividend of 0 3125 per share this is an increase of 3 8 million over the first quarter of last year reflecting the new spok dividend policy as always the declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the board s discretion and will depend on financial and legal requirements and other considerations as a reminder the board is authorized to share repurchase program of up to 10 million of the company s common stock this authorization allows the company to return additional capital to shareholders by opportunistically repurchasing the company s shares we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy as spok transitions to our strategic pivot during 2022 and beyond our balance sheet continues to remain strong with the cash cash equivalents and short term investment balance of 46 3 million as of march 31 2022 we continue to operate as a debt free company additionally i d like to remind everyone that we continue to remain committed to our mission of being a strategic partner of choice for enterprise grade clinical communication and patient care coordination this commitment has allowed spok to create a significant market position with long standing relationships with the nation s leading healthcare providers spok has a best in class paging network currently the largest in the united states which continues to generate strong results and we now have a new exclusive alphanumeric messaging device in our gen a pager product additionally spok continues to provide a valuable and critical service to our customers delivering important information to care teams when and where it matters the most to improve patient outcomes as previously discussed our spoke care connect solutions provide a suite of products with potential for new license sales and a valuable maintenance stream maintenance continues to provide a foundation under our legacy software business and it s important to maintain as we quickly transition to focus on cash flow generation our pivot away from spok go and our new focus on our care connect suite of solutions now allows us to invest significantly more in our legacy products as reflected in our guidance we believe this will drive future sales and upgrade opportunities and improve our results going forward in this important business line while generating free cash flow on a go forward basis we have a world class customer base and a large market share in healthcare contact center solutions and we believe this represents significant opportunity for the future spok continues to demonstrate a very predictable revenue base with over 80 of our revenue being recurring in nature coming from either our legacy wireless offerings or software maintenance contracts so in closing i d like to thank everyone for joining us today we appreciate your support and interest and spok and we look forward to updating everyone again next quarter if you have any questions please reach out to our investor relations team and have a great day and please stay safe and healthy thank you questions answers operator

thailand upbeat on food revolution mr santi the government should come up with clear food development plans the covid 19 pandemic marks the beginning of a full scale revolution in the food industry according to leaders in the field consumer behaviour has changed with many people now cooking at home instead of eating out and shopping at small shops nearby their residences more people use delivery services and are eating healthy foods in an effort to curb viral infections leading food manufacturers and retailers to change their business julpas tom kruesopon the founder of golden triangle health co paisarn aowsathaporn managing director of bistro asia co and santi abakaz chief executive and co founder of tastebud lab and bio buddy shared their views on thursday on the future of the thai food industry at a bangkok post virtual seminar proper policies pushed the future of food is bright and thailand is ready to lead the sector but a policy direction is critical as bureaucracy has hampered the industry s potential to grow said mr tom he said as a result of the pandemic everyone has become more aware of their health mr tom believes a major food trend is health especially herbal based foods he lamented that the industry is being held back by authorities that encourage the wrong types of agricultural products the country s farmers should grow kratom or cannabis because they have higher sales value and are a lot better than growing rice which is only encouraged for politicians to gain votes said mr tom there has been no progress in the last 2 3 years in the thai food industry and the country is in the backseat instead of leading he said mr tom criticised current authority figures as stuck in the 18th century of thai farming thailand is always ready to lead the world in the food industry we just need better policies he said mr tom said kratom is a us 2 billion industry as a dietary supplement for anxiety alzheimer s disease and sleep disorders in the us while indonesia has pounced on this market thailand is unable to because of obstacles put up by the public health ministry for kratom production he said another product the country has failed to capitalise on is called thai sticks a valued cannabis strain native to thailand said mr tom he also shared an anecdote about his interaction with an american who said a strain of coffee from nan province is highly valuable and would sell well but it is difficult to develop the production facilities because of government regulations on shipping the product thailand is ready to go we just need the right policies and mindset from authorities for this to happen mr tom said as an example he said nr instant produce plc a food distributor under gth is involved in elon musk s project to colonise mars and create food on the planet mr tom the food industry is being held back by authorities encouraging the wrong products consumers more emotional mr paisarn head of bistro asia co the operator of baan suriyasai hyde seek and so asean said with the global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 according to un data food consumption will definitely rise estimates project by 2050 food consumption will increase by 70 he said global food trends are happening in thailand including food for health food for sustainability and food for culture said mr paisarn consumers eating behaviour changed during the pandemic with demand for food delivery growing greatly restaurant operators have to develop food products that mesh with the delivery channel in terms of product quality freshness and sustainable packaging he said consumers not only look at food as nourishment but also develop an emotional attachment to products that are good for the earth and society the world is moving towards the ideology of green this word has many meanings including sustainability and environmental friendliness said mr paisarn the restaurant greenery concept is an upcoming trend where consumers desire to feel good about saving the world and feel close to nature as they value trees leaves and animals as friends he said there is still a vast opportunity for organic products in the market everybody loves to eat organic products but how do they know they are really organic business owners need to be transparent about their organic products said mr paisarn there are many plots of farmland that plant organic products in thailand but farmers still cannot sell their output the government should support these farmers through marketing and helping to set higher product prices because of the higher cost of planting he said mr paisarn said the thai food industry could become the world s kitchen if some regulations are unlocked the government offers serious funding for research and allows freer competition mr paisarn food consumption is expected to increase by 70 in 2050 more linkages to create a brighter future for food businesses in thailand the public and private sectors need to connect food development with technological innovations safety issues and even soft power said mr santi consumer behaviour is changing so businesses cannot think of food as merely a way to bolster human energy he said population growth will determine future food demand as will changes in people s lifestyles such as those caused by the pandemic and the shift to an ageing society said mr santi he believes people will be more aware of health and safety issues when they buy food as many of them can afford to pay for healthy premium food this trend aligns with improved efforts to protect the environment said mr santi technologies will also play an increasing role in developing the food of the future he said digital technology robotics artificial intelligence the metaverse and even blockchain technology can all support food development said mr santi a connection can also be made between food and the creative economy which can promote thai cultural products and services through the use of soft power thai food is among many well known cultural products he said mr santi suggested the government come up with clear food development plans utilising a food database and infrastructure to better support manufacturers we need the government s financial support funds should not be limited to loans from financial institutions or fundraising in the stock market he said small and medium sized enterprises especially need support in order to grow in future food related businesses said mr santi
ollie smith now you may know him as the u s financier who made an enemy of vladimir putin in the early 2000s with investments in gazprom bill browder wowed the audience at morningstar s investment conference last year and a few months later he is back in the u k studio to talk to me about the situation on the ground in ukraine vladimir putin himself and his new book bill i m really excited to meet you thank you very much for making the time to come in would you agree first and foremost that the military situation in ukraine has been a disaster for vladimir putin bill browder total disaster putin thought he was going to roll in within two days the ukrainians would capitulate zelensky would flee and that they would raise the russian flag in kyiv he had no anticipation of what he and his military had in store the ukrainians have had eight years of training for this everyone says this war started on feb 24 but this war didn t start on feb 24 this war started in 2014 in 2014 russia illegally annexed crimea and then russia sent in mercenaries to fight in eastern ukraine and one of the big sins that we have played in the west is to somehow put that situation in eastern ukraine in some weird little box that we call them russian backed separatists and somehow it s not a war it s not a russian invasion of ukraine it has been a russian invasion of ukraine and for the ukrainians they have spent the last eight years getting up to snuff when it comes to fighting russians and so they might have been terrible their military was a disaster in 2014 when they had faced the first russian invasion smith but not anymore browder now they are fully war weary hardcore soldiers and they know how to fight and they re fighting for a much better cause than the russians are fighting for they re fighting for their home their freedom their children whereas the russians don t even know what they re fighting for smith ok we ll come on to vladimir putin in just a second but do you attribute that military failure to an intelligence failure specifically or a cult of personality failure what s gone wrong specifically there browder well what s gone wrong is that russia is the most corrupt country in the world every government agency every ministry every department 80 of the money is stolen by the person in charge of that department and it s no different for the military as it is for the ministry of finance or the ministry of fuel and energy and so you have this situation where it s like this mafia fiefdom and all the money was stolen from the military i ve heard these incredible stories where russian soldiers have gone into ukraine with their tanks and without even fighting the ukrainians have offered them 25 000 personally for the tank which costs 2 million and they take the money smith almost like the privatization of russia in the first place it was a bargain browder exactly and why are they taking the money because the soldiers haven t been paid and those are the guys making the big money the little money comes from selling the gas out of the gas tank of the tanks so they run out of gas before they even make it into ukraine or on the highway smith there are all sorts of micro conflicts going on underneath the military browder well it just doesn t work the whole thing doesn t work and so you ve got a bunch of people who are not motivated where the situation is totally corrupt where the planes can t fly because they ve sold all the spare parts on the migs to the indian military who also use the migs who have a very effective air force and so putin with all of his chest thumping and grandiosity had sent in a totally hollowed out military to fight a war against people who are absolutely trained up ready to die for their country and it s been a total disaster for russia smith coming on to the topic of vladimir putin you ll be aware of the rumors circulating around his state of mind and indeed his physical health the sense that perhaps something has gone dreadfully awry for him personally what s your understanding of vladimir putin the person here his isolation perhaps his mindset browder well so on the one hand his behavior is totally different than his previous behavior before he always kept one foot in the civilized world with gerhard schröder as his friend and silvio berlusconi and hosting the world cup and all those kind of stuff going to davos on the other hand he was murdering invading countries bombing civilians and he was able to keep these two things in balance the main thing that s different now is him taking entirely the foot out of the civilized world and going fully into the criminal world having said that he has always had a history of being a mass murderer a terrible criminal and somebody where this is not inconsistent with his behavior i mean just how did vladimir putin come to power smith via the kgb and his browder well he came to power very specifically by setting up a number of domestic terrorist incidents where a bunch of apartment buildings were bombed in moscow and it turned out that one of the apartment buildings didn t get bombed and they caught fsb agents his secret police agents planting the bomb what was the purpose of these bombs to blame it on the chechens and to start a war in chechnya so that his approval ratings could go up as being a tough wartime president and so the original sin of his presidency was a domestic terrorist attack killing hundreds of russians to justify a war to kill tens of thousands of chechens smith and here we are again browder exactly and so is it abnormal has he changed has he gone insane no this is vladimir putin from the very beginning smith do you think he is ill personally browder yes he was mentally ill from the very beginning he s a psychopath smith and physically do you think he is looking for some kind of final last hurrah before the inevitable end browder no i think he has been a mentally ill man from the very beginning he is a psychopath he doesn t have any capacity for empathy his heart doesn t start beating faster if someone was being tortured to death in front of him his closest comparable is hannibal lecter the only difference is he was a cannibal and putin doesn t enjoy human flesh but otherwise the same character and that s what putin is is he sicker now than he was before no he is just more scared now what motivated him to go into ukraine i believe is fear that something will come along and some fire would get started and it would engulf him and his administration and he would end up losing power i think that s what he was worried about smith ok browder he watched the same thing happen in january in kazakhstan a dictator who had been there longer than him was engulfed in a weekend because they raised gas prices and putin saw that he saw lukashenko who fabricated an election in belarus almost lose power and putin said i need a war like he started his presidency to stay in power and that s what ukraine is all about smith so just finally on putin specifically is there any way back here i mean can he somehow stick his foot back in the civilized camp browder no the president of the united states has declared him to be a butcher a war criminal and a mass murderer smith where does that end then with his head on a stick or browder well it ends one of two ways there is the kim jong un scenario where he carries on with a pariah state making life worse and worse for the average russian and flexing his muscles and intimidating the west until the end of his natural life or the alternative is that the ukrainians win this war the russians won t tolerate a loser as president and they will take care of him we don t have to do anything smith so high stakes then well moving on to the topic of speaking out about this because you ve been very vocal historically about this but you ve also endured some quite considerable personal cost in doing so i mean your speech to morningstar investment conference last year talked about trumped up charges and a bogus arrest warrant from interpol and being arrested in spain you ve got your new book out i want to ask you about the book but first and foremost i want to know what do you consider the personal cost to be here potentially do you feel as though that you consciously carry a risk to your career or to your life in talking about russia browder my career is long gone my life is at risk i ve been threatened with death with kidnapping eight interpol arrest warrants i have been sentenced in two russian cases to 18 years in a russian prison camp in absentia they ve tried extraditing me from the u k they sent teams of surveillance specialists and investigators to track my movements it s a damn scary life i have to live doing this but it s all been motivated by the murder of my lawyer sergei magnitsky back in 2009 he uncovered a massive government corruption scheme putin corruption scheme he exposed it and he was arrested tortured and killed and since then i wasn t ready to let that go and i ve been on a mission getting justice for sergei that led to the magnitsky act being passed which freezes assets of putin and his cronies and that s led to his basically signing a fatwa for me a putin fatwa going after me and trying to destroy me in any way he could smith tell me a little bit more about the book then i mean what s the motivation specifically behind the book browder this is my second book it s called freezing order my first book was called red notice the first book tracks my career and my life up until things turned bad in russia and then afterwards it talks about how sergei magnitsky discovered this crime exposed it was arrested tortured and killed and it ends with the passage of the magnitsky act my second book the new book is all about going after the money the 230 million that sergei magnitsky discovered was stolen from the government and figuring out where that money went and as we peeled the onion and went through this investigation we discovered all sorts of officials got this money and vladimir putin got some of this money and then the book describes all the different ways in which vladimir putin tried to stop me and everybody around me including killing more people trying to kill more people arresting people arresting me leading right up to interfering in the u s presidential election and trying to get donald trump elected smith sure finally bill thank you very very much for coming in could i ask for your reflection on the next six months it s been roughly six months since your speech to the morningstar investment conference what do you expect in the next half year browder well the first thing is i don t expect the war to end the ukrainians are not going to give up their territory and putin is not going to go into reverse gear so what does that lead us to putin is a guy who cannot accept humiliation and he has been humiliated so what does he do he escalates how does he escalate i can t say specifically because i don t know but something much worse than what we ve seen so far he is unable to confront the ukrainians militarily in a very effective way and so the easy thing to do is just to go after defenseless people civilians and so i think the next step in his conflict is a much much worse massacre than anything we ve seen before smith so in that sense then any sort of short term news of strategic offensives within ukraine could just be a holding pattern for something much worse browder that s my prediction smith ok bill thank you very very much for your time today for more on ukraine and the impacts on financial markets check out any of morningstar s websites across the world until next time i ve been ollie smith for morningstar read more browder s perspective in autocracy is a bad investment
lower numbers in the company s first quarter earnings report concerned investors what happened align technology algn 3 25 saw its shares plummet 25 this week according to data from s p global market intelligence the stock is down more than 53 so far this year it had a 52 week high of 737 45 and a low of 270 37 it closed at 360 57 last friday and hit a weekly low of 304 66 on thursday the company makes and sells both invisalign clear aligners and itero intraoral scanners and services for orthodontists and general dentists its two segments are clear aligner and scanners and services so what the company released its first quarter earnings report after the market closed on wednesday align s numbers while mostly up year over year were all down compared to the fourth quarter a worrying trend investors may also have been spooked when the company withdrew its guidance for the time being align reported revenue of 973 2 million down 5 6 sequentially the company s earnings per share eps of 1 70 were down from 2 40 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2 51 in the first quarter of last year the company had net income of 168 7 million which was down 29 7 sequentially and 33 year over year ceo joe hogan said there were several factors for the drop covid lockdowns particularly in china weaker consumer confidence in the united states inflationary pressures and the russia ukraine conflict the problem for align is that its products are considered discretionary health spending and that s one of the first places consumers look to cut back when they tighten their belts now what investors will want to see if the first quarter numbers are an aberration or the start of a trend for the healthcare stock align s scanners and services segment was hit particularly hard in the first quarter with a 24 2 drop in revenue sequentially the first quarter however is often a slower one for capital expenditures by dentists and orthodontists so that segment could easily bounce back meanwhile the company s larger segment clear aligner was only down 7 sequentially and up 7 5 year over year more concerning is the drop in the company s margins the past two quarters perhaps due to inflation in the third quarter of 2021 the profit margin was 25 7 but in the fourth quarter it was down to 21 4 and in the first quarter of 2022 it was 20 4

the market was up sharply during the regular session but what will tomorrow bring the stock market delivered an extremely strong rebound on thursday as investors seemed to decide that the selling pressure that financial markets had faced over the past several weeks had been overdone gains for the major market indexes ranged from less than 2 for the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 to more than 3 for the nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 with the s p 500 gspc 1 20 landing in the middle index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 85 614 s p 500 2 47 104 nasdaq 3 06 383 as has been the case all week most investors paid closest attention to the news coming out of the after hours trading session late this afternoon apple aapl 2 19 and amazon com amzn 1 35 were among the companies reporting their latest financial results and the two tech bellwethers served as a key indicator of what investors should expect in friday s stock market session and for much of the rest of 2022 apple keeps setting records shares of apple were down a bit more than 1 in the after hours session giving back a portion of the stock s 4 gains during the regular trading session the company s latest quarterly results showed continued success for the business overall although some pockets of weakness gave some shareholders a bit of anxiety about what the future could bring apple s results for the fiscal second quarter ending march 26 featured solid growth revenue rose 9 year over year to 97 3 billion which was a record figure for this part of the calendar year net income rose a more modest 6 to 25 01 billion and that translated into earnings of 1 52 per share apple s various businesses saw varying degrees of growth on the services side revenue was higher by 17 to 19 8 billion but that was slightly slower than apple has seen in recent quarters meanwhile product sales were up almost 7 year over year gross margin improved but a 19 rise in operating expenses kept bottom line gains somewhat in check apple pointed to the iphone and mac segments as well as its wearables home and accessories business as standing out leaving out the ipad as a potential drag on results nevertheless with many having feared that apple would fare much worse shareholders took the news relatively well and a 5 boost to the dividend and a new 90 billion stock buyback plan was icing on the cake for investors amazon gives up ground shares of amazon com didn t do nearly as well the stock was down more than 12 in after hours trading following its first quarter financial release the numbers from amazon told the story net sales were up 7 to 116 4 billion even after accounting for a 2 percentage point hit from currency impacts however operating income was down substantially from year ago levels falling from 8 9 billion a year ago to just 3 7 billion in this year s period moreover a massive charge related to the decline in the value of amazon s holdings in rivian automotive rivn 8 00 stock caused amazon to lose 3 8 billion in the quarter or 7 56 per share amazon s segments told very different pictures north american retail saw sizable sales gains but a bigger jump in operating expenses caused amazon to lose money on an operating basis there international sales were actually lower year over year causing a similar hit however amazon web services remained solidly profitable with segment revenue rising 37 and segment operating income soaring 57 from year ago levels investors also didn t seem comfortable with amazon s second quarter guidance which featured revenue projections of 116 billion to 121 billion and calls for operating results of between a loss of 1 billion and a gain of 3 billion with so much uncertainty and a slowdown in growth amazon is finally seeing the anticipated slowdown following a time of extremely sharp sales and profit gains during the initial years of the covid 19 pandemic

former bethel worship leader sean feucht has been leading disney protests because of its opposition to florida s parental rights in education law now he s challenging christians to cancel their disney subscriptions and step out and make their own content in a video interview with the christian post feucht said he believes disney really overplayed their hand adding it s one thing when you re inserting gay characters into cartoons it s another thing when you re trying to fight for the sexualization of children in schools the florida law which critics derisively called the don t say gay bill prohibits public schools from circumventing parental rights and prohibits teachers from discussing gender ideology and sexual orientation with children in kindergarten through the third grade parents can sue teachers and school districts that violate the law get our latest news for free subscribe to get daily weekly email with the top stories plus special offers from the christian post be the first to know subscribe initially disney s ceo bob chapek didn t publicly comment on the bill and was swiftly condemned by lgbt activist groups and some employees following the backlash he swiftly released a statement saying the bill should never have been signed into law our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that chapek added we are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of lgbtq members of the disney family as well as the lgbtq community in florida and across the country in response to disney s commitment to lgbt activism feucht told cp that he feels like i m speaking on behalf of millions of americans that this is not ok for all other christians and believers out there it s time that we rise up and say enough is enough said feucht we cannot allow our children to be sexualized we cannot allow perverts to indoctrinate them starting at 4 years old in kindergarten with transgenderism and all the crazy stuff that s coming from the left it s time for us to rise up and hold the line chapek who used to donate to political campaigns said he now plans to give millions of dollars to lgbt causes feucht offered suggestions for people who want to take action in response to disney s position and advised that americans cancel their disney plus membership and quit renewing their disney park passes stop feeding the economic engine that is disney if it s going to be hijacked by woke corporate elitists that want to shove this stuff down our kids faces he declared as someone who once enjoyed disney entertainment feucht said it s disappointing that the company had taken this route in many ways it s a bummer because we have the nostalgia of all the memories watching the movies and theme parks and stuff like that he said the revivalist is encouraging christians to curate their own entertainment i think this gives an opportunity for believers to rise up and create content let s not leave that to the world to disciple and raise our kids let s be the ones that can create content and parks and movies and films and stuff like that in one sense it s a bummer but in another sense it presents an incredible opportunity for believers out there in the industry to rise up and create alternatives that are wholesome and that are safe that really even all of america can embrace feucht has held a few protests at disney headquarters in disneyland in california in recent months and he is now gearing up to host an event at disney world in lake buena vista florida in may according to feucht the hold the line protests are intended to encourage parents to protect their children and fight back in part by boycotting disney at the events the activist and his team can be seen worshiping praying and making declarations they re asking god to intervene and for parents and believers to be motivated to cut ties with the entertainment giant since the protest began disney has increased its promotional content with feucht telling cp the behemoth is just doubling down on its social media outreach they are really pushing advertising because the hashtag disneygroomers and stuff like that has been trending feucht said so they re trying to combat that through advertising dollars they re pushing their parks and doing discounts at different things they re digging their own grave i think their earnings are down probably 20 percent in the stock market he added so if we can hit them hard enough then the shareholders and other people will rise up and hopefully bring a change i think that s our longterm goal here in response to those that think feucht s protests are motivated by hatred toward the lgbt community he responded by telling cp that he s doing this out of love for his children this is motivated toward my love for my kids he maintained i think anybody that can t see that needs a big heart check i don t know why the left is so infatuated with talking to children about sex it s weird it s perverted it s deranged and we need to call it what it is i will die fighting for my kids feucht declared i m not in this for me to look good i m not in this for credibility i m in this to fight for my kids he continued those that don t have kids need to understand that when you become a parent your primary role is to protect your children that s what really motivates me this is driven out of my love for my kids to get their innocence would not be stolen the father of four is also the founder of the let us worship movement which was launched to protest the ongoing covid 19 lockdowns that restricted in person worship in indoor and outdoor gatherings feucht who ran for congress in 2020 to represent california s 3rd congressional district but lost and has since become known for his worship gathering in cities nationwide said he will not stop until he sees the kingdoms of this earth become the kingdoms of our lord jesus said pray that this place would look like that place that we could use our life and our breath and our work and our passions to see heaven come to earth in all different areas he declared as he travels from city to city and state to state most recently in north carolina he witnessed hundreds of people give their lives to jesus that s the kind of thing that really motivates me and we re starting to see that more and more across the nation feucht added he also encouraged parents to sign the stand with parents petition feucht s next hold the line event will be held on may 16 on friday gov ron desantis signed a bill that will end disney s special tax district that allows the company to govern the land for its disney world theme park
the u s economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter according to gross domestic product data released on april 28 2022 while the reasons were technical and weren t seen as signs of weakness they add to worries that the u s might be headed for another recession as the federal reserve seeks to fight inflation by raising interest rates but before we fret too much about what 2022 will bring i believe as a financial economist who studies the decisions people and companies make with money and the resulting impacts it s worth reflecting on 2021 which saw the strongest economic growth in almost four decades gdp which provides a snapshot of the economy by measuring the total value of all goods and services consumers produce and exchange surged 5 7 in 2021 after accounting for inflation the fastest pace since 1984 so who benefited from all this growth record gains in american net worth a useful way to assess how economic growth affects individuals is by looking at personal financial wealth this is measured by net worth or the difference between what someone owns and owes by that measure it s likely that the vast majority of americans are better off than they were in 2020 or even before the covid 19 pandemic meaning they have less debt relative to their assets this is in no small part thanks to the trillions of dollars in pandemic related spending by the u s government overall americans net worth increased by over us 18 trillion during 2021 to 142 trillion likely the biggest increase ever it amounts to an average gain of almost 55 000 for every american the wealthiest got most of that of course the average hides tremendous variation across groups it s already been thoroughly reported that billionaires saw their wealth soar during the pandemic this was driven largely by double digit gains in the value of their stock holdings and businesses while their liabilities grew only 1 in 2021 the wealthiest 1 of americans saw their net worth grow 6 7 trillion to about 46 trillion making up well over a third of the overall gains another 6 2 trillion went to the next 9 meanwhile just 1 5 trillion went to the bottom 50 but those in the bottom half grew the fastest the richest may have gotten the most but the net wealth of the bottom half jumped at the fastest pace the bottom 50 saw their wealth grow 64 in 2021 that s the biggest calendar year growth of any of these groups since at least 1988 dwarfing the percentage gains of the richest this happened largely because homeowners saw real estate assets grow a lot faster than mortgage debts while these changes are positive for americans both on average and in general this has not changed the overall distribution of wealth that much the bottom half of americans accounted for 5 5 of the country s assets before the pandemic and at the end of 2021 owned 5 9 though this is the highest level since 2013 it still lags behind levels it saw during the 1990s when the share rose to nearly 9 white people gained most but still saw share fall similar to the income level story most of the gains went to white americans who saw their net wealth soar 14 5 trillion in 2021 to 119 trillion black americans gained 1 3 trillion and hispanics saw growth of 683 billion but the percentage gains were highest for people of color 26 for african americans and 24 for hispanics that compares with 14 for white americans as a result the overall share held by white people fell to 83 6 the lowest since at least 1988 and very likely the lowest ever black net wealth increased to 4 4 of the pie the most since 1992 hispanics held 2 5 of total u s net wealth for context non hispanic white americans make up about 60 of the population versus 13 4 for black americans and 18 5 for hispanic or latino americans what happens next as economic growth slows is hard to say a large chunk of the coronavirus related aid went to poorer americans which helps explain the gains for the bottom 50 as well as for black people and latinos that aid has now ended still the market for workers remains on fire with unemployment at 3 6 at the end of march 2022 near a half century low and economists have been forecasting pretty solid growth will this strong economic growth continue count me as one economist hoping americans continue benefiting from improving job prospects to build wealth even as the economic picture gets a bit cloudier

photo nelson bennett cn ceo tracy robinson discusses railway supply chain issues with cofi ceo susan yurkovich at cofi conference with russia s war in ukraine runaway inflation and rising interest rates analysts and economists speaking at a council of forest industries cofi conference thursday were openly dropping the r word by the end of this year or early 2023 europe at least and possibly north america could be in a recession some are now predicting that would normally be bad news for canada s forestry industry but demand for new housing is so strong in the u s that paul jannke principal for forest economic advisors said he expects demand for lumber in the u s will remain strong even with an economic contraction due to an underbuild of 4 million housing units and aging housing stock while we have a slowdown these markets still remain very very strong jannke said and the loss of lumber imports from russia will likely mean increased demand for canadian lumber in non china asian countries we do see room for an increase in exports to non china for north america jannke said we re calling for it to occur in 2023 he said he expects lumber prices to be in the high us 500 per thousand board feet range in 2023 that s lower than what prices have been for the last couple of years but still very high prices relative to history we do see prices coming off some next year as the markets weaken but we think that prices are still going to remain high jannke said the average age of homes in the u s is 45 years jannke said even with interest rates of 5 to 6 jannke said it s entirely possible that demand for new home construction will remain strong in the u s even in a high interest rate recessionary period in 2021 u s new housing starts were expected to be 2 2 million but there were only 1 6 million new housing starts leaving an underbuild we just simply couldn t build it because of the supply side jannke said in a typical recession u s housing starts would fall to 1 2 million but even if there is an economic contraction jannke said u s housing starts are expected to be 1 6 million this year and next we have fundamentally strong demand over the next decade based on age class distribution of our population based on pent up demand based on the age of the housing stock but also on the reshoring of our manufacturing jannke said while market fundamentals bode well for b c forestry products there remains a laundry list of challenges domestically for b c lumber and pulp and paper producers from continued logistical pinch points to provincial policies and regulations that deter investment at the end of march canfor corp announced plans to reduce operations at all of its sawmills in western canada and to extend a curtailment at its pulp mill in taylor citing extreme supply chain challenges related to rail transportation tracy robinson the new ceo for canadian national railway acknowledged thursday that cn has seemed less than dependable recently let s be frank she said the business relationship between cn and this industry has been strained with all these supply chain challenges there have been times when your sector has felt that cn was less

photo nelson bennett cn ceo tracy robinson discusses railway supply chain issues with cofi ceo susan yurkovich at cofi conference with russia s war in ukraine runaway inflation and rising interest rates analysts and economists speaking at a council of forest industries cofi conference thursday were openly dropping the r word by the end of this year or early 2023 europe at least and possibly north america could be in a recession some are now predicting that would normally be bad news for canada s forestry industry but demand for new housing is so strong in the u s that paul jannke principal for forest economic advisors said he expects demand for lumber in the u s will remain strong even with an economic contraction due to an underbuild of 4 million housing units and aging housing stock while we have a slowdown these markets still remain very very strong jannke said and the loss of lumber imports from russia will likely mean increased demand for canadian lumber in non china asian countries we do see room for an increase in exports to non china for north america jannke said we re calling for it to occur in 2023 he said he expects lumber prices to be in the high us 500 per thousand board feet range in 2023 that s lower than what prices have been for the last couple of years but still very high prices relative to history we do see prices coming off some next year as the markets weaken but we think that prices are still going to remain high jannke said the average age of homes in the u s is 45 years jannke said even with interest rates of 5 to 6 jannke said it s entirely possible that demand for new home construction will remain strong in the u s even in a high interest rate recessionary period in 2021 u s new housing starts were expected to be 2 2 million but there were only 1 6 million new housing starts leaving an underbuild we just simply couldn t build it because of the supply side jannke said in a typical recession u s housing starts would fall to 1 2 million but even if there is an economic contraction jannke said u s housing starts are expected to be 1 6 million this year and next we have fundamentally strong demand over the next decade based on age class distribution of our population based on pent up demand based on the age of the housing stock but also on the reshoring of our manufacturing jannke said while market fundamentals bode well for b c forestry products there remains a laundry list of challenges domestically for b c lumber and pulp and paper producers from continued logistical pinch points to provincial policies and regulations that deter investment at the end of march canfor corp announced plans to reduce operations at all of its sawmills in western canada and to extend a curtailment at its pulp mill in taylor citing extreme supply chain challenges related to rail transportation tracy robinson the new ceo for canadian national railway acknowledged thursday that cn has seemed less than dependable recently

james s brady press briefing room 3 16 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone good afternoon okay two items for all of you at the top today we released a report highlighting the historic small business boom under the biden harris administration last year americans applied to start 5 4 million new businesses 20 percent more than any year on record and small businesses are creating more jobs than ever before and it s been particularly strong for entrepreneurs of color for example hispanic entrepreneurs started new businesses in 2021 at the fastest rate in more than a decade 23 percent faster than pre pandemic levels you heard the president say this today but this approach is in stark contrast to congressional republicans tax plan which would raise taxes by an average of almost 1 200 on nearly half of small business owners not only does president biden reject congressional republicans plans to increase taxes on half of small business owners he also has an economic strategy to keep the small business boom going including expanding access to capital making historic investments in technical assistance programs to help entrepreneurs identify resources leveraging federal procurement to direct hundreds of billions in government contracts to small businesses and leveling the playing field for small business owners to reforming the tax code i also wanted to note that today the food and drug administration announced two proposed rules one to prohibit menthol cigarettes and one to prohibit flavor flavored cigars the rules announced today would enforce regulations related to what stores sell and what companies manufacture and distribute which is a critical critical action to prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers help adult smokers quit and significantly reduce tobacco related health disparities with that why don t you kick us off q hello i have two questions about student loan forgiveness first off has the president concluded that he has the power to do this unilaterally and secondly does he believe that means testing is the correct approach to student loan forgiveness ms psaki well there s been no conclusion of any process internally yet but you heard the president talk this morning about his ongoing consideration of how to provide additional relief to many americans who are still still have student loans even though they have not paid a penny on federal student loans since he took office and what was the second part of your question q has he decided if he wants to do means testing ms psaki so he has talked in the past about how you know he doesn t believe that that millionaires and billionaires obviously should benefit or even people from the highest income so that s certainly something he would be looking at q so i just want to be very clear about the power to do this he s looking at doing this issue ms psaki yeah q but you re not saying if he s going to send a bill to congress or he s actually going to do it himself ms psaki well we definitely know he has the ability and the the legal ability to sign a bill congress passes q sure ms psaki so what we re really talking about is authorities through executive action which we re continuing to look at and he s continuing to consider q and lastly what concerns does he have about the growing cost of college you know obviously the cost of college has been rising very quickly this would reduce borrowers out of pocket costs so they don t have to pay down some of their debt but what about that cost of the education up front ms psaki well it from the beginning of his administration and i would say through the course of his career he has expressed an interest on the increasing cost of college and the barriers that that poses to people getting a two year or four year education he has taken a number of steps already since he took office to bring down costs for americans including bringing down the cost of college the american rescue plan provided nearly 40 billion in higher education relief for colleges and universities much of which was earmarked for emergency financial aid to help students to make college more affordable for college and for current and future students he also called for and congress passed a 400 increase in the maximum pell grant the largest increase in over a decade and additionally we have now approved the cancellation of more than 18 5 billion in student loan debt for more than 750 000 borrowers so while he s continuing to consider what executive actions he could take using his own authority even though if congress sent him a bill tomorrow he could sign it and he would sign it to give 10 000 of student debt relief we ve also he has not hesitated and has also taken additional steps q and the final question a response to republicans like senator romney who say this is a political giveaway to consider canceling student student loan debt ms psaki i would say you know the president s view is that as the leader of the country what he needs to do is continue to provide relief to people who need it most to help people get some extra breathing room and that includes getting people con this consideration of getting people relief who have taken steps to further their education and maybe take steps to advance their their family circumstances go ahead q thanks switching gears to title 42 the president said today that the administration would comply with whatever the courts decide so just to be clear there s not a plan to fight this decision ms psaki that would be a decision made by the department of justice but they haven t even done a formal ruling that they re considering at this point in time q but there s the temporary restri the tro so at this point the administration is doesn t have anything to announce in terms of fighting this ms psaki they verbally did the tro they have not done i don t believe a more formal written one that has been looked at or considered by the department of justice at this point in time q does the president disagree with this ruling ms psaki again it s the department of justice to look at this the president has talked about how he would the authority is given to the cdc to make a decision about when the conditions exist to lift title 42 they made that decision and he certainly supports that and that s why we re preparing to lift it through the department of homeland security and an interagency process q but if the cdc determined like you just said the order was no longer necessary then it wouldn t make sense to fight to not fight this to let that just stand ms psaki well the department of justice would make that decision there hasn t even been a formal issuing by the court it s been a verbal report they said they would need to look at that they would make any announcement about any legal action q and i just want to ask you we just continue to hear these democratic senators that were briefed this week cortez masto was the latest she was briefed by the administration and said that even though you ve been saying there s this comprehensive plan to deal with the border after title 42 is lifted she has not seen a comprehensive plan she said she did not hear a comprehensive plan on how they are going to address the surge or the resources needed to make sure we are addressing the drug trafficking across the border so your response to her and just big picture why democrats aren t united on this ms psaki i can t speak for all democrats i can tell you that we share the frustration about how broken our immigration system is and how there need to be fixes at the border whether that is smarter security funding or fixing the asylum processing system that s long been broken and we would welcome the interest of any democrat or republican to work with us on that effort and talk about and work for it work on moving forward the bill the president proposed on his first day in office secretary mayorkas who oversees this of course has been testifying i think he has four he s testifying to four committees including the house judiciary committee today and he laid out six pillars of our plan including components that address exactly those specific pieces how we would surge resources personnel transportation medical support how we re enhancing cbp processing how we re administrating administering consequences for unlawful entry how we re bolstering the capacity of nongovernmental organizations what we re doing to target and disrupt the transnational criminal organizations and how we re going to deter irregular migration but this is not an immigration policy this is how we re implementing the lifting of title 42 so we need a longer term more comprehensive immigration reform policy and we d welcome any efforts to work with that with members of congress go ahead q thanks jen the request for 33 billion how quickly do you expect it will move through congress and when is the deadline for when you absolutely need it ms psaki i m not here to set new deadlines but i can tell you that both needs are urgent well the i would say that need is urgent as is the need for covid funding is urgent in terms of where we are with with spending just to give you a sense of of the money that we ve already we ve already allocated or already been giving putting on the ground to the ukrainians in the form of military assistance i stumbled through that a little bit as you know we had 3 5 billion in military security assistance we have about 250 million of that left in drawdown so obviously we will work to expedite that and provide that to the ukrainians but in order to continue to help assist them help make sure they have the the weapons they need the artillery they need the equipment they need it is certainly urgent to move forward on this funding q and what is your view on why the economy shrunk 1 4 percent during the first quarter ms psaki so gdp which is what that s a measure of measures a couple of different components of economic data consumption investment inventory and exports on a number of these these data components we had very positive signs in this same set of data including consumption consumer spending was up by about 2 5 percent on investment business investment residential investment both up as well and on exports the number was down but that is largely because our economy is doing better than many economies around the world so while we were purchasing a lot of goods from other countries there wasn t the same capacity to purchase our goods that is that is why that number was was lower and then on inventory which is another piece of data that is measured quarter four of last year had the largest inventory number of any quarter in history in large part because as the supply chain problems were being fixed thanks in large part to the president s efforts businesses were able to get goods and they made enormous purchases largest numbers to stock their inventory of any quarter in history and this what this data is measuring is changes in growth from quarter to quarter so because of that even though this was the fifth largest inventory quarter in history in comparison with the fourth quarter of last year it showed a decrease which led to the to the number but what what economists many economists jason furman has spoken to this and others what they look at as measures of the strength of the economy and what they re monitoring closely from quarter to quarter as important indicators are consumer spending business investment residential investment all of these increased at strong rates in the first quarter and as did the overall demand and are good signs for the strength of the economy q and lastly to what extent are you looking at cutting tariffs on chinese goods as a way to ease inflation ms psaki well there s an ongoing review of that led by ambassador tai at ustr and we are certainly continuing to look at where these tariffs put in place by the prior administration don t make sense and one of the factors that we re looking at as a part of this review is certainly the impact on jobs and wages and of course on inflation but we re also looking at and costs of course of goods but we re also looking at where we have concerns about the economic policies and approaches of china but i don t have anything to preview at this point in terms of how that review is going go ahead q just one point of clarification does the president want this funding for ukraine tied to the covid 19 funding ms psaki we re not making a predetermination of that from here we put forward both of these funding requests today because they re both vital they re both important we need them both to help the ukrainians and to help ensure we re continuing our covid programs here in this country and around the world but we re not going to predetermine for congress how they move forward there is just an urgency in moving them forward q okay it was just confusing because in his letter to congress he seemed to say he did want it tied to the covid 19 funding but he told reporters he didn t care if it was tied to the covid 19 funding ms psaki that was not the intention of how it was written it was intended just to convey we re moving we re putting these both forward today q okay so you re not so the white house is not saying that it should be tied to the covid 19 funding ms psaki no we re saying these are both urgent we would like to move these forward we ll work with you to determine how to get that done q okay and you said you don t want to put a deadline on when congress needs to pass and authorize this 33 billion request that the president has made but how many more weeks can ukraine go based on what they have so far and based on the drawdown authority that the president still has before you do start to see interruptions in military aid and economic assistance and humanitarian aid ms psaki well i would say because we have 250 million left q that s not very much though compared to what you re asking for ms psaki i know i m i m getting i m getting to your point i m getting to the point here you know there s obviously more that s needed and we want to be able to continue to provide a range of security and military assistance to the ukrainians now we strategically frontloaded the military and security assistance we were providing a couple of weeks ago expedited the delivery of it because we knew that as russia was repositioning in the east and really re re changing their strategic approach to focus on the donbas they would need that on the front end so it doesn t mean that it will be exactly the same pace and every week but certainly there is an urgency to getting this funding done there has been bipartisan through there has been bipartisan support in the past and we re certainly looking forward to working with them to get this done as quickly as possible q and it would seem to suggest that there is a timeline since officials told reporters today briefing it that they believe this is enough for ukraine for the next five months to last through the end of the fiscal year which of course that would start in a few days if you re judging on a five months timeline ms psaki well that s a different that s a different question than a timeline for getting the package done i mean we did this on a fiscal year basis because that seemed to make sense of course and also because we wanted to do it over the long term for planning purposes but it doesn t mean that the funding would be delivered tomorrow obviously we have to get it through and move it through congress and we want to do that as quickly as possible go ahead q thanks jen a quick follow on student loans today the president said that he is not considering the 50 000 figure that some democrats have pushed for is there a range you can provide for what he is considering is it more than the 10 000 both of you have mentioned before ms psaki he has said that before so today was not the first time he has said that about 50 000 in the past i guess it s been a few months i don t have a top range for you i think he was just reacting to that size of the number he said in the past and i ve reiterated that he would be happy to sign a piece of legislation or a bill that came to his desk that canceled 10 000 in student loans could be more than that we re looking at that but i think 50 000 was just his indication of that size and his opposition to that q got it and then today when he was talking about the supplemental budget he said that nato allies and eu partners are going to pay their fair share of the cost as well how does he define fair share ms psaki i think he was trying to send the message which has already been underway that we are going to continue to give a range of and a significant range amount of military and security assistance but other countries we expect them to continue to step up as well as this is going to be a sustained effort a longer war as we ve talked about before we re going to need other countries to continue to provide a range of assistance as well and we are far and away the united states is the largest provider of military humanitarian and economic assistance and other countries have taken steps i mean germany just announced this week right their their plan or their intention and they may have been delivered to provide tanks something they have never done before a number of other countries have announced steps to provide a range of military assistance and weapons that they have never provided before but it was more the president sending a message about the need for every country to remain committed to this sustained and long term effort to support the ukrainians q but but he s not saying that they should be paying as much as the u s in terms of a monetary figure ms psaki every country is going to be able to provide different amounts and different types of assistance so it s not prejudging that it s just an ask and a reminder and a call to the world that we need to be in this for the long term and we all need to continue to provide a range of assistance q and then one more on paul whelan yesterday i asked you about what his brother said today he himself issued a statement and he is asking why was i left behind he mentioned he s pleased trevor is home with his family but he is asking why hasn t more been done to secure my release what is the administration s response to paul whelan ms psaki i would say that we will continue to do everything possible to bring paul whelan home we are in regular touch with his family and his family members and we don t outline in detail everything we are doing publicly because our objective is to return him home with his family the president is focused on that and we would say to him we we are going to continue to do everything possible to bring you home q can you say whether there has been any progress made in the past two three months on their cases on whelan and brittney griner ms psaki it wouldn t be constructive to outline or detail any specifics from here because our objective is to be successful and talking about these cases publicly and getting into specifics often isn t constructive toward that goal go ahead q jen thank you i wanted to start by asking you a few questions about ukraine the u n secretary general met with president putin he s meeting with president zelenskyy he s trying to strike a deal to get those who are in the steel plant out ukrainian officials were very skeptical of these talks heading into this week does the administration feel as though there s been any progress that has come out of his talks with putin and zelenskyy ms psaki look i would say that it s not for us to make a judgment from here we are here to support the efforts of the ukrainians and the ukrainian leaders to pursue diplomatic talks and diplomatic engagements should they see that as constructive we have not seen evidence that president putin or the russians have taken steps whether it is allowing for humanitarian convoys to move forward humanitarian assistance creating corridors that would give an indication of that but our objective is continue to implement the strategy that we laid out from early in this conflict which is to provide the type of security and military assistance to help the ukrainians fight and win on the battlefield they obviously did that in kyiv in pushing back the russians to give them economic and humanitarian assistance to strengthen their hand in diplomatic talks q against the backdrop of the president s announcement today and request for this 33 billion aid package can you say is it the policy goal of the united states for ukraine to defeat russia ms psaki well look it depends on how you we re not going to define that from here that s for the ukra q how would you define it ms psaki well that s for the ukrainians to define what we are going to do from here is to continue to provide them with a range of security and military assistance as is evidenced by the package that the president proposed and put forward to capitol hill today to strengthen their ne their hand at the negotiating table and ensure that they have the support and backing of the united states and the world q just to be clear and i understand what you re saying it s for the ukrainians to define but does the united states think that success has to include russians leaving all of the new portions of ukraine that they currently invaded ms psaki again we re not going to define that from here kristen there are a range of negotiations that may happen and may take place and we re just not going to get ahead of that q let me ask you about build back better if i might or the remains of build back better ms psaki yeah q given that you are pushing for this new aid given that you are pushing for pandemic aid as well where does that fall right now on the agenda is there urgency to get those priorities passed as well ms psaki absolutely i mean here s the thing about congress and governing you you can and you are able to do more than one thing at one time right just even look at the committees of jurisdiction in congress the committees that are considering and looking at you know some of the military assistance and security packages may not be the same that are considering and writing pieces of legislation on a reconciliation package there is a great deal of interest and passion on capitol hill among democrats in moving forward on the president s agenda and the president s proposal to lower the cost of prescription drugs to lower the cost of childcare of healthcare of eldercare and we re going to continue advocating and fighting for that q in order for it to get done against the backdrop of this election year do you need to have a deal in place by memorial day that has obviously been floated as the deadline ms psaki i m not here to set new deadlines kristen we know there is interest there s passion there s advocacy we re continuing to do a lot of work behind the scenes and we re going to continue to fight to get it done q i know you don t want to talk about deadlines but if you could give us a reality check the president said today he s going to announce something on student loans in just a few weeks you had said that there could potentially be an announcement by august the end of the summer realistically can we expect to hear something from the president in the next few weeks on this ms psaki stay tuned and we ll see obviously we have to continue a policy process the president will make a decision and once we have a decision to make we ll we ll of course announce that what i was getting at really is the end of august is also the time that the student loan payment deferral that s the kind of period that it was extended through so it was more about making a decision before then q okay thanks jen ms psaki we always like to beat timelines here you know so go ahead q thank you jen on student loan debt ms psaki yeah q the committee for a responsible budget has spoken out against this saying they ve done a calculation that canceling 10 000 per borrower would cost 250 billion 50 000 per borrower would cost 950 billion what do you say to people sort of in their camp who are concerned that canceling student debt can have inflationary impact ms psaki well i haven t looked at all those numbers and what incomes they would apply to nor has there been a proposal that the president has put out on this front or anything that s passed through congress but what i would say broadly speaking is that when you look at the choices that need to be made the president is looking at the impact of student loans something that many people in this country millions of americans undertook to get a better education to make sure they were advancing their own knowledge to maybe help their family have a better life that finding ways to provide relief to students to make sure that these working cla working families are getting relief is more important than tax cuts to millionaires billionaires and corporations and we can make choices about where we invest and where we think we can make the tax system more fair but there isn t even a bill that s moved through congress nor have we put a proposal together so i don t those numbers aren t based on any reality at this moment q but broadly speaking is there any concern that you know given this narrative that it could have an inflationary impact that s coming from critics of this administration who are looking at the economy looking at inflation and having problems with where it stands is there a concern that you know canceling student debt could make it hard for the joe manchins of congress to sign on to bills that would you know pass elements of build back better that you guys are still trying to get through which he said he won t do because of inflation ms psaki well i m not going to speak obviously for senator manchin i haven t heard him make that point in the past either what i would say is that the way that inflation impacts people across the country is costs right costs to their bank accounts costs to their budgets and what we re talking about here is how to provide people with relief how they can how we can provide them with relief or consider providing them with relief so that they have more money to spend on things in their lives and providing student loan relief is exactly that and the president has taken a range of steps to address and lower costs for people considering this is one of them extending the pause on student loan payments is one of them but also fixing the glitch the family glitch in the affordable care act is another one of them so when we talk about inflation sometimes we talk about it like you know a 50 000 foot ivory tower economist might and really what in how inflation impacts people is costs and what they re paying out of their pocket so actually considering this would be helping americans address exactly that issue q and then on this new report that the department of homeland security is setting up a disinformation governance board to tackle misinformation ahead of the midterms secretary mayorkas said that part of its intention was to tackle misinformation in hispanic communities especially can you give us an idea of what this board is going to be doing what their authority would look like ms psaki sure jacqui i really haven t dug into this exactly i mean we of course support this effort but let me see if i can get more specifics we know that there has been a range of disinfo out there about a range of topics i mean including covid for example and also elections and eligibility but i will i will check and see if there s more specifics q there s been some criticism of the person who s been chosen to oversee this board she had previously called the hunter biden laptop a trump campaign product seeming to discredit its validity or validity of reporting surrounding that how can you assuage concerns of people who are looking at this person who s been appointed to this position and wondering if she s going to be able to accurately judge misinformation now that a lot of that reporting has been proven to be factual in some ways ms psaki well i don t have any comments on the laptop but what i can tell you is that it sounds like the objective of the board is to prevent disinformation and misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of communities i m not sure who opposes that effort and i don t know who this individual is so i have no comments on it specifically q her name is nina jankowicz she also just recently made some polarizing comments about the twitter elon musk s twitter purchase it s just getting some pushback from critics who are saying this person may not be the right choice for a board that is run by the department of homeland security can you speak to that at all ms psaki i don t have any information about this individual i can check on more information about the board go ahead q how much of the original 13 6 billion for ukraine has actually been spent at this point reporters are still trying to understand the answer to that ms psaki well i noted a little bit earlier i think in response in proactive preemptive response to this question that of the 3 5 billion on security we ve spent 3 25 billion of that already which we have transparently provided regular info to all of you on in terms of the humanitarian and economic assistance a lot of it has been allocated to how it would be spent i can see if we have an update on what has actually gone to ground q okay and secondly on the on the menthol ban some black community activists the aclu members of the cdc have voiced concerns that it could push more of the illicit market which would lead to racially profiling black smokers can this administration ensure that won t happen ms psaki absolutely because this rule would go after manufacturers and people who sell not individuals who smoke menthol cigarettes and it would save lives i d also note that the naacp put out a statement saying for decades the tobacco industry has been targeting african americans and have contributed to the skyrocketing rates of heart disease stroke and cancer across our community the tobacco industry is on a narrow quest for profit and they have been killing us along the way the naacp has been calling for a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored e cigarettes for years now and we applaud the fda s plan but what we re talking about here is this these rules are estimated that it s estimated that eliminating menthol and tobacco products could prevent up to 654 000 deaths over the next 40 years and up to 238 000 deaths among african americans but this is not about going after individuals smoking menthol cigarettes this is about manufacturers and people who are selling them q jen why does president biden believe pro life taxpayers catholics among them q on on inflation q should fund title 10 clinics q excuse me on inflation hey q that advise women on how to get an abortion ms psaki sir we don t q you re going down the row and you re giving these people five and six questions i get one don t i and the people back here too ms psaki i think if you could if you could sit here and be respectful q you give them five to six questions ms psaki of your colleagues here q so again my question is ms psaki that might work better go ahead q why does president biden believe pro life taxpayers ms psaki sir sir q catholics among them ms psaki i think he s the next question go ahead q yes okay so on q should have to fund title 10 clinics that advise women on how to get an abortion simple question q you re being very disrespectful q on the amlo meeting your statement laid out a bunch of domestic issues that would be discussed and regional issues ms psaki yeah q like economic cooperation et cetera i was wondering if the president was planning to raise amlo s attitude towards russia and ukraine he s been really loath to criticize russia and he hasn t really joined this international effort so does the president plan to raise that tomorrow ms psaki you know it s a good question the primary focus of the meeting as you outline is about kind of getting ahead of the summit of the americas talking about the agenda obviously there s a lot to be discussed as it relates to migration and this meeting was planned in advance of our long term planning of the potential lifting of title 42 as well it is often on the president s mind as you know russia and ukraine and the conflict so while it may not be on the preemptive agenda we will have a more comprehensive readout once the meeting is concluded q and then on the gdp report i m just wondering if the contraction has the white house rethinking its support for the fed s plan to raise interest rates ms psaki we continue to support the intention or stated intention of the independent federal reserve to recalibrate and we support that effort i noted a lot of the different data measurements here because i think it s important to note that the inventory piece was not unexpected i mean we actually spoke to it a couple of days ago as well given the record inventory numbers from the fourth quarter of last year and the fact that it measures the comparison and the change of growth from quarter to quarter q and then lastly this has happened while you came out here so you might not have heard about it but senator manchin said at a hearing that he thinks the electric vehicle tax credit quote makes no sense and i m wondering what your reaction to that is and whether you think that further complicates a skinny reconciliation bill getting through ms psaki i would say that senator manchin remains a friend of the president s and someone we will continue to work with and look forward to continuing engagements with go ahead q so again my question why does president biden believe pro life taxpayers catholics among them q okay so earlier you were asked about the economic q should fund title 10 clinics that advise women on having an abortion q you were asked about economic and humanitarian assistance aid amount ms psaki yeah q i m wondering the military aid it seems like the president said has quote basically run out the military i m sorry the humanitarian and economic aid if it has not yet run out could those funds be diverted first from the white house to additional security and military assistance is that something that you all can do is it something you are considering ms psaki i don t believe it s a good question i don t believe that s under consideration in large part because the humanitarian and economic assistance is vital think about the number of the millions of refugees the millions of people who have been become homeless as a result of this or no longer in their homes as a result of this war and there are a range of economic needs that president zelenskyy has spoken about himself about that will be needed over the coming months so that s why there are multiple buckets and that will continue to be the case i m not aware of any consideration of reallocation of funds q and then the other question i was going to ask is in terms of having the 250 military i m sorry 250 million in military assistance that remains could you all essentially spend money on the front side in the coming weeks if congress is unable to pass something recoup it from the supplemental later and if you do that is there a limit how much money you can spend that way upfront ms psaki just so i understand i may have to ask omb this question can we kind of get a line of credit of sorts q correct exactly ms psaki okay to to kind of purchase or things along those lines let me check and see with our budgetary experts no one knows more than how this works than shalanda young so i will check with her and get back to you q and the last question i was going to ask is is it the administration s policy to continue to provide essentially an unlimited amount of money to ukraine i mean is there a top line budget and is the thinking that the administration will continue to support ukraine for as long as it needs for how much money it needs ms psaki well i think we did this five month request because we wanted to be able to do longer term planning and work with the ukrainians our european partners this is not all for ukraine it s also for some of our eastern european partners and others to help support them during this time as well but i m not going to get ahead of where we will be in three months four months five months our objective is continue to support the ukrainians but i m not going to get ahead of where we are at this point in time i can note and i know this goes to alex s earlier question i mean a little bit in terms of the other components and i can see if there s more of a specific of what s been spent down but when it comes to humanitarian economic food and other security assistance some of that funding is you know 1 7 billion to ensure continuity of ukraine s democratic operations and provide other macroeconomic assistance hundreds of millions of dollars in food shelter and other humanitarian aid to ukrainians but we can also see if there s more specifics on where we are with the spend out of it go ahead q yeah revisiting student loan debt and that issue why isn t president biden willing to go as high as 50 000 that s the figure that majority leader chuck schumer has pointed to that s the figure that a lot of progressive democrats have pointed to so what about that number gives the president concern ms psaki the president himself has spoken to this in the past so i d really point you to his own words on this front q remind me what he said then ms psaki i m happy to get them to you after the briefing but what i can tell you is that the president has said many times that he would be happy to sign a bill that would provide 10 000 in relief to individuals who have student loans and congress could send him that that hasn t happened yet that could be the first focus of congress as an example and he s continuing to consider what he has the executive authority or authority to do with his own power so i m just not going to get ahead of that consideration process go ahead q so again it s a simple question why does president biden q jen you mentioned the 33 billion package and how urgent it is we don t yet really have a timeline on how urgent you know if it s weeks or months can you detail at all sort of the white house strategy behind getting that money secured the president obviously next week is going to alabama to tour lockheed martin and the javelins it may be one opportunity ms psaki yeah to see javelins javelins being made q that may be one opportunity to draw attention to this are there other things that the white house is doing strategically to get that urgency you know felt by members of congress ms psaki look i think you are going to see a full court press from us on this funding as well as the covid funding which is very which is vital to the continuation of our fight against the pandemic and you will see that in the form of engagement with members on the hill and committees you will see that in the form of our secretary of state our secretary of defense and other national security officials speaking publicly testifying as many of them are and speaking to it during testimony and obviously you noted the president s visit to the factory the lockheed martin factory i believe in alabama next week even the decision today for the president to make the announcement himself instead of doing just a background briefing and providing all of the details to all of you was an effort to talk through the vital need of this assistance what it would go to and elevate it to that level q and then is there any effort i guess you heard this a little bit from him today talking about how ukrainians are giving up their lives so the money i guess is there anything that the white house is doing to address the concern from some americans that this is an awful lot of money going to a foreign country when we have domestic needs at home i don t know if there s anything proactively that you guys may do to try to make that case for why this amount of money is needed ms psaki well i would say that we ve also seen an incredibly heart heartfelt outpouring of support from the american people for the efforts of the united states to lead in standing up to russian aggression and to stand up in favor and support of the ukrainians you know to the president this is about american leadership in the world it s also about standing up for democracy versus autocracy it s about standing up against one foreign country invading another foreign country and you know it s about american leadership in the world so we will continue to articulate that and make that clear and that is part of the reason why the president also detailed in specificity today what all of this would go to i mean some of it a great deal of it is of course to military assistance to fight this war but there is funding in there as he noted this morning for food security and ensuring that we are addressing any food shortages around the world there is assistance that is going into humanitarian assistance and helping the outflow of refugees and so it was important to him personally to lay out the specifics in his remarks this morning q can i follow up on q so again a really simple question ms psaki go ahead q yes thanks jen looking ahead to the president s q there s a simple process sir q inaudible question you give these people six questions in the front row q looking ahead to the president s trip to japan q it s disrespectful q that was announced last night i m wondering if you can talk about and the quad summit ms psaki yeah q i m wondering if you can talk how the president will raise sort of a unified response to russia ms psaki yeah q with india at the table and then also sort of the china taiwan issue ms psaki well on the japan on the first part on russia i would say first we ve had a number of engagements as you know with leaders in india about our approach to supporting the ukrainians in this in this war whether that is sanctions and the enormous sanctions package we re putting in we ve put in place or of course the assistance we ve provided we will convey the same sentiments in this meeting now this meeting is several weeks away so a lot can certainly happen and as you know other members of the quad have also been vital partners and vital you know supporters of the ukrainians effort to fight the war including japan i mean japan just as an example has not only provided a range of assistance but they ve also agreed to divert some of the lng resources to help europe so there s a number of steps they have also taken that will be a part of the discussion and certainly the president will provide an update on what we re doing and where things stand at that point in time we re just not quite there on previewing the agenda yet obviously the president s position on taiwan has not changed he will certainly restate it during this meeting but i m sure we ll have more to preview as we get closer to the trip q and china taiwan how will that be raised as well ms psaki again as we get closer to the trip there s not a change in our policy obviously the president s policy is based on the taiwan relations act that will continue and as we get closer to the trip i m sure we ll have more to preview go ahead q thanks jen one question on moldova and one on covid do you have any update any insight on the explosions in transnistria earlier in the week ms psaki yeah q and if the russians were to open a new front in moldavian territory would that trigger any new consequences for russia ms psaki on the first part i just don t have new confirmation or new details to read out from here on we re still continuing to look at the explosions from earlier this week i m just not going to get ahead of a hypothetical at this point in time in terms of what consequences there would be q yesterday you were talking about how there s great access to paxlovid ms psaki yeah q in the country you re trying to get the word out on its effectiveness one of the main issues with paxlovid is that an individual who is eligible has to test positive and then they have to race to get it within three days even though they re quarantining is there any conversation within the administration to change that for an eligible individual to be able to get it preemptively ms psaki i think that would be a decision likely made by our health and medical experts so i just don t have anything to preview at this point in time it requires a prescription right but there are a range of ways to have those conversations with your doctor so i m not sure it always involves a race to the doctor s office but different doctors can have virtual appointments and other means of getting prescriptions it s about consulting to ensure you re eligible go ahead q thank you jen so i have a question on ukraine and then a follow up on my colleague s questions zelenskyy s top advisor tweeted today that ukraine should decide whether to strike military facilities i know you ve spoken to on this before but you re trying to avoid a hypothetical situation but this seems like it s getting closer towards a non hypothetical situation can you can you at least outline laughter outline ms psaki i appreciated that okay go ahead q whether the administration believes that this is escalatory or could be constructive ms psaki well you know one i think it s important to take a step back and remember what we re talking about here i mean it is russia that started this war invaded ukraine and violated ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity it s russian forces that have committed war crimes and horrifying atrocities and it s russia that continues to attack ukrainian targets in ukraine every day so even if we are dare i say getting into a hypothetical what we re talking about here is not any intention of ukraine invading russia and trying to take russian territory going after russian civilians going after russians hospitals we re talking about consideration of military targets it s something very different so i just think that s important context for everybody to consider q still on ukraine there s no formal announcement as of right now about jakarta inviting zelenskyy to the g20 but our sources suggest that they are indeed inviting both zelenskyy as well as putin so under those circumstances would the president consider attending i know it s still six months away but under those circumstances inaudible ms psaki well we certainly welcomed reports about ukraine s invitation obviously we can t confirm that on behalf of indonesia who is hosting and the president has been clear about his view this shouldn t be business as usual and that russia should not be a part of this but again it s six months away we don t even have confirmation of these reports so i m certainly not going to get into a hypothetical in this case q and just to ms psaki yeah q to follow up on the issue of you know americans being concerned about the amount of money being sent out to ukraine one of the things that the president outlined today in his speech was not just humanitarian assistance but also allow pensions and social support to be paid to the ukrainian people so what would you say to the american public who says okay it s one thing to help ukrainian refugees with food and shelter but why should we be paying for their pensions ms psaki well look i would say that we have provided a range of economic assistance because we know that their economy has been devastated not of their doing because they were invaded by a foreign country q but how is that ms psaki and they re going let me let me finish and they are going to need assistance in order to recover we provide assistance economic and humanitarian assistance to a range of countries around the world because that s part of american leadership and so i would say that s the reasoning for this assistance being proposed in the package go ahead q jen on menthol going back to the opposition in the black community i talked to congresswoman frederica wilson today and she said she s opposing it she says the president not should not only deal with menthol but ban all instead of just menthol she feels that it will cause a profiling issue and she also says this is something that should not be dealt with in the midterms because it will split the black community what do you say to that and are you talking to frederica wilson al sharpton ben crump and others about this very issue ms psaki well let me try to answer all your questions there i m sure you ll let me know if i don t april of course you know this is a public health decision made by the fda and the objective of it was not to address politics or handle politics in one way or another but to save lives and the studies estimate that with menthol cigarettes if they re no longer available it could prevent over 650 000 deaths including 238 000 african americans there are also high rates of use by children and young adults menthol also increases the appeal of cigarettes makes them easier to use especially for kids and what we have seen as you know is decades of targeted marketing activities at the african american community to promote further purchasing and in many ways and for many addiction to these cigarettes so this is not but what i think is important for everybody to know and understand including opponents is this is not targeting individuals this is not to give anybody license to arrest somebody who is smoking a cigarette a menthol cigarette this is going after the manufacturers of this it is going after those who are selling because it is it has we have seen decades of marketing targeted activities at exactly these communities q so with that said as you say decades i mean there has been efforts to stop the targeting through billboards in urban communities in the 90s and on and on this is decades old but why now you know there s been progression but why now instead of other issues ms psaki well i think again this is a public health decision that went through a public health process it wasn t made through a political prism or made you know for any other reason than the lives that it could save go ahead q thank you jen at least seven sailors have died by suicide since the uss george washington began undergoing inaudible overhaul there have been three just within the last month the navy today confirmed three from prior years is the president aware of these suicides does he have any response to them and is the military doing enough to make sure that it is promoting the mental wellbeing of our service members ms psaki well certainly the president is regularly briefed and is aware and the service men and women and the stress and the pressure on them is something that is on his mind including making sure we have the right mental healthcare the right treatments for any individual who may be suffering from depression or anything that might lead to suicide in terms of an assessment of what the steps they are taking or what they re doing i d really point you to the department of defense who would be better versed to speak to the specifics q sure and then to follow up on a question from yesterday about ukraine and tariffs the president could today if he wanted to by executive action undo these trump era tariffs on steel imports from ukraine is there any reason why he wouldn t do that does it have anything to do with pushback from unions ms psaki there s an ongoing consideration and process of reviewing a range of steps we can help we can take to provide relief to the ukrainians a review of tariffs but there s a range of factors and i just don t have anything to preview in that process at this point q okay but that is something that he is considering ms psaki there s a range of options on the table go ahead in the back q thanks jen i wanted to ask the house is out next week and usually that would be where an appropriations bill would start given that the president is saying the covid funding is so urgent in addition to the ukraine proposal how do you see this playing out legislatively in the quick that you need it to ms psaki well this is something now that we ve put the proposal forward and put it forward and sent it up to the hill a lot of the work is happening behind the scenes engagement with our legislative team steve ricchetti louisa terrell and this team with leaders on the house side the senate side to move it forward as quickly as possible but in terms of the legislative mechanics i d really point you to leaders on the hill for specifics on that q and one other question on covid funding the biden administration has been i don t know if reticent is the right word to release spending that you ve done on covid tests the rapid testing program whether it s how much you spent per test or overall is that information that you re planning to make public or planning to provide to the senate and the house as they consider whether to provide more funding ms psaki the testing program in terms of people being able to order free tests q yeah the covid tests inaudible ms psaki what specifically do you think we haven t provided q the amounts that you spent per test or overall per contract ms psaki i m sure if members of congress or committees are interested in information we ll have those discussions with them directly go ahead q thanks jen two questions my first question is about the security pact between china and the solomon islands do you have any concerns that china is taking advantage of what s going on in the pacific because the u s is so focused on ukraine and russia ms psaki i know we have spoken to this a little bit in the past and expressed some concern at the time i ll have to talk to our national security team and see if we have any any updates on recent developments q and i just have one more question about president biden s trip to asia could you confirm reports by some asian media outlets that are saying that president biden is going to announce some kind of china strategy during his trip to korea and japan ms psaki again this trip is weeks away which is a lifetime for us so we re not quite there yet on previewing specifics of the trip and what it will entail why don t we do the last one and then i got to wrap it up q thank you jen thank you the minnesota department of human rights found that the city of minneapolis and the mpd engaged in a pattern of practice of racial discrimination they re working on some consent decree but we know that can take some time is there anything that the president can do moving forward can we say that the george floyd justice in policing act seems like it s shelved for now and has the president seen that report what s his reaction ms psaki i don t have any direct reaction from the president to that report i can certainly check with him on that we re still consid continuing to consider a police reform executive order as you know that s consideration is underway it continues to be underway and the president has every intention of signing one and of course we would of cour still love to have bipartisan legislation passed through congress we know the anniversary is coming up in just a few weeks and certainly that s something that remains on the president s mind thank you everyone so much 4 07 p m edt

natarsha eppes kelly has been working hard for the last four months to establish a new normal in her life a dinwiddie resident and former mortgage specialist who now works as a beauty and skin care entrepreneur ms eppes kelly contracted covid 19 in late august unable to be vaccinated at the time because of her diabetes ms eppes kelly initially focused on getting the rest of her family tested and taking stock of the potential impact the larger effects of her infection would quickly become clear in just a few days when she laid down but couldn t seem to wake up that lasted for four days ms eppes kelly was rushed to a hospital by her husband when she proved unresponsive and was barely breathing her infection led to months of care in a richmond hospital and later at home treatment as the long term effects of covid 19 subsided and emerged again and again now nearly nine months after coming down with covid 19 ms eppes kelly is on the path to recovery at sheltering arms physical rehabilitation and therapy center in bon air where she began rehab for her fatigue diminished lung capacity and physical decline on new year s day the experience can be taxing with ms eppes kelly taking regular breaks between activities and needing a portable oxygen machine to assist with breathing but her determination to regain a measure of the health she has lost to covid 19 is clear and through the deep breaths she takes as she trains she repeats a simple phrase i got this mentally i struggle every day i break down at times but i have to remember that i do this for a reason ms eppes kelly said i feel like this was something that i had to go through i m very strong on faith and faith driven so i feel like this was my destiny ms eppes kelly is one of around 200 people with post acute sequelae of sars cov 2 infection also known as long covid being treated at sheltering arms according to dr jason seltzer a manager of therapy services who serves as her physical therapist on a larger scale ms eppes kelly is among 7 9 million to 23 9 million people in the united states who are grappling with the long term effects of covid 19 that s about 10 percent to 30 percent of those who were infected with the virus in virginia an estimated 166 237 to 498 712 people are covid long haulers those great numbers are forcing a shift in how the medical community including physicians therapists and others are dealing with the after effects of covid 19 i think we re in a state of evolution said dr seltzer who noted how long covid symptoms add difficulty when it comes to providing the best possible medical treatment for those affected i think we re learning that it s not one size fits all for treatment dr seltzer said how i treat one patient is very different from how i treat the other diagnostics alone are not the only thing that can guide treatment and therapies interventions and management approaches need to be tailored while ms eppes kelly s condition has caused a major change in her daily life for ed coleman long covid is a hill he s been working to climb since the pandemic started mr coleman first discovered his infection in early 2020 during a routine visit to mcguire veterans administration medical center in south richmond the virus led to severe health complications he was even placed in a medically induced coma to help stabilize his blood pressure and other functions that were erratic under the effects of the virus he was 76 at the time and had a history of health issues covid 19 treatment was still nascent at the time and doctors weren t positive about his prospects of making a recovery today he continues to strive to improve as he gets acclimated to his new health status i m still in recovery mr coleman told the free press in late march and i guess that s going to go on for a little while longer i m still on oxygen 24 hours a day and went from six liters down to three but it s an effort you know he said the initial impact of long covid also had a mental toll for mr coleman he recognized the cognitive impairment from the virus known as brain fog even briefly forgetting during his recovery at home that he had lost a son in 2019 currently mr coleman continues to teach shotokan karate as much as he can and he regularly walks in his chamberlayne farms neighborhood to improve his health ms eppes kelly also is working to adjust to the cognitive impact of her covid 19 infection it has forced her to re learns parts of her new business and the work she previously put into it like mr coleman family support has been a major benefit for ms eppes kelly she said family members have stepped up to aid her entrepreneurial ambitions and home life and to help boost her physical and mental state they have been such a big help ms eppes kelly said it was a lot that was put on them and they answered the call ms eppes kelly s and mr coleman s situations are a stark reminder of the high costs the virus presents for many even months after initial infection and despite vaccines being widely available delegate delores l mcquinn knows the situation all too well in both her professional and personal life on march 14 she gathered with people at virginia union university for covid 19 remembrance day a day set aside by the virginia general assembly to remember the more than 20 000 virginians who have lost their lives since the pandemic s start the resolution to make march 14 a day of remembrance each year was sponsored by delegate mcquinn and approved during the 2021 legislative session the effects of covid 19 have had a toll on delegate mcquinn s own family delegate mcquinn her husband jonathan mcquinn and their daughter daytriel mcquinn nzassi continue to monitor and manage their long covid symptoms including shortness of breath headaches and exhaustion while delegate mcquinn s and her daughter s symptoms are mild and sporadic mr mcquinn s moderate symptoms have left him with headaches feeling exhausted and unexpected medical costs delegate mcquinn has mixed feelings about the initial response of authorities to the spread of covid 19 and its impact on communities of color the trauma caused by covid 19 continues to strike black and brown communities she said we did some things right but i also think that in retrospect there were some things that we could have done better and not just virginia but as a nation delegate mcquinn said i m hoping that we still understand that there are vulnerable communities you still have to be careful you have to be cautious of how communities are impacted she believes more needs to be done to ensure a better quality of life for those affected long term by covid 19 as well as for those who have lost friends and family to the virus this will require more from those in positions of power to help she said no expense should be spared to correct and address the gap in care and research that has occurred so far in the pandemic i know people are going to say do you know what it s going to cost delegate mcquinn said i don t know the final cost but i do know a lot of people have paid already for the negligence of those who should have and could have helped us to better understand this disease we have a responsibility and we have an obligation to do what we can to help those folks the greater question now is how society can better understand and accommodate the long term health consequences of covid 19 millions of people across the united states including ms eppes kelly mr coleman and the mcquinn family are likely to be impacted by covid 19 for years to come dr seltzer stressed the need for long term research into long covid s effects as well as an expansion in understanding and awareness of symptoms to properly respond to the changes it will bring for individuals and groups the more people who are aware of long covid symptoms the more health care providers who are seeking to address it the faster we ll get to a solution dr seltzer said on the national level u s sen tim kaine of virginia introduced a bill in early march focused on improving the understanding of and response to long covid while accelerating research into the affliction sen kaine s own development of mild long covid symptoms which include a constant nerve tingling two years after becoming infected with the virus was a major influence in his efforts to help people who live with long covid the bill called the care for long covid act would raise public awareness of long covid and treatment possibilities we still just don t know much about it sen kaine said that s why we need to do more research put more information out there and then come up with treatments that work for people though his bill and a 10 billion covid 19 spending bill have yet to be approved by congress sen kaine seemed confident the legislation would find the support needed to pass employers also need to know how to accommodate employees with things like zoom and telework and open up some opportunities for people that they might not have had before he said dr seltzer believes the growing response to long covid by the medical community will have a positive impact on treatment of those with the virus and other long term afflictions i m happy to see that more and more long covid clinics are popping up because that is a place where a patient with a single condition can go and be seen by specialists dr seltzer said it sets a good example for how chronic conditions and diseases should be managed in the future ms eppes kelly urged people facing a future with long covid to be steadfast in working to improve their health post infection but not to overwhelm themselves in the effort take it day by day hour by hour ms eppes kelly said just give yourself grace and just be patient

elon musk is buying twitter will the purchase pay off twitter s earnings provided some clues thursday when the company reported that the number of daily active users which has grown slowly had grown to 229 million first quarter revenue climbed to 1 20 billion which fell short of analysts estimates according to a bloomberg compilation twitter stock was relatively stable thursday after the company experienced losses earlier this week that signaled investors were dubious about musk s 44 billion purchase of the social media platform the company declined to issue a financial forecast citing the pending sale given the pending acquisition of twitter by elon musk we will not be providing any forward looking guidance and are withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlook the company said in a statement with the board of directors decision monday to sell the company to musk for 54 20 per share twitter is charting a new path as owner musk will have unique power over a highly influential platform that shapes public opinion on politics industries and cultural movements around the world advertisement in the days leading up to the deal musk declared himself to be a free speech absolutist arguing against what he considers to be overly aggressive content moderation practices the tesla ceo has deemed twitter a de facto town square and essential to a well functioning democracy if the acquisition is completed musk will have significant sway in determining what kind of speech qualifies as acceptable at a time when there is widespread disagreement about social media s role in society he will have to decide where a company with 229 million daily active users draws the line between free expression and mitigating the real world harms that result from speech on its platform perhaps his highest profile decision will be whether to allow former president donald trump to return to the site after the company banned him after the jan 6 riot at the u s capitol musk s views on free speech as well as his leadership style already are raising eyebrows among employees at the san francisco based company on wednesday he tweeted a meme to his more than 86 million followers with the face of twitter s top lawyer vijaya gadde that appeared to suggest the company s decisions are affected by a left wing bias the tweet came hours after he criticized a 2020 policy decision gadde made and was in response to an earlier tweet from a political podcast host calling her the company s top censorship advocate gadde and musk did not respond to requests for comment wednesday advertisement musk s positions on social media content moderation put him relatively at odds with current twitter leadership which has made some of the most aggressive moves to punish political leaders who break the company s terms of service many rank and file employees are also concerned employees peppered twitter s leadership on monday with questions about how musk s ownership might change the company

former us treasury secretary lawrence summers has been a siren voice on the american economy arguing that the federal reserve s delayed response to inflation coupled with low unemployment made a recession likely within two years it may arrive sooner than summers expected with american output shrinking by 1 4 per cent in the first quarter what is surprising about the data is that none of the platoons of forecasters saw it coming with the consensus being a one percentage point expansion former us treasury secretary lawrence summers pictured warned the federal reserve s delayed response to inflation coupled with low unemployment made a recession likely the post event rationalisation is to blame the dip on omicron congestion at the ports which hit exports and stock building another factor was the withdrawal of public sector fiscal support put in place in the pandemic what is more worrying as central banks in the us and britain limber up to raise interest rates next week is the impact on personal consumption a big driver for western economies the data suggests it climbed in january but fell back sharply in the following two months this may be pandemic related but it is hard to escape the fact that even though americans are sitting on high levels of covid savings real personal disposable income money to spend after tax and inflation fell at an annualised 2 per cent over the period that is about the same squeeze on incomes that is projected for 2022 in britain by both the bank of england and office for budget responsibility central banks do not much like raising interest rates into a slowing economy for fear of causing a slump but with inflation showing no signs of subsiding quite the contrary they may have no choice the bigger question for rate setters on both sides of the atlantic is whether to hit consumption and output hard now at the risk of recession and unemployment or take matters more gradually and trust more painful outcomes can be dodged there is the possibility that covid followed by war in ukraine could be the kind of seismic moment that changes the world a benefit of globalisation has been cheaper prices for everything cut russia and ukraine out of the picture and you have soaring european gas prices the loss of farm output from one of the grain baskets of the world as well as shortages of fertilisers and valuable metals such as nickel supply chains and open trading systems which took almost a century to recover after the golden era of 1870s to 1914 ended are in danger again so is expansion and prosperity price points the challenging world of soaring input prices is dominating life for alan jope the chief executive at unilever in the first quarter inflation added 1 8billion to raw material costs and they keep on rising with an estimate for the second quarter of an extra 2 3billion unilever is able to pass through most of the hurt with sales growth of 7 3 per cent largely the result of higher prices strong brands such as dove and hellmann s offer a degree of protection from a fall in demand but in latin america where prices jumped by 16 4 per cent sales volumes shrank by 5 7 per cent higher incomes in the west offer insurance against shrinking demand an encouraging aspect of the unilever tale is that strategic moves into the fashionable space of prestige beauty and functional nutrition such as smartypants vitamins is boosting the growth narrative across the globe beauty and personal care the company s biggest segment outpaced home care and food over the period in spite of the inflation challenge targeted share buybacks of 2 5billion or so remains intact with the first slug of 633million under way phew winters dawn the seven year stint of bill winters as chief executive of standard chartered can hardly be counted as a roaring success with the shares halving in value he has striven to repair the balance sheet and the emerging market bank s shabby reputation a return to robust growth in the face of difficult conditions in hong kong and china is something of a victory it has been aided by volatility in commodity markets which lifted trading income by 32 per cent whether growth and recovery can be sustained should financing cracks open up in developing markets is less predictable its investors are used to that
hey there time traveller this article was published 27 04 2022 719 days ago so information in it may no longer be current london ap twitter s quarterly profit revenue and the number of daily users on its platform are rising but its quarterly report released days after agreeing to be sold to billionaire elon musk offered scant details about what it expects on the financial front for the rest of the year the social media company on thursday reported net income of 513 million or 61 cents a share but that includes a big one time gain from the sale of its mopub business clouding comparisons with the year ago period revenue most of it from ads rose 16 to 1 2 billion in the three months to march compared with the same period last year though the company said the figure reflected headwinds associated with the war in ukraine without elaborating file in this april 26 2017 file photo is a twitter app icon on a mobile phone in philadelphia if elon musk and twitter get their way the company will soon be privately held and under his control the most obvious immediate change would likely be twitter s stock being taken off the new york stock exchange ap photo matt rourke file twitter reported an average of 229 million daily active users in the quarter which was about 14 million more than a revised 214 7 million daily users in the previous quarter the san francisco company canceled a conference call with executives and industry analysts that usually accompanies its results so there will be little further insight into the company s current financial condition given the pending acquisition of twitter by elon musk we will not be providing any forward looking guidance and are withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlook the company said musk who s paying 54 20 for each outstanding share of twitter did not speak publicly on the quarterly report perhaps among its last as a publicly traded entity musk s 44 billion deal to buy twitter was announced earlier this week and is expected to close sometime this year but before the deal is completed shareholders will have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business so far though few hurdles are expected despite objections from some of twitter s own employees along with users who worry about musk s stance on free speech and what it might mean for harassment and hate speech on the platform angelo zino tech analyst at cfra said the results combined with a slew of challenges facing the digital ad industry should solidify the board s decision to approve musk s offer we see little reason to believe twitter could extract greater shareholder value remaining public he said in a research note still twitter shares have yet to reach the buyout price and on thursday the company s stock rose slightly to 49 11 the gap between the deal price and current stock price seems to indicate that some investors remain uncertain about when and whether the deal will be completed said harry kraemer a former ceo and chairman of baxter international who is now a professor at northwestern university s kellogg school of management one factor in the uncertainty is how unusual it is for an individual to buy a multibillion dollar company in the case of a publicly traded company acquiring another investors can examine the buyer s financial disclosures and see whether they have the cash to fund the deal the buyer can also issue shares to raise funds as needed but in this case tesla is not buying the company elon musk is kraemer said elon musk is an individual you can t look at a balance sheet and see where the cash is coming from another factor is musk s propensity to change his mind fueling fears he could back out of the deal even if he has to pay a 1 billion break up fee musk who also runs the electric car company tesla as well as spacex and other ventures says he plans to take twitter private if he does the company will no longer be beholden to shareholders or publicly report its financial results which have been mixed at best since the company went public in 2013 twitter has struggled to consistently post profits as a public company while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook on one hand going private could give twitter more room to experiment while focusing less on short term profit and its stock price on the other hand even the world s richest man is likely to want the company to make money winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the

the ocean of red ink in amazon s report was mostly related to a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in an electric vehicle startup example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york amazon reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 on thursday its money making juggernaut stalled by a slowdown in pandemic induced online shopping and a huge write down of its investment in an electric vehicle startup the seattle based e commerce giant s stock fell 9 in after hours trading amazon reported a loss of 3 84 billion or 7 56 a share for the first three months of the year a year ago it reported a profit of 8 1 billion or 15 79 a share for the first quarter wall street analysts expected a profit of 8 35 a share in the latest quarter according to factset the ocean of red ink in amazon s report came mostly from the company s accounting for a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in rivian automotive rivian went public in late 2021 and its stock traded at close 180 at one point it closed thursday at 32 18 ford motor co reported a similar write down of the value of its rivian investment wednesday amazon s e commerce business also reported an operating loss of 1 57 billion in north america and 1 28 billion internationally meanwhile sales at amazon s cloud computing business which helps power the online operations of netflix mcdonald s and other companies grew 37 in the quarter and sales in its advertising business where brands pay to get their products to show up first when shoppers search on amazon s site rose 25 still the slowdown in online spending is real and broad based while in store sales rose march is the first month to show decline in online sales since the pandemic began according to mastercard spendingpulse which tracks spending made over the mastercard payments network and survey estimates for other payments made with cash and checks amazon prospered during the covid 19 pandemic as homebound people eager to limit human contact turned online to purchase what they need but growth has slowed as vaccinated americans feel more comfortable going out according to the e commerce research firm marketplace pulse the value of goods sold on amazon last year grew by half the rate compared to 2020 like many others amazon is dealing with pressure from inflation and supply chain issues in the past two years amazon s chief financial officer brian olsavsky said the company has doubled the size of its operations and nearly doubled its workforce he said labor shortages and a lack of physical space are no longer major issues but the company continues to face a variety of pressures such as increased shipping costs inflation related expenses added roughly 2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year olsavsky said adding that the company also incurred another 4 billion in costs related to productivity loss and other inefficiencies the pandemic and subsequent war in ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges said amazon ceo andy jassy in a statement our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network we know how to do this and have done it before to offset rising fuel costs and inflation the retail giant has added a 5 surcharge to fees it charges third party sellers who use its fulfillment services last quarter amazon also hiked its annual prime membership fee by 20 a first since 2018 despite the fee hike olsavsky said millions of new prime members have enrolled during the quarter revenue rose 7 to 116 44 billion compared with 108 52 billion in first quarter 2021 representing the company s sixth consecutive quarter of revenue topping 100 billion amazon had projected sales between 112 billion and 117 billion analysts surveyed by factset were expecting 116 5 billion given the pace at which the business grew over the past few years this shift is hardly surprising said neil saunders managing director of globaldata retail it represents more of a post pandemic reset than catastrophic failure nevertheless the slowdown raises important questions over how amazon can restore momentum and regain its leadership position as one of the primary drivers of online growth amazon said it forecasts sales for the current quarter to range between 116 billion and 121 billion below the 125 33 billion that analysts are forecasting the results come as amazon is closing all of its brick and mortar bookstores as well as its 4 star shops and pop up locations as the online retail behemoth reworks its physical footprint the company also faces a growing unionization push from inside its workforce a second union election is currently underway at a company warehouse on staten island new york the same borough where workers at a nearby facility voted to unionize earlier this month amazon has filed objections over the election with the national labor relations board and is seeking to re do the vote the final outcome of a separate union election in bessemer alabama is still up in the air with 416 outstanding challenged ballots hanging in the balance hearings to review the ballots are expected to begin in the coming weeks ____

the shock inflation number and implications for rba policy the rba was going to hike anyway we ve known that for some time it was just a matter of the election being a temporary distraction the next significant economic release will be the march quarter gdp but that s a good month away the yanks have had a stab at theirs however not that anyone noticed rinse repeat a solid rebound on wall street was always a very good chance heading into last night for no other reason than the pattern of 2022 has been one of big falls for a few sessions followed by a bottoming attempt and then a sharp snap back rally the next day we saw a very similar sort of bottoming attempt back in march to wednesday night and sure enough the pattern repeated it did somewhat help that having fallen 25 on its december quarter earnings result facebook rallied 17 on its march quarter earnings result and had done so in wednesday night s aftermarket but the night s economic data gave wall street every excuse to go the other way all year the concern has been of heading into a recession and an increasingly hawkish fed has only fuelled those fears but it was still expected the march quarter would see at least minor growth in the face of omicron after a 6 9 leap in the december quarter it didn t the us gdp contracted by 1 4 in the march quarter when a 1 0 gain was forecast mind you this is only a first estimate based on extrapolating the month of january there are revisions to follow these are nonetheless unlikely to get better as the month of march brought the invasion wall street had assumed if the us was to mark two quarters of negative growth it would begin in the june quarter but with march in the negative june quarter contraction and thus a recession are now even more possible there is some relief in that the biggest hit to us gdp was a ballooning trade deficit and not a plunge in consumer spending the problems have been supply constraints and resultant inflation not demand either way wall street seemed not to care less as to whether this snap back rally lasts any more than a couple of sessions is another matter the fed meeting is next week but there are plenty more earnings results to come on wednesday night facebook reported after the bell last night it was the turn of amazon and apple blaming inflation amazon provided a big miss on june quarter guidance and is currently down 9 in

calm approach the right strategy for energy security says panel 28 april 2022 share policymakers and businesses alike need to take a calm rational and pragmatic approach to ensure security of energy supply according to panellists at world nuclear fuel cycle 2022 l r desbazeille hanly murphy and grancea take the stage at wnfc a session on government and utility views on energy and supply security included an eu perspective from foratom director general yves desbazeille adrienne hanly uranium production specialist in the international atomic energy agency iaea department of nuclear energy gave an overview on uranium inventories focusing on a forthcoming iaea technical document while a utility perspective was provided by jason murphy vice president of nuclear fuels at constellation the session was moderated by luminita grancea nuclear energy analyst at the oecd nuclear energy agency who asked the panellists their recommendations to policymakers and to industry to ensure security of supply from a european perspective desbazeille said policymakers should adopt a more pragmatic approach to energy security particularly when it comes to eu policy on nuclear prolonging the operating life of the existing nuclear fleet is a no regret solution that is cheap and available now he said it s only a case of a decision and forgetting about ideology although some countries are beginning to adopt a pragmatic approach this is not yet being seen at the eu or european commission level he said the change of mind we can observe is a more bottom up thing in some countries we see that public opinion tends to shift to a more positive view on nuclear and the role it can play he said adding that from the governmental side the situation is not so straightforward for germany although it would clearly be possible to keep the country s remaining nuclear plants open very strong political opposition to this means the debate is already over in belgium the decision to prolong the operating lives of two of the country s seven reactors illustrates a slight shift from the country s green led coalition government he said 73 of citizens are now supportive of the idea of prolonging the whole fleet so we see a definite clash between the political level and the public itself he said new perspective on inventories hanly outlined an ongoing project to produce an iaea technical document on global secondary uranium inventories secondary uranium supplies are defined as all materials other than primary production which is sourced to satisfy nuclear reactor requirements such supplies currently and historically fill the gap in demand not filled by primary uranium production and understanding the role of secondary inventories is therefore important in ensuring the assurance of nuclear supply the iaea coordinated project is focusing on front end inventories commercial inventories in the form of natural uranium ore concentrates natural uranium hexafluoride enriched uranium product and unused fuel assemblies in the world s eight largest nuclear fuel markets with quantitative analysis based on publicly available information together with qualitative analysis from experts this approach said hanly could fill some important gaps in analysis and support assessments due to its non commercial nature analysis of data supplied by the euratom supply agency esa shows that 42 400 tue tonnes of uranium equivalent of declared inventory was held by european utilities in 2020 ten utilities held inventories of less than 1500 tue while seven held inventories ranging from 1500 tue to over 6000 tue an upper limit is not given to protect confidentiality while this on aggregate equates to esa s recommended two years worth of supply many individual utilities fall short of this benchmark a similar exercise using data from the us energy information administration revealed a similar pattern with an average inventory per utility of about 1300 tue concentrated in about 40 of utilities this equates to about 23 564 tue of buffer stocks or about 16 months worth of supply available to mitigate supply disruptions a preliminary conclusion is that us utilities may have limited capability to independently manage a protracted supply disruption hanly said strategic inventories held by us doe including american assured fuel reserve and mox backup offer a potential short term backstop she added in answer to questions on what could be done to ensure security of supply hanly called for more transparency in reporting inventories as well as supporting diversity in primary supply as an industry and maybe even the iaea we should be making recommendations on best practices we should be able to demonstrate that there is an assurance of supply beyond fuel banks which are for emergency situations she said the iaea report is expected to be published in early to mid 2023 managing risks two of constellation s nuclear plants byron and dresden last year were on the cusp of early permanent closure until state support to ensure their operation was secured a situation described by murphy as a near death experience now with some uplift in the market in part due to such state support but also macroeconomic changes the company is looking to extend the operating licences for its plants to 80 years he said turning to security of supply murphy identified two areas for utilities to manage operational risk including ensuring reliable fuel supplies and financial risk ensuring supplier diversity geographically and also ensuring a diversity of supplier companies and appropriate inventory holdings to protect against supply disruptions and price shocks offer ways of managing nuclear fuel supply risk us utilities historically may have maintained lower inventory levels than european or asian utilities and that thinking might change going forward he said a number of financial strategies on contracting side can help to manage financial risk such strategy decisions should be made calmly and rationally he said as an end user you have to take long view and try to resist the very human urge to take immediate action sometimes doing nothing is a strategy don t make any rash decisions in the moment the top level international forum which is co organised by the nuclear energy institute and world nuclear association was being held in person for the first time since 2019 researched and written by world nuclear news related topics
amazon com inc projected sluggish second quarter sales growth as the largest online retailer struggles to build off the dramatic gains it made early in the pandemic the shares plunged about 10 percent in extended trading revenue will be 116 billion to 121 billion in the period ending in june amazon said thursday in a statement analysts on average estimated 125 billion according to data compiled by bloomberg amazon has been grappling with rising energy and labor costs and changing shopping habits as people return to pre pandemic activities the company thursday began rolling out a 5 percent fee charged to independent sellers on its website who use its shipping services a move designed to blunt the impact of inflation and rising fuel costs earlier this year amazon raised the price of its prime speedy shipping program by 20 to 139 a year in the us growth in amazon s main e commerce business which had been supercharged by the pandemic has fizzled despite those pressures wall street analysts have been nearly unanimous in their optimism about amazon s prospects citing the company s massive investments in package handling and delivery capacity and continued growth in its highly profitable cloud computing and advertising businesses advertisement the pandemic and subsequent war in ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges chief executive officer andy jassy said in the statement as we re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfilment network we know how to do this and have done it before this may take some time particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures sales gained 7 3 percent to 116 4 billion meeting analysts estimates that s the slowest pace of growth since 2001 and marks the first time amazon has ever recorded back to back quarters of less than 10 percent revenue growth the company also reported a net loss of 3 8 billion or 7 56 a share compared with profit of 8 1 billion or 15 79 a share in the period a year ago amazon said it included a loss of 7 6 billion in non operating expense from its investment in rivian automotive inc it was the company s first net loss in seven years the shares dropped to a low of 2 560 in extended trading after closing at 2 891 93 in new york the stock has dropped 13 percent this year amid a broad decline in the s p 500 by matt day learn more how can viral amazon native beauty brands grow dek of article you are adding as further reading
the ocean of red ink in amazon s report was mostly related to a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in an electric vehicle startup example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york amazon reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 on thursday its money making juggernaut stalled by a slowdown in pandemic induced online shopping and a huge write down of its investment in an electric vehicle startup the seattle based e commerce giant s stock fell 9 in after hours trading amazon reported a loss of 3 84 billion or 7 56 a share for the first three months of the year a year ago it reported a profit of 8 1 billion or 15 79 a share for the first quarter wall street analysts expected a profit of 8 35 a share in the latest quarter according to factset the ocean of red ink in amazon s report came mostly from the company s accounting for a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in rivian automotive rivian went public in late 2021 and its stock traded at close 180 at one point it closed thursday at 32 18 ford motor co reported a similar write down of the value of its rivian investment wednesday amazon s e commerce business also reported an operating loss of 1 57 billion in north america and 1 28 billion internationally meanwhile sales at amazon s cloud computing business which helps power the online operations of netflix mcdonald s and other companies grew 37 in the quarter and sales in its advertising business where brands pay to get their products to show up first when shoppers search on amazon s site rose 25 still the slowdown in online spending is real and broad based while in store sales rose march is the first month to show decline in online sales since the pandemic began according to mastercard spendingpulse which tracks spending made over the mastercard payments network and survey estimates for other payments made with cash and checks amazon prospered during the covid 19 pandemic as homebound people eager to limit human contact turned online to purchase what they need but growth has slowed as vaccinated americans feel more comfortable going out according to the e commerce research firm marketplace pulse the value of goods sold on amazon last year grew by half the rate compared to 2020 like many others amazon is dealing with pressure from inflation and supply chain issues in the past two years amazon s chief financial officer brian olsavsky said the company has doubled the size of its operations and nearly doubled its workforce he said labor shortages and a lack of physical space are no longer major issues but the company continues to face a variety of pressures such as increased shipping costs inflation related expenses added roughly 2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year olsavsky said adding that the company also incurred another 4 billion in costs related to productivity loss and other inefficiencies the pandemic and subsequent war in ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges said amazon ceo andy jassy in a statement our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network we know how to do this and have done it before to offset rising fuel costs and inflation the retail giant has added a 5 surcharge to fees it charges third party sellers who use its fulfillment services last quarter amazon also hiked its annual prime membership fee by 20 a first since 2018 despite the fee hike olsavsky said millions of new prime members have enrolled during the quarter revenue rose 7 to 116 44 billion compared with 108 52 billion in first quarter 2021 representing the company s sixth consecutive quarter of revenue topping 100 billion amazon had projected sales between 112 billion and 117 billion analysts surveyed by factset were expecting 116 5 billion given the pace at which the business grew over the past few years this shift is hardly surprising said neil saunders managing director of globaldata retail it represents more of a post pandemic reset than catastrophic failure nevertheless the slowdown raises important questions over how amazon can restore momentum and regain its leadership position as one of the primary drivers of online growth amazon said it forecasts sales for the current quarter to range between 116 billion and 121 billion below the 125 33 billion that analysts are forecasting the results come as amazon is closing all of its brick and mortar bookstores as well as its 4 star shops and pop up locations as the online retail behemoth reworks its physical footprint the company also faces a growing unionization push from inside its workforce a second union election is currently underway at a company warehouse on staten island new york the same borough where workers at a nearby facility voted to unionize earlier this month amazon has filed objections over the election with the national labor relations board and is seeking to re do the vote the final outcome of a separate union election in bessemer alabama is still up in the air with 416 outstanding challenged ballots hanging in the balance hearings to review the ballots are expected to begin in the coming weeks ____

an adjustment to the pccam base in our upcoming montana electric general rate review filing for the three months ended march 31 2022 electric supply costs exceeded the pccam base revenues by approximately 8 0 million as a result during the three months ended march 31 2022 we deferred 7 2 million of costs to be collected from customers 90 of the costs above base and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 0 8 million 10 of the variance for the three months ended march 31 2021 electric supply costs exceeded the pccam base revenues by approximately 8 4 million with 7 6 million of costs deferred for future collection from customers and 0 8 million recorded as a reduction in pre tax earnings montana fixed cost recovery mechanism fcrm on april 15 2022 we requested that the mpsc continue to defer implementation of the existing fcrm pilot currently set for july 1 2022 as we have indicated our intention to request a redesign of the decoupling mechanism in our upcoming rate review filing we expect the mpsc to issue a decision on our request for deferral by july 1 2022 supply chain challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build a 30 40 mw electric generation plant near aberdeen south dakota as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges also as we developed our forecast of capital expenditures we estimate that these supply chain challenges increased our forecasted 2022 capital spend by approximately 2 percent further challenges with product and services availability and price inflation could increase this impact on our capital spend forecasts or could cause us to experience delays fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we continue to proactively seek to mitigate wildfire risk we are furthering the efforts with the development of a comprehensive fire mitigation plan addressing five key areas situational awareness operational practices system preparedness vegetation management and public communications and outreach this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past decade including nearly 80 million spent on vegetation management and hazard tree removal programs and our growing annual investment to harden our transmission and distribution system infrastructure because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we expect to include a request for expected costs associated with the plan in our 2022 montana electric general rate filing primary earnings drivers revenues consolidated operating revenues for the three months ended march 31 2022 were 394 5

financial measures such as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe

ukraine underscored the likelihood of large economic shocks and disruptions that must be addressed downturns are likely to continue to challenge the economy improved understanding of breaks and supply chains increases in commodity prices bursting of asset bubbles and labor and productivity shocks can help policymakers implement reforms that bolster our economic resilience in recent weeks energy price movements have been another significant source of global economic shocks the biden administration s proposed energy agenda is designed to diminish our reliance on fossil fuels and help achieve greater energy independence these shifts will mitigate our future vulnerability to oil price shocks at the same time they will bet the transition to cleaner energy sources which will in due course lessen the risks tied to natural disasters and climate change the crisis has exposed the need for more permanent rental safety net housing stability is foremost concern not just in downturns but in recoveries as well and during this crisis treasury was at the forefront of establishing for the first time national effort at scale for rental assistance emergency rental assistance has not only helped to keep evictions below their pre pandemic levels it also enabled states and localities to build an infrastructure for rental assistance going forward advertisement experts say a recession

federal reserve to raise interest rates and combat high inflation supply chain shortages an ongoing global health crisis and of course the geopolitical earthquake caused by russia s invasion of

cash in on the housing boomif you ve been on the fence about selling your home now might be the time to make the leap the housing market has been on a tear with year over year prices up 19 8 in february according to the latest s p corelogic case shiller home price report but mortgage rates are also on the rise which may dampen demand i would suggest that anyone planning to put their house on the market do so right away said adam cover your near term cash needshaving liquid assets to cover you in emergencies or severe market downturns is always a good idea but it s especially crucial when facing big events beyond your control including layoffs which typically increase during recessions that means having enough money set aside in cash money market funds or short term fixed income instruments to cover several months of living expenses emergencies or any big anticipated expense e g a down payment or college tuition this is also advisable if you are near or in retirement in that case you may want to set aside a year or more of living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio said rob williams managing director of financial planning retirement income and wealth management at charles schwab this should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments such as social security or a private pension in addition williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short term bond fund that will help you ride out any market downturns should one occur and give your investments time to recover don t trade on the headlinesrapid fire news reports about higher energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving but making financial decisions based on an emotional response to current events is often a losing proposition making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that regret said don bennyhoff chief investment officer for liberty wealth advisors and a former investment strategist at vanguard look back at periods of crisis over the last century and you ll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment and did well on average over time for example since the financial crisis hit in 2008 the s p 500 has returned 11 a year on average through 2021 according to data analyzed by first trust advisors the worst year in that period was 2008 when stocks fell 38 but in most of the years that followed the index posted a gain and four of its annual gains ranged between 23 and 30 if you go back as far as 1926 that annual average return on the s p has been 10 5 staying the course may be hard on your nerves but it can be healthiest for your portfolio williams said that s not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats or the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns but were things to truly escalate globally he noted we d have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios review your risk toleranceit s easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when stocks are soaring but you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing over time so review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead and while you re at it figure out what it means to you to lose money there are many definitions of risk and loss bennyhoff said for instance if you re keeping money in a savings account or cd any interest you re earning is likely being outpaced by inflation so while you preserve your principal you lose buying power over time then again if it s more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it which could happen when you invest in stocks that inflation based loss may be worth it to you because you re getting what bennyhoff calls a sleep easy return that said for longer term goals figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains over time you re better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth adam said rebalance your portfoliogiven record stock returns in the past few years now is a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven t done so in a while for instance adam said you may be overweight in growth stocks to help stabilize your returns going forward she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower growing dividend paying value stocks through a mutual fund and check to see that you have at least some exposure to bonds while inflation has resulted in the worst quarterly return in high quality bonds in 40 years don t count them out should a recession result from the fed s aggressive interest rate hikes to quell inflation bonds are likely to do well recessions tend to be far kinder to high quality bonds than they are to stocks bennyhoff said make new investments slowlyif you have a large lump sum maybe you just sold your business or house or you got an inheritance or big bonus you may wonder what to do with it now given all the global uncertainty adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically e g every month for a given period of time rather than all at once space out your investing over time since this week s news will be different than next week s news she said stay cool do your best then let go whatever the news today building financial security over time requires a cool steady hand don t let your feelings about the economy or the markets sabotage your long term growth stay invested stay disciplined history shows that what people or even experts think about the market is usually wrong the best way to meet your long term goals is just stay invested and stick to your allocation adam said doing so will help minimize any damage a rough market in 2022 may cause if you ve built an appropriately diversified portfolio that matches your time horizon and risk tolerance it s likely the recent market drop will be a mere blip in your long term investing plan williams said remember too it s impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information collect your facts try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance adam said then she added let go

figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains over time you re better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth adam said rebalance your portfoliogiven record stock returns in the past few years now is a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven t done so in a while for instance adam said you may be overweight in growth stocks to help stabilize your returns going forward she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower growing dividend paying value stocks through a mutual fund and check to see that you have at least some exposure to bonds while inflation has resulted in the worst quarterly return in high quality bonds in 40 years don t count them out should a recession result from the fed s aggressive interest rate hikes to quell inflation bonds are likely to do well recessions tend to be far kinder to high quality bonds than they are to stocks bennyhoff said make new investments slowlyif you have a large lump sum maybe you just sold your business or house or you got an inheritance or big bonus you may wonder what to do with it now given all the global uncertainty adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically e g every month for a given period of time rather than all at once space out your investing over time since this week s news will be different than next week s news she said stay cool do your best then let go whatever the news today building financial security over time requires a cool steady hand don t let your feelings about the economy or the markets sabotage your long term growth stay invested stay disciplined history shows that what people or even experts think about the market is usually wrong the best way to meet your long term goals is just stay invested and stick to your allocation adam said doing so will help minimize any damage a rough market in 2022 may cause if you ve built an appropriately diversified portfolio that matches your time horizon and risk tolerance it s likely the recent market drop will be a mere blip in your long term investing plan williams said remember too it s impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information collect your facts try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance adam said then she added let go

the first commercially imported alpacas were brought to the u s from south america in 1984 alpacas are famous for their soft luxurious fleece as well as for their reputation as perhaps the most adorable creatures on the planet with their sweet goofy smiles calm dispositions and impossibly long eyelashes the u s alpaca industry took off exponentially in the early 2000s but prices collapsed a few years later during the great recession and by 2014 the so called alpaca bubble had burst since then however the industry has been slowly coming back and there s plenty of love for alpacas here in colorado ranchers raise them and sell their fiber for use in comfy sweaters socks even bedding you can visit with them up close this weekend at the great western alpaca show at the national western complex in denver the show is free and open to the public and runs through sun may 1 fans can watch halter and performance competitions costume contests and peruse vendor booths with handcrafted alpaca fashions and you can commemorate the entire weekend by hopping into the dedicated alpaca selfie photo booth to get a better idea of what the buzz over these fuzzy gentle creatures is all about colorado edition spoke with jennifer hack the owner and founder of triple h ranch in sedalia where she s been raising suri alpaca since 2013 interview highlights these interview highlights have been lightly edited for length and clarity erin o toole what made you decide to get into raising alpacas versus some other type of livestock jennifer hack there was a lot of thought that went into it part of it is that i can t raise animals that are going to go for slaughter i just i get too attached it s a fault of mine alpaca are one of the few where thankfully right now there is not a terminal market for them they re raised specifically for their fleece courtesy of jennifer hack judges at the great western alpaca show gauging fleece density and quality can you give a brief explanation of how the alpaca market works i know they re valued for their fiber how do ranchers like yourself make a living from alpaca herds so there s many different streams of revenue in raising alpaca or any livestock but alpaca specifically as i said they are raised primarily for their fleece some of us like myself and some other larger ranches in colorado we also raise what are called seed stock and those are the animals that are a little bit more valued you know they ve done very well at shows they have both the conformation as well as the fleece characteristics that we re looking for in making all the beautiful products that they can make but anything from having four animals as a fiber herd that you want to spin the yarn yourself to there s people across the country that have their own mill and their own knitting machines and have just made a huge business out of it so it s really what you want to do and what you re comfortable with for those of us who haven t had the pleasure of feeling it can you describe what a garment or an item made from alpaca fleece feels like well it s incredibly soft wool everybody thinks of that as prickly and that s because it s got little scales that come off of each individual fiber alpaca does not have that so there isn t that prickle factor when you deal with alpaca and especially you know we ve been breeding them for 30 years in the u s now and improving the fineness of all of our herds and the two different kinds are suri and huacaya suri feels more silky and has more of a drape whereas huacaya still has that incredible soft feel but it s a warmer fleece i want to talk a bit about the market and the infamous alpaca bubble in 2006 there were around 85 000 alpacas registered in the u s and as sometimes happens in other industries there was an alpaca boom in the early 2000s that was followed by a bust what happened courtesy of jennifer hack tikka one of the curious alpacas at triple h ranch poses for the camera honestly it s a lot of what happened to pretty much every industry you know around 2008 when the recession hit and prices for everything dropped simply because people couldn t afford to feed them couldn t afford the property they were on anymore it was just a difficult time really for the entire country and so it s been slowly building back but you know the industry now i think is pretty strong and we just continue to grow it almost sounds like there were a lot of people being sold this kind of idealized vision of a retired or semi retired lifestyle where you could just wake up and have coffee and go out in your backyard and tend to your herd of alpaca but it sounds like it was a bit more complicated and a bit more difficult than that yeah i mean they are livestock so there s what comes with raising any livestock you have to feed them twice a day and clean up after them and watch their health and know the individual personality of each animal so you can tell when there s a problem or not so it s certainly not that easy i mean as far as animals go alpacas are easier on the land which was part of what brought me to them they have pads on their feet so they don t tear up the ground like other hooved animals do they re pretty easy on fencing so as far as that goes they re relatively easy but it s still work you got into the alpaca business in 2013 after this bubble had burst did you have any qualms about it and did that shape your approach getting into it honestly i was really excited to get in to get involved you know i did a lot of research on them beforehand and it helped as well that i had other livestock knowledge so i understood their needs as far as being a herd animal and i understood the nutrition and their conservation so for me it was actually it was a pretty simple transition what s the state of the industry right now for people who want to raise or breed alpaca have things recovered i think actually things right now are looking really positive there have been a couple of national auctions this year that see the seed stock animals that i was talking about earlier selling back up to getting closer to where they used to be price wise which of course helps the breeders that are doing it but at the same time there s still those fiber animals out there that if people want to have a small herd it s enabling them to be able to do that relatively easily courtesy of jennifer hack a small herd of alpacas at triple h ranch let s talk about the great western alpaca show what can alpaca enthusiasts expect to see this weekend well there s a lot to see we have of course our regular halter competition which the alpacas are judged on 50 conformation and 50 fleece quality and there s several characteristics that go into that could you explain what you mean by conformation conformation is how the animal is put together so what they re looking for or want to see is a square body so their back is the same length as their legs and the same length as their neck so they re nice and balanced and they want a straight back you know they look at the quality of the head is it too long because that can make it difficult to breathe or is it too short because that can have the same problem they look at their bite to make sure that they can eat properly because obviously that s very important conformation is important because if you don t have a sound animal they tend to have a lot more health issues courtesy of jennifer hack tikka one of the alpacas of triple h ranch what about judging the fleece do the judges just sort of get in there with their hands and feel for how fluffy and luxurious it is how does that work yes so they ll part the fleece so they can see what it looks like down by the skin they look for how fine the fleece is and actually take a small sample of the fleece and put it on their arm so they can compare it to the other animals in the class they re looking for brightness and density how much fleece is that animal actually putting on their body and every animal is different so obviously our harvest is their fleece so we want more follicles the more hair follicles per inch the better because that gets us more fleece when we harvest it does anyone measure the length of the eyelashes i have to ask since it s one of the things that stands out to me personally the most when i see an alpaca face no laughs though there are some that have really long eyelashes of course one of the highlights for many people this weekend is the chance to get a selfie with an alpaca is there any alpaca photo etiquette we should know beforehand they are sometimes known for spitting so how do we not get spit on so first alpaca don t generally spit at people if they re going to spit it s because they re arguing with each other over food or sometimes the mature males which there are very few of at the show we only bring the calm ones when they re mature sometimes the mature males will spit at each other it can happen it s just very rare courtesy of great western alpaca show as far as being around them and touching them unlike a dog they don t like to be touched on the top of the head if people want to come in and touch them i mean the selfie booth obviously people can get in there and put their arm around them and they re very calm animals they re used to being around people and they re good with having their neck petted sometimes some of them like to have under their chins scratched that type of thing but because they re a prey animal they can t see what s on top of their head and that s why they don t like having top of their head petted what do you love most about raising alpacas well there s a couple things one they re just very calming animals you know if i ve had a hard day and you know i love my horses and i have a very different relationship with my horses but alpaca just seem to help you get centered and help you relax after a difficult day but the other thing that i found is that the people in this industry are just honestly amazing people and very welcoming and very helpful it doesn t matter if they re a competitor or what if somebody needs help they re going to give it

the ocean of red ink in amazon s report was mostly related to a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in an electric vehicle startup example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york amazon reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 on thursday its money making juggernaut stalled by a slowdown in pandemic induced online shopping and a huge write down of its investment in an electric vehicle startup the seattle based e commerce giant s stock fell 9 in after hours trading amazon reported a loss of 3 84 billion or 7 56 a share for the first three months of the year a year ago it reported a profit of 8 1 billion or 15 79 a share for the first quarter wall street analysts expected a profit of 8 35 a share in the latest quarter according to factset the ocean of red ink in amazon s report came mostly from the company s accounting for a 7 6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in rivian automotive rivian went public in late 2021 and its stock traded at close 180 at one point it closed thursday at 32 18 ford motor co reported a similar write down of the value of its rivian investment wednesday amazon s e commerce business also reported an operating loss of 1 57 billion in north america and 1 28 billion internationally meanwhile sales at amazon s cloud computing business which helps power the online operations of netflix mcdonald s and other companies grew 37 in the quarter and sales in its advertising business where brands pay to get their products to show up first when shoppers search on amazon s site rose 25 still the slowdown in online spending is real and broad based while in store sales rose march is the first month to show decline in online sales since the pandemic began according to mastercard spendingpulse which tracks spending made over the mastercard payments network and survey estimates for other payments made with cash and checks amazon prospered during the covid 19 pandemic as homebound people eager to limit human contact turned online to purchase what they need but growth has slowed as vaccinated americans feel more comfortable going out according to the e commerce research firm marketplace pulse the value of goods sold on amazon last year grew by half the rate compared to 2020 like many others amazon is dealing with pressure from inflation and supply chain issues in the past two years amazon s chief financial officer brian olsavsky said the company has doubled the size of its operations and nearly doubled its workforce he said labor shortages and a lack of physical space are no longer major issues but the company continues to face a variety of pressures such as increased shipping costs inflation related expenses added roughly 2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year olsavsky said adding that the company also incurred another 4 billion in costs related to productivity loss and other inefficiencies the pandemic and subsequent war in ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges said amazon ceo andy jassy in a statement our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network we know how to do this and have done it before to offset rising fuel costs and inflation the retail giant has added a 5 surcharge to fees it charges third party sellers who use its fulfillment services last quarter amazon also hiked its annual prime membership fee by 20 a first since 2018 despite the fee hike olsavsky said millions of new prime members have enrolled during the quarter revenue rose 7 to 116 44 billion compared with 108 52 billion in first quarter 2021 representing the company s sixth consecutive quarter of revenue topping 100 billion amazon had projected sales between 112 billion and 117 billion analysts surveyed by factset were expecting 116 5 billion given the pace at which the business grew over the past few years this shift is hardly surprising said neil saunders managing director of globaldata retail it represents more of a post pandemic reset than catastrophic failure nevertheless the slowdown raises important questions over how amazon can restore momentum and regain its leadership position as one of the primary drivers of online growth amazon said it forecasts sales for the current quarter to range between 116 billion and 121 billion below the 125 33 billion that analysts are forecasting the results come as amazon is closing all of its brick and mortar bookstores as well as its 4 star shops and pop up locations as the online retail behemoth reworks its physical footprint the company also faces a growing unionization push from inside its workforce a second union election is currently underway at a company warehouse on staten island new york the same borough where workers at a nearby facility voted to unionize earlier this month amazon has filed objections over the election with the national labor relations board and is seeking to re do the vote the final outcome of a separate union election in bessemer alabama is still up in the air with 416 outstanding challenged ballots hanging in the balance hearings to review the ballots are expected to begin in the coming weeks ____

chains increases in commodity prices bursting of asset bubbles and labor and productivity shocks can help policymakers implement reforms that bolster our economic resilience in recent weeks energy price movements have been another significant source of global economic shocks the biden administration s proposed energy agenda is designed to diminish our reliance on fossil fuels and help achieve greater energy independence these shifts will mitigate our future vulnerability to oil price shocks at the same time they will bet the transition to cleaner energy sources which will in due course lessen the risks tied to natural disasters and climate change the crisis has exposed the need for more permanent rental safety net housing stability is foremost concern not just in downturns but in

in a new job nowwith ultra low unemployment and plenty of openings it s a job seeker s market right now but if there s a recession that could change quickly so make hay while you can if you are not working or are looking for a better position now would be a good time to take advantage of the very strong job market and lock in a position said florida based certified financial planner mari adam cash in on the housing boomif you ve been on the fence about selling your home now might be the time to make the leap the housing market has been on a tear with year over year prices up 19 8 in february according to the latest s p corelogic case shiller home price report but mortgage rates are also on the rise which may dampen demand i would suggest that anyone planning to put their house on the market do so right away said adam cover your near term cash needshaving liquid assets to cover you in emergencies or severe market downturns is always a good idea but it s especially crucial when facing big events beyond your control including layoffs which typically increase during recessions that means having enough money set aside in cash money market funds or short term fixed income instruments to cover several months of living expenses emergencies or any big anticipated expense e g a down payment or college tuition this is also advisable if you are near or in retirement in that case you may want to set aside a year or more of living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio said rob williams managing director of financial planning retirement income and wealth management at charles schwab this should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments such as social security or a private pension in addition williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short term bond fund that will help you ride out any market downturns should one occur and give your investments time to recover don t trade on the headlinesrapid fire news reports about higher energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving but making financial decisions based on an emotional response to current events is often a losing proposition making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that regret said don bennyhoff chief investment officer for liberty wealth advisors and a former investment strategist at vanguard look back at periods of crisis over the last century and you ll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment and did well on average over time for example since the financial crisis hit in 2008 the s p 500 has returned 11 a year on average through 2021 according to data analyzed by first trust advisors the worst year in that period was 2008 when stocks fell 38 but in most of the years that followed the index posted a gain and four of its annual gains ranged between 23 and 30 if you go back as far as 1926 that annual average return on the s p has been 10 5 staying the course may be hard on your nerves but it can be healthiest for your portfolio williams said that s not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats or the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns but were things to truly escalate globally he noted we d have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios review your risk toleranceit s easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when stocks are soaring but you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing over time so review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead and while you re at it figure out what it means to you to lose money there are many definitions of risk and loss bennyhoff said for instance if you re keeping money in a savings account or cd any interest you re earning is likely being outpaced by inflation so while you preserve your principal you lose buying power over time then again if it s more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it which could happen when you invest in stocks that inflation based loss may be worth it to you because you re getting what bennyhoff calls a sleep easy return that said for longer term goals figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains over time you re better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth adam said rebalance your portfoliogiven record stock returns in the past few years now is a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven t done so in a while for instance adam said you may be overweight in growth stocks to help stabilize your returns going forward she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower growing dividend paying value stocks through a mutual fund and check to see that you have at least some exposure to bonds while inflation has resulted in the worst quarterly return in high quality bonds in 40 years don t count them out should a recession result from the fed s aggressive interest rate hikes to quell inflation bonds are likely to do well recessions tend to be far kinder to high quality bonds than they are to stocks bennyhoff said make new investments slowlyif you have a large lump sum maybe you just sold your business or house or you got an inheritance or big bonus you may wonder what to do with it now given all the global uncertainty adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically e g every month for a given period of time rather than all at once space out your investing over time since this week s news will be different than next week s news she said stay cool do your best then let go whatever the news today building financial security over time requires a cool steady hand don t let your feelings about the economy or the markets sabotage your long term growth stay invested stay disciplined history shows that what people or even experts think about the market is usually wrong the best way to meet your long term goals is just stay invested and stick to your allocation adam said doing so will help minimize any damage a rough market in 2022 may cause if you ve built an appropriately diversified portfolio that matches your time horizon and risk tolerance it s likely the recent market drop will be a mere blip in your long term investing plan williams said remember too it s impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information collect your facts try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance adam said then she added let go

under a recently proposed rhode island senate bill eligible residents would have to get the covid 19 vaccine or face a monthly fine and pay double their income tax example video title will go here for this video in january 2022 the u s supreme court blocked a federal vaccine mandate that required employees at large companies 100 workers to get vaccinated against covid 19 or undergo weekly testing but according to the supreme court states and cities can require vaccine mandates in certain instances state lawmakers have the authority to introduce laws that would require vaccine mandates or ban them in rhode island several state legislators are vying to push statewide mandates even further proposing to penalize residents who choose to remain unvaccinated with danmcgowan reporting that rhode islanders still strongly support a universal vaccine mandate despite the mckee administration pushing hard for the surrender policy it s time for us to pass my mandate bill cases are rising again surrender isn t working pic twitter com hxxkgf8bcg sam bell samuelwbell april 18 2022 the question verify viewer cameron wrote to us asking does a rhode island bill actually say that unvaccinated residents would be taxed more the sources the answer yes rhode island senate bill s2552 says that residents eligible for the covid 19 vaccine who opt against receiving it could face fines and pay more income tax unless they receive an exemption but that bill has not passed into law what we found rhode island senate bill s2552 was introduced to the state legislature on march 1 by state sen sam bell d providence as of april 26 the bill had not been passed into law and was under review by the senate health and human services committee the proposed bill states any eligible rhode island resident would have to be vaccinated against covid 19 and if they choose not to they could face a 50 monthly fine and pay double the state income tax fines for unvaccinated children under the age of 16 would be imposed on their parents or guardians according to the bill any resident could petition for an exemption from the statewide mandate the petition must be signed by three licensed physicians stating that the person is not a fit subject for immunization against covid 19 for medical reasons the rhode island department of health would have the power to investigate and potentially reject the petition employers would be responsible to show proof of taxation to the state of rhode island government according to the proposed bill any in person worker would have to be in compliance with covid 19 mandates but the requirement could be waived for remote workers this means remote workers might not necessarily face penalties but it would depend on the employer if an employer violates the covid 19 mandate under the new bill they would have to pay a 5 000 penalty per violation the state department of health and department of revenue would be responsible for ensuring compliance but the current bill does not specify the process of collecting the fines or additional taxes bell tweeted that he had been facing harsh criticism from antivax advocates since he introduced the bill he shared a screenshot of an expletive laden email he received that also contained threats to his family in a letter to constituents state sen jessica de la cruz r north smithfield said she would never support such legislation i have not nor will i ever support legislation that coerces rhode islanders into making medical decisions or face steep financial damages i hear my constituents and others around the state loud and clear this is dangerous legislation and sends the message that our government doesn t trust you to make the right choice for you and your family this is an unconscionable overreach of legislative powers the good news is this legislation has little chance of passing i won t rule it out but i don t believe it will pass that said i m not taking it for granted and neither should you the letter said according to the state of rhode island general assembly website the time it takes for a bill to become law varies the bill is currently being reviewed by a senate committee and from there the committee would have to recommend next steps for the legislation the committee could recommend passage of the bill as introduced recommend passage with amendments recommend passage of a different version of the bill entirely forward the bill to a different committee for their recommendation recommend the bill is indefinitely postponed offer no recommendation but allow the bill to move forward in which case it stands or falls on its own merit if the bill moves out of committee it would also have to be voted for approval in the house and senate before going to the governor for signing

when mary bach and her husband started thinking about retirement after more than three decade careers at westinghouse electric company they suddenly got numerous meal invitations from people who claimed to be local representatives for well known financial institutions these people with alphabet soups of letters following their names would present financial product pitches including numerous charts and graphs before the meal was served despite delicious food and impressive credentials bach said she didn t trust the presenters who lacked brochures prospectuses and details on how they conformed to state laws just lots of talk she said they did promise one thing though no risk with guaranteed returns their goal was to hook bach and others like her to later solicit them for private consultation our conclusion is enjoy the meal but be wary of the deal said bach in a panel discussion co hosted by the sec and the american association of retired persons bach who now works as chair of the aarp pennsylvania consumer issues task force to protect elderly citizens from fraud and scams said one representative with the fancy title of css or certified senior specialist later admitted to her that he had received a certificate in 24 hours via the internet we urge people to scrutinize credentials use brokercheck do their homework and understand that the printed contract always prevails over spoken promises and a nice dinner she said the fbi estimates that seniors lose more than 3 billion each year to fraudsters who either pitch risky financial products through free meals sell high yield bonds with so called guaranteed returns or dupe people into scanning qr codes at atm machines in local gas stations to invest in pseudo cryptocurrencies scammers go after seniors because they believe older adults have a significant amount of money sitting in their accounts and they are eager to exploit the combination of wealth and the cognitive decline that may come with age according to the national council on aging helping older investors know the signs of potential fraud to protect themselves to the assets they worked a lifetime to accrue must remain a central feature of our collective outreach effort sec commissioner hester m peirce said in the panel discussion but tackling the enormity of the financial markets for older investors can be tricky as just a few bad investments or unscrupulous advisors can be financially devastating said phillip aidikoff securities arbitration attorney and past president of public investors advocate bar association finra rules require that an oral presentation for financial products be consistent with the risks and rewards associated with a particular investment but many times those presentations are followed by investors being handed a complicated prospectus or initial offering document they don t understand which requires further oral presentations that must present a fair and balanced picture regarding both risks and rewards and let s face it even for people that are financially literate and can read through offering documents it does pose a challenge every time a new product is offered to the public it takes a while to get comfortable that you understand the true mechanics of the offering aidikoff said in reality brokers often receive substantial compensation for complicated alternative investments such
