ben life in many ways has returned to normal followinghe shakeup we all experience to more than a year ago the pandicem was difficult and isolated people and that has left many with anxiety and mental health challenges ma ria how do you know someone you are seeing for the first time may be struggling our eye opener anchor antoinette antonio tells us what to look for and what to do answer net and march 2020 life suddenly changed overnight antointe et in march 2020 life suddenly changed overnight streets and offices were empty 15 months later the elimination of pandemic restrictions happen aedost as quickly like somebody flipped a switch there was a huge mental people are not light switches people are not that quick to pivot antoinette dr duckworth is a psychiatrist and chief medical officer for the national alliance on mental illness he says the loss of conneconti with coworkers and family and friends revealed mental health challenges for some and compounded them for others he t rate of mental health conditions and substance use conditions essentially doubled during the pandemic from 1 in 5 to 2 in 5 at the same time the mental health went from becoming a they thing to a we thing i find a lo otf people are struggling with the gray space right now we are not normal times what we are also not in the pandemic deep end antoinette that struggle means you may notice things and difficulties fmro people that you have not seen face to face in a while the return to work for some people will be a relief connection contact routine for some peoe it s going to be a provocation or a stress of the unknowns has a coworker or a loved one how do you know the difference between simple adjustment and need rfoelp people who are struggling with mental health conditions usuayllleep poorly and that can show up in people s work effectiveness their ability to show up on time sleep and exhaustion is one thing that dr duckworth says yocau look for is your coworker or loved one functioning at a lower level having new difficulty with the boss is there a loss or interest in something they loved or statements about self harm if so the best thing to do is have a casual conversation remembethr at people can feel shamed don t lead with a pathology i think you have this diagnosis you know inquire with open ended questions do you want support around having difficulty with your boss do you want support around looking at your sleep and this is a conversation that they may be able to engage in mental health convsations are happening all across the country and they are happening now they were not happening two years ago this is an opportunity antoinette dr duckworth says everyone has a bad day or a bad week but someone with longer duration anxiety or depression should seek help a

the nationwide hotline is 800 273 talk that s 800 273 8255 or you can text c2t to 741 741 advertisement feeling anxious as things return to normal you re not alone experts say share copy link copy america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at ohio state university s wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brainif you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassionsafely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotionslike all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for helpnot everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find helpfirst look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals

july 1 marked one month since 2 450 workers at vale s sudbury ontario mining and processing complex went on strike workers have thus far rejected two concessions filled contract offers the first of these was unanimously recommended to them by the united steelworkers usw local 6500 bargaining committee the most recent was voted down 10 days into the strike with a decisive 87 percent of workers voting to reject in a ballot in which 84 percent of the strikers participated recognizing the anger and militancy among the workers the usw felt compelled to call for vale s second offer to be rejected even though it had advised acceptance of essentially the same terms less than two weeks earlier last saturday the world socialist web site reported on the attempt of vale s north atlantic chief operating officer dino otranto to bully and threaten the sudbury workers into making sweeping contract concessions otranto arrogantly asserted that the sudbury operations have the highest labour costs in vale s global empire and declared that a refusal to accept the givebacks demanded by the company would lead to a drying up of investment it s all about cost per ton he lectured the workers in a company town hall even as he depicted vale as financially hard pressed otranto boasted that vale s huge global assets will enable the company to endure a long strike in order to wear down the sudbury workers and extort concessions from them if the company is bold enough to make such a brazen attempt to intimidate and blackmail the striking miners it is because it knows full well that the usw is on its side if the union gets its way striking vale workers will be isolated on the picket lines with starvation strike pay as they were in the 2009 10 strike then forced to accept many of the same concessions they have bravely twice rejected poverty level strike pay the usw is paying vale strikers the measly sum of 370 per week about us 300 to workers earning the company s base wage this poverty level allowance is pitiable and amounts to even less than they would earn under unemployment insurance ei benefits or the federal government s makeshift pandemic canada emergency response benefit cerb it s maybe 30 percent of our wage it s not even the same as ei it s lower than ei one striking worker told the world socialist web site for a miner on the base wage ei would equate to 520 per week before rent or mortgage payments are even taken into account the average cost of living for a family of four in sudbury is 3 969 per month or 1 127 for a single person according to the world s largest cost of living database the average rental price of a one bedroom apartment in sudbury is 1 225 per month the strikers and their families are receiving poverty rations from an organization that routinely boasts that it is the largest private sector union in north america with more than 225 000 members in canada and over 850 000 dues paying members continent wide the usw has more than enough financial resources to provide a decent standard of living for the strikers however the reality is that the usw like the united auto workers unifor and the other state recognized pro capitalist trade union apparatuses is not an organization devoted to serving the interests of the workers it purports to represent over the past four decades the usw has abandoned any association it once had with workers struggles to secure limited improvements in their working conditions transformed itself into a junior partner of management and connived in the restructuring of mining steel and other basic industries at the expense of workers jobs and wages to facilitate this process it has promoted canadian and american nationalism pitting workers against each other and demobilizing them against the onslaught waged by globally mobile corporations like vale this pro corporate syndicate which is a union in name only exists not to defend the interests of workers but rather to meet the demands of its six figure salaried officials these demands include maintaining cooperative working relations with vale executives protecting the usw s investment portfolios and demonstrating to the federal government that the usw is a reliable partner in enforcing the dictates of canadian big business the usw s overall assets have risen more than 600 percent since the year 2000 and now sit at over 1 5 billion from these astonishingly deep pockets only 19 million was drawn out to spend on strike benefits in the entire year of 2020 this tiny fraction equates to only 2 4 percent of the usw s net assets meanwhile the union s top brass who hobnob regularly with government ministers and corporate executives gorge themselves on obscene salaries paid for by workers hard earned cash according to lm forms filed with the us office of labour management standards the combined total of usw president thomas m conway s gross salary benefits and other compensation amounts to a whopping 210 395 per year vice president david mccall s annual income surpasses even conway s with his total compensation reportedly being 217 762 the usw s national director for canada kenneth neumann receives 212 629 annually vice president fredrick redmond follows suit with a yearly sum of 212 489 the list goes on with hundreds of lesser known union functionaries earning generous six figure sums each year furthermore as the wsws has reported the bulk of the union s assets are invested in the stock market this means that the usw has a direct material incentive in suppressing strikes and wage increases in order to keep profits strong and stocks rising the meagre 19 million paid to striking workers in 2020 constituted less than a quarter of what the union earned from its stock trades and securities usw isolates strikers in addition to weakening workers ability to resist the company s concession demands by providing them poverty level strike pay the usw is working consciously to demobilize and isolate the striking vale miners the usw s website boasts our members work in nearly every industry and in every job imaginable in all regions of the country we work in call centres and credit unions mines and manufacturing plants offices and oil refineries restaurants and rubber plants sawmills and steel mills and security companies we work in nursing homes legal clinics social agencies and universities a genuine workers organization would mobilize this vast social power to support the vale strikers solidarity action to draw attention to the struggle would be called across all economic sectors where similar attacks on workers conditions are being imposed appeals would be made to other vale workers in canada including those employed at its nickel mining operations in voisey s bay labrador and thompson manitoba and around the world to stop production to bring the company to its knees but the usw has taken no measures to prepare solidarity action by other usw members let alone other sections of workers on the contrary it has even contrived to separate striking vale workers in sudbury from their co workers in port colborne ontario with its recommendation to adopt vale s initial offer the usw prevailed on the port colborne workers to vote in favour resulting in the work stoppage being isolated to sudbury from the outset this outrageous betrayal makes the usw complicit in imposing a contract on the port colborne workers that removes retiree health benefits for all new hires as part of the relentless stripping of benefits from the second tier workforce it also eliminated new hires eligibility for all insurances and hospital service coverage vale can now use this as a battering ram to compel the sudbury workers to accept no less ruthless givebacks as the strike continues into its second month the usw will continue to isolate the sudbury workers on starvation strike pay they will also continue to sit on their hands effectively inviting vale to run a massive scabbing operation similar to that it carried out during their bitter yearlong 2009 10 strike the union has given workers strict orders from the outset of the strike not to stop scabs or anyone else from entering vale facilities right off the bat straight from the hall this is from the president and vice president a vale striker told the world socialist web site the message was information lines only no picket lines we re not there to stop people from getting in and we don t want an injunction if people do cross we inform them we tell them and that s it go on their way miserly strike pay continued isolation and totally ineffectual picket lines workers must carefully consider the implications of this record the usw is a wealthy and powerful organization with enormous resources lying untapped at its fingertips that could and by all rights should be utilized to strengthen the strike action and ensure that workers demands are met the conclusions of this are unmistakable the usw serves to sabotage the strike and act in criminal complicity with vale workers cannot realize their entirely justified demands for wage increases and better working conditions while under the control of this pro company police force workers in sudbury must establish a rank and file strike committee independent of the usw in order to wage a genuine struggle against vale to lay the basis for a serious fight this committee should demand that the usw provide strikers with full pay from its multimillion dollar resources throughout the strike the committee should also formulate demands that start from what the workers actually need not what vale executives and their usw lackeys claim is affordable this should include a 25 percent wage increase to make up for all the concessions filled contracts over recent years an end to the multitier workforce full health care coverage for all paid for by vale and defined benefit pension plans for all workers to enforce these demands the strike must be broadened the rank and file strike committee should issue an appeal to vale workers in brazil indonesia and elsewhere miners across north america such as the striking warrior met coal miners in alabama and workers in all economic sectors to join them in a working class counteroffensive for decent paying secure jobs for all to unify these struggles vale workers and their class brothers and sisters should support the construction of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees
washington ap with the economy growing rapidly as it reopens from the pandemic many employers are increasingly desperate to hire yet evidence suggests that as a group the unemployed aren t feeling the same urgency to take jobs many people who are out of work are either seeking higher pay than they had before or are still reluctant to take jobs in public facing service companies for fear of contracting covid 19 how those two trends balance themselves out will likely set the pace for how many open positions employers can fill in the coming months on friday analysts expect the government to report that the economy added 675 000 jobs in june that would be a substantial gain but nowhere near the gains that could be expected given the record high number of job openings in fact some economists have estimated that monthly job growth would be at least twice what the three month average gain was for march april and may 540 000 if there were no constraints on the number of workers available to fill jobs for june the unemployment rate is projected to have dipped from 5 8 in may to a still elevated 5 7 total available jobs reached 9 3 million in april the highest in 20 years of data according to the labor department the employment website indeed has said that job postings have increased still further since then as the competition to keep and attract workers intensifies especially at restaurants and tourist and entertainment venues employers are offering higher pay along with signing and retention bonuses and more flexible working hours the proportion of job advertisements that promise a bonus has more than doubled in the past year indeed found the supply of potential hires is being held back by a variety of factors many americans still have health concerns about working around large numbers of people about 1 5 million people mostly women are no longer working or looking for work because they had to care for children when schools and day care centers shut down and roughly 2 6 million older workers took advantage of enlarged stock portfolios and home values to retire early a temporary 300 a week federal unemployment benefit on top of regular state jobless aid may be enabling some people to be more selective in looking for and taking jobs roughly half the states plan to stop paying the supplement by the end of july in what proponents say is an effort to nudge more of the unemployed to seek jobs economists at goldman sachs have calculated that in states that are cutting off the federal jobless payment early the number of people who are receiving state jobless aid is declining faster than in states that plan to pay the 300 a week benefit until it officially ends sept 6 that trend which suggests could help boost hiring in june and in the subsequent months on thursday the government reported that the number of people who applied for jobless aid last week fell to 364 000 the lowest level since the pandemic began there are also signs that people are re evaluating their work and personal lives and aren t necessarily interested in returning to their old jobs particularly those that offer modest wages the proportion of americans who quit their jobs in april reached its highest level in more than 20 years nearly 6 of workers who are in an industry category that includes restaurants hotels casinos and amusement parks quit their jobs in april twice the proportion of workers in all sectors who did so rising numbers of people quitting jobs often for higher paying positions mean that even employers that have been hiring may be struggling to maintain sufficient staffing levels a survey of manufacturers in june found widespread complaints among factory executives about labor shortages many said they were experiencing heavy turnover because of what they called wage dynamics other companies are luring their workers away with higher pay karen fichuk chief executive of randstad north america a recruiting and staffing firm said that the monster job board which randstad owns found that job postings jumped 40 from may to june job searches by contrast rose just 4 there is a significant gap between supply and demand fichuk said the struggle to fill jobs coincides with a swiftly growing economy in the first three months of the year the government estimated that the economy expanded at a strong 6 4 annual rate in the just ended april june quarter the annual rate is thought to have reached a sizzling 10 and for all of 2021 the congressional budget office estimated thursday that growth will amount to 6 7 that would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 in the meantime consumer confidence rose in june according to the conference board and is nearly back to its pre pandemic level americans also seem undeterred by recent price increases with the percentage of consumers who plan to buy a home car or major appliance all rising home prices shot up in april by the most in 15 years factory output is also expanding at a healthy pace in part because companies are investing more in industrial machinery aircraft and technology those investments could make workers more efficient in the coming years and boost longer term growth copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

photo credit alamy stock photo after more than a year of living through covid 19 the worst of the pandemic in the u s appears to be over daily cases peaked in early january at more than 250 000 per day but ever since the u s has seen sharp declines in covid 19 positive cases even as more contagious variants have emerged now the u s is looking toward a summer that might finally look a little closer to normal one of the biggest factors in the wind down of the pandemic has been the availability of covid 19 vaccines covid 19 vaccines first became available for select populations in december 2020 and by late april any u s adult was eligible to get the pfizer moderna or johnson johnson vaccine according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention more than 50 of the total u s population had received at least one dose as of the beginning of june and 41 of the population was fully vaccinated going from zero vaccinated individuals to more than half the population in a span of six months is no small feat and vaccination trends showed impressive growth early in the year after an initially bumpy rollout daily doses administered averaged 1 million in mid january 2 million in early march and 3 million at the beginning of april including several days with more than 4 million doses administered in total nearly 300 million doses had been administered by the end of may however public health officials have since become increasingly worried at slowing rates of vaccine administration experts believe that the population is still far off from reaching herd immunity to the coronavirus through vaccinations but overall demand for the vaccine has nonetheless tapered off throughout the spring the 7 day average of doses administered peaked at around 3 3 million on april 11 but by the end of may that figure had dropped below 1 million doses per day even though it is easier than it has ever been to get the vaccine one of the key issues in vaccine administration has been vaccine skepticism public health experts have long anticipated that there would be hesitancy around the safety and efficacy of covid 19 vaccines especially given the accelerated food and drug administration process to get the immunizations approved reports of unpleasant side effects have also been a major source of hesitancy these concerns may have been exacerbated by the temporary pause to the johnson johnson vaccine rollout in april after a handful of patients developed blood clots after receiving the single dose shot others are skeptical of the risks of covid 19 at this stage in the pandemic many individuals who have previously tested positive for the virus have declined to take a vaccine believing themselves to be safe from future infections due to natural immunity and as covid 19 cases have taken a steep decline some feel the virus no longer poses a threat but arguably two of the most important factors in the vaccine rollout have been demographics and geography in terms of demographics the vaccination rate for seniors one of the populations most vulnerable to severe illness and death for covid 19 outstrips that of the general population with three in four adults aged 65 fully vaccinated as of early june in some leading states like vermont hawaii and pennsylvania more than 95 of the senior population has received at least one dose other demographic factors like income levels and educational attainment also show positive relationships with vaccination rates based on polling data geographically the success of the vaccine rollout has varied widely from state to state some state governments have been much more successful than others in managing the logistics of vaccine administration and launching public education and information campaigns to address vaccine skepticism a state s politics also play a role as states that lean conservative tend to have lower vaccination rates in part due to the politicization of covid 19 response during the elections to determine which states had the highest covid 19 vaccination rates heading into summer researchers at sidecar health utilized data from the cdc s covid data tracker and ranked states by the percentage of residents that were fully vaccinated in the event of a tie the state with the greater percentage of residents receiving at least one dose was ranked higher here are the 15 states

hey there time traveller this article was published 30 06 2021 1015 days ago so information in it may no longer be current new york ap the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing alan futerfas an attorney with the trump organization s defense team leaves court thursday july 1 2021 in new york new york prosecutors announced the first criminal indictment in a two year investigation into trump s business practices accusing his namesake company and allen weisselberg of tax crimes related to fringe benefits for employees ap photo mark lennihan here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in both companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort

privacy policies and casl agreement while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s name over the door ___ this story has been corrected to remove an erroneous reference to bank of america being convicted of reckless

the trump organization and its chief financial officer alan weisberg pleaded not guilty today to tax fraud charges and grand larceny in manhattan state court these charges were more than two years in the making that followed an intensive investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office which subpoena the presidents former presidents tax records um and had investigated many aspects of his business before bringing this case trump himself was not charged in the indictment unsealed today but the manhattan district attorney s office has stressed for weeks that the investigations are still ongoing even as these charges have been made public it s a significant case on many fronts because a former president is being placed in the perilous position of having to defend criminal charges against his own company there s also been rampant speculation that the chief financial officer alan white hesselberg could face pressure to flip and provide information to prosecutors that could be detrimental to the president that s something that s been watched very closely and will continue to be watched mhm weisberg who is known as an intensely private man and lived in a modest home in long island claimed to continue to claim residency there despite living in a company paid manhattan apartment according to the prosecution and by doing so he concealed that he was in new york city resident and avoided paying more than 900 000 in federal state and city income taxes and collected about 133 in refunds to which he wasn t entitled prosecutors set y spielberg himself could face jail time if convicted of these serious charges but the trump organization itself would likely be forced to pay fines or fees and perhaps even change the way that it operates if convicted work more advertisement explainer how could the indictment hurt trump s company share copy link copy the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s name over the door

listen to this article listen to this article with the economy growing rapidly as it reopens from the pandemic many employers are becoming desperate to hire yet the evidence suggests that as a group the unemployed aren t feeling much urgency to find work how those two trends balance themselves out will likely set the pace for how many open positions employers can fill in the coming months on friday analysts expect the government to report that the economy added 675 000 jobs in june that would be a substantial gain but nowhere near as many hirings as would be expected given the demand for labor and the record high number of job openings in fact some economists have estimated that monthly job growth would be at least twice what the three month average gain was for march april and may 540 000 if there were no constraints on the number of workers available to fill jobs for june the unemployment rate is projected to have dipped from 5 8 in may to a still elevated 5 7 the record total of posted job openings reached 9 3 million in april according to the labor department the employment website indeed has said that job postings have increased still further since then as the competition to keep and attract workers intensifies especially at restaurants and tourist and entertainment venues employers are offering higher pay along with signing and retention bonuses and more flexible working hours the proportion of job advertisements that promise a bonus has more than doubled in the past year indeed found the supply of potential hires is being held back by a variety of factors some people who are out of work are still reluctant to take on service jobs that involve interacting with the public because of covid 19 about 1 5 million people mostly women are no longer working or looking for work because they had to care for children when schools and day care centers shut down and roughly 2 6 million older workers took advantage of enlarged stock portfolios and home values to retire early there is also increasing evidence that people are re evaluating their work and personal lives and aren t necessarily interested in returning to their old jobs particularly those that offer modest wages the proportion of americans who quit their jobs in april reached its highest level in more than 20 years nearly 6 of workers who are in an industry category that includes restaurants hotels casinos and amusement parks quit their jobs in april twice the proportion of workers in all sectors who did so rising numbers of people quitting jobs often for higher paying positions mean that even employers that have been hiring may be struggling to maintain sufficient staffing levels a survey of manufacturers in june found widespread complaints among factory executives about labor shortages many said they were experiencing heavy turnover because of what is called wage dynamics other companies are luring their workers away with higher pay karen fichuk chief executive of randstad north america a recruiting and staffing firm said that the monster job board which randstad owns found that job postings jumped 40 from may to june job searches by contrast rose just 4 there is a significant gap between supply and demand fichuk said the struggle to fill jobs coincides with a swiftly growing economy in the first three months of the year the government estimated that the economy expanded at a strong 6 4 annual rate in the just ended april june quarter the annual rate is thought to have reached a sizzling 10 and for all of 2021 the congressional budget office estimated thursday that growth will amount to 6 7 that would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 in the meantime consumer confidence rose in june according to the conference board and is nearly back to its pre pandemic level americans also seem undeterred by recent price increases with the percentage of consumers who plan to buy a home car or major appliance all rising home prices shot up in april by the most in 15 years factory output is also expanding at a healthy pace in part because companies are investing more in industrial machinery aircraft and technology those investments could make workers more efficient in the coming years and boost longer term growth to sign up for free citybusiness updates click here

a hawkish turn by the federal reserve has woken up world markets to the prospect that policymakers might soon start withdrawing monetary and fiscal stimulus and the risk of too hasty action that could choke off the economic recovery before it is secured fed officials have brought forward expectations for u s interest rate rises to 2023 from 2024 and opened talks on how to end crisis era bond buying norway could lift rates as early as september while strong new zealand data has prompted economists to bring forward rate hike expectations there germany s jens weidmann and austria s robert holzmann this week became the first european central bank officials to openly debate winding down its 1 85 trillion euro 2 2 trillion pandemic emergency stimulus investors are starting to feel wary premature monetary tightening to contain inflation after the 2008 global financial crisis hurt growth forcing central banks to backtrack it s important to acknowledge that it s better to keep in place monetary stimulus too long rather than taking it away too early said zurich insurance group s chief market strategist guy miller if inflation picks up and the economy runs too hot the ecb will be well positioned to tackle it if you take stimulus away too early the situation is going to become very difficult the ecb lifted rates in april and july 2011 as a debt crisis raged just to cut them four months later the fed started raising rates in 2015 a move many analysts now view as a policy error that unnecessarily stalled the post crisis recovery a russell investments second quarter survey of fund managers last week showed 50 of 72 respondents expect the fed to deliver its inflation promise down about 10 percentage points from q1 they expect higher inflation and treasury yields there are parallels with the past and that s very useful for markets right now said gerard fitzpatrick global head of fixed income at russell investments concern about the fed hiking extra early we re already starting to see a sense of that coming through he added noting rising economic growth and inflation key measures of business activity in the united states and europe are at their highest in years inflation too is rearing its head judging by the latest 5 u s inflation print one concern is that a less dovish fed could pave the way for other central banks to follow warning but perhaps it s the lessons of withdrawing fiscal stimulus too soon that policymakers really need to heed government stimulus after the financial crisis was small in comparison to that unleashed after covid 19 in some places like europe stimulus was then quickly withdrawn as austerity prevailed governments allocated 10 trillion for stimulus in just two months last year and for some countries their response as a percentage of gdp was nearly 10 times what it was post 2008 according to mckinsey company david riley chief investment strategist at bluebay asset management said the mistake after the financial crisis was dialling back fiscal support too soon leaving central banks to carry the burden of bolstering economies he added that central banks were right to starting thinking about scaling back hefty monetary stimulus the main concern i have is that it tapering is taken by governments as a sign that they can t provide more fiscal support as the monetary policy backstop gets withdrawn and they start worrying about bond vigilantes he said referring to investors punishing profligate governments by pushing up borrowing costs in bond markets the risk is we get a return to austerity too soon a 559 billion u s infrastructure deal last week was smaller than anticipated with strong opposition from republicans likely to limit plans for further stimulus germany s september election could also be key the ruling conservative christian democrats cdu now leading in the polls are promising tight public finances although economists believe germany will be unable to balance its books soon morgan stanley s head of european economics jacob nell said the premature withdrawal of fiscal support that ecb chief christine lagarde has warned about is just what the cdu manifesto calls for we think they will negotiate this away in the coalition talks after the election but you know there is a live risk of a rapid return to fiscal consolidation he said overall however analysts pointed to signs that governments were determined to keep support flowing eu fiscal rules have been suspended again this year and bofa estimates that the u s government will spend 879 million every hour in 2021 while the bank for international settlements warned in its annual report this week about daunting challenges ahead for policymakers when they eventually seek to normalise policy for now the flow of cheap

a recent letter to the editor attacked democrats and president biden for trying to turn america into a socialist country here s another perspective one of the ways americans are divided politically is in their views of socialism republicans view socialism as government control of society from controlling the means of production in the economy to controlling what people can think say or do democrats view socialism as a way of treating people more equally and of government helping make people s lives better with such things as universal health care improving policing methods and perhaps free tuition for college a gallup poll article from october 2018 shows how americans views of socialism have changed since the 1930s it states now almost 70 years later americans views of socialism have broadened while many still view socialism as government control of the economy as modified communism and as embodying restrictions on freedoms in several ways an increased percentage see it as representing equality and government provision of benefits advertisement these results make it clear that socialism is a broad concept that can and is understood in a variety of ways by americans republicans who are overwhelmingly negative about socialism tend to skew toward seeing socialism as government control of the economy and in derogatory terms while democrats a majority of whom are positive about socialism are more likely to view it as government provision of services i grew up in a nebraska republican farm family who didn t much care for government but i benefited greatly from government social programs my biological father was killed in an army air force plane crash before i was born and because of that my mother who remarried received government payments for me for 18 years without that help i never would have been able to go to college or to medical school as a doctor in park rapids many of my patients got their health care funding through medicare and medicaid and now that i m retired part of my income is from social security so one could say i ve been on the government dole all my life for this i m grateful and think i ve repaid some of this via work and taxes the preamble to the constitution says that one of the goals of the government should be to promote the general welfare i don t believe in socialism as being total government control of society but rather as a way to help people live better i d like to see universal health care and also tuition help for post secondary students i think people should be treated equally no matter what their skin color is i like government programs that help ensure clean water food air good roads and bridges police and fire protection a great recycling center and good education advertisement as someone who has a retirement portfolio with stocks and bonds i like capitalism and its benefits but i d like more government and business emphasis on reducing fossil fuel use promoting clean energy to mitigate climate change and keeping america energy independent i think wealthy individuals and companies should pay their fair share in taxes so i guess i m a democratic socialist and will just have to bear with republican criticism of this so be it

101 ash st and civic center plaza photos by adriana heldiz this post has been updated san diego is betting a state anti corruption law can be an escape hatch from two city leases that a real estate guru it had considered a volunteer received more than 9 million to help execute city attorney mara elliott and a team of lawyers allege former adviser jason hughes violated government code section 1090 which bars government officials from having financial interests in contracts they broker in their official capacities in past cases the law has also applied to contractors and consultants like hughes particularly when they provide advice to government officials the law is based on the premise that government officials should act in the best interest of taxpayers rather than their own attorneys for the city argue that hughes the architect of the city s civic center plaza and 101 ash st lease to own deals never told the city that the middleman in the deal developer cisterra paid him 9 4 million for his work on the city leases and that the arrangement and the role he played in negotiations amount to a major conflict of interest the city took two legal actions this week to try to undo the two leases if the city cases are successful the penalties could be steep a court victory in a government code section 1090 case can lead to voided transactions and contracts and orders to pay back governments as the city is seeking to do with the civic center plaza and 101 ash deals violators can also be criminally charged if investigators can prove they knowingly skirted the law hughes has not been charged with any crimes unsurprisingly elliott s office and hughes attorney have opposing views on the city s prospects of backing out of the two deals hughes attorney argues hughes didn t violate the law and that the legal actions elliott s office took this week amount to political grandstanding while elliott s office argues the attorney s arguments thus far don t hold water several attorneys who spoke to voice of san diego this week said they believe the city has a viable case against hughes a few including hughes attorney noted that there are issues that could trip up the city s quest to kill the two lease deals including hughes unique dealings with the city and a statute of limitations on government code section 1090 cases ann ravel a bay area attorney who once chaired the state fair political practices commission and the federal election commission is among those who believes the city has a case that hughes violated the state conflict of interest law he used his position with the city essentially to negotiate a huge contract on his own behalf which is exactly what government code section 1090 was intended to preclude and prevent ravel said he was the one who convinced the city to enter into this contract that gave him an enormous amount of money michael attanasio a veteran white collar defense attorney now representing hughes argues his client was an informal adviser rather than an employee subject to the state law and that he took pains to let top city officials know he hoped to get paid for his work on the deals he also cites a 2017 state supreme court opinion that included a passage suggesting outside contractors hired by government agencies may not always conclude they need to subordinate their own financial interests to the public s jason s transparent disclosures to senior city officials are fatal to the city attorney s allegation attanasio wrote in an email to vosd jason disclosed that he would seek compensation from third parties on alternative lease to own transactions to the mayor the mayor s chief of staff the chief financial officer the deputy chief operating officer and the director of real estate assets the latter official cybele thompson signed an agreement with jason in which she specifically acknowledged and agreed that he would seek compensation from other parties thompson former mayor kevin faulconer and his then chief of staff stephen puetz have told vosd they don t recall signing off on any payments elliott spokeswoman hilary nemchik said the city had only received unconfirmed reports of cisterra s payments to hughes until monday when developer cisterra provided documents confirming it had paid hughes nemchik also told vosd that city attorneys are certain hughes position with the city and the payments he received put him the crosshairs of government code section 1090 despite his attorney s arguments to the contrary this is a textbook conflict of interest case where hughes put his own interests ahead of his duty to represent the city elliott wrote in a statement he has not produced any evidence that he disclosed his substantial financial interests in these deals to the city or to the public we are confident that the court will agree a handful of attorneys told vosd that hughes reported disclosures about his plans to be paid and his unique role advising the city on real estate issues are likely to be significant points of debate in the case in 2013 as the city faced a series of downtown real estate woes then mayor bob filner took up hughes offer to serve as an unpaid real estate adviser the two played up the value that the city would get from the arrangement including savings from commissions it would otherwise pay other real estate brokers i appreciate jason s commitment to public service in this advisory role which he will perform without compensation from any party filner wrote in an april 2013 press release announcing the appointment more than a year into the volunteer arrangement the city faced the prospect of being forced to quickly move hundreds of city employees out of civic center plaza after its longtime lease went month to month and a legal challenge stalled efforts to go to the bond market to fund a quick purchase hughes came up with a solution in the form of a lease to own deal that would allow the city to essentially pay a monthly mortgage and own the building after 20 years cisterra would take on the city s earlier 44 million purchase deal to buy civic center plaza and then execute the lease with the city hughes attorney said he flagged his intent to be paid by parties on the other side of that deal in emails and a letter obtained by vosd but former top city officials including puetz say they were shocked this week to learn that cisterra paid hughes just over 5 million in fees for civic center plaza and 4 4 million for the virtually identical ash street deal nearly two years later most attorneys who spoke to vosd this week with the exception of hughes attorney said they believed hughes would be subject to government code 1090 despite simply signing on with the city as a volunteer gary schons a former senior assistant attorney general who later spent years advising governments on issues including 1090 was among those who said hughes likely wouldn t have an out simply because the city didn t pay him it doesn t matter that he wasn t paid schons said he voluntarily took it upon himself to put himself in a position to work with the city to work on their behalf schons who reviewed the letter hughes said he shared with city officials said hughes disclosures to the city about cisterra s payments were also lacking because he never specified who was paying him and how much he was being paid in those disclosures it s a meaningless disclosure schons said it s not a disclosure at all ravel agreed his disclosure was not full disclosure and his relationships were not full disclosure ravel said that s the issue attanasio has said city officials could have asked for further disclosures or legal reviews after hughes presented them with the november 2014 letter describing his intent to be paid but never did all they had to do was say so attanasio wrote in an email to vosd attorney gil cabrera who once chaired the city s ethics commission highlighted the decision by hughes legal team to essentially argue that his disclosures and status as a volunteer consultant to the city should make him an exception to government code 1090 in most cases cabrera said disclosure doesn t negate a conflict of interest they re arguing that it s possible that his interests are reasonably in place given his disclosures but the general rule is outside consultants with influence on a municipal decision are subject to 1090 cabrera said those arguments are crucial cabrera said because hughes unique position and his disclosures mean the case against him will likely be battled in court for years after all there hasn t been another case exactly like it there s no slam dunk because ultimately some court of appeal will have to decide whether in fact hughes was subject to 1090 cabrera said before the case ever gets to that point attanasio has another legal argument he plans to float he s preparing to contend that a four year statute of limitations for government code section 1090 should apply since the law states that any legal actions should kick off within four years after the plaintiff has uncovered issues or in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the statute of limitations applies in this case attanasio said because hughes notified the city in 2014 that he wanted to be paid for lease to own agreements and got thompson s signature on a letter saying so thompson has said she doesn t recall signing the letter the statute of limitations began to run when the city knew exactly what it is complaining about now that jason would be paid on the civic center plaza and 101 ash transactions attanasio wrote the time to bring this claim ran out in 2018 former city attorney mike aguirre part of a team of attorneys challenging the 101 ash acquisition in a separate civil suit also noted the statute of limitations this week and questioned whether past disclosures might complicate the city s case it s important to know when the city attorney knew and it s important to know how did the city attorney come to know aguirre said at a wednesday press conference elliott said that her office pursued legal action against hughes alleged 1090 violations as soon as it documented them building a solid case requires upfront work once we had the facts we needed to prove our case we amended our lawsuit and initiated the civic center plaza litigation elliott wrote in a statement update this post has been updated to include a statement from the city attorney
new york ap the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay of tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived including bank of america which was convicted for reckless mortgage lending practices others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that prices in condos in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even

the work of art in the age of second order observation on june 3 2021 the online magazine artnet reported that the hitherto little known italian artist salvatore garau auctioned off an invisible sculpture for 18 300 the sculpture it was added is made literally of nothing the buyer of the sculpture we are informed received a certificate of authenticity and a set of instructions for its display it must be exhibited in a private house in a roughly five by five foot space free of obstruction it is neither new nor especially provocative today to create and sell un created art there is a well established category for such works the term work as paradoxical as it is is still used in this context and for the people that make them they are conceptual artists this is to say that instead of focusing first of all on making material objects these artists wish to somehow visualize represent or as in this case stimulate ideas garau s invisible sculpture is far from original and firmly rooted in a tradition of art that consists in presenting or exhibiting something or nothing rather than making it marcel duchamp for instance created his famous ready mades already more than a century ago thanks to its paradoxical quality nothingness has often and long ago featured prominently in conceptual art in the early 1950s john cage composed 4 33 four minutes thirty three seconds or four thirty three a piece of non music simply instructing the performing musicians not to play their instruments for precisely that duration at roughly the same time robert rauschenberg s white paintings were made consisting of several panels that show nothing except their white surface as it is common for artists garau has exhibited a whole series of similar works in may and june 2021 the invisible sculpture afrodite cries was displayed in front of the new york stock exchange its exact position indicated by a white circle on the ground a few months earlier an invisible buddha in contemplation was to be imagined in front of the famous scala opera house in milan this time for a change its location was indicated by a white square the title buddha in contemplation signals to the public that garau wants to be associated with buddhism buddhist art just like daoist art has been depicting emptiness for more than a thousand years since this notion is so central to both these philosophical and religious traditions referencing buddhism and daoism in contemporary western conceptual art is also not new john cage for instance had done exactly this many decades ago as well just as obvious and old as garau s artistic method and subject is their critique one of my favorite songs as a teenager was in the gallery by dire straits recorded in 1978 it is about the death of an artist named harry who as the lyrics go had to work in clay and stone and made realistic statues for and about the working class including a fine coal miner for the national coal board which had been running the publicly owned coal mining industry in the uk until it was eventually privatized harry however made no career and not much money as an artist the song compares him with more successful peers saying and then you got an artist says he doesn t want to paint at all takes an empty canvas and sticks it to the wall such phonies and fakes as they are called in the song thrive in the art business because as the lyrics continue it is the dealers who decide who gets the breaks and who is going to be in the gallery this simple song still resonates with me as do its lyrics and it calls to mind a story i ve been liking since my childhood hans christian andersen s 19th century tale of the emperor s new clothes my intentions here however are neither aesthetical nor political as conventional as salvatore garau s art may be aesthetically and as problematic as it may be politically i want to approach it from a theoretical perspective instead analyzing garau s invisible sculptures i will be making five brief points that i hope to be of philosophical relevance the first is about how these sculptures confirm the relevance of the concept of exhibition value coined by walter benjamin in his groundbreaking essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction in the 1930s the remaining four points are about how those invisible sculptures illustrate niklas luhmann s more recent concept of second order observation and the notion of profilicity that is derived from it 1 garau s brief instructions for the buyer of his sculpture express perfectly what can be called with some irony especially given the unfortunate philosophical connotations of this expression the origin of his works of art according to the artnet report the instruction stipulates that the sculpture must be exhibited invisible art can only be perceived when exhibited as art its invisibility makes it entirely non existent if not explicitly displayed you may stumble across harry s fine coal miner in a thrift store and see it for what it s worth this is impossible with garau s buddha in contemplation it is precisely its exhibition and nothing else that makes this buddha existent moreover it is most fitting for afrodite cries to make its home in front of the new york stock exchange this location perfectly symbolizes the symbiosis between value and exhibition in modern art described by benjamin the higher the value of the exhibition venue the higher the value of that which is exhibited this is also the case vice versa the higher the value of that which is exhibited the higher the value of the exhibition venue tellingly the artnet headline on garau s work not only highlights its invisibility but also the price it achieved at an auction pure exhibition an exhibition that does not generate value is not an exhibition if the invisible sculpture had not achieved a price we would have hardly heard about it in the news it would have remained simply nothing this is the first thing we can learn from salvatore garau the origin of the work of art in our society lies in its exhibition and in the value generated by this exhibition 2 traditional aesthetic approaches to art made sense of it within the framework of first order observation someone looks at or listens to a work of art thereby the artistic quality of the artwork traditionally often called its beauty is revealed some have attributed this artistic quality of that which is seen or heard to the work of art itself in this case beauty was supposed to be a property of the work others attributed beauty to the eyes of the beholder in this case beauty was believed to be created through experience or reception however you prefer to call it others yet would point to the resonance between a work of art and its audience and accordingly a more dynamic aesthetics could be proposed based on the interaction between subject and object salvatore garau s invisible sculptures enable us to move beyond such traditional aesthetics today art lies neither in the aesthetic properties of an object nor in the aesthetic experience of a subject clearly the buddha in contemplation has no objective properties whatsoever and whatever aesthetic experiences those who look at the empty space it occupies may have they are hardly relevant for the buddha to become a work of art in order to see that the buddha in contemplation is a work of art we need to switch to second order observation it is revealed as art only by being communicated as art in the self referential social system of the art world when we read about it in artnet when it is sold at an auction when it is exhibited in new york and milan then and only then do we know that it is art this is the second thing we can learn from salvatore garau to observe something as art in today s society it is insufficient to simply observe or experience an artwork you must observe that it is being observed as art in this way even if there is actually nothing to be observed in the mode of first order observation it is still art 3 when observing a work of art in the mode of second order observation all we observe is communication we read an article about afrodite cries on the web we watch a video on it on youtube we hear a philosopher talking about it on a podcast we see that it is presented to an audience in an exhibition or know it has been sold to someone for a price written or spoken texts filmed videos staged exhibitions and paid prices are different forms of communication in art when moving to second order observation we move beyond the aesthetic and into the social second order observation does not observe material objects personal experiences or anything material or psychological at least not directly instead we observe communication about material or psychological or other events when we observe the buddha in contemplation as art we cannot but see it as communicated or in society in this sense second order observation that is the social sphere frames and enables first order observation that is for instance the psychological experience of objects this is the third thing we can learn from salvatore garau you cannot contemplate the buddha in contemplation without having been told about it first second order observation frames everything in communication 4 obviously salvatore garau doesn t literally make any artworks so what does he do by organizing exhibitions having his art auctioned and providing opportunities for it to be reported on he curates a profile his profile as an artist in the art scene and beyond his actual activity as a sculpturer lies not in sculpturing material sculptures but in sculpturing his own second order observation identity profiles are identities produced for and emerging in the mode of second order observation this is the fourth thing we can learn from salvatore garau today artists do not simply create artworks more importantly they curate profiles a second order observation identity while the buddha in contemplation remains invisible salvatore garau s profile is seen ever more clearly 5 we now understand that the certificate issued to the buyer of salvatore garau s invisible sculpture has been misnamed it should not have been called a certificate of authenticity but a certificate of profilicity by creating his invisible sculptures salvatore garau depicts not buddhist or daoist emptiness but illustrates how profile curation works today the fifth and final point is thank you for enabling us to understand so clearly how a profile based identity is created and curated salvatore garau you are the michelangelo of profilicity

bismarck tribune nd jul 1 drought conditions in north dakota improved only slightly over the past week and crops hay and pasture land across the state continue to suffer meanwhile another hot and mostly dry weekend is in store for independence day revelers exceptional drought the worst of four categories still covers about 18 of the state roughly the north central region according to the latest u s drought monitor map published thursday extreme drought the second worst category impacts another 43 down just 3 from last week and all of north dakota remains in some form of drought rainfall helped improve soil moisture and stream flows in some parts of the state but in areas which missed out on the heaviest rain drought continues to impact the region with cattle producers feeling the brunt of the impacts national drought mitigation center climatologist deborah bathke wrote producers from wyoming eastward across the dakotas are having to make tough decisions as to what to do with cattle with many selling entire herds she said struggling producers this week s crop report from the national agricultural statistics service rates pasture and range conditions in north dakota as being 65 poor or very poor stock water supplies are 74 in those categories both percentages are relatively stable over the week the first cutting of the alfalfa hay crop is about half complete slightly ahead of the average pace and more than half of the crop continues to be rated poor or very poor only 10 of the crop is rated in good condition the weekly report rates 66 of topsoil moisture and 78 of subsoil moisture in north dakota as being short or very short of moisture both slight improvements from the previous week forty four percent of the state s staple spring wheat crop is rated in poor or very poor condition down 6 over the week about one fourth of the corn crop and one third of the soybean crop remain in those categories farmers and ranchers during recent drought meetings hosted by state and federal officials have spoken of wheat that is only 3 inches tall but already heading out the head is where the grain kernels form any time you have growth that s that minimal your yield is going to be tied to it said tyler kralicek agriculture and natural resources agent in burleigh county for north dakota state university extension the healthiness of the plant is severely diminished when it s that tall he said whatever grain development you re going to have is going to be minimal as well wheat that short also might not be picked up by a combine kralicek said producers who have attended the drought meetings have asked for more help and flexibility from the federal government including permission to hay conservation reserve program land before aug 1 while the hay is still of good quality crp acres normally are left idle to prevent erosion and provide wildlife habitat haying crp acres in mid july would provide a chance for regrowth if rain were to fall bismarck farmer clark coleman chairman of the national sunflower association said during a wednesday meeting in mandan hosted by u s sen john hoeven r n d and attended by the heads of two federal agriculture agencies if crp land is hayed in august even if rain follows that opportunity is gone coleman said realistically aug 10 we re not going to get much regrowth he said we need to speed the process up hoeven s tour with risk management agency acting administrator richard flournoy and farm service agency administrator zach ducheneaux was continuing thursday in carrington and argusville our producers are facing historic drought conditions which impact every corner of the state with the majority of counties in the extreme drought category or worse hoeven said in a statement it is critical that administrators flournoy and ducheneaux are here in north dakota to hear about these challenges directly from our producers lake advisories north dakota s department of environmental quality on thursday issued blue green algae advisories for a dozen lakes including sweet briar lake in morton county hot summer weather contributes to the production of the algae that can produce

follow us on image source ap the trump organization s chief financial officer allen weisselberg second from left arrives to a courtroom in new york the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived including bank of america which was convicted for reckless mortgage lending practices others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s name over the door also read jeff bezos picks female aerospace pioneer to rocket into space with him

don t miss out on the headlines from victoria followed categories will be added to my news this coronavirus article is unlocked and free to read in the interest of community health and safety click here for full digital access to trusted news from the herald sun and leader for just 1 a week for the first 12 weeks melbourne has recorded no new local covid cases overnight and just one new case in hotel quarantine acting premier james merlino said it is good news and news i know everyone in victoria wanted to hear but he warned that while it was a terrific outcome it was nowhere near over victorians have done an awesome effort in getting tested getting vaccinated following the rules we are not out of the woods yet today having zero cases is a great reflection of the work of all victorians there is a total of 75 active cases in the community and 17 604 tests were processed on thursday mr merlino urged those in craigieburn to get tested as he said testing numbers were lower than expected in some areas we would like to see an uplift because of community transmission it was lower than we would have liked in some parts of melbourne i am asking victorians that if you live in the craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday please go out and get tested today he said acting premier james merlino says victorians are not out of the woods yet picture david crosling chief health officer brett sutton also urged victorians to keep testing efforts up the week ahead probably won t be all zero cases we have thousands of primary close contacts some of which will become positive it is not a concern as they all quarantined for the entire period it has only been 48 hours since we had cases of uncertain acquisition the genomic sequence from the four mystery cases in the same reservoir household has indicated they re carrying the kappa strain of virus prof sutton said that finding was consistent with the existing city of whittlesea outbreak the dhhs is still searching for the source of exposure for the two queensland cases in melbourne they have gone through a long interview process with us prof sutton said we thank them for that it is a tiring process lots of detail around where they have been we have been looking quite a bit earlier than june for that acquisition where they may have picked it up whether or not they were infectious through that he said mr merlino said a number of exposure sites would come up as a result of the couple who had travelled to queensland but could not say if the pair would be fined a large line forms at the food bank pop up

images masks remain mandatory outside picture david crosling restrictions to stay in place prof sutton said the state would not ease restrictions sooner than planned given the kappa variant link with the reservoir household he said he wasn t suprised by friday s zero cases obviously primary close contacts isolating at home has helped to control this he said although tracing work has helped to control this and all the great testing that has been done has allowed us to find cases and then control them so we are going to get days of zero i expect they will be more and i also expect there will be days when we have new cases each day it isn t over yet we are on the right track as the city s restrictions eased on monday prof sutton said he had never backed lockdowns as the first measure to tackle an outbreak they will never be the first measure they will be a measure that we implement when we have to do and only when we have to do there are so many sad stories and struggles that people are reporting on my heart goes out to them i cannot fathom what it has meant across victoria throughout lockdown and through all of the circuit breakers and lockdowns across australia we are doing this with the minimum restrictions that keep us safe the alternative with this running away is too awful to imagine in some respects however he said mystery cases would trigger tighter restrictions but couldn t say whether the emergence of more mystery cases would lead to another lockdown of course mystery cases where there are concerns about high risk settings would be of concern there will be mystery cases where people have had very little interaction or there is a significant suggestion where they may have picked it up geographically or otherwise there is no one size fits all each on its own merits chief health officer brett sutton says mystery cases will trigger more restrictions picture andrew henshaw shopper return to bourke street mall picture david crosling covid jab a path out of lockdowns more than 17 000 victorians were vaccinated on thursday mr merlino said the commonwealth had assured it had enough pfizer vaccination in stock for a second dose he said vaccination was a pathway out of future blanket lockdowns the sooner we get our community vaccinated at a much higher proportion the more comfort is provided to public health in terms of our response to any particular outbreak qld authorities put victorians on notice queensland health minister yvette d ath said she had been informed that there were other victorians who managed to come into queensland without the correct exemptions i ve been advised this morning by the deputy police commissioner that there are other people coming across our border from victoria who are driving up through new south wales crossing our border from victoria who do not have the exemptions or travel declarations to do so ms d ath said we will be making sure that you are found this is an offence you cannot come into this state if you are from a hotspot and put our state at risk and we will make sure that you will face the consequences if you do that queensland police deputy commissioner steve gollschewski confirmed five other people have been identified as failing to comply with directions coming into queensland two in the darling downs one in dalby and two in the wide bay district all five people who entered

seen yet in this particular outbreak or the most recent ones we ve dealt with of outdoor transmission mr weimar admitted on thursday professor cheng said there was pretty good evidence around masks reducing transmission and that cases where the virus was passed outdoors in the second wave might have gone unnoticed when asked about reports that transmission was 20 times less likely to happen outdoors prof cheng said that doesn t mean zero there is still a risk infectious diseases expert prof peter collignon said little to no transmission occurred outdoors unless in crowded situations where people gathered for prolonged periods unless you ve got uncontrollable spread like in the uk or europe i can t really see it ll provide much benefit to wear masks outdoors prof collignon said there can t be much community transmission in melbourne right now if any mr merlino said the continued wearing of masks was a small price to pay we don t have the luxury of picking and choosing public health advice that we like or don t like he said melbourne exited lockdown at midnight on thursday picture ian currie acting premier james merlino said victorians must wear masks outdoors victoria

through nsw before arriving on the sunshine coast on june 5 they first became symptomatic on june 3 but victorian contact tracers have little information on the case given they are now in the hands of queensland authorities prof cheng flagged the new cases could stall the planned easing of restrictions in greater melbourne from thursday june 17 we may need to hold on the current settings for a little longer prof cheng said more exposure sites added a mcdonald s drive through multiple coles supermarkets and a woolworths are among the latest additions to victoria s long list of covid 19 exposure sites the state s health department made eight additions to the alerts list of venues visited by a confirmed case of covid 19 on thursday as melbourne s tough lockdown was lifted all of the

new york the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world advertisement those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax advertisement what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates advertisement but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico advertisement what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived including bank of america which was convicted for reckless mortgage lending practices others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans advertisement he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s name over the door send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

vehicle identification and management systems based on artificial intelligence in the united states canada and internationally one of the main drivers of rekor s business is its automatic license plate recognition alpr technology which the company has pitched to investors as a major market opportunity since at least 2018 for example rekor has consistently touted the purportedly lucrative prospects of its uninsured vehicle enforcement diversion uved partnership with the state of oklahoma oklahoma under which the company receives compensation and commission fees in exchange for using its technology to scan vehicle license plates and compare them against a database to identify vehicles without auto insurance fueled by management commentary rekor s stock price has ballooned under the market perception that the oklahoma uved partnership is not only lucrative but the first stepping stone to capturing similar deals with other municipalities the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i rekor s alpr technology and uved related business is outclassed by global competitors with an established dominant market share ii it was unlikely that states would pass legislation authorizing deals similar to rekor s oklahoma uved partnership because of inter alia state and local privacy laws and related public concerns iii rekor s uved partnership was not as profitable as defendants had led investors to believe because of known impediments to enrollment rates and costs associated with the partnership iv accordingly rekor had overstated its

legislature s daily house calendar rekor s stock price fell 5 20 per share or 27 5 to close at 13 71 per share on may 10 2021 then following defendants post market conference call with investors the same day rekor s stock price fell an additional 2 45 per share or 17 87 to close at 11 26 per share on may 11 2021 representing a two day total decline of 7 65 per share or 40 45 then on may 26 2021 private investor western edge published a report addressing rekor entitled rekor systems lackluster growth runway and exaggerated insurance scheme raise substantial downside risk the western edge report alleged among other things that global competition was miles ahead of rekor in alpr development and market establishment that the company s realized results suggest management s potential revenue guidance could be overstated by up to 80 and that investors were at risk of facing a massive downside if growth doesn t show up the western edge report also noted that rekor s predecessor in the oklahoma uved partnership had exited it because the program is not economically feasible given costs associated with the program and because there was typically no consequences for individuals that simply ignored the fines insurance requirements after they were identified also on may 26 2021 mariner research group mariner published a report addressing rekor entitled rekr government documents do not support investor expectations the mariner report highlight government documentation which shows that rekr s revenue opportunities are likely a fraction of what investors expect among other things mariner alleged that oklahoma government budgets imply that rekr s much vaunted uved program is a sub 2mm revenue opportunity almost 96 less than the 40mm in revenue intimated by rekor s ceo the mariner report likewise echoed the issues disclosed in the western edge report including inter alia those that had caused rekor s predecessor in the oklahoma uved partnership to exit the
