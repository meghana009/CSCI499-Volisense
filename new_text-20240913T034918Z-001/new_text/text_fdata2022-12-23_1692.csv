where it ultimately closed not much happened in between less will happen today ahead of an early close but we ll see some give back a spooked wall street overnight has our futures down 66 this morning but for the record local investors ignored a 7 point rally in the aussie ten year to 3 79 yesterday real estate rose 0 9 utilities 1 6 healthcare 1 3 and communication services 1 1 and even technology rose 1 4 as bargain hunters continued with some last minute shopping the banks still kind of like higher rates and they rose 0 6 for once the resources sectors sat it out with energy flat and

significant production downgrade macquarie downgraded to sell on the numbers to make three sells out of five among covering fnarena database brokers 29metals is not in the index but the reverberations were clear lithium and coal stocks were also weak meanwhile oz minerals ozl has agreed to be taken over by bhp group bhp but now it s over to the regulators which is about all that s worth talking about three men and a dog will be in operation today and they ll probably head off at lunchtime unwanted stocking fillers it s not often a final revision of us gdp much moves wall street but that was the case last night for a trigger happy market economists had forecast the revision to come in the same as the last revision at 2 9 but it came in at 3 2 to recap the us first estimates a quarterly gdp by taking the data from month one and extrapolating that across three months the first revision incorporates month two and the result is re extrapolated before month three is finally added in for a true result this particular revision suggests the month of september was a lot stronger than assumed the core pce inflation measure within the numbers was revised up to 4 7 from 4 6 just when wall street thought the fed might be able to back off this took the wind out of the sails this was not all that upset wall street last night early in the session renowned hedge fund manager david tepper appeared on cnbc with some downbeat commentary i would probably say i m leaning short on the equity markets right now because the upside downside doesn t make sense to me when i have so many people so many central banks telling me what they are going to do what they want to do what they expect to do when tepper talks wall street listens leading chipmaker micron last night reported earnings showing a halving in revenues and a loss for the quarter given lower prices for its products micron will also lay off 10 of its employees and executives will take salary cuts sounds like a recession micron led all the chipmakers down tesla is offering discounts on its model 3 and model y evs due to weaker demand see above tesla led all auto stocks down while the high cost of living is reason enough to lead to discounting commentators wonder whether musk s twitter tomfoolery is leading to brand damage the micron tesla stories were backed up by a leading economic indicator that showed a 1 fall in growth in november september up november down what do we make of it the us ten year yield fell 2 points and the two year rose 6 points i ve never been a fan of these leading indicators as a large part of their index is the stock market itself so if the stock market responds poorly to the index it is reacting poorly to the stock market but the dow was down 800 points at the low of the session the recovery to be down only 350 by the close does bring some relief maybe wall street has been nice this year after all the s p500 did fall below support at 3800 which exacerbated early selling but has

it was the year that the box office recovery from the covid 19 catastrophe began to take shape blockbusters hit the big screen led by tom cruise giant people eating dinosaurs and james cameron s tall blue na vi one year after warner bros sent its entire release slate to hbo max and cinemas simultaneously the burbank studio s movie posters boasted only in theaters like old times in a show of confidence the head of the world s biggest theater chain rolled down the streets of pasadena in a rose parade float but it wasn t enough the year is expected to end with about 7 35 billion in ticket sales from the u s and canada according to analysts and studio estimates down 35 from the pre pandemic year of 2019 advertisement when the hits came they reminded audiences and studio executives of the good old days proving that audiences want to go back to certain movies in droves there just weren t many movies of that caliber only three 2022 pictures will have grossed more than 1 billion worldwide assuming avatar the way of water reaches that milestone the mega budget movie is expected to join top gun maverick the highest grossing film of the year 1 49 billion and jurassic world dominion almost exactly 1 billion in 2019 nine movies joined the billion dollar club most of them produced by disney the primary culprit according to theater owners and studio executives a persistent movie shortage u s cinemas received 38 fewer wide release movies as of dec 25 this year compared with the same point in 2019 according to comscore a wide release plays on 1 800 screens or more you re off 30 something percent and you ve got 30 less movies right said brian robbins president and chief executive of paramount pictures the math kind of works with such a thin slate the box office became increasingly reliant on the home runs and there weren t enough of what studio executives call singles doubles and triples the kinds of mid budget films that sustained theaters year round advertisement the top 10 movies this year are expected to account for more than half of the industry s total box office in the years before covid 19 the 10 highest grossing movies took up between 30 and 40 of the annual totals according to comscore data multiple factors explain the shortfall in film releases some big pictures were pushed to 2023 including warner bros shazam fury of the gods a backlog at visual effects companies meant that some films couldn t be finished in time and had to find other premiere dates some films that in other years might have gone to theaters were instead funneled to streaming services pixar s turning red and disney s hocus pocus 2 certain movies were released in theaters but hit streamers at the same time undercutting their grosses firestarter halloween ends in a particularly disruptive move netflix took rian johnson s glass onion a sequel to a massive hit knives out and yanked it from theaters after a week long promotional run a pair of disney animated bombs lightyear strange world sparked worries that the company s streaming strategy had trained loyal fans to look for its movies primarily on disney rather than buy tickets and some films just flopped as studios took bets that simply didn t pan out focus features the northman mgm s three thousand years of longing finally many top releases were clumped together within a couple months of one another resulting in long stretches without any blockbusters advertisement the first four months of the year were a disaster thanks to a paucity of major titles late spring and early summer came back roaring with doctor strange in the multiverse of madness top gun maverick and jurassic world dominion and then the late summer drought hit after bullet train in august and before warner bros black adam in october only smile managed to crack 100 million in domestic sales the lean times killed whatever momentum the hits had built up comscore senior media analyst paul dergarabedian compared the year to a relay race in which an athlete fumbles the baton if it was just that people didn t want to go back to the movies then the summer would have sucked too dergarabedian said what changed was that there were fewer movies and then this unusual circumstance threw the release calendar into disarray the doldrums hit theater operators hard cineworld owner of the nation s second largest theater chain regal filed for bankruptcy in september citing the weak slate and a heavy debt burden the stock price of the no 1 chain heavily indebted amc theatres plummeted after surging last year as ceo adam aron memed his way into retail investors hearts shares of amc have fallen 82 to 4 91 so far this year it was hardly all doom and gloom though the year demonstrated that releasing good movies in theaters is smart business as long as they remain in cinemas for multiple weeks before they show up for online rental or streaming advertisement starting in 2020 when theaters were closed for months studios experimented with releasing movies in theaters and online sites at the same time same day streaming cannibalized box office sign ups to streaming platforms surged but entertainment companies other than netflix have begun to backtrack on streaming focused movie strategies wall street has started to demand profits rather than subscriber numbers at all costs warner bros discovery ceo david zaslav in contrast with the preceding at t regime has rejected big streaming movies as boondoggles paramount s upcoming comedy 80 for brady was at first intended for streaming but is getting a theatrical release instead ditto for magic mike s last dance which was planned for hbo max but is now set for the big screen next year they wanted to boost their subscriber numbers while they had a chance said eric wold senior analyst at b riley securities but i think we ve seen that that just isn t sustainable nor can it get a return on a high production cost film still it s becoming clear that the theatrical window the gap of time when theaters have sole rights to show movies has changed for good previously movies waited an average of 72 days before becoming available for digital viewing now studios are holding most films for around 45 days before they hit streaming the flexible release patterns are beneficial for studios because they allow them to avoid having to restart marketing campaigns they re more efficient and give poor performing movies a better shot at profitability on the flip side successful movies can stay for longer top gun maverick remained in theaters for more than 90 days before becoming available for home viewing advertisement i don t think it s going to be one size fits all said jim orr president of domestic distribution for universal pictures still i think some consistency across the windows is a decent thing studios that held on to their biggest movies to release them in theaters reaped the rewards paramount pictures enjoyed unusual levels of success in 2022 releasing jackass forever and a scream reboot early in the year facing minimal competition the long awaited top gun maverick became the year s highest grossing release with 1 49 billion in ticket sales smile a movie that was greenlighted with a straight to streaming plan was flipped to theaters and became a huge hit sometimes i say i feel like we ve been living in a little bit of an alternative movie business reality robbins said universal pictures put out more movies than any other studio by far 33 including a couple classic re releases and had a remarkably diverse slate that bet on a wide range of genres for various audience demographics that paid off in some instances with winners like jordan peele s nope illumination entertainment s minions the rise of gru and dreamworks animation s the bad guys in other cases not so much she said and bros were among the year s biggest flops advertisement disney in contrast to its struggles in animation did well with superhero titles taking the current no 2 and no 3 spots with black panther wakanda forever 421 million domestic and the doctor strange sequel 411 million respectively warner bros found success with the batman 401 million and elvis 151 million the winners and failures defied conventional wisdom about the health of whatever genres went in and out of vogue yes comedies largely struggled mid budget fare aimed at adults long a source of angst within studios fielded several wins including sony s the woman king and where the crawdads sing indie art house labels served up their share of commercial disappointments like tár and the banshees of inisherin suggesting that serious cinema is a tough sell in an environment that rewards escapism but some specialty releases fared well at least those that were entertaining and skewed young such as searchlight s the menu and a24 s everything everywhere all at once it s fair to say that it s probably a little bit more difficult to get certain demographic groups back into theaters orr said some of the adult titles have certainly struggled but i don t think that s always going to be the case we ll get to the other side of that advertisement horror had a particularly strong year with highly profitable releases including the black phone barbarian and smile when people came back to theaters it was often for a premium experience audiences paid up for large format screenings such as imax that make a trip to the movies more of an event during the opening weekend of the way of water 3 d accounted for 57 of sales premium formats and motion seat auditoriums fueled more than 60 of business there s no question that when a moviegoer makes an appointment to go to the multiplex to see a specific movie they want to make sure they get a premium offering like imax said greg foster a movie business consultant and former imax entertainment ceo but the box office was dominated by big budget escapist entertainment based on established film franchises every film in the top 10 was a sequel reboot or part of a larger cinematic universe the highest grossing original film was warner bros opulent music biopic elvis at no 11 do i feel like there s certain parts of the audience that aren t coming back sure said robbins i think the older audience is still struggling but that also might be that the product is not there for them thanksgiving weekend usually the source of a huge box office bounty was bereft of compelling new releases leaving disney and marvel s black panther wakanda forever to run roughshod over the competition including fellow disney release strange world advertisement christmas weekend proved to be similarly bare dampened by wintry weather across much of the u s paramount s babylon an audacious ode to old hollywood from damien chazelle took in just 3 5 million according to estimates from comscore released sunday sony s whitney houston i wanna dance with somebody notched 5 3 million and universal and dreamworks puss in boots the last wish earned 11 4 million that left avatar the way of water a clear path to no 1 for the second straight week with a 56 million haul following its 134 million domestic opening but although analysts and rival studios predict the film will have strong staying power it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to meet hollywood s and cameron s sky high expectations if the director knows one thing it s how to keep audiences awaiting a sequel

in morocco the regime has used the pandemic to consolidate political despotism and neoliberal policies the authorities of the wilaya of rabat prohibited us from using the public conference room allal el fassi to host the opening session this confirms once again the obstinacy of the authorities to continue the restrictions against our organization for nearly twenty years attac cadtm morocco did not give in to this ban it held its opening session at headquarter of the moroccan association of human rights amdh in rabat on friday december 16 at 6 pm with the participation of a large number of representatives of organizations in morocco and the press it continued the work of the congress on saturday and sunday at the headquarters of the national federation of education democracy fne in rabat the congressmen discussed and approved the moral and financial reports that set out the assessment of attac cadtm morocco s work over six years since the sixth national congress held in may 2017 as well as the draft resolutions prepared by the preparatory committee including the attac cadtm morocco platform attac cadtm morocco s strategic themes resolutions on women debt free trade agreements food sovereignty ecological justice and amendments to the association s statutes the discussions focused on the political economic and social situation at the global regional and national levels and can be summarized in the following elements the covid pandemic has aggravated the already deep crisis of the capitalist mode of production it is a multidimensional crisis economic financial food environmental political and migratory with wars and terrorism in this respect the environmental crisis that is devastating the climate nature and biodiversity constitutes a serious threat to the existence of humanity and the entire planet the intervention strategy of imperialism in the regions of asia africa and eastern europe is leading to the expansion of wars and armaments which portends the danger of a world war that will be disastrous for humanity and the planet this is manifested on the one hand in the invasion of ukraine by russian imperialism and on the other hand in the enlargement of nato nato north atlantic treaty organization nato ensures us military protection for the europeans in case of aggression but above all it gives the usa supremacy over the western bloc western european countries agreed to place their armed forces within a defence system under us command and thus recognize the preponderance of the usa nato was founded in 1949 in washington but became less prominent after the end of the cold war in 2002 it had 19 members belgium canada denmark france iceland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal the uk the usa to which were added greece and turkey in 1952 the federal republic of germany in 1955 replaced by unified germany in 1990 spain in 1982 hungary poland and the czech republic in 1999 under the hegemony of the usa to achieve the geopolitical objectives of western imperialism with a massive increase in military budgets in this context the trade wars reinforce the power of the multinationals which impose the removal of all barriers to the circulation of goods and capital in order to plunder the wealth of the peoples especially in the poor countries of the global south debt is one of the main mechanisms of this plundering that accompanies the expansion of the domination of finance capital in such a situation the working class the small producers and the popular strata of the countries of the south as well as of the north bear the burden of these different capitalist crises which primarily affect women and young people through the generalization of the logic of the market and of profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders in all aspects of human activities and through the destruction of economic social civil and political rights in north africa and the middle east arab region the health crisis and the war against ukraine have exacerbated the economic and social conditions against which the peoples of the region have revolted since 2011 in addition to their opposition to the zionist entity occupying the lands of the palestinian people the international monetary fund imf and the world bank are the main components of the counter revolution in the region the international monetary fund imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries imf and the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates are the main components of the counter revolution in the region through drastic loan agreements such as those imposed on the lebanese people plunged into an acute food crisis on egypt tunisia jordan and other countries in the region the terms of these loans include guaranteeing conditions to stimulate private investment giving tax breaks to large companies abolishing the food and energy subsidy system reducing salaries and raising the retirement age this will lead to a further decline in the income of the working classes and a deterioration in purchasing power this will lead to an increase in poverty unemployment and a generalization of precariousness and instability of living conditions in morocco the regime has used the pandemic to consolidate political despotism and neoliberal policies the country entered a new debt spiral by removing the fixed ceiling for foreign borrowing the total public debt stock debt stock the total amount of debt doubled from 2011 to 2020 and reached 96 of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another the new development model is based on the expansion of opportunities for the concentration of wealth in the hands of a local capitalist minority that shares with multinationals in the grabbing of land water maritime and mineral resources public services and other areas the despotic character of the regime is a major pillar of this great capitalist accumulation which is no longer absorbed by the local market and has begun to penetrate the countries of the african continent the war against ukraine has exacerbated the structural food and energy crisis in our country and the resulting exponential rise in prices the green morocco plan has drained a colossal budget for ten years to support the large exporters of the agricultural sector while imports of cereals pulses oilseeds and sugar have increased there is currently a shortage of milk and its derivatives derivatives a family of financial products that includes mainly options futures swaps and their combinations all related to other assets shares bonds raw materials and commodities interest rates indices etc from which they are by nature inseparable options on shares futures contracts on an index etc their value depends on and is derived from thus the name that of these other assets there are derivatives involving a firm commitment currency futures interest rate or exchange swaps and derivatives involving a conditional commitment options warrants etc which will also be covered by imports the fisheries sector in turn is undergoing a major depletion with a minority monopolizing the fisheries wealth for export the state has completely removed subsidies on energy materials gasoline diesel and fuel oil in late 2015 this led to a doubling of the price of a liter of diesel which currently hovers between 15 and 16 dirhams about 1 45 euros and 1 55 euros petroleum distribution companies have accumulated profits of more than 45 billion dirhams about 4 4 billion euros since the liberalization of energy prices until the end of 2021 the bill for these profits is paid by consumers either directly at the pump or indirectly through general price increases the deterioration in purchasing power has worsened in parallel with falling incomes and low wages popular households are heavily indebted and are being suffocated especially by microfinance institutions which are also accumulating large profits on the backs of the poor the state wants to abolish what remains of the compensation fund including subsidies for butane gas it is also preparing to raise the retirement age to 65 and to reduce the retirement pension of workers in the private sector by reforming the national social security fund and by generalizing the contractual system in the public service the government is anxious to fulfill its obligations to international financial institutions to ensure payment of the debt and obtain further loans it is currently awaiting imf approval for the precautionary liquidity liquidity the facility with which a financial instrument can be bought or sold without a significant change in price line or flexible credit line which could allow it to obtain loans on the international financial market financial market the market for long term capital it comprises a primary market where new issues are sold and a secondary market where existing securities are traded aside from the regulated markets there are over the counter markets which are not required to meet minimum conditions as a reminder the share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of private creditors in the external public debt has increased from 9 in 2011 to 28 in 2021 total public debt payments debt service debt service the sum of the interests and the amortization of the capital borrowed amounted to 172 billion dirhams at the end of 2021 equivalent to 9 times the health budget all these measures are fuelling the conditions for a likely social explosion in our country the regime is conducting a preventive repression against all forms of protest and demonstration restricting the right to strike criminalizing all forms of expression and harassing all critical voices the attac cadtm morocco delegates full of hope in the self organized collective struggle from below for a morocco of democracy freedom and social justice reiterate their demands for the cancellation of the debt as one of the radical solutions to get out of dependence and cut with the international financial institutions and foreign decision centers hence the need for a popular mobilization that imposes a moratorium and an audit of morocco s debt that will identify the odious and illegitimate parts and repudiate them cancellation of the debts of popular households setting up a public loan system and stopping the abuses of microfinance institutions against the victims of microcredit especially women impose a progressive tax on wealth and profits and provide free public services for all the release of all political prisoners including our comrade omar radi the detainees of the rif hirak and all prisoners of conscience stopping free trade agreements especially with the imperialist powers the european union and the united states of america broadening the popular mobilization to stop the normalization with the zionist entity broadening solidarity at the national regional and international levels with the struggles of the palestinian people and the palestinian prisoners putting an end to the role of policeman played by morocco to ensure the closure of the borders of the european continent to immigrants from sub saharan africa and the respect of the rights and dignity of immigrants to stop the harassment against attac cadtm morocco and to allow it to renew its legal deposit receipt the seventh national congress of attac cadtm morocco which closed its work in rabat greeting all the political trade union and human rights organizations associations and movements of popular struggle that participated in our congress and supported us renews the commitment to contribute to build the next struggles and propose alternatives against the capitalist development model in crisis and make the greatest effort for another morocco possible and necessary to live in dignity in conclusion it should be recalled that morocco is preparing to host the summit of the annual meetings of the world bank and the international monetary fund in october 2023 in marrakech in this regard the association attac cadtm morocco announces its refusal to hold this summit in morocco these two institutions have committed crimes against our people and against the peoples of our region and the world they are not welcome in our country and we will continue to fight against them we will mobilize for a counter summit national convention

as quite old telling reporters russia would find a way to counter it at the same time he said russia wants an end to the war in ukraine and that this would inevitably involve a diplomatic solution our goal is not to spin the flywheel of military conflict but on the contrary to end this war putin told reporters we will strive for an end to this and the sooner the better of course these comments drew

the last ukrainian this is not conducive to a speedy settlement quite the contrary peskov said of the patriot system and this cannot prevent the russian federation from achieving its goals during the special military operation using russia s term for a war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed zelenskiy told congress on wednesday that u s aid to his country was an investment in democracy as he invoked battles against the nazis in world war two to press for more assistance against russia s invasion he said the patriot system was an important step in creating an air shield this is the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror the possibility to hit our cities our energy zelenskiy told a white house news conference standing next to president joe biden zelenskiy s comments in washington came with republicans some of whom have voiced increasing scepticism about sending so much aid to ukraine set to take control of the u s house of representatives from democrats on jan 3 congress moved closer on thursday to approving an additional 44 9 billion in emergency military and economic assistance part of wider u s government spending

finally pinpointed the baseline in the conflict 1 russia must lose 2 no territory in exchange for pseudo world compromises 3 ukraine will receive all necessary military aid as much as possible 4 no

it s a common dilemma you ve created ten thousand non fungible tokens nfts of apes whose expressions answer in the affirmative the age old for billionaires that is question can ennui follow you onto a yacht you look around and see other artists striking it rich with pictures of rocks but your nfts just aren t selling what s a poor digital ape monger to do according to a recent 95 page lawsuit filed in california federal court against yuga labs creators of the bored ape yacht club bayc line of nfts the answer is to pay celebrities to feign interest the putative class action lawsuit alleges that yuga labs and their promoters attempted to create the impression of organic interest in their nfts by paying celebrities like jimmy fallon post malone dj khaled and paris hilton to purchase the nfts and then tout their purchases to their supporters generally via social media the celebrities crowed about their new nfts at times bought for eye popping sums or in madonna s case bemoaned their inability to get their preferred ape allegedly creating the impression that the bayc nfts were in such high demand and so exclusive that even a highly connected celebrity like could not get any one that she wanted all the while the value of bored apes and the native apecoin token that yuga labs launched in march 2022 climbed higher and higher but plaintiffs allege these celebrities didn t join the bayc out of genuine interest in the nfts as the plaintiffs tell it the celebrities didn t even purchase the apes at all rather yuga labs and their promoters compensated the celebrities for their purchases and tossed in a little extra for their trouble unfortunately for all involved bayc was not immune to the market malaise that has seen bitcoin drop to 17 000 and the s p 500 drop nearly 25 in a year an ape that justin bieber bought for 1 3 million is now worth a paltry 70 000 and apecoin is 90 off its all time high plaintiffs assets have fared little better leading to the current lawsuit in some ways plaintiffs are alleging a fairly basic wash trading scam repackaged with nfts instead of stocks artificial trades create the impression that there is more desire for an asset than the market can actually support attracting investors who are ultimately harmed if the market ever corrects but other aspects of this litigation are unique to bayc part of what yuga labs sells is membership to an exclusive club ownership of a bored ape can get you into a music festival and an actual nightclub celebrity membership in that club makes the nfts that grant admission all the more valuable advertisements showing celebrities enjoying a particular product are nothing new and bars and nightclubs have long provided desirable patrons favorable deals and free products however before social media such endorsements were more transparent few people thought that a camera crew happened to stumble into sean connery s home just before he poured a glass of suntory whiskey even the paparazzi have limits but tiktok instagram facebook and other social media apps are particularly susceptible to celebrity advertising because they create the impression that the poster uses the product or in this case purchased the nft as part of their everyday life for this reason the federal trade commission has cracked down in recent years on social media influencers who fail to disclose financial connections to the products in their posts the sec has also taken aim at celebrity promoters of digital assets in october kim kardashian paid 1 26 million to settle claims that she had used social media to promote ethereummax without disclosing her financial interest in the cryptocurrency the sec s announcement of the settlement reiterated its november 2017 guidance that any celebrity or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security must disclose the nature source and amount of compensation they received in exchange for the promotion nor are congressmen immune to scrutiny on december 1 the u s house of representatives ethics committee fined outgoing representative madison cawthorn r nc approximately 15 000 for promoting the let s go brandon coin despite failing to disclose his purchase of 150 000 of the cryptocurrency time will tell whether plaintiffs claims against yuga labs have any legs but what is clear is that the last year s downturn in the crypto market has drawn scrutiny to crypto developers and their promoters

you asked and we listened we at okdo are passionate about technology and innovation so we gathered all our forces to make a single board computer sbc that we and you always wanted the rock bringing to the table everything you ve been asking for as standard we believe that tech is the key to driving positive and innovative change together as a community of fellow tech professionals we can build an exciting future and empower amazing things through technology richard curtin the co founder and cto of okdo shares everything you need to know about the rock and how we can customize and tailor it to your needs allowing you to build the future you want and drive sbc design innovations let s meet the new sbc solid as a rock so what is rock it s a range of reliable and low power sbcs developed in collaboration between okdo and radxa it offers class leading capabilities hardware and performance in a similar form factor as other popular sbcs the rock series are versatile boards formed with high performing hardware as standard what s more the rock boards can be fully customized and configured just the way you want because it s your board in your way this brings huge financial and environmental benefits during current supply chain challenges allowing professional design engineers to leverage cutting edge technology for developing high volume end products it offers professionals industrial oems iot enthusiasts hobbyists and pc diy enthusiasts and makers a reliable and capable platform for bringing their ideas and projects to life supporting the most extraordinary next generation technology applications why rock okdo rock was born out of our love for technology having listened to what you really needed in an sbc we decided to build something different we wanted to create a better board to allow people to build a better future for the world here at okdo we are committed to offering you the best hardware and software to maximize the potential of your design applications we aim to build a community of engineers passionate about tech and electronics who want to be part of something different be part of a community that will drive change and be beta together we believe in the power of rock and we also believe our community can help make it even better if you get a kick out of creating innovating hacking and being part of bringing an awesome new product to market then we d love to hear from you rockchip a powerful processor at the heart of rock the rock boards are designed around processors provided by rockchip a fabless semiconductor company based in china although rockchip has sales of billions of dollars in china and the apac region they have a very modest market share position in europe and north america nevertheless they ve gained an outstanding reputation outside of asia and continue to grow and expand globally what s great about using the publicly available processors from rockchip is that they offer detailed product information such as comprehensive datasheets if you are a professional user and you d like to internalize the technology the bill of materials bom used by rockchip is openly available in the market one of the greatest advantages of rockchip is the diversified model they use to produce their wafers in fabs considering the supply chain constraints that taiwan semiconductors have had lately there is a significant risk of stock shortages when the production of semiconductors is solely located in asia or in one wafer fab rockchip on the other hand uses several different fabs to produce their wafers meaning that they have been able to ride out the supply chain storm better than some other semiconductor companies this was one of the main attractions when we initiated the design manufacture and distribution partnership with radxa a rockchip design partner to solve our customers problems rock products are designed by a talented engineering team from radxa in china they ve approached their engineering by considering how they can provide everybody from education and makers to industrial customers with scalable robust platforms using next generation technology it has been another key differentiator that laid the foundation of our partnership with radxa and rockchip we are also expanding our semiconductor design strategy with some of the largest semiconductor suppliers in the world what rock products is okdo bringing to the market nowadays customers who have been designing using sbcs have been impacted by severe supply chain constraints that caused projects to stagnate to help resolve the sbc availability issue we re excited to partner with radxa and bring to market a robust roadmap of rock products at first we introduced the special edition board the rock 4 se and the rock 4c which meet most of the design and cost requirements previously satisfied by other sbc brands but now the next generation of sbcs the advanced resilient and multifunctional board the rock 5b is finally here packed with incredible features including its powerful rockchip rk3588 soc the rock 5b is the first sbc supporting 8k displays tailor made for advanced multimedia applications depending on your design needs there is a board that will rock your project whether it s the next gen rock 5b sbc the rock 3a or a rock cm3 compute module be sure you can trust that your board will be as solid as a rock

attorney j c sanchez of robbins geller by calling 800 449 4900 or via e mail at case allegations f45 training is a fitness franchisor with a business model based on rapid growth through the franchising of low overhead fitness facilities f45 training went public in a july 16 2021 ipo in which it issued 18 75 million shares priced at 16 per share f45 training via its ipo offering documents asserted its advantage over traditional owner operated fitness facilities both because its franchise model has enabled us to open new studios at an accelerated pace versus the owner operator model and because it generated quick revenue because or the majority of franchises that we sell we receive an upfront payment from the franchisee however as the f45 training class action lawsuit alleges the ipo s offering documents misled investors regarding f45 training s revenue stream and its ability to maintain its rapid expansion business model specifically the ipo s offering documents failed to disclose that f45 training could not maintain new franchise growth because it was offering more favorable payment terms to multi unit franchisees f45 training s lackluster pace of growth was also accompanied by a massive and unsustainable increase in f45 training s accounts receivable and a similar and equally unsustainable decrease in its cash and cash equivalents these practices were not sustainable at the time of the ipo and when f45 training could no longer sustain this defective business model its growth rate and revenue plummeted on july 26 2022 a mere year after the ipo f45 training revealed i a significant reduction in its financial guidance from a range of 255 to 275 million to a new range of 120 to 130 million ii a dramatic cut in the number of new exercise studios that it would open in 2022 down approximately 60 iii a 250 million credit line will not be available iv that it was letting go of approximately 45 of its workforce and v that f45 training s ceo defendant adam gilchrist had resigned his position as ceo f45 training further disclosed that full year net franchises sold would be between 350 and 450 a fraction of the prior guidance of 1 500 and that full year net initial studio openings would be between 350 and 450 compared to the prior guidance of 1 000 as a consequence of f45 training s infirm business model and condition existing at the time of its ipo f45 training was also forced to substantially slash guidance for the full year 2022 revenue on this news f45 training s stock price fell by more than 60 representing more than a 78

the details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer lately the credit card market has become exploratory in the way it rewards cardholders for spending for example we ve seen the debut of many cryptocurrency credit cards your incentive for swiping these cards is a non cash product that can be liquidated at rates determined by a clearly volatile market another credit card concept has debuted with an outsized payoff potential contingent on stock market performance and it s likely more digestible and understandable than crypto for most of us instead of earning airline miles hotel points or direct cashback the 750 annual fee save wealth premium credit card rewards you with stock every time you swipe your card the result for you is cash back but your earnings

of 5 70 annual return on purchases in all categories show pros cons and more chevron down icon an icon in the shape of an angle pointing down save wealth premium card overview the wealth card is designed for consumers who are looking for the potential of better economic value from their credit card in a low interest rate environment and with high inflation said michael nelskyla ceo at save a credit card that earns investments instead of cash back or travel rewards is a novel idea but with a 750 annual fee is it a worthwhile concept to experiment with here s how it works save purchases a strategy linked security with an investment value of a little over twice the amount you spend if you spend 100 save will invest 217 in stocks the card is as simple or complicated as you want it to be you can swipe mindlessly and allow save to handle the investments save charges a management fee of 0 79 or you can dictate what you want to invest in save estimates that you ll net a 5 7 average return on all purchases we ll show you how save arrives at this number in a minute also realize that you could get a much higher or lower return depending on stock market performance how to earn with the save wealth premium save is a discretionary advisor who will allocate a portfolio that matches the customer investment profile but the customer can overrule independently as needed said nelskyla customers have full transparency into the investment portfolio assets and strategy a lot of big words i know in short save will invest for you or you can tell them exactly how you d like your reward stock invested you ll hear this disclaimer repeatedly there s no way to guarantee an exact return rate earning rates fluctuate depending on stock market performance but through save s hypothetical back testing procedure which views market data from 2006 to the present the company has calculated an average growth rate of 5 7 that s after their mandatory 0 79 wealth management fee with that in mind they ve crafted a valuation chart to compare the save wealth premium to other premium rewards cards this reflects the expected return rate based on 3 500 in monthly spending and the annual rewards value year 1 includes the welcome bonus of each card save for this comparison save has assumed the points value of competing cards is worth 1 5 back if you re familiar with business insider s points valuations you know it s not difficult to receive a value significantly higher than this from rewards currencies earned by the capital one venture x rewards credit card chase sapphire reserve and the platinum card from american express when you redeem them for travel but when it comes to cash back the wealth premium card is theoretically uncontested for everyday spending one other important note your minimum return will always be 0 you won t lose money if the stock market takes a turn for the worse here s how save described this situation to business insider the customer can not invest their own funds and any investment is generated by spend hence there is no risk to the customer if there is no return for periods when the market underperforms there is no cap on the amount of money you can earn with this card but there is a cap on how much you can lose and that s a good thing how to redeem cash back while the card doesn t earn cash back directly it s effectively a cash back credit card you can t transfer its rewards to valuable airline and hotel partners like you can with other premium cards such as the chase sapphire reserve or the platinum card from american express here s how you get your cash back for every dollar you spend save buys a strategy linked security with an investment worth twice the dollar spent the investments remain untouched for a little over a year save deposits the returns earned by the stocks into your bank account minus save s mandatory 0 79 wealth management fee to be clear you will not have access to the actual investments only the gains from those investments for example if you spend 100 save will purchase 217 in stocks chosen by either you or save one year after that 100 purchase you ll be eligible to withdraw the gains on that stock if the stock has yielded the expected return you ll receive 5 70 for your 100 purchase in the event that you make less than 0 79 you won t be charged the wealth management fee because the return rate from your funds isn t available until a year after the initial investment you ll have a monthly annuity of returns coming in for every month you spent in the previous year which is a good income generator said nelskyla at any time you can cancel your account and we will liquidate your investments at their market value and you will receive them but it defeats the purpose of the program and hence your returns may be lower than typical portfolio returns but still likely to be higher than any cashback value of other cards in short you ll be most rewarded by letting your stocks ride instead of withdrawing every month save wealth premium benefits and features welcome bonus currently the card offers a 10 000 investment bonus that does not equate to 10 000 in cash this is an investment made on your behalf there s no way to say for certain how much this is worth as the market fluctuates but a reasonable estimate is 278 here s why for every dollar you spend save will purchase 2 17 in investments that means a 10 000 bonus is equivalent to spending 4 608 if you net a projected average return of 5 7 return on that spending you d receive 278 in addition to this both you and a friend will receive a 5 000 investment bonus when you refer to the card again this is not a cash bonus using the above equation this bonus should be worth 139 on average it s worth restating that this dollar amount could be dramatically higher depending on the stock market and by that same token you could net absolutely nothing earning rates it s been stated before but the save wealth premium s big selling point is its potential earning rates on everyday spending a whopping 5 7 estimated average return there are no limits to what you can earn and there are also bonus categories that earn the following again all are estimates tesla peloton soulcycle 18 back samsung apple microsoft 12 back amazon whole foods 9 back as you can see the save wealth premium credit card is designed for members with high quality brand loyalty you won t find annual walmart subscription credits on this card these categories yield higher returns because save purchases more stock per dollar when you transact with these merchants for example think of tesla as a 3x category samsung as a 2x category and amazon as a 1 5x category premium market savings account the card comes with access to save s enhanced fdic insured cash management tools which include a premium market savings account which yields 1 5 on cash deposited a high yield checking account which yields 0 5 back on cash deposited there are no deposit limits except for the 250 000 maximum for eligibility for fdic insurance provided by save s bank partners travel benefits the save wealth premium is not a travel credit card though it s got some fair travel benefits that are mostly standard with visa signature credit cards primary rental car insurance up to the full value of the car trip cancellation insurance emergency evacuation repatriation of remains visa luxury hotel collection travel and emergency assistance the card also offers premium benefits you won t find on most other cards such as 15 audi rental discount avis presidents club status normally by invitation only and comes with perks like 50 bonus points a guaranteed car and double upgrades when available after booking an intermediate car or higher lifestyle benefits this card comes with access to the visa signature concierge which can help with such arrangements as travel restaurant reservations and tickets to entertainment events the save wealth premium is also good for large purchases as it offers purchase security and extended warranty benefits fees and costs the save wealth premium charges a 750 annual fee you ll also be charged a

we ve never before seen a credit card like the save wealth premium the opportunity to earn stock rewards instead of direct cash back comes with uncertainty a stock market free fall could mean you don t earn a dime for your spending but save s hypothetical back testing procedure suggests cardholders will receive an average of 5 7 back on all spending just be aware that you ll have to wait at least one year before you see any returns from the card as the investments generated by your spending must remain untouched for at least one year depending on the success of the save wealth premium this

while there s no question that 2022 has been an incredibly challenging year we provide six key themes that we expect will help shape and navigate investment making decisions in 2023 and beyond i delve into the ongoing pressures of the aggressive tightening of global monetary policy whether the reopening of china will help prevent australia from going into recession and how inflation will reduce as covid supply chain issues and the ukraine war impacts dissipate strange bedfellows the super cycle in renewables and oil natural gas the super cycle in renewables is in full flow and perversely oil and natural gas will remain a beneficiary until sufficient new renewable capacity is created the current renewable energy solutions of solar and wind are estimated to be some 10 times more metals intensive then the fossil fuel plants they are replacing the life cycle of the current renewable solutions are substantially less than a typical coal or nuclear power station which last 30 50 years the critical minerals required for global decarbonisation include rare earths lithium cobalt copper and nickel the world currently does not have sufficient reserves to fulfill the net zero aspiration therefore we expect prices will remain elevated with australia in a pivotal position given our resources inventory to help deliver on the energy transition refer tyndall s esg insights the value in securing critical minerals oil development is down substantially with cashflow from the major integrated oil and gas companies spent on buybacks natural gas and renewable projects like solar wind and hydrogen shareholder activism and government pressure have contributed to oil producers reducing capex and development spend traditionally there has been a tight relationship between oil prices and drilling development this relationship appears to be broken and even in the short cycle unconventional prospects onshore in the usa companies are drilling less despite the attractive economics given oil reservoir production typically depletes by 10 15 p a there appears to be a substantial supply gap going forward despite demand decreasing norwegian oil and gas consultant rystad estimate that 61m barrels of oil per day need to be developed by 2030 when using the 1 7 degree scenario refer figure 1 figure 1 demand for oil outstrips supply source rystad the three horseman of the apocalypse energy interest rates and labour costs increasing energy interest rates and labour costs are substantial headwinds for many companies and as margins continue to come under pressure we expect downgrades throughout 2023 labour pressures are being felt in both wages and from the global impact of apparent labour shortages given this is felt across various sectors it is difficult to envisage a short term fix outside of a substantial economic downturn the impact of monetary policy tends to lag by 12 18 months meaning the australian economy is yet to feel the full impact of tightening monetary policy full employment and an above average savings rates have softened the impact the wealth impact of housing weakening further in 2023 will eventually put the brakes on consumption the canary in the coal mine during slowdowns driven by interest rates is normally a discretionary consumer pullback consumer discretionary sales currently remain high with little evidence of pain felt by retailers we expect commentary in the february 2023 reporting season may provide some early signs of both margin and top line growth pressures the combined impact of the materially higher cost inputs of energy interest rates and labour should become clear over 1q 2023 margins are currently at high levels and we expect pressure particularly in companies and industries that have little pricing power to fight the inflationary forces we see little respite in energy and labour outside of government intervention whereas interest rates may roll over when central banks consider they have the inflation under control be prepared for the profit downgrades china exiting covid zero the changes observed over the past 20 years of visiting china have been incredible given the combination of a growing middle class and high annual gdp growth the chinese communist party ccp is cautious to not upset the mass population this is in contrast to an outsider s view which tends to believe china s people are frightened of the ccp the catalyst for the recent covid pivot from the ccp over covid restrictions were the large demonstrations often violent across china from citizens frustrated by the restrictions interestingly western governments ignored and at times violently pushed back on similar demonstrations the ccp has now relented and recently announced 10 optimisation measures that mark the tipping point of the country s economy reopening therefore in 2023 we are likely to see china go through a typical reopening phase similar to what we have observed across most western countries resulting in consumption and gdp increasing australia may be a beneficiary of china reopening as consumption and demand increase both services and materials demand will rise with oil and natural gas being a notable beneficiary recession risk rears its ugly head the aggressive tightening of global monetary policy aimed at slowing the economy is likely to move many countries into recession territory it appears to be a fait accompli that europe and the uk will dive into recession and the debate is still ongoing on whether the usa will dip into negative gdp growth australia has the benefit of the world desiring its resources and agricultural products and thus the probability of a recession appears lower albeit in many ways this is just semantics given a slowdown is coming inflation and interest rates the return of the old normal inflation will reduce as covid supply chain issues and the ukraine war impacts alleviate however inflation will remain stubbornly higher compared to the past 10 years given obvious structural changes including labour shortages persistent supply chain disruption and constrained supply of some goods technology innovation and productivity will need to accelerate to offset these pressures demographics meanwhile are negative for many countries with a slowing population particularly within advanced countries including china australia benefited prior to covid with strong immigration but overall the combination of increasing demand consumers and decreasing supply workers is not great arithmetic global demand for labour currently is high we hope central bankers have learnt their lesson given they kept monetary policy too low for too long and entered covid with very low interest rates it is difficult to envisage interest rates being that low outside of an emergency meaning higher interest rates are here to stay the net result is that higher interest rates and inflation imply that long duration assets should further derate getting deglobalisation right globalisation together with china essentially selling deflation to the world over the past 20 years will pause and perhaps even retreat companies and countries have recognised that relying on single supply chains or countries is risky covid and the ukraine war have illustrated these risks and we are starting to see governments develop plans to mitigate these risks in one example new chip manufacturing plants are being built in the us and governments are helping to fund the critical minerals required for the pathway to net zero additionally the australian government provided an au 1 2b non recourse debt facility to iluka resources asx ilu to help fund their rare earths processing facility in west australia this was unprecedented for the federal government and illustrates how countries are viewing the access to reliable and secure supplies of critical minerals most recently the us passed the inflation reduction act of 2022 ira which directs nearly us 400b in federal funding to clean energy with the goal of lowering carbon emissions by the end of the decade there are strings attached with many of the ira tax incentives requiring domestic production domestic procurement requirements or from a country with a free trade agreement australia could be a beneficiary of this given our relationship with the us which includes a free trade agreement the bottom line is that deglobalisation is inflationary and will continue placing pressure on inflation for many years to come value investing makes a big comeback tyndall has always viewed value investing as a philosophy rather than a factor our process has always aligned with the approach from benjamin graham the father of value investing tyndall values companies based on their sustainable earnings capacity we determine the intrinsic value by capitalising the sustainable or mid cycle earnings of every stock under coverage at its core value investing is buying companies that are trading below their assessed net worth maintaining a disciplined and patient approach the valuation gap between growth and value remains at extraordinarily high levels despite a recent narrowing refer figure 2 3 the tailwinds for growth post the gfc are unlikely to return anytime soon higher inflation and interest rates are here to stay and thus we expect the elevated valuations still being priced for growth will derate further a disciplined and bottom up valuation approach will deliver alpha during these times figure 2 high pe firms trade at a 75 premium to the market well above historical averages

december 22 2022 information clearing house vox t he invitation said the quiet part out loud the ukrainian embassy hosted a reception last week in honor of the 31st anniversary of the country s armed services events like this are part of the social calendar of washington s smart set with hobnobbing diplomats think tankers journalists and us officials guests took photos with the ukrainian ambassador even chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley showed up but there was something so overt it led some observers to laugh out loud at the gathering s invitation the logos of military contractors northrop grumman raytheon pratt whitney and lockheed martin were emblazoned on the invitation as the event s sponsors below the official ukrainian emblems and elegant blue script that said the ukrainian ambassador and defense attaché request the pleasure of your company it s really bizarre to me that they would put that on an invitation one think tank expert told me the fact that they don t feel sheepish about it that s interesting explained an academic both spoke on the condition of anonymity and regularly attend embassy events in washington that ukraine and those us military contractors have a strong relationship isn t surprising america s allies and partners around the world bought some 50 billion in us weapons last year these four companies produce some of the most high profile missile defense systems and anti tank missiles that president joe biden has sent to ukraine since russian president vladimir putin invaded in february neither is it surprising that ukraine s government which says its country has already suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in damage might not want to deplete its coffers but the explicit sponsorship indicates how intimate major military contractors have become with ukraine and how much they stand to gain from the war the invitation is a clear expression of how the war in ukraine has been good for business as ukraine fights a defensive war against russia s brutal invasion ukrainians in washington have been pushing for the us to send ukraine more weapons so far president joe biden s administration has committed a substantial 19 3 billion of military assistance since february that aid has been integral to ukraine s success on the battlefield their armed forces first repelled russia s advances and then launched counteroffensives that have retaken much of the territory russia initially claimed no one wanted to talk about the party invite however a senior official from the ukrainian embassy in washington confirmed that the companies logos appeared on the invitation but declined to speak on the record they directed me to the ukrainian ministry of defense which did not immediately respond lockheed declined to officially comment and deferred to ukraine house an embassy linked entity that was also listed on the invitation raytheon also declined to comment emails to northrop grumman and pratt whitney were not returned even some us supporters of ukraine say the overt sponsorship is a bad look sustaining american popular support is absolutely essential for ukraine s continued defense matt duss a carnegie endowment for international peace fellow who previously advised sen bernie sanders told me so ukrainian diplomats should probably think harder about how it looks for them to be throwing parties with the defense contractors who are making bank off of this horrible war 19 3 billion of us security assistance to ukraine briefly explained the biden administration has ramped up military aid to ukraine to an unprecedented degree it s had an undeniable effect on the battlefield it s also been good business for us defense contractors among the biggest winners are lockheed martin raytheon and northrop grumman each of their stocks has climbed since russia s invasion with lockheed up about 38 percent this year contractors have accelerated production to backfill the weapons the us has been sending to ukraine the javelin missile for example has become a meme in ukraine it s so in demand that lockheed said it will go from manufacturing 2 100 a year to 4 000 the biden administration has been using what s called a presidential drawdown authority to quickly source high end weapons from american stocks and get them into ukraine and then use congressional funding to replenish those you re making it possible for the ukrainian people to defend themselves without us having to risk getting in a third world war by sending in american soldiers fighting russian soldiers biden told employees at lockheed s troy alabama factory in may and every worker in this facility and every american taxpayer is directly contributing to the case for freedom lockheed also produces the high tech defensive systems that protect ukrainian cities under russian s aerial bombardment in appeals to washington ukraine has sought lockheed s high mobility artillery rocket system himars the us has sent ukraine 20 of the missile defense systems and is working to produce another 18 which will cost about 1 1 billion according to defense news lockheed also makes another precision missile system that has been sent to ukraine last month the us army awarded lockheed 521 million of contracts to refill its own supplies which had been sent to ukraine we are confident in long term growth as domestic and international demand for a wide range of our products and services remain strong ceo james taiclet said on the company s october earnings call raytheon for its part just won a 1 2 billion contract for six surface to air missile systems the company co produces javelin missiles and also makes stinger missiles which the us awarded a 624 million contract for in may the first in two decades according to the financial times over the first 10 months of the war ukraine has consumed as many stinger anti air missiles as raytheon makes in 13 years the trade publication breaking defense noted pratt whitney an aerospace company whose logo also appeared on the embassy invitation is one of raytheon s subsidiaries in its most recent earnings call raytheon ceo greg hayes described a significant global demand for advanced air defense systems especially in eastern europe as the russians and ukraine conflict unfortunately continues the entire military industrial base has been facing supply chain issues resulting from the covid pandemic and microchip shortages but northrop grumman a leading producer of ammunition could stand to gain long term from the ongoing war in ukraine one is the growth that we re seeing in munitions and particularly that demand which we expect to grow even more with the conflict in ukraine ceo kathy warden said on an earnings call arming ukraine is a good narrative for these companies especially after coming under intensive criticism for selling bombs to countries like saudi arabia which have reportedly been used to kill civilians in yemen and an embassy event for ukraine is an opportunity for military contractors to show that they support the so called arsenal of democracy military contractors support many research institutions and nonprofits in washington but that sponsorship tends to be more subtle their names appear in donor rolls or on the final page of a report not on an invite below an ambassador s name i ve never quite seen this kind of public embrace of a country and the weapons contractors as is happening with ukraine bill hartung a researcher at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft told me i can t imagine another situation where the contractors would sponsor an event for a country that they re arming in the middle of a war it s one thing to support ukraine to defend itself which i think is certainly legitimate he added but i think the companies want to go beyond that they want to cash in on this reputationally jonathan guyer covers foreign policy national security and global affairs for vox from 2019 to 2021 he worked at the american prospect where as managing editor he reported on biden s and trump s foreign policy teams
