operating as a grain buyer without a license in that state the five person psc heard four hours of testimony in lincoln the commission will take the information and will issue an order as an agenda item at an unspecified future regular meeting terri fritz the psc s grain division manager said the fine is based on the number of transactions and months of illegal trading banghart s attorney robert konrad of pierre south dakota asked for leniency and noted that the fine is triple the company s net worth that would bankrupt her he said psc lawyers said that assessment was based on financial

license and has implemented new internal controls konrad said his client has admitted to wrongdoing and is applying for the license there has been no harm to the farm although we can speculate on potential risk he said protecting producers should be weighed with wanting to be pro business and helping the economy grow he said the psc in october 2021 filed the complaints against companies associated banghart whose son jeremey frost has other grain related companies including fearless grain marketing storage and arbitrages fearless grain marketing and fearless grain as well as grain related legal issues frost did not appear the psc accuses the entities of taking possession of grain without issuing written communication compliant with commission rules a few mistakes banghart 61 speaking confidently admitted she made quite a few mistakes and was sorry for failing to know the nebraska licensing requirements and said she expected it to be as easy as it was in south dakota

go into south dakota newspapers the company was willing to cancel contracts when farmers asked for them but didn t notify the farmers they d made the deals without a license bond and with contracts that didn t have the proper warnings to sellers weird position when she realized the company had made deals without a license banghart allowed banghart properties to continue to pay farmers for deals made without a license because she didn t want to put them in a weird position at the end of the day the responsibility is yours rhoades said banghart acknowledged her education was in criminal justice and human services and her business experience had been in real estate management she worked four years in the grain business for her son before they switched roles and she became the boss

researchers at the new york federal reserve have a new way to measure the logistics chaos that s being partially blamed for consumer price inflation the global supply chain pressure index gscpi the new measure aggregates 27 indicators including two shipping indexes the baltic dry index bdi and harpex index into a standard deviation from the average since 1997 it s designed to provide a more comprehensive summary of potential disruptions affecting global supply chains so how high is it in october and november the latest two months available it measured 4 43 and 4 37 standard deviations above average respectively to put that in the lingo of financial traders the current situation is an extremely rare four sigma event chart american shipper based on data from gianluca benigno julian di giovanni jan groen and adam noble a new barometer of global supply chain pressures federal reserve bank of new york liberty street economics jan 4 2022 following the onset of covid the gscpi showed a sharp jump coinciding with the initial lockdowns in china europe and the u s then came a second even larger rise one that s still underway coinciding with the surge in consumer demand chart american shipper based on data from gianluca benigno julian di giovanni jan groen and adam noble in their introductory post on tuesday the new york fed researchers stated that more recently the gscpi seems to suggest that the global supply chain pressures while still historically high have peaked and might start to moderate somewhat going forward stories on the new index by reuters cnbc and business insider highlighted the potential peak angle in their headlines american shipper asked the fed researchers about the evidence of moderation they responded that the evidence is the index decline in november versus october but the index decreased just 1 4 in november from october after rising 2 115 between october 2020 and october 2021 and over the time span covered by the gscpi there have been many instances when the index fell by 1 4 or more in one month and then continued to rise thereafter most recently in june complete index dataset here index components the gscpi is built on variables that are meant to capture factors that put pressure on the global supply chain wrote the authors at the new york fed gianluca benigno and julian di giovanni assistant vps of research and statistics officer jan groen and senior research analyst adam noble in addition to the bdi and harpex there are four other transportation inputs to the gscpi u s bureau of labor statistics price indices on airfreight costs for asia u s u s asia europe u s and u s europe the other 21 components are purchasing managers index pmi surveys for three subcomponents delivery times backlogs and purchased stocks for seven economies euro area china japan south korea taiwan u k u s why bdi and harpex for ocean shipping insiders the inclusion of the bdi and the harpex might seem a curious choice the bdi tracks ton mile demand for dry bulk commodities mainly iron ore coal and grains in relation to the supply of bulk carriers near loading ports congestion does play a role in effective ship supply particularly so in 2021 due to strict covid protocols at chinese import terminals but over ordering of bulker newbuilds relative to demand far more so than congestion drove the bdi during the decade prior to covid the harpex measures the rates liners pay to charter ships not what cargo shippers pay to transport cargo supply chain congestion severely curtailed effective ship supply in 2021 increasing ocean carrier demand for charterable vessels and boosting charter rates to record highs but in the decade prior to covid container ship charter rates were dictated by excess newbuild deliveries relative to demand not port congestion asked by american shipper why the harpex was used as opposed to a spot freight rate index like the drewry world container index the new york fed researchers said that harpex was chosen because a longer sample was available we only have access to drewry over the last couple of years the harpex index goes back to 2001 only five years longer than drewry s world container index which has been published since 2006 asked about the inclusion of the bdi the researchers responded that it was chosen based on data availability the gscpi is generated using principal component analysis after all 27 components are adjusted in an effort to purge demand factors and isolate supply side drivers asked how the gscpi weighs the various components the authors explained that the bdi weighting is 0 02 and the harpex 0 09 to put this in perspective the weights of the country specific delivery times are in the 0 30 0 35 range as such the bdi has the smallest weight out of the 27 variables that go into the index and the harpex is in the bottom four indeed a chart released by the new york fed researchers of the pmi subcomponents weighted by gdp reveals the importance of the delivery time indicators which measure how supply chain delays impact producers the gdp weighted delivery times index the blue line in the chart below appears to most closely track the overall path of the gscpi during the covid era including a big decline around mid 2020 as the effect of initial lockdowns on delivery time reversed a pattern that significantly diverged from freight rates pmi subcomponents weighted by gdp chart gianluca benigno julian di giovanni jan groen and adam noble chart data harper petersen holding gmbh baltic exchange bloomberg l p haver analytics index peak or head fake container freight rates appeared to be peaking in september october but they didn t fall far before plateauing and over the past two months they started rising back up again likewise the harpex charter rate index has risen since november spot rate in per forty foot equivalent unit chart freightwaves sonar to learn more about freightwaves sonar click here another indicator the number of container ships waiting for berths in los angeles long beach has been rising inexorably since mid june as of tuesday there were 101 container ships waiting in the pacific very close to the all time high chart american shipper based on data from marine exchange of southern california as to the question of whether the gscpi has actually peaked as the new york fed researchers suggest or whether it s a head fake as the earlier dips in freight and charter rates turned out to be the release day for the december index has yet to be determined but updates will be published monthly click for more

one almost had to feel sorry for u s federal reserve chair jerome powell when in congressional testimony this september he expressed frustration at the inflationary pressures affecting the american economy on the plus side he finally acknowledged the existence of inflation that would last for more than a few months but then he went on to argue that the fed s expansionary monetary policy was not to blame that policy includes near zero short term nominal interest rates an enlargement of the fed s balance sheet to an astounding 8 trillion and a continuation of asset purchases at a monthly rate of 120 billion if there was ever an aggressive monetary policy this is certainly it powell continues to insist that today s high inflation is all about temporary bottlenecks and supply chain problems stemming from the pandemic induced recession and the subsequent uneven recovery according to this view the fed is merely a passive agent trying its best to provide enough liquidity so that the supply side inflation does not disrupt financial markets and the overall economy

this article is more than 2 years old getty images judging by the headlines there s not much to be cheerful about we are in the middle of a seemingly never ending pandemic mental health is deteriorating political polarization is historically high the planet is getting warmer and the spike in inflation dominates the economic news but step back a little and the picture becomes less gloomy in many ways life in the us is improving part of it is because us economic and stock prices growth driven by the tech sector are and will continue to be much stronger than in most other advanced economies the pie is expanding in addition a very tight labor market and faster wage growth benefit workers especially in manual labor and in person services jobs the pie is more evenly distributed and the shift to remote work is allowing millions of americans to spend less time commuting and to live in larger and better homes these trends are likely to continue for years here are 12 reasons why life in the us is getting better the us is growing faster than most other advanced economies thanks to its tech sector 1 the tech engine since 2017 the us economy has grown significantly faster than most other advanced economies especially those in europe greater labor productivity and rapid tech sector growth have spurred this one of the main comparative advantages of the us is in tech which happens to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the global economy 2 gains in tech companies values and stock prices tech companies owners stockholders and workers disproportionately benefit from these gains in the past five years us households financial assets increased by over 50 percent largely driven by tech company growth us stock price indices grew much faster in recent years than those in most other countries some of the gains will spread beyond stock owners tech workers and companies spend a large share of their income on goods and services in the communities in which they live and operate which will generate jobs and income for all workers 3 tech growth won t stop the pandemic has greatly accelerated the shift to online activity and businesses and consumers digital transformation which would otherwise have taken years that leads to faster growth in the global technological demand it helps that the us dominates the specific tech industries that have been growing rapidly in recent years such as online shopping and payments cloud computing services cyber security business related software social media online advertisement and on demand entertainment content there s no sign that this will slow any time soon workers are getting a bigger share of the pie especially lower paid workers 4 tight labor market is driving wage growth the share of workers compensation in gdp has been growing in recent years driven by the tightening us labor market and faster wage growth underlying it was the baby boomers retiring and a related stagnation in the number of working aged people that figure itself declined in 2020 and 2021 for the first time in us history and with more baby boomers reaching retirement age it s not likely to change in the next decade 5 rapid wage growth will continue us labor shortages during the second half of 2021 were the most severe in recent decades the reduction in labor supply due to the pandemic drove much of the tightening most of the pandemic impact will likely be gone in a year or two but labor shortages will remain for the rest of the decade job growth especially in in person services industries will likely be strong in 2022 by 2023 the unemployment rate will likely reach 3 percent the lowest in about 70 years history shows that once unemployment starts declining it will continue to do so until a few months before the next recession therefore the unemployment rate is likely to remain historically low for the next 5 10 years and a tight labor market will push wages higher 6 it s a workers market higher wages are not the only way tight labor markets help workers first the risk of being laid off is smaller second workers are more likely to switch to better jobs third benefits other non monetary job characteristics and overall job satisfaction tend to improve in tight labor markets wage inequality and poverty are declining 7 non college wages are growing faster workers without college degrees have enjoyed tighter labor markets than those with them since 2016 the narrative about slowing growth in the working age population masks two opposing educational trends the number of working age people with a bachelor s degree increases by about 2 percent annually while the number without bachelor s degrees who are willing to work in manual jobs is shrinking this is likely to sustain the labor shortage and fast wage growth among manual workers for the next decade manual workers strong wage growth led to a decline in wage inequality and poverty rates in the past seven years and will likely continue to for the rest of the decade 8 manual workers can t work remotely and will get paid more because blue collar jobs can t go remote they will become relatively less attractive that means that the number of workers entering these professions is likely to shrink and may lead employers to offer higher wages to fill positions 9 greater focus on equity corporate america is more focused on equality of opportunity with business leaders indicating a desire to diversify more indeed us ceos told the conference board in late 2020 that recruiting a more diverse workforce and building a more inclusive culture would be among 2021 s top human capital management issues that focus may narrow racial wage gaps the difference between what white and black workers make started out big and only grew in the 2010s despite efforts to reduce it but that trend reversed between 2019 and 2021 more black workers are finding high paying jobs according to the conference board research a possible result of social protests and a growing commitment of corporate america to racial equity remote work is improving quality of life 10 less commuting and bigger homes at some point in their lives many workers have had to decide whether to live in smaller homes close to their jobs in city centers partly to reduce commute time or to live in larger homes farther away now they can do both 11 more geographically distributed high paying jobs in the decade or two prior to the pandemic most high paying job growth occurred in a handful of coastal cities as remote work expands companies are growing operations and hiring high paid employees elsewhere this will lead to a more even geographical distribution of us income and wealth jobs are improving 12 the number of satisfying jobs is increasing new labor market entrants tend to be more educated than their predecessors and are likely to have more satisfying careers between 2000 and 2021 the share of management and professional workers in total employment increased from 34 to 43 percent the long run shift from manual services and routine office jobs to more satisfying professional jobs is likely to continue further raising overall job satisfaction covid 19 spreading faster than ever makes it difficult to see the full half of the glass but history may judge the 2015 2030 period as one of significant improvement in the quality of life of most americans especially when compared with other advanced economies perhaps there is something to be cheerful about after all

new york jan 5 xinhua u s stocks fell sharply on wednesday as a more hawkish federal reserve unnerved investors the dow jones industrial average decreased 392 54 points or 1 07 percent to 36 407 11 the s p 500 fell 92 96 points or 1 94 percent to 4 700 58 the nasdaq composite index shed 522 54 points or 3 34 percent to 15 100 17 all the 11 primary s p 500 sectors ended in red with real estate and technology down 3 22 percent and 3 13 percent respectively leading the losses u s listed chinese companies traded mostly lower with nine of the top 10 stocks by weight in the s p u s listed china 50 index ending the day on a downbeat note u s federal reserve officials anticipated earlier and faster interest rate hikes than previously expected as the economy continues to recover and inflation remains elevated according to the minutes of the fed s december policy meeting released wednesday rising interest rates could make stocks particularly high flying technology stocks less attractive since their valuations are based on future growth and cash flow when interest rates rise the value of that future cash flow is discounted on the economic front payroll data company automatic data processing reported wednesday that private companies in the united states added 807 000 jobs in december easily beating market expectations
you ll never know what would ve happened if the central bank had done something different the stock market had a tough day on wednesday losses for the nasdaq composite ixic 1 62 were the sharpest at more than 3 but declines for the dow jones industrial average dji 1 24 and s p 500 gspc 1 46 took both benchmarks well below their recent record levels index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 07 393 s p 500 1 94 93 nasdaq 3 34 523 market participants largely blamed the federal reserve for today s drop given that the bulk of the declines came after the central bank s monetary policy committee released the minutes of its december 2021 meeting yet little that the fed said should have come as any big surprise to investors given prior press conferences and releases here s what the fed minutes said and why investors need to look beyond them for an explanation of today s drop the main points the fed made the federal open market committee minutes repeated many key points that fed chair jerome powell and the central bank had already said among them were investors shifted their expectations for the timing of reductions in policy accommodation that is reduced fed spending on treasury and agency bonds and rises in short term interest rates to be nearer to the present the fed affirmed its belief that changes to the federal funds rate should be the primary tool for monetary policy arguing that the impact of other measures such as quantitative easing is less clear and familiar to the investing community and the general public the economy is much stronger currently than it usually is with interest rates this low which could make the fed react more quickly to remove accommodative monetary policy than in the past outlooks for inflation were higher than before even as risks to economic growth were greater on the downside some commentators pointed to the pace of tapering asset purchases and potentially raising rates as their key concern powell had been clear that asset purchases could end as soon as march but some had hoped that the fed would stand pat with the size of its balance sheet thereafter rather than quickly allowing it to shrink selective selling once again though substantial swaths of the market didn t react very negatively at all to the news looking broadly across the market stocks in the energy consumer staples materials and utilities sectors barely moved lower at all rather it was largely the sectors that saw the biggest share price gains that took the brunt of the damage on wednesday technology stocks were the most notable casualties with high growth disruptors seeing outsized declines other areas where accommodative policy has helped bolster prices including consumer discretionary and real estate also struggled given that those sectors have been among the top performers over the past year giving back some ground in a down market only seems fair somewhat more surprising was a drop in the financials banks have hoped for higher interest rates for a long time and so today s news might have seemed good however what really helps banks is having a big difference between short term and long term rates if the fed hikes short term rates more quickly than expected then it will shorten the period of time that banks can benefit from a more favorable rate environment volatility is here the only certainty for investors is that markets are likely to remain choppy as people try to digest the information they re getting that shouldn t stop stocks from solid long term performance but whether today proves to be a near term bottom or further losses ensue isn t something anyone can predict investors need to feel confident about the stocks they own and be able to weather whatever comes

review is reporting thatâ the post pandemic windfall of dividends provided by the australian share market in 2021 areâ expected to ease this year as companies become more confident about the economic

during the acute phase of the covid 19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 when a large part of the population was locked down at home the economy fell into a deep recession that hit the unskilled and minorities particularly hard moreover in contrast to previous downturns the job losses were concentrated in sectors with a high proportion of female workers justifying the term shecession the first indications therefore were that the fallout from the pandemic would exacerbate inequality but the subsequent two years have provided signs that this is not necessarily the case for starters the direct impact of actual or potential job losses on people s income was offset in most developed countries by unprecedented government support in the united states this assistance took the form of checks mailed directly to millions of households in europe most governments financed massive short term schemes under which the state footed the bill for firms to retain furloughed workers these measures meant that initial pandemic induced job losses did not lead to lower incomes and those most likely to lose their jobs were also the most likely to receive generous government support as a result inequality indicators that are based on disposable income that is total income after accounting for taxes and government transfers did not deteriorate and even improved slightly in some cases the most widely accepted gauge of income inequality is the so called gini coefficient which measures how far the observed income distribution diverges from perfect egalitarianism in the us the coefficient remained very high in 2020 but it did not increase further the pattern is similar in europe with one study even finding that income inequality fell from january 2020 to january 2021 in the european union s four largest economies germany france italy and spain according to another study although inequality would have increased considerably without government action both the gini index and the official eu risk of poverty indicator show that targeted state support programs neutralised this initial impact this outcome highlights how the state can perform its role of insurer of last resort by protecting vulnerable groups from an unexpected economic shock of unprecedented magnitude but governments are now winding down covid 19 support schemes as the recovery proceeds albeit somewhat more gradually in europe than in the us where the rebound is more complete does this mean that the pre pandemic trend toward increasing inequality will resume again initial indications are that the opposite may be true and that previous inequality patterns might be reversed in the post pandemic world the shecession turned out to be a short lived phenomenon with most job losses that affected women lasting only a quarter or two another encouraging sign is that the wage share the share of total output that is paid to employees increased in 2020 and in 2021 the wage share had been falling for a long time fostering a raft of explanations but the recent recovery seems natural there are currently too few workers to operate the existing capital stock build back better is a misnomer covid 19 lockdowns did not destroy any capital but merely rendered it idle for a short period the recovery thus does not require new capital only a redeployment of what was already available but there is now less labour available than before because of what us commentators have called the great resignation which has effectively reduced the workforce or rather the share of the adult population willing to work at previous wage levels firms must offer higher wages to attract the workers they need to increase production in europe labour markets are less dynamic but resignations are increasing in most eu member countries even as substantial pockets of unemployment remain and the greater need for workers is likely to persist for some time the pandemic has accelerated pre existing trends that in the very long run might reduce the demand for low skilled workers in particular but in the short to medium term will likely have the opposite effect for example online shopping which used to be marginal in most parts of europe is now rapidly gaining in popularity everywhere as a result many of the goods that we previously put in real life shopping carts stuffed into bags and carried home are now collected packaged transported and delivered by others who need to be paid for their time and effort most of these new roles are low skilled and might be performed in the distant future by robots self driving delivery vans or drones but because last mile delivery still requires humans for now the jobs outlook for the unskilled looks much better than before similarly a few years ago some pundits were predicting a world where robots would do much of the work truck drivers for example would supposedly be rendered unemployed by self driving vehicles but today a lack of drivers is one of the factors slowing the industrial sector s recovery from the pandemic from an economic perspective then the covid 19 crisis has so far played out much better than feared for the more vulnerable segments of society initial job and earnings losses were cushioned by generous state support and the vigorous recovery is leading to much improved employment prospects for many as the pandemic enters its third year that at least should provide some grounds for optimism project syndicate daniel gros is a member of the board and a distinguished fellow at the centre for european policy studies

princess beatrice and other high profile staff at afiniti are set to miss out on a bumper pay day after the tech firm shelved plans for a stock market listing the daily mail can reveal the company was looking to float this year in new york but in november founder and chief executive zia chishti stepped down after a former employee tatiana spottiswoode accused him of grooming her and then beating her during sex the scandal saw david cameron resign from the company s advisory board in further embarrassment for the former prime minister who was caught up in the greensill scandal last year embarrassment ex prime minister david cameron pictured resigned from afiniti s advisory board afiniti which was founded in 2005 and provides technology to call centres was valued at 1 1billion and hired upmarket merchant bank liontree to look into a spac deal spacs which are shell companies which list on the stock market raising millions from investors with the purpose of buying an existing company the float would have given beatrice prince harry s old friend tom skippy inskip former england rugby world cup winner will greenwood and archie soames nephew to nicholas and rupert soames a considerable payday as all are understood to own minority stakes in the business eton educated inskip is chief commercial officer and greenwood is a chief customer officer in the uk soames is a managing director a source close to the company said they ve snookered themselves the ipo is toast for now it is not known if cameron retained his stake in the firm after he resigned the scandal was a hammer blow for the former pm who had wanted to put greensill behind him and restore his reputation royal hanger on princess beatrice has defied calls from women s rights groups to step down instead it added to his shambolic post political career and left his judgment in question again he had joined afiniti in 2019 as chairman of the board of advisers saying he would help support work to transform the future of customer service and interpersonal communications beatrice stayed on after the scandal broke despite a string of resignations and calls for her to step down by women s rights groups the princess joined the firm in 2016 and worked her way up to be a vice president she has been on maternity leave since september but is understood to have demanded answers about recent events but even before the sexual assault allegations broke there was a murky shadow around afiniti and chishti the bermuda headquartered firm drew much attention to itself by hiring world famous politicians royals and aristocrats those who know chishti who was born in the us to an american father and pakistani mother say he was always drawn in by the glamorous life and wanted the contacts books of these men and women to give afiniti access to any boardroom in the world before afiniti chishti became a multi millionaire by founding invisalign which manufactures clear braces for teeth spottiswoode s evidence against chishti 50 referenced a work trip to brazil where the alleged assaults took place and an invitation to a ski trip in 2014 insiders say the company was renowned for its raucous parties and high profile ski trips one of which took place weeks before coronavirus struck in 2020 it saw beatrice lead a high level delegation to pakistan where chishti lived between 1974 and 1988 the point of these trips was to promote pakistan as safe for international investors and businesses afiniti has offices in karachi and lahore penalty former england rugby world cup winner will greenwood pictured was among those in line for a bumper payday the junket hosted by the country s president arif alvi brought together tech professionals entrepreneurs and multinational ceos from around the world for the unique expedition it caused a stir after photos emerged of beatrice chatting with imran khan and former italian pm matteo renzi it was all a bit odd to have some of the world s most rich and powerful men and women up a mountain together in pakistan but zia has always wanted to be part of this set the source continued chishti has a mixed reputation in pakistan his investment company trg pakistan which owns a majority stake in afiniti and is listed in karachi was probed in 2020 over alleged insider trading it wrote to pakistan s securities and exchange commission in december 2020 stating we have no formal means of knowing what speculations are circulating in the market and are unable to directly address these the lack of information in the letter did little to enhance trg s reputation or stop the rumour mill chishti also stepped down from trg in november afiniti has been less than honest in its dealings in bermuda too in january last year it vowed to employ 1 000 staff on the island over five years around 60 employees left the island last year while afiniti s unravelling has been swift questions remain over how so many high profile politicians and members of the british establishment managed to be enticed to the firm one former tory mp said i was approached in london for a role at the company when i left office they headhunt a certain type what is for sure is chishti has damaged his reputation as well the long list of public figures personally associated with him to make matters worse they won t be getting the pay day they perhaps were hoping for

according to a statement from the mayo clinic about 1 of the approximately 73 000 employees failed to meet the mandate requirement rochester minn approximately 700 mayo clinic employees were fired this week for failing to comply to the company s covid 19 vaccine mandate the nonprofit medical center gave all employees until monday jan 3 2022 to receive at least their first dose of the vaccine or provide a medical or religious exemption according to a statement from the mayo clinic about 1 of the 73 000 total employees failed to comply to those requirements while mayo clinic didn t provide an exact number of employees who failed to meet the vaccine requirement the statement reads that it s comparable to what other health care organizations have faced while final numbers are still not available nearly 99 of staff across all mayo clinic locations have complied with the required vaccination program meaning they have been vaccinated or have received medical or religious exemptions mayo clinic s statement reads this means that approximately 1 of staff across all locations will be released from employment as a result of the required vaccination program this is comparable to what other health care organizations have experienced in implementing similar vaccine requirement programs the statement adds that most of the medical or religious exemptions were granted the full statement reads the deadline for mayo clinic employees to become compliant with mayo s required vaccination program was jan 3 this means staff were required by jan 3 to receive at least one dose of vaccine and not be overdue for a second shot for moderna and pfizer only medical or religious exemptions were granted as mayo clinic shared on jan 3 staff continued to get first doses of covid 19 vaccine on jan 3 to become compliant with the required vaccination program several staff also received their first doses the weekend before jan 3 as these vaccinations were being administered and processed on jan 3 final numbers were not yet available for required vaccination program compliance some media reports have included incorrect estimates for the number of staff being released from employment as a result of noncompliance with the required vaccination program while final numbers are still not available nearly 99 of staff across all mayo clinic locations have complied with the required vaccination program meaning they have been vaccinated or have received medical or religious exemptions this means that approximately 1 of staff across all locations will be released from employment as a result of the required vaccination program this is comparable to what other health care organizations have experienced in implementing similar vaccine requirement programs the majority of medical or religious exemption requests were granted while mayo clinic is saddened to lose valuable employees we need to take all steps necessary to keep our patients workforce visitors and communities safe if individuals released from employment choose to get vaccinated at a later date the opportunity exists for them to apply and return to mayo clinic for future job openings based on science and data it s clear that vaccination keeps people out of the hospital and saves lives that s true for everyone in our communities and it s especially true for the many patients with serious or complex diseases who seek care at mayo clinic each day mayo clinic is deeply grateful to our staff who are working tirelessly and showing tremendous dedication to delivering the highest level of care to our patients in extremely challenging circumstances with the rising wave of infections from the omicron variant mayo clinic also urges all who are not vaccinated to get vaccinated as soon as possible and if you are eligible for a booster mayo clinic urges you to get a booster as soon as possible to help protect your health and the health of everyone around you on monday protesters gathered in rochester where mayo clinic s headquarters are located to speak out against the mandate kttc an nbc affiliate out of rochester reports dozens were in attendance including those who were granted medical or religious exemptions state house minority leader rep peggy bennett wrote a letter last month to mayo clinic president and ceo dr gianrico farrugia asking for the mandate to include consciousness opt outs as well as medical and religious exemptions though 100 percent employee vaccination may be ideal according to mayo guidelines we do not believe it is ethical nor is it realistic the letter which was signed by 38 lawmakers read in part we have had a healthcare worker shortage in minnesota for quite some time especially in rural areas where the mayo clinic predominantly serves losing even a small number of doctors and nurses because of an excessive employee vaccine mandate puts our healthcare system at risk the letter continued how can we as minnesota legislators rationalize investing state money for healthcare worker shortage programs and grants if those hospitals then turn around and fire those employees thereby exacerbating the problem we will not support state funding for programs like these or any other funding for any healthcare facility that fires their employees due to unrealistic vaccine mandate policies according to data released on the wednesday the minnesota department of health says 8 783 387 total doses of vaccine have been administered in the state with 3 764 738 people age 5 and older having received at least one shot 72 2 of that number 3 530 683 people have completed their covid series and are considered completely vaccinated 67 7 watch more on the coronavirus
the corvette c2 roadster is one of those cars that beg for a more powerful engine better brakes and sharper handling with some help from new technologies and those who made this one went the whole nine yards for it so you ll just have to drive it with a huge smile on your face in 1963 chevrolet introduced the second generation of the corvette which was designed by larry shinoda with some input from pete brock it was the first to be studied and slightly adjusted in the wind tunnel but while the rear window raised a war between zora duntov and bill mitchell the roadster s shape was their common ground it was and still is a beauty on the road the seller bought this c2 in 2020 but before that it was refurbished by corvette care in ohio in 2019 sure its 900 miles 1 448 km shown on the odometer can make you think that it is or was a garage queen but that doesn t mean that it cannot be driven hard since it is not the same car that left the factory in 1963 it s a different kind of animal under the refurbished and widened bodywork lies a new drivetrain and a coffman c2 custom chassis its suspension comes from a c6 corvette and the brake calipers from a z06 its viking coilovers will help the car stay on the road during hard cornering but the exterior finished in silver blue will surely catch some attention and if that s not enough the sound of the thunder chamber side pipes will inside the original looking radio is still on the center stack but it features a usb port for some 60s music i m not particularly attracted by the leather wrapped low back bucket seats with lap belts but a pair of high bolstered sport seats would have spoiled the car s look but the dakota digital instruments are just about right they look old but they are completely new and the speedometer is marked up to 160 mph 257 kph the car features a vintage air conditioning and power windows just to keep with the new era but the entire work is completed by the drivetrain which features an ls3 powerplant fed through a velocity air intake we don t know exactly how many ponies are provided but the 430 hp offered in stock form should be enough the engine is mated to a five speed manual that sends the power to the rear wheels via a dana 44 rear axle with a 3 56 1 gear ratio from my experience in a z06 this setup should be more than enough to smoke the 325 30 michelin pilot sport tires long enough even on dry pavement this awesome restomod just surfaced for sale on the bring a trailer auction website and some already appreciated that its final price will be a six figure one and i can t argue with that with seven days to go it was already at 60 001 bucks

this article is more than 2 years old vcg via getty images china is the world s last zero covid holdout the government has staked its political legitimacy on controlling the virus a new york times headline the recent outbreak in the chinese city of xian has spurred some of the toughest covid countermeasures yet authorities have shut down the entire city of 13 million people shuttering businesses schools and factories imposing virtual house arrest on all residents leaving home is a violation not even food shopping is allowed instead bags of vegetables leeks cabbages broccoli will be delivered to the locked down inhabitants hundreds of quarantine camps are being prepared to hold people who may have been in proximity to an infected individual the city s economy is at a complete standstill xinhua news agency via getty images covid containment policies obviously involve a trade off between economic outcomes and public health outcomes and of course these are mutually interdependent strict measures lockdowns travel bans etc raise the economic cost but hopefully save lives so is china s hardline approach working the question has both an economic answer and a medical one the economic impact the economic picture in china is murky as usual however even aside from the xian crisis a slowdown seems to be taking place across the country more on that in part 3 of this series the official chinese gdp growth figure for q3 2021 was 4 9 the lowest quarterly gdp figure ever except for the first two quarters of 2020 when the pandemic shock first hit western estimates are more pessimistic monthly data showed china s economy slowing sharply china s tough virus curbs mean economic activity could be close to flat bloomberg the declining chinese stock market reflects this it is the only major financial market to have declined this year chart by author in the real economy china s retail consumption remains stubbornly weak and other signs of distress have multiplied a slump in retail sales and property construction chinese consumption growth has rarely looked weaker real spending on consumer goods rose only 0 5 year over year in november the weakest since at least 2011 the economic damage is becoming apparent wsj china has apparently decided to accept significant economic sacrifices to control the virus the public health impact china claims officially an extraordinarily low incidence of covid mortality however there are significant gaps in the chinese data as described in the previous column essentially beijing put a halt to the reporting almost two years ago it means that most of the international comparison studies have to leave china out the absence of reliable internal covid statistics forces us to look at comparative benchmarks based on better data from other countries the official figures from reuters a comparison of the officially reported covid mortality rates for various countries in asia makes it clear that china is an extreme statistical outlier developed asian economies japan gdp capita 41k and korea 32k gdp capita are rich countries fully industrialized and important trading partners for china singapore 60k gdp capita is a very rich very tightly controlled city state well known for its strict social policies and vigilant administration all three countries are seen as having implemented successful covid containment programs with mortality rates 10 20 times lower than in europe or north america yet china claims to have a covid mortality rate that is 30 50 times lower even than these three comparables chart by author developing asian economies china s cities match up with those in its rich neighbors but there are more than half a billion people in rural china with incomes about 1 3rd of the average income of the urban chinese population living conditions and health care deficits are common many rural chinese are still unvaccinated socially and economically rural china looks more like some of its developing asian neighbors yet china claims a covid mortality rate up to 300 times lower than these other asian nations chart by author china s neighbors japan and singapore are islands lacking any land borders korea has just one militarily closed border these countries can more easily control traffic from abroad than china which is a continental power with many neighbors that share land borders with it borders that are in some cases quite porous open to legitimate and illegitimate human traffic there are hundreds of thousands of refugees from north korea in china today burmese refugees number in the tens of thousands smuggling and human trafficking from vietnam is endemic where border walls are being constructed how does china compare with its neighbors china in fact shares land borders with 14 other countries a total of over 13 000 miles the longest aggregate land borders of any country in the world yes even longer than russia s borders all of these countries are evidently hot beds of covid infection and death hundreds of times higher than china how does china keep all that bubbling contagion at bay chart by author korea the best comparable the best close comparable for china in terms of climate culture economic development patterns of commerce and covid protocols is arguably korea getty images south korea is regarded generally as the emerging covid 19 success story it has countered covid aggressively and successfully south korea s response to covid 19 has been impressive building on its experience handling middle east respiratory syndrome mers south korea was able to flatten the epidemic curve quickly it achieved this success by developing clear guidelines for the public conducting comprehensive testing and contact tracing and supporting people in quarantine to make compliance easier the country successfully managed outbreaks in march and august and gradually gained control of a larger more dispersed outbreak in december 2020 overall south korea has shown success across three phases of the epidemic preparedness and response framework detection containment and treatment was managed through restrictions on international travel school closures targeted suspensions of public gatherings and closures of public entertainment venues the primary focus has been a system of testing contact tracing and quarantine supported by mobile technology and data analytics brookings institute study south korea does not have the exposure to the many porous land borders with other countries that china has that has certainly helped with the isolation measures and no doubt kept mortality rates down experientially the korean covid regime was similar to the chinese except for the city wide lockdowns korea required all travelers to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days they had rigorous testing they had rigorous contact tracing they mask up korea unlike china has excellent covid related data there are no unexplained gaps and the registration of cases seems to be very thorough according to the economist s study cited below korea s reported death toll conforms almost exactly to the predicted mortality rate given all that we would expect a similar public health outcome korea s mortality rate is among the lowest in the world at 108 deaths per 1 000 000 population nevertheless china s reported death rate is said to be 34 times lower than korea s new zealand the edge case finally consider the most extreme comparison available getty images the island nation of new zealand is the most geographically isolated country in the world it has a very low population density just 11 of the population density of china both factors should be favorable with respect to controlling the spread of covid new zealand is rich with 4 times the per capita gdp of china it is peaceful and well governed it has strong medical institutions and universal government run and publicly funded healthcare the country responded quickly to covid and instituted a rigorous travel ban the authorities articulated an aggressive zero covid type policy early on which has been described as an emblematic champion of proper prevention and response to the pandemic informed by strong science based advocacy national leaders decisively switched from a mitigation strategy to an elimination strategy the government implemented a stringent countrywide lockdown new england journal of medicine the country was able to contain the initial wave more effectively than almost any other nation the first covid case in nz was diagnosed on february 26 2020 and the last case was diagnosed in early may recently the delta and omicron surges have produced a handful of new cases as a result of these natural advantages and smart policies new zealand achieved an extraordinarily low mortality rate of just 10 3 deaths per million the lowest of any developed country by far australia with similarly stringent policies had a rate 8 times higher most european countries were at least 100 times higher still still china claims an overall covid mortality rate three times lower than new zealand and if we exclude the single 90 day period of wuhan hubei s covid cases from january 1 to march 31 2020 the only sample of quasi complete mortality data from china in two years which accounts for 97 of all officially reported chinese covid deaths then china s official covid mortality rate over the past 20 months would be wait for it 73 times lower than new zealand s in any data analysis project when a discrepancy in the data becomes too large one must entertain the possibility that there is either a measurement problem or a bias in the reporting or outright falsification the economist s study to address the missing data problem western analysts have recently turned to alternative methods for estimating the prevalence and impact of covid the economist has developed a new model for assessing covid mortality the methodology followed by the economist is fully published here the results underscore the anomalous character of the chinese data the model is intended to correct for systematic gaps and discrepancies in reporting of covid deaths these discrepancies can arise from bad record keeping and administrative inefficiencies from weaknesses in national governance e g the effects of war civil unrest from diagnostic failures covid deaths that are mislabeled as due to other causes or from incomplete reporting protocols e g china does not include asymptomatic covid cases in its published figures discrepancies may also be the result of deliberate suppression alteration or falsification of the mortality data for political purposes the economist s model attempts to estimate excess mortality this refers to the deviation from the past averages and trends in death rates in a given country death rates are normally very steady for example the u s death rate from 1950 to 2000 varies only about 1 from its average in any given year so if the death rate rises much above that trend line there is said to be excess mortality by analyzing this relationship and using a machine learning model to bring other sources of data to bear the scope and some aspects of the source of the discrepancy between the reported covid deaths and the total number of deaths can be estimated with the goal of illuminating unreported covid related deaths as far as i can tell the economist s model does not have the ability to discriminate the motive that gives rise to a discrepancy they don t differentiate between underreporting due to incompetence vs political manipulation the model focuses on quantifying the discrepancy relative to the official figures globally the study concludes that covid deaths are underreported by a factor of 2 to 4 that is if the model is correct there have been between 6 and 18 million more covid deaths in the entire world than what has been officially reported looking at individual countries the model further confirms the peculiarity of chinese covid mortality figures chart by author only 17000 off ponder that dear reader who knew percentages could even go that high or to reverse the ratio china has apparently reported less than 1 of the actual covid deaths in the country and keep in mind that almost all deaths of those it has reported some 97 of them come from that single 90 day period for a single city wuhan as noted in the previous column can these results be questioned of course like any estimation procedure there is inherent uncertainty the model is built on various assumptions which can each be critically examined the model s output is given as a range bounded by statistical likelihood parameters e g the 95 confidence interval this means that this model cannot be expected to reveal fine differences the distinction between 200 and 300 under reporting is probably not bankable so to speak but china s undercount stands out no other major country is even close to this discrepancy the only comparably large figures come from countries that are currently involved in war or large scale civil unrest such as south sudan chad the congo burkina faso where it is understandable that public health records may not be in good order even some of the most unsettled countries in the world currently such as libya 400 iraq 900 iran 100 and afghanistan 900 venezuela 1100 while they have large discrepancies and are clearly undercounting their covid deaths they are no where near china s ratio of 17 000 conclusions china s reported covid statistics are the outlier in the global picture beijing s official numbers are 10 s or 100 s of times lower than would be expected from simple comparisons even with countries that have the aggressive and stringent countermeasures e g singapore japan korea australia new zealand after q1 2020 china stopped providing most mortality data since that time china s reported mortality rate is more than 100 000 times lower than the major western countries than the major western countries china s willingness to provide data related to covid in any way has been minimal the pattern of denial obstruction and data destruction is striking china has a long history of public health scandals including faulty vaccines multiple adulterated baby formula and coverups and mismanagement related to the initial outbreaks of sars 2003 bird flu 2004 bird flu again 2013 swine flu 2019 and covid 2020 bottom line china s numbers cannot be trusted which ought not to be surprising given how little we can trust china with respect to almost anything involving covid in light of all this the economist s study needs to be taken seriously it is not a definitive conclusion it is an estimate it is a serious and well founded attempt to make up for the appalling gaps in chinese accounts the numbers with whatever caveats are so large as to clearly indicate that china has been misreporting covid mortality at least since april 2020 as to motives the ny times headline puts it succinctly the government has staked its political legitimacy on controlling the virus it is a battle beijing cannot afford to lose

according to the bureau of labor statistics there were more than 218 000 personal financial advisers operating in the united states as of september 2021 and that number is expected to grow at a mere 5 in the decade between 2020 and 2030 since so many customers rely on automated services such leveling of the profession creates an urgent need to establish trust among customers which in turn makes a potential breach all the more damaging it s so important to remember that cybersecurity is a constant risk says nick santora ceo of curricula speaking to the discreet approach of many financial advisers you can t win in cybersecurity you can only build progress towards a better defense for financial services institutions and across the industry many people tried to solve the problem of cybersecurity as if security and compliance were one in the same and responded by implementing technology to check the box in the first part of this series sc media examined the increasing threats facing financial advisers here we examine the particular factors that may place financial advisers in a more precarious position ultimately managing lost business customer attrition lost revenue systems outages and a struggle to win over new customers simply put said rodrigo macias partner and leader of the advisory services at mgo a professional services firm focused on cybersecurity better effort needs to be put toward minimizing risk because many firms are not in a position to manage the impact the inevitable level of inconvenience mike morris principal with wipfli llp said that unfortunately security often comes with a level of inconvenience as it does across various financial channels and services however tightening email filters providing users with regular cybersecurity training he said and using multifactor authentications on all critical applications and remote access can help reduce the risk and the impact that these types of attacks pose santora points out that technical controls are extremely important in any security program but they re not the ultimate answer we all need to do better he said we can t just buy software or implement technical controls and expect results we now know that we need better security awareness training which involves the industry working together on understanding the problem from a new angle sameer ansari a managing director and deloitte s leader of u s cyber strategic risk services for the investment management sector said that as financial advisers increasingly rely on technology to further enable and automate their business processes the cyber threats to their business have also skyrocketed while cyber threats are similar across financial services there are differences in how financial advisers see those threats john lacour principal strategist with helpsystems pointed out that financial advisers often have access to broad client financial portfolios many advisers often communicate with clients via email which is especially susceptible to attackers intercepting those communications he said and pretending to be either the adviser or client often resulting in money being misdirected to the attacker lacour adds that many independent financial advisory firms are small and simply don t have the resources and expertise to implement a robust cybersecurity program sameer ansari a managing director and deloitte s leader of u s cyber strategic risk services for the investment management sector says that cyber threats to financial advisers can span the front office robo advisers and portfolio management to the middle office like compliance reporting payments and settlements and risk models back office with fund accounting reporting hr finance and marketing financial advisers could easily suffer distributed denial of service attacks during market hours while they may be trading customers stocks or the threat of malicious insiders working to exploit their settlement another potential threat vector according to ansari ransomware or data theft ploys could target the data of high net worth clients or the trading algorithms used by the advisory service itself prior to covid 19 pandemic disruption most financial advisers were already pursuing digital transformations driven by market needs since then financial advisers transformations have accelerated adopting public cloud and increasing commitment and investment towards digital security improvement in cloud hybrid and on prem settings ansari says he sees most financial advisers taking a threat based view of their digital operations working to understand how they can create layered security approaches to help mitigate cyber risks and to leverage public cloud adoption to increase digital agility and automation to get their technology platforms to market faster for financial advisers as well as broader fsis organizations are continuously looking at ways to reduce the friction that exists between security

listen to this article listen to this article the u s job market is nearly at levels healthy enough that the central bank s low interest rate policies are no longer needed federal reserve officials concluded last month according to minutes of the meeting released wednesday fed officials also expressed concerns that surging inflation was spreading into more areas of the economy and would last longer than they previously expected the minutes said many policymakers saw the u s economy making rapid progress toward the fed s goal of maximum employment the minutes said several officials said they felt the goal had already been reached the minutes underscored the fed s sharp pivot from what had been its policy through most of the pandemic shifting from keeping interest rates very low to encourage more hiring to moving quickly towards raising rates to rein in inflation which has surged to four decade highs fed officials also voiced heightened concerns about inflation a development that pushed down stock prices after the minutes were released bond yields also rose in response the yield on the 10 year treasury note a benchmark for setting rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans increased to 1 7 soon after the minutes were released from 1 68 just before inflation readings had been higher and were more persistent and widespread than previously anticipated the minutes said some participants noted that the percentage of product categories with substantial price increases continued to climb with inflation worsening and unemployment falling more quickly than many economists expected fed chair jerome powell said after the dec 14 15 meeting that the central bank was accelerating the reduction of its ultra low interest rate policies the fed said last month that it would reduce the monthly bond purchases it has made since the spring of 2020 which are intended to lower long term rates at twice the pace it had previously set and will likely end those purchases in march that accelerated timetable puts the fed on a path to start hiking its benchmark short term interest rate as early as the first half of next year fed policymakers also suggested they could hike the fed s short term benchmark interest rate three times this year that signaled a significant pickup from their september meeting when the 18 policymakers split over whether to lift rates a single time in 2022 even fed officials who have long been focused on keeping rates low to combat unemployment such as san francisco federal reserve bank president mary daly and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari now cite concerns about high inflation as a reason for raising interest rates this year the fed s key rate which has been pinned near zero for nearly two years influences many consumer and business loans including mortgages credit cards and auto loans rates for those loans may start to rise too later this year though changes in fed policy don t always immediately feed into other borrowing costs
advertisement sales of new motors remained at almost 20 year lows with a fraction less than 1 65 million passenger cars entering the market in a desperately disappointing 2021 for the motor sector according to industry bosses this came as vehicle production was crippled by the semiconductor chip shortage and that heavily influenced a major shake up of britain s most popular new cars with ford s fiesta knocked off its perch for the first time in 12 years and vauxhall s corsa becoming the top seller tesla s 42 500 tesla model 3 was the second most popular new car in 2021 with almost 35 000 registrations propelling it up the order from the fourteenth best selling motor in 2020 but forget cars it was the ford transit custom van that was the vehicle sold in highest numbers annual car sales were a mere one percentage point higher than a lockdown hit 2020 in which showrooms were forced to close for months making it the second worst year for registrations since 1992 the society of motor manufacturers and traders confirmed this morning with manufacturers facing significant part supply issues and forced to make tactical decisions around priority of production and consumers buying an increasing number of electric and hybrid vehicles the list of the uk s best selling models of 2021 looks drastically different to how it did before the pandemic here s a rundown of the top 10 most registered new cars last year 10 toyota yaris 2021 registrations 27 415 2020 ranking 15th up 5 places price from 20 210 the yaris picked up a number of awards in 2021 toyota s impressive management of the semiconductor chip shortage helped the supermini gatecrash the top 10 best sellers in the uk last year the all new yaris was named 2021 european car of the year and picked up a number of different accolades last year also boosted by the huge popularity of the gr yaris rally inspired hot hatch glowing recommendations weren t what entirely drove the japanese supermini to tenth spot in the overall sales standings toyota was one of the brands that best managed the semiconductor chip shortage last year having stockpiled the essential parts however in august it was hit by supply issues with the company forced to suspend production during september still the impressive small car racked up enough sales to scrape into the top 10 toyota s impressive management of the chip shortage also saw it become the best selling car maker in the united states dethroning general motors which had held the crown as us s favourite brand every year since 1931 9 kia sportage 2021 registrations 27 611 2020 ranking 16th up 7 places price from 26 745 2022 model kia dealers would have been shifting their remaining stock of sportage suvs before the all new 2022 car is due to arrive in their showrooms early this year the sportage has always been a relatively popular family suv in the uk taking sixteenth spot overall in 2020 the rise to ninth spot last year is likely due to cars being available to buy that s because an all new sportage hits the market in 2022 meaning dealers would have been shifting the remaining stock of previous generation examples why is it so attractive to buyers in britain firstly it is competitively priced and that s before you take into account any discounts with dealerships looking to make space in their showrooms for the arrival of the 2022 model but it is also packed with loads of equipment and is sold with kia s long lasting seven year warranty 8 ford puma 2021 registrations 28 697 2020 ranking 9th up 1 place price from 22 885 the puma is incredibly the only ford to make it into the top 10 best selling new cars of 2021 with the fiesta and focus slipping out of the rankings for the first time in decades like the toyota yaris the ford puma has picked up plenty of awards since it hit the market a couple of year ago winning a string of gongs in 2020 incredibly it s the only ford model in the top 10 list of best selling cars with both the focus and incredibly the fiesta dropping out of the order for the first time in decades insiders suggest the reason for the pair of ford stalwarts falling down the pecking order of registrations wasn t a case of dwindling demand but a shift in tactics by the company as it appeared to prioritise semiconductor availability for the production of its commercial vehicles the puma officially becomes the best selling compact suv in 2021 retaining the accolade from 2020 by leading the expanding sector 7 nissan qashqai 2021 registrations 29 992 2020 ranking 6th down 1 place price from 24 555 the qashqai has been the best selling suv in britain since it first hit the market over a decade ago in 2021 it retained that crown the qashqai has retained its crown of britain s most popular suv in 2021 amassing more sales than any of its rivals yet again a feat it has managed ever since it was first introduced in 2007 one big factor helping to boost the qashqai s popularity among britons is the fact it is produced on our shores with the suv assembled at nissan s sunderland factory and a new version arrived in 2021 offering mild hybrid technology plenty of extra equipment a boost in practicality and fresh new looks a combination of orders for the third generation car and sales of remaining second gen model stocks in showrooms has kept it firmly among the best selling new passenger vehicles of the previous 12 months a new e power hybrid is set to be made available soon which should help to cement the qashqai s position among the most popular motors in 2022 as drivers switch to greener vehicles 6 volkswagen golf 2021 registrations 30 240 2020 ranking 3rd down 3 places price from 24 430 the vw golf 8 hit the market in 2020 meaning it has been on sale during one of the most difficult recent periods for the automotive sector every car maker has suffered as a result of the semiconductor shortage with automotive giant vw also caught up in the global issue as a result the golf traditionally volkswagen s best selling new car has slipped down the charts to sixth having been the third most popular model in britain behind the vauxhall corsa and ford fiesta in 2020 reduced outputs at the brand s wolfsburg plant mean the german car maker has a backlog of golf orders to fulfil the eighth generation car hit the market last year meaning it has arrived at one of the most difficult times for the sector 2021 car sales only 1 higher than covid hit 2020 official figures published by the society of motor manufacturers and traders this morning show the car industry continued to be hit by covid related problems throughout last year most notably the ongoing shortage of semiconductor computer chips needed for vehicle production sales increased by 1 per cent year on year in 2021 even though 2020 was the worst year for sales since 1992 due to the pandemic and the first lockdown which forced dealerships to close a total of 1 647 181 motors were registered last year up from 1 631 064 the year before in what mike hawes boss at the smmt described as another desperately disappointing year for the car industry as covid continues to cast a pall over any recovery for the sector he added manufacturers continue to battle myriad challenges with tougher trading arrangements accelerating technology shifts and above all the global semiconductor shortage which is decimating supply new car registrations in 2020 were the lowest since 1992 a 1 increase in 2021 means the industry is far from recovering from a pandemic hit period with semiconductor chip shortages continuing to cripple motor production volkswagen overtook ford to become the uk s most popular car maker with a total of 147 826 registrations across all models it was the first time on record that vw topped the manufacturers sales charts in the uk audi and bmw also sold more motors than ford last year with the latter having just 116 305 new motors entering the market in 2021 vauxhall was even lower at 91 452 one positive taken by sector leaders was the rise in pure electric vehicle registrations with more sold last year than in the previous five years combined some 190 792 pure electric cars were registered last year up from 108 205 the year before accounting for more than one in ten new motors bought 11 6 per cent with the kia e niro and vw id 3 adding to the success of the tesla model 3 read more about that below while sales of pure electric cars didn t quite manage to overtake diesel registrations in 2021 234 486 diesels registered industry bosses say battery electric vehicle are set to surpass oil burners for sales for the first time this year diesels accounted for 14 2 per cent of sales last year low emission vehicles combining pure electric plug in hybrid and self charging hybrid cars accounted for a massive 27 5 per cent of cars sold last year the data confirms but petrol is still by far the most popular type of car accounting for 58 3 per cent of sales in 2021 more than 1 in 10 new cars bought in 2021 were pure electric cars combined with plug in and hybrid electric vehicles the data shows that over a quarter of sales were low emission motors last year at present only about one in every 100 cars on the road uses a plug a blow to the government s target of banning all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 mike hawes chief executive of the smmt said this needed to improve to about one in three before the end of the decade if the target is to be hit he both called for the government to make drastic improvements to charging infrastructure and criticised ministers for the decision to cut electric car grants in december saying it sent mixed messages to consumers about the bid to reduce air pollution in the uk the biggest obstacle to our shared net zero ambitions is not product availability however but cost and charging infrastructure hawes said in a statement recent cuts to incentives and home charging grants should be reversed and we need to boost the roll out of public on street charging with mandated targets providing every driver wherever they live with the assurance they can charge where they want and when they want 5 volkswagen polo 2021 registrations 30 634 2020 ranking 8th up 3 places price from 18 285 the polo rose above its bigger vw sibling the golf in the sales charts in 2021 with figures likely bolstered by the sales of remaining stocks of the previous generation model that has recently been replaced like the golf there is a new polo on the market which arrived on sale late last year that means its position of fifth in the 2021 rankings is likely a result of available stock being sold to make way for the latest iteration with order books for the latter opening around september this has pushed the polo above its bigger sibling in the uk sales charts for the first time in years registrations hit 30 634 last year which was 394 examples more than the golf volkswagen for the first time on record was the most popular car brand in britain last year overtaking ford 4 mercedes benz a class 2021 registrations 30 710 2020 ranking 5th up 1 place price from 25 975 the mercedes a class which starts from just under 26 000 is now the most popular new family hatchback bought by britons the uk has a new favourite family hatchback and it s a premium model the mercedes a class now outsells the vw golf ford focus vauxhall astra and every other mainstream family hatch on the market and has also completely thrashed the bmw 1 series arguably its closest rival this second generation a class only arrived on the market late in 2017 but has had a big impact on uk buyers and proved a huge hit thanks to attractive finance deals private customers and fleet operators have been lapping it up due to its quality interior and high safety standards this has seen the merc move one place higher in the sales standings than last year 3 mini hatchback 2021 registrations 31 792 2020 ranking 7th up 4 places price from 17 405 despite pausing production in april due to the semiconductor shortage mini has sold enough hatchbacks to warrant taking third spot in the sales charts for 2021 the minis rise to the third most bought new car in 2021 is despite owners bmw being forced to pause assembly lines at its plant oxford site in april again due to semiconductor shortages yet some 31 792 examples of the compact hatchback both three and five door models were registered in the uk according to the latest smmt figures this means the mini has jumped four places higher in the popularity ranks for uk drivers compared to a year ago the mini electric also built at the oxford factory likely helped to boost sales with the zero emission version of the car the seventh best selling pure electric vehicle last year 2 tesla model 3 2021 registrations 34 783 2020 ranking 14th up 12 places price from 42 990 incredibly the tesla model 3 despite its 43 000 starting price was the second most bought new car in britain last year official figures have confirmed in 2020 the tesla model 3 set a new record by becoming the first fully electric car to break into the top 15 best sellers in britain last year it went to dizzying new heights and has become the second most bought new passenger car in the country with a massive 34 783 registrations during 2021 incredibly at the end of november the model 3 wasn t even among the top 10 however a shipment that arrived in the final month of the year as tends to be the case with teslas mostly coming to the uk in bulk at the end of each quarter saw it leap up the standings with 9 612 model 3s almost a third registered in december alone the majority of model 3 customers will be company car drivers who are taking advantage of the lucrative salary sacrifice scheme with low benefit in kind taxation of 1 per cent for electric vehicles 1 vauxhall corsa 2021 registrations 40 914 2020 ranking 2nd up 1 place price from 17 380 the vauxhall corsa has brought to an end the ford fiesta s 12 year stint at the top of the uk s best selling cars standings it is also the first time a ford hasn t been the nation s most bought new model since 1971 the ford fiesta has been the top selling new car in britain for the previous 12 years but it has been forced to pass the baton to a new king the corsa it will be a bitter pill for ford to swallow passing the gong to its nearest rival and brings to an end a 50 year run of a ford topping the sales charts it also spells the end of a record held by the brand for half a century the last time a car without the blue oval badge on its bonnet either the cortina escort focus or fiesta was crowned the nation s best seller was in 1971 when the austin morris 1100 1300 topped the registration rankings the corsas rise to the top is down to a combination of factors including plenty of fleet sales and the popularity of its all electric corsa e which was the ninth most bought pure electric car in britain in 2021 however the corsa wasn t the best selling motor in britain last year nation s best selling vehicle overall in 2021 ford transit custom van 2021 registrations 53 394 2020 ranking behind vauxhall corsa and ford fiesta up 2 places price from 28 825 excl vat while the vauxhall corsa might be the best selling car of 2021 more new transit custom vans right were registered in the uk last year some 53 394 entered the road along with 34 293 two tonne transits left which would be enough to earn it third position in the list above fourth if including the transit custom ahead of the mini hatchback that s right the best selling new motor in the uk last year wasn t a car but a van a total of around 355 000 vans sold in 2021 up 21 per cent on 2020 and only two per cent down on 2019 ford s transit custom topped the commercial vehicle sales charts amassing 53 394 registrations which is more than any car model last year and 12 480 units ahead of the vauxhall corsa industry insiders claim the rise in demand for vans due to the increasing reliance on deliveries during the pandemic saw ford prioritise its semiconductor availability to its commercial vehicles for those manufacturers that build them vans also offer stronger profit margins than passenger cars because they are less expensive to produce it also explains why the two tonne transit also sold in massive numbers last year with 34 923 registrations enough to place ahead of the mini hatchback in the list above

brevard county fla â a few days into 2022 captain john murrayâ s prediction for the new year is that the cruise industry wonâ t see another mass shutdown like the one that dominated the majority of the pandemic so far speaking with reporters on wednesday morning the ceo of the port canaveral port authority said things are trending in the right direction for the port and he didnâ t see the pandemic stopping that what you need to know the current surge of cases hasnâ t halted cruise operations from port canaveral murray said the next big influx of passengers will come over the spring break period the cdcâ s conditional sailing order is set to expire on january 15 2022 â if you were out here in the last couple of weekends our cruising numbers were very strong through the holidays â murray said â you know the average traveler knows that if you re on a cruise ship they do their investigation ahead of time and you re safer probably on a cruise ship than you are in a grocery store â murray said that because all passengers and crew need to be vaccinated ahead of each departure any potential breakthrough infection wonâ t be as potent â the cruise lines have the protocols in place as do we at the ports to manage these we ve done this from the very beginning we said that you know his conditions changed weâ d modify â murray said last month the centers for disease control and prevention increased its covid 19 travel health notice and advised against cruising even for those who are vaccinated murray said the level four designation for cruising wonâ t slow things down for the industry â if you follow the cdc website to where those announcements are it falls right in line with every other country in the world basically â murray said â ireland s on the list germany s on the list all are level four so you know cruising is just one more country so to speak that s on the level four list so it really doesn t in my view mean that much â while the spread of the coronavirus hasnâ t halted operations at port canaveral outbreaks of covid 19 onboard cruise ships have prompted some cruise lines to take actions on their own on wednesday norwegian cruise line announced the cancellation of voyages on eight of its cruise ships norwegian getaway cruise with embarkation date of jan 5 2022 norwegian pearl cruises with embarkation dates through and including jan 14 2022

submitted on january 4 all 10 are in the yellow designation and state that the â cdc has investigated and ship remains under observation â the classification doesnâ t clarify how many cases may have triggered the investigation murray said that ambiguity means that people should overly worry about the ships â one crew member on a ship triggers a shift from green to yellow one crew member having a covid diagnosis it s of the passenger community will trigger the investigation â murray said â so if you ve got 5000 people on a ship that s five cases bam now the whole ship is under investigation â murray said port canaveral doesnâ t help manage quarantines for cases of covid 19 that pop and said that is handled by the cruise lines themselves in coordination with the cdc the port would step in to assist if a ship were designated as red in the cdcâ s guide â if there was a ship that went into the red status thereâ d definitely be communication with us and what was going on because that would indicate itâ s a much more serious event â murray said â but so far you know the cases that we have heard about are all mild they re manageable the cruise lines have been able to manage it it s proof that the protocols that were put in place work â hotels near port canaveral have been assisting with those passengers and crew that need to quarantine because of a positive covid 19 test eric garvey the coo of baugher hotel group said that theyâ ve been working with the cruise lines since sailing resumed in august and have been working on ways to account for covid 19 cases as they come up â i think weâ re very good at it we have a great property that can support that and so weâ ve been doing it long enough where itâ s just become a regular thing â garvey said he said they act as if anyone who comes in may have the virus and have had precautions like masking extra sanitizing and distancing in place throughout the pandemic he said they are in regular contact with the cruise lines and if a ship has need for quarantines they will reach out and see if there are rooms available for those needing to stay near the port â supporting the cruise lines is an important business segment for us overall for the whole community so weâ ll try to do anything we can for the cruise industry cruise lines to help them whatever they might need â garvey said the cdcâ s conditional sailing order for cruise ships was temporarily extended on october 25 2021 through january 15 2022 a cdc spokesperson told spectrum news that the â cdc intends to transition to a voluntary program in coordination with

you might also like fed s pivot is the opposite of hawkish washington a very tight job market and unabated inflation might require the federal reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected and begin reducing its overall asset holdings as a second brake on the economy u s central bank policymakers said in their meeting last month in a document released on wednesday that markets took as decidedly hawkish the minutes from the dec 14 15 policy meeting showed fed officials uniformly concerned about the pace of price increases that promised to persist alongside global supply bottlenecks well into 2022 those concerns at least as of mid december even appeared to outweigh the risks potentially posed by the fast surging omicron variant of the coronavirus seen by some fed officials as likely adding further to inflation pressures but not fundamentally altering the path of economic recovery in the united states participants generally noted that given their individual outlooks for the economy the labor market and inflation it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate the minutes stated the language showed the depth of the consensus that has emerged at the fed in recent weeks over the need to move against high inflation not just by raising borrowing costs but by acting with a second lever and reducing the central bank s holdings of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities the fed has about 8 8 trillion on its balance sheet much of it accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic to keep financial markets stable and hold down long term interest rates markets swiftly took note the probability that the fed would lift interest rates in march for the first time since the pandemic s onset rose to greater than 70 as tracked by cme group s fedwatch tool that plus the prospect of the fed reducing its presence in long term bond markets pushed the u s 10 year treasury yield to its strongest level since april 2021 u s stocks tumbled with the s p 500 index down about 1 6 as the readout of last month s meeting showed perhaps even more conviction than investors had expected among fed policymakers to tackle inflation the yield on the 2 year treasury note the maturity most sensitive to fed policy expectations shot to its highest level since march 2020 when the pandemic fueled economic crisis was unfolding this is news this is more hawkish than expected said david carter chief investment officer at lenox wealth advisors in new york the minutes offered more details on the fed s abrupt shift in policy last month taken to counter inflation running at more than twice the central bank s 2 target along with outlining their inflation concerns officials said that even with the u s labor market more than 3 million jobs short of its pre pandemic peak the economy was closing in fast on what might be considered maximum employment given the retirements and other departures from the job market that have been prompted by the health crisis participants pointed to a number of signs that the u s labor market was very tight including near record rates of quits and job vacancies as well as a notable pickup in wage growth the minutes said many participants judged that if the current pace of improvement continued labor markets would fast approach maximum employment policymakers in december agreed to hasten the end of their pandemic era program of bond purchases and issued forecasts anticipating three quarter percentage point rate increases during 2022 the fed s benchmark overnight interest rate is currently set near zero the december meeting was held as coronavirus case counts had begun to climb due to the spread of the omicron variant infections have exploded since then and there has been no commentary from senior fed officials yet to indicate whether the changing health situation has altered their views about appropriate monetary policy fed chair jerome powell will appear before the senate banking committee next week for a hearing on his nomination for a second four year term as head of the central bank and is likely to update his views about the economy at that time

new york bloomberg 3d investment partners the second largest investor in toshiba has called for a special meeting of the japanese company s shareholders as it steps up its opposition to a break up plan people familiar with the matter said singapore based 3d investment is requesting a vote on toshiba s proposed split that it must be supported by at least two thirds of stockholders the people said asking not to be identified because the matter is private a second proposal from 3d investment which holds a 7 6 per cent stake in toshiba asks for the company to reconsider alternative options they said toshiba announced in november that it intended to separate into three companies as a way to create value for shareholders after years of scandals and corporate governance issues 3d investment published an open letter that month opposing the plan saying toshiba s strategic review process was inadequate the investor is now calling for an extraordinary general meeting because it is concerned about a lack of transparency in the separation process including about how toshiba intends to structure the shareholder vote and what level of support would be required for the process to proceed the people said investor distrust the first proposal is unusual in that it would require toshiba to push ahead with the company split or any other strategic reorganisation supported by the board and its strategic review committee if approved the move aims to ensure that at least two thirds of investors support the break up a threshold that would typically be needed for any major reorganisation or sale of a japanese company the people said 3d investment plans to vote against its own proposal the people said the investment firm believes a supermajority vote would give toshiba a mandate for its plans if they are approved or force the company to scrap the split and launch a new review they said the second proposal which 3d investment will support calls for the toshiba board s strategic review committee to launch a new review to ensure all avenues to unlock value are fully explored the people said toshiba plans to complete the spin offs of the infrastructure services business and the technology device unit by the second half of fiscal 2023 the company has said 3d investment argued in the november letter that the strategic review process that led to the break up plan was flawed and failed to address the company s underlying issues the investment firm accused toshiba of not adequately exploring a full range of alternatives including a sale of all or part of the company it also argued that it prematurely cut off talks about selling a minority stake to a global private equity firm in favour of the break up accounting scandal the company has said it plans to hold a shareholder meeting by march to vote on the separation plan toshiba s leadership has offered few details beyond that including what date the vote will be held on 3d investment s push for its own meeting and proposals highlight the simmering tension and level of distrust between the japanese icon and some of its largest investors toshiba has been mired in controversy since the emergence of an accounting scandal in 2015 that devastated its profits and led to a companywide restructuring

a bigger than expected drawdown was overshadowed by a massive gasoline supply build that had more to do with year end tax shenanigans than it did with real supply or demand the opec plus expected 400 000 barrels a day supply increase did little to soothe markets as the group is already short of their quota and almost have no chance of getting over quota especially with libyan oil production being off as much as 700 000 barrels a day oil traders are also talking about the great rebalancing as commodity index rebalancing is coming due while all this noise may fluctuate prices in the short term the fundamental outlook for 2022 is looking more bullish as the lack of oil investment that we have been warned about for years as well as pie in the sky expectations for renewable fuels is already falling short i guess when you try to build your energy future on technology that does not exist you might run into a few problems let s talk about the american petroleum institute report first the api reported that for the week ending december 31 fell by 6 43 million barrels that was twice expectations and another sign that biden s oil release from the spr is not adding to us inventory but being sent to places like china yet the us api was reported as a build of 7 061 million compared to the previous draw of 0 319 million last week they expected a build so one who is suspicious might suspect some gasoline last week was held back for tax purposes so the tax on the product would be deferred into the new year clever so it looks like we got three weeks of inventory in one week the api also reported that distillate stocks increased by 4 34 million barrels that overshadowed the oil draw yet make no mistake about the global oil supply it is tightening bloomberg news is reporting that the us oil market braces for a 4 6 billion wave of selling they point out that every january the world s two biggest commodities indexes the s p gsci index nyse and the bloomberg commodities index nyse reset spurring a raft of inflows and outflows across commodity markets for wti that means investments tracking both benchmarks could be ready to pull almost 60 million barrels worth of futures contracts from the market according to societe generale otc estimates while this is true the oil market knows this and based on what we are seeing the market can absorb this amount of selling without destroying the overall uptrend if oil can t take out 77 00 then we could see a sharp move higher despite the rebalancing javier blas of bloomberg is tweeting that kazakhstan is reimposing price for controls for lpg gasoline and diesel after rare demonstrations over the last 24 hours over rising energy prices the country is one of the world s top oil producers and a member of the opec alliance maybe we can send them some of our spr oil new york may be banning in new large buildings but europe is finally admitting that they re going to need natural gas to get through the energy transition the ft reports to hit its ambitious climate goals reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 the eu needs to mobilize a flood of capital to finance the necessary investment funneling bank loans bond investors and stock markets towards environmentally friendly green technologies and away from unfriendly brown ones where best to draw the line however is far less straightforward the scale of the task demands a radical approach to meet its goals the eu must start rapidly phasing out fossil fuels now but it also requires a recognition of just how difficult it will be to deploy sufficient renewable energy including natural gas as a transitional fuel is justified but only temporarily and with strict conditions partly the reasoning for labeling the fossil fuel as green in a proposal published at the new year is political maybe new york can learn from that instead of embarking on a policy that could increase electricity costs in new york by over 70 in the next few years we think the rise in gasoline supplies is fake and the outlook then is to buy brakes and gasoline and diesel crude oil is looking fairly strong right now and we believe that the energy information administration supply reports should be supportive there is resistance up above but if we can break out above 7700 it should accelerate rallies natural gas should also get some support from the cold weather though the charts aren t looking particularly bullish the grain markets are on fire as we re seeing a reduced corn crop in argentina and brazil the lack of rain is making the crop smaller and this will add to overall support for commodities in general as we ve said before despite the ups and downs in the market we believe the commodities are in a major super cycle crude oil grains precious metals industrial metals a super cycle doesn t mean that the market goes straight up every day but it does show you that we re going into a period of being undersupplied there is no doubt that shortsighted thinking in the energy sector is one of the reasons why this market is very bullish going into the new year as we have warned for many many months producers and users of oil and natural gas should get hedged on breaks
