washington federal policymakers have made plenty of noise lately about the state of cryptocurrency regulation on wednesday it was the crypto sector s turn the ceos of leading crypto ventures appeared before the house financial services committee with somewhat of a hybrid message there is a certain need for more regulation of their industry they said but not to the extent that some in washington want it s healthy that the industry will be regulated said samuel bankman fried founder and ceo of the crypto exchange ftx one of six witnesses testifying at the hearing i think it is also already regulated in a number of ways i think that there are points that need to be addressed to give oversight of various aspects of the industry that do not have sufficient oversight right now under the trump administration regulators appeared willing to promote crypto innovation through enabling banks to offer crypto services and granting bank charters to crypto focus firms among other things the biden administration has sung a decidedly different tune acting comptroller of the currency michael hsu has suggested he questions some of the charter approvals and other policies approved by his predecessor brian brooks while securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler has referred to crypto as the wild west crypto policy should take into account not only any new risks introduced into the system but also the risks in the present system that are being solved by decentralization said brian brooks former acting comptroller of the currency who is now ceo of bitfury bloomberg news last month the president s working group on financial markets federal deposit insurance corp and office of the comptroller of the currency concluded that only insured depository institutions should be able to issue stablecoins the federal reserve is also exploring whether it should issue its own digital currency but the ceo of the crypto firm circle the issuer of the stablecoin usdc testified that his company s model is safer than that of an fdic insured bank an fdic insured bank is fdic insured because the bank is taking risks with deposits said jeremy allaire in august he announced that circle was seeking to become a national digital currency bank allaire argued that the reserves behind stablecoins are not exposed to the same types of risks well designed stablecoins are safer than bank deposits because bank deposits you re taking a risk on the lending book of the underlying bank he said some democratic lawmakers on the house committee urged regulators not to wait for legislative action before taking steps to better regulate the sector the regulators need to listen to this hearing very carefully said rep brad sherman d calif don t cop out and say we are not going to do anything until we pass meaningful legislation but the ceos stressed that policymakers should not adopt new policies to regulate the sector without fully understanding the benefits of the technology crypto policy should take into account not only any new risks introduced into the system but also the risks in the present system that are being solved by decentralization said brooks who is now ceo of bitfury after having run the occ during the trump administration however there was some disagreement between the panelists about whether decentralized finance would benefit from having a dedicated federal regulator to supervise the digital asset sphere we believe the government should regulate digital assets under a new framework and responsibility for this new framework should be assigned to a single federal regulator and a new registration process established for marketplaces for digital assets said coinbase inc ceo alesia haas our existing regulatory system does not work effectively for the open decentralized networks that crypto has created haas said in her prepared remarks financial regulation was built around a series of financial intermediaries transfer agents clearing houses and traditional brokers which are not necessary to effectuate crypto transactions but brooks disagreed pointing to the already fragmented regulatory environment in the u s the last thing we need to do is add another regulator to a system that s already got dozens of regulators brooks said what we need to do instead is have parity for crypto activity along with traditional finance if i make a crypto lending platform i should probably be regulated by the fdic if i m a crypto trading platform i should probably be regulated by the and sec brooks added brooks criticized regulators in the biden administration for being too hesitant to grant bank charters to crypto firms is it consistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins brooks said but then fail to grant bank charters to the largest issuers of stablecoins while witnesses ostensibly addressed their answers to members of congress much of the commentary carried implications for the nation s financial regulators who are currently trying to grasp the risks posed by crypto at large but several republicans on the house committee expressed doubts that the nation s current financial regulators had the capacity to police the crypto industry today without crushing innovation in the process the u s has a huge opportunity with crypto but my fear is that this regulatory state is going to crack down on an industry that the regulators really don t understand yet said rep ted budd r n c among the financial regulators the sec has been the most aggressive in seeking to police crypto gensler has frequently said that the sector needs to implement stronger investor protections and the agency has pushed for a broad classification of many crypto assets as securities but ceos testifying at the hearing pushed back against that view existing laws regulation and legal precedent make it clear that blockchain tokens are not securities said haas and we believe that the law clearly shows that blockchain based digital assets are one of two things either a new form of digital property or a new way to record ownership brooks meanwhile suggested a better approach to policing the crypto sector would be to incorporate it into the regulated banking sector a national policy agenda that takes crypto compliance seriously should assess whether it makes more sense to continue to keep crypto activities largely out of the regulated financial system or to bring them inside the system precisely so they can be supervised and operated with appropriate levels of risk management he said

new york dec 8 2021 prnewswire cfa institute the global association of investment professionals calls for a global approach to goodwill accounting as diverging accounting standards could cause significant loss in global comparability for investors should amortization get the go ahead from u s standard setters the international accounting standards board iasb for international financial reporting standards ifrs and the financial accounting standards board fasb for u s generally accepted accounting standards u s gaap are reexamining goodwill accounting and specifically the measurement of goodwill post acquisition the iasb is pursuing improved disclosures while the fasb is considering reverting to amortization a return to amortization in accounting for goodwill would have significant implications for investors in the united states and globally given the size of goodwill balances across the world a survey of cfa institute members demonstrated an almost unanimous preference from investors for a unified global approach with a majority favoring improving disclosures over reverting to amortization the survey findings are included in a new report goodwill investor perspectives improve disclosures rather than revert to amortization cfa institute gathered 2019 goodwill balances for some of the world s largest economies in the united states corporations in the s p 500 had usd3 5 trillion of goodwill in 2019 which represents 42 2 percent of the equity and 9 3 percent of the assets of such companies goodwill for all u s public companies was usd5 6 trillion in 2018 and represented 40 5 percent of equity and 7 7 percent of the assets of those public companies with goodwill goodwill balances of the largest corporations in the united kingdom europe and canada jurisdictions following ifrs ranged from 21 41 percent of equity in 2019 amortizing goodwill for u s companies following u s gaap would have significant implications on net income equity and assets of such companies and their comparability with companies around the globe that apply ifrs standards sandra j peters cfa senior head global financial reporting advocacy cfa institute said the size of goodwill balances around the globe highlight why the debate about the subsequent measurement of goodwill must go beyond a discussion of accounting theory alone as divergent solutions by the iasb and fasb will create significant comparability issues for investors a majority of investors prefer retaining impairment only accounting while improving disclosures over reverting to amortization amortization even when done with impairment testing will not improve financial reporting as it mutes impairment testing while increasing costs and simultaneously decreasing the decision usefulness of financial statements the iasb s disclosure approach will allow investors to better evaluate acquisitions and facilitate the market assessment of impairment testing thereby improving financial reporting paul andrews managing director for research advocacy and standards at cfa institute adds earlier this year iosco called for greater collaboration between the accounting boards so as to maintain the alignment of ifrs and u s gaap our survey shows investors agree and thus we call for a unified approach for goodwill accounting survey key findings make sure the path forward is globally consistent investors wish to see a unified approach for goodwill from policymakers with 94 percent believing the iasb and fasb should follow the same approach in the subsequent measurement of goodwill improve disclosures rather than revert to amortization most investors 58 percent believe impairment testing should be retained rather than reverting to amortization but seek better disclosures that facilitate the assessment of post acquisition deal performance investors report that current goodwill and impairment disclosures are not useful 70 percent they want improvement in disclosures before any changes in impairment accounting 66 percent and they want improvement in such disclosures irrespective of any change in accounting 88 percent investors believe goodwill is an asset 75 percent that it can have wasting and non wasting elements 77 percent and that it doesn t necessarily decrease in value over time 53 percent amortization presumes goodwill is a fully wasting asset whereas impairment allows for wasting and non wasting elements over time investors recognize timeliness of goodwill impairments could be improved 72 percent but believe impairment still provides decision useful information confirms underperformance 73 percent holds management accountable 80 percent and that eliminating impairment would result in loss of information to investors 77 percent investors believe disclosures will facilitate greater transparency and improve timeliness of impairment testing by allowing investors to understand acquisition performance and hold management accountable most investors 73 percent are willing to bear the cost of impairment testing while understanding amortization would come with impairment testing investors also recognize amortization would mute impairment testing leaving it a costly compliance exercise while amortization may be administratively convenient for preparers it does not allow for discernment of good vs bad managers 61 percent distorts financial metrics 63 percent and does not provide decision useful information for investment analysis amortization increases costs but provides no benefit or improvement in financial reporting for investors in order of priority investors want to see improved disclosures concerning valuation models and related estimates and assumptions quantitative information on acquisition performance over time relative to original business objectives key common performance metrics used by management to monitor the acquisition quantitative and qualitative information on deal performance more information on how the board assessed the acquisition s performance over time taken together investors support the iasb approach focusing on enhancing disclosures is more consistent with investor perspectives for further information please contact notes to editors goodwill investor perspectives improve disclosures rather than revert to amortization surveyed a random sample of 23 800 cfa charterholders employed as research investment or quantitative analysts or portfolio managers the survey deployed during the period 5 15 november 2020 asked about the accounting for goodwill the related disclosures and how these issues are affecting analysis and investment decision making a total of 1 607 individuals completed the survey and yielded a useable response rate of 7 percent in 2020 cfa institute issued a

shipping stocks have never been for the faint of heart and they ve been on a particularly wild ride in the covid era there have been steep plunges and historic surges along the way with unexpected twists and turns what could be around the corner u s listed equities in the three main segments tankers containers and dry bulk are following different patterns to put these shipping stock moves in context from the onset of covid until today american shipper spoke in depth with evercore isi analyst jon chappell and jefferies analyst randy giveans the panic begins predictably shipping stocks were down big across all sectors in q1 2020 at the onset of the pandemic amid initial fears that container lines could lose billions the exact opposite of what happened shares of container ship lessors fell danaos nyse dac plunged 75 from a high of 9 84 in january 2020 to a low of 2 50 two months later it was still trading under 4 at the end of june dry bulk stocks also sank in the first half of 2020 albeit less than containers star bulk nyse sblk fell 67 from a high of 11 81 in january to low of 3 95 in may then rose back to 6 60 by the end of june the real action in the early days of covid came from trading tanker stocks as oil prices and consumption plunged the opec production cut agreement briefly broke down and saudi arabia and russia began pumping at full bore crude pricing collapsed refineries could not shut down their product output fast enough oil went into steep contango when the futures price is higher than the spot price the opposite of backwardation and tankers were chartered for floating storage duties causing tanker rates to surge tankers twin peaks most tanker stocks show a pattern of two peaks one just before covid s onset one after in the fall of 2019 rates rose due to middle east unrest and u s sanctions on tankers operated by chinese shipping giant cosco rates sank as china locked down and the virus spread across the global in q1 2020 rates jumped back up in q2 2020 due to floating storage then fell again crude tankers dht eurn product tankers stng mixed fleet fro nordic american tankers nyse nat a darling among retail traders went from a low of 2 30 on march 23 to a high of 7 25 on april 27 more than tripling in just over a month other tanker stocks rose on floating storage as well but not as much as nat chappell believes nat briefly outperformed other tanker stocks because institutional investors who were not invested in nat were fading taking the opposite position on a high momentum move the other names first there was a big institutional short term spike in early march into april but by the time you got to late april that s when the institutions started fading and that s when the retail guys started chasing it the institutional guys knew it was anomalous they knew the contango curve would eventually shift to backwardation whereas the retail guys were getting hit over the head with these record earnings and promotional press releases and appearances on cnbc tanker bullishness quickly evaporated as the hangover phase came into focus all of the crude and product cargoes in floating and land based storage would take a very long time to unwind and until they did tanker transport demand would suffer shares of product carrier owner scorpio tankers nyse stng hit a low of 12 35 in march 2020 amid initial covid panic surged to 28 21 in april amid the storage play euphoria then collapsed back to 12 50 by the end of june containers dry bulk begin ascent the second half of 2020 saw shipping stock sentiment rebound first for containers then tankers then dry bulk as it turned out stock pickers bet right on containers and dry bulk and wrong on tankers container spot freight rates began their epic climb in june 2020 and just kept rising rates today remain near all time highs container ship leasing stocks were slow to react all the way back on aug 16 2020 stifel analyst ben nolan wrote the single most compelling investment opportunity in the traditional shipping segments are the container ship leasing companies calling these stocks a classic catch up opportunity j mintzmyer of seeking alpha s value investor s edge was another early proponent of container shipping stocks container ship leasing stocks finally began to move in september october 2020 and kept rising until just a few months ago danaos ultimately went from that low of 2 50 in march 2020 to a high of 89 41 in september 2021 an astonishing 35x increase container ship lessors dac gsl esea cmre container liner operator matx most crude and product tanker stocks hit bottom in october 2020 then gravitated upward until summer 2021 nordic american tankers was an exception its stock trend has been especially ugly falling continually since last april on monday nat which has been public since 1995 flirted with a 26 year low why did most tankers stocks partially rebound so early when spot rates have still not recovered over a year later giveans said it was really about an expectation of a recovery before the delta variant people were saying 2020 is the bottom 2021 is going to be better i also don t think people baked in the amount of inventory that had to be destocked and they were certainly more optimistic on the degree and timing of the demand recovery than what came to fruition chappell said i think it was partially it can t get any worse obviously it turned out to be quite early dry bulk stocks started their move just after that in late 2020 these stocks moved prior to rates rising unlike container stocks which initially lagged rate rises dry bulk spot rates didn t start their surge until q1 2021 giveans explained starting in october and november sentiment shifted and people started to say ok there s still going to be a lot of spending it s really about production iron ore production is going up coal demand is going up in the near term the grain trade is very robust dry bulk is a gdp business gdp growth next year will be up so dry bulk growth will be substantial q1 q3 2021 great for containers dry bulk this year dry bulk carrier owners have enjoyed the best rates since before the financial crisis container shipping rates have completely blown away all historical precedents and in the other direction tanker rates have been the worst in three decades the first three quarters of this year were exceptionally good for dry bulk stocks and container stocks and surprisingly benign for crude and product tanker stocks some dry bulk stocks have done even better than container stocks in 2021 between the beginning of this year and early october shares of star bulk almost tripled between january and early september shares of golden ocean nasdaq gogl more than doubled container dry bulk and tanker shares all suffered a hiccup in july due to the delta variant stocks began climbing again thereafter but only briefly most shipping stocks peaked in september or october and have pulled back since then container shipping stocks for both ship lessors and liner companies seemed to have retrenched at the same time container freight rates and charter rates peaked and moderately retreated are we at the peak or close to it probably said giveans but i don t see a sharp pullback to pre covid levels by any stretch of the imagination whereas a lot of people do fear that and are pricing that in i don t think container equities will track rates as much on the way down as they did on the way up giveans added noting that ship leasing companies have revenues locked in via leases of up to four years in duration so charter rate declines are not as impactful one reason for stock trader wariness some may view potential moves in container charter and freight rates similarly to how rates move in other shipping segments that are far more volatile such as very large crude carriers vlccs tankers that carry 2 million barrels and capesizes bulkers with capacity of around 180 000 deadweight tons we ve seen vlccs go from 20 000 to 200 000 to 2 000 in a year and a half and capes go from 3 000 to 30 000 to 80 000 and back to 30 000 that s extreme volatility said giveans the container ship charter side is much less volatile it is the only sector to ever go up for 72 weeks in a row that has never happened before there s also a psychological barrier due to extreme gains visualized in container stock charts i e the belief that a stock has already risen so much that it can t keep going for example shares of zim nyse zim fell as low as 11 34 in late january on their first day of trading and were as high as 62 20 in mid september quintupling in less than eight months there is a psychological headwind there that chart is certainly intimidating giveans said referring to a stock chart of danaos which is up 1 800 since mid 2020 but if you look at danaos today on a p e or ev ebitda or even nav basis it s still very cheap if you look at the chart and see it went from 3 to 70 you think i must have missed it but it should never have gotten down to 3 what s next for dry bulk stocks dry bulk rates are expected to fall seasonally into the fourth and first quarters as of monday rates were still far above the five year average but they peaked in early october when capesize rates topped 80 000 per day and as soon as rates reversed most dry bulk shares started falling as in the container sector equities appear to be following rates down chappell said with dry bulk and containers it is the opposite of tankers tanker stocks are being driven by the it can t get worse sentiment whereas chappell said dry bulk and container stock sentiment is more this is about as good as it gets the thinking on dry bulk and containers chappell said is that all of the congestion related issues anomalous a function of elevated demand and limited spending on services and supply chain bottlenecks and that at some point those are going to normalize and return to 2019 levels so we need to start taking profits in general chappell believes equity buyers have become much quicker to sell shipping stocks when rates fall and slower to buy them when they rise the market is supposed to be forward looking two to three quarters in advance of the inflection point and i am seeing that in my other coverage areas now in rail and trucking people are positioning for what they see two to three quarters in advance but in shipping now for many reasons market caps retail past poor corporate governance people want to see the whites of the eyes of a recovery to make sure it s real before they get involved and they certainly don t want to see the whites of the eyes of a downturn as it unfolds so the cycles are much shorter you saw it in dry bulk when the capesizes went from 80 000 to 70 000 a day 70 000 is still an amazing cape rate and the stocks started declining said chappell according to giveans dry bulk stock sentiment is really about rate of change for dry bulk rates it s pretty clear that rates in the first quarter of 2022 are going to be lower than in the fourth quarter no one s questioning that but i would say it s going from incredible rates to very good rates and it still will be very profitable giveans also believes that dry bulk has the best supply demand picture of any shipping segment in 2022 it s hard to see a situation where demand doesn t outpace supply he maintained what s next for tanker stocks for tanker equities it s the exact opposite of dry bulk explained giveans it is also about rate of change of spot rates but in the case of tankers the thinking is that rates are going to be better next year even though they re still not going to be above cash breakeven in the first quarter do i think tanker rates are going to be incredible next year no will they be much better than in 2021 of course this has been literally the worst year in decades chappell said i m optimistic tankers are finally going to get to that recovery but to put it in perspective if you look at the vlcc rate estimates for next year i d be shocked if i m not in the bottom quartile if not the bottom decile if not the low i m still conservative relative to most people out there but it s about the rate of change vlcc rates don t need to get to 50 000 a day if they go from an average of 4 000 this year to 16 000 next year and end in the fourth quarter with a seasonal upturn in the 20s that s ringing the bell we re on our way to a recovery it doesn t need to be this grandiose dry bulk or container shipping replica it just needs to show that we re out of the trough and i m confident that s going to happen the thing i watch most is inventories as long as inventories continue to draw it s just coiling the spring even tighter and there s going to have to be a supply response at some point in the meantime tanker stocks have pulled back since october and the omicron variant has just created yet another headwind the playbook used to be that even in bad years the fourth quarter was better than the second and the third and in good years it was substantially better so after labor day you started buying tanker stocks in anticipation that rates were going to start to go up said chappell but i think that by the time we got to this october people realized that not only are we not entering a seasonal increase but the third quarter numbers are going to be really gross and with the quarter to date update in earnings season we re not even going to get a good fourth quarter another way to look at the recent tanker stock pullback the stock buyers largely retail traders may have been more forward looking than traders of container and dry bulk stocks or rather forward hoping as they bought shares in anticipation of the still elusive rate recovery consequently unlike container and dry bulk stocks tanker shares have not followed freight rates and from time to time such as in july and since october tanker stock traders realized they were too early and tanker equities retreated giveans believes the recent decline in tanker stock prices is due to a too steep rise immediately prior to that you get these sentiment shifts where you get these runups then there s a pullback where people think oh wait we got a little bit ahead of ourselves the market isn t improving euronav ran up from 8 50 to 11 clearly prematurely the september october rally was so ridiculously strong that it had to come off those levels he said what happens next is highly dependent on covid said giveans it s all about omicron and whatever the next variant is tankers probably have the most exposure to covid of any shipping segment good or bad source freight waves by greg miller
the road leading out of albuquerque new mexico turns from city to desert in the blink of an eye one minute office parks give way to houses and apartments the next those homes give way to scrubby desert bushes and dusty beige plains that melt into low mountains on the horizon it s not long before you pass the exit for the navajo community of to hajiilee here only 30 minutes outside of an american city with half a million people you ll find a town where kitchen faucets run black with sediment and orange with rust and where nearly 2 000 residents rely on truckloads of water for drinking across the country 49 of tribal homes do not have access to reliable water sources clean drinking water or basic sanitation homes in to hajiilee are no exception as the community s aging wells have crumbled water quality has degraded to the point that it s not safe to consume and a project that promises a steady clean supply has faced years of logistical hurdles andrew robertson george mihalik souder miller associates water flows dark with contaminants in a sink at tohajilee s school left and a pipe from the community s plumbing system shows signs of rust and corrosion an engineer who worked on the pipes said they looked decades old after less than two years of use our water here it sometimes comes out like the color of the sand said nora morris she was born and raised in to hajiilee and now works at its senior center many residents shuttle water in from albuquerque mostly stopping at walmart to fill jugs or stock up on bottled water by the crate i have to haul water for daily use morris said the days that we feed i have to have good potable water we have to utilize safe water to make sure we re cooking with safe water and to sanitize our pots and pans another to hajiilee resident rheana apachito also brings bottles from albuquerque but she is left with piped water for showers in the past couple years it s been more like orange apachito said on our hair it makes it hard our skin is drier sometimes it comes out orange brown black others don t rely on water from the town s pipes but still contend with a great deal of inconvenience and expense frank pablo s home on moon mesa a high altitude perch on the outskirts of town is off the grid all of the water pablo and his mother use on this property where he grew up arrives in the back of his pickup truck alex hager kunc the winding dirt road to frank pablo s house passes by sandy cliffs and roaming horses he often makes the long and expensive drive to stores in albuquerque to stock up on crates of bottled water for drinking he hauls crates of bottled water for drinking and a thick plastic tank strapped into his truck bed carries water for everything else he fills that at a nearby well off to the side of the hilly dirt road that leads up to his house there s a big sign that says not for human consumption but we have no choice but to go down and get it pablo said those trips get expensive each visit to walmart begins with a half hour drive down that dusty road winding past roaming horses and rocky cliffs before he gets to the interstate and starts the next half hour to the city with the gas being so high i had to top off last night and it was 100 he said but pablo is committed to staying at his childhood home it s nice and peaceful up here i wouldn t live anywhere other than here he said a fix is coming soon hauling clean water is simply a fact of life for to hajiilee s residents as it is for many native people in the southwest but a change to that routine is in the works for a long time their geography has been a source of frustration as wells beneath town have dried up one by one mark begay has operated the town s water system for more than 30 years and has seen that play out firsthand out of those six wells he said only one is still running as of right now all the other wells have either collapsed or just stopped running we re only dealing with one distribution well so we re in a water crisis here in to hajiilee but now a different aspect of to hajiilee s geography means the town will soon receive piped water from the same supply that feeds albuquerque to hajiilee is a satellite community of the navajo nation the contiguous body of tribal land that begins about two hours to the west in this way it s an island separate from big navajo as the locals call it alex hager kunc mark begay points in the direction of albuquerque from which a pipeline will carry water to to hajiilee the project is expected to deliver clean water as soon as 2023 but the process of bringing it to reality has involved an array of logistical and financial challenges since 2006 to hajiilee has been working out the details of that new pipeline the product of an agreement with the albuquerque bernalillo county water authority begay expects water will start flowing in 2023 on its face the deal is a revolutionary and permanent solution after decades of struggles but the journey to that solution has been lined with hurdles the frustration has come from various different entities and setbacks said sherrilyn apache tohajilee s community services coordinator whether it was grant funding a property owner land ownership or right of ways nearly 20 years of research planning and fundraising met perhaps their largest roadblock when a private development firm looked poised to block construction of the pipeline through land it planned to use for tens of thousands of new homes with the support of area politicians and advocacy groups an agreement was eventually reached in late 2020 clearing the way for the 7 3 mile pipeline it s kind of terrifying to know we did once upon a time own the majority of the lands apache said why do we have such a hard time regathering our land or the acreage of our land to move forward even with permission to construct the pipeline the challenge of paying for it still lingered with building costs in the ballpark of 8 million to hajilee has had to secure money from an array of sources alex hager kunc although to hajilee is only a 30 minute drive from a major american city the roughly 2 000 people who live there lack access to clean water a large chunk comes from new mexico s state water board with other money coming from navajo nation but millions of dollars in construction funding were distributed as loans or grants that required matching contributions from to hajiilee which the community didn t think it would be able to pay on top of that the costs of getting and maintaining a clean water system in to hajiilee go well beyond the new pipeline itself many of the pipes that carry water within town are made of asbestos cement replacing the pipes is necessary expensive work that can be hazardous for the people doing the job mark begay the long serving water utility worker suspects that asbestos has caused long term health issues for people living in to hajiilee and will continue to do so if pipes aren t replaced even if they carry cleaner water from albuquerque s system for more clean water tribes need more money trouble accessing clean water and the money it would take to get it persists across the rest of the navajo nation efforts to solve the issue have gained newfound traction in the last couple of years as pandemic era calls for handwashing and sanitation put a spotlight on the lack of clean water in tribal communities nationwide crystal tulley cordova principal hydrologist with the navajo nation department of water resources said new funding made available by pandemic relief programs was a silver lining the bipartisan infrastructure package allocated 3 5 billion to the indian health service s sanitation deficiency system listing fully funding the list s projects for the first time ever tribes are also expected to see portions of funds earmarked for rural water projects other funding from the cares act a 2 trillion economic relief package from the early months of the pandemic was used for tribal clean water projects tulley cordova said the recent surge in federal money was useful but cautions that clean water access in the navajo nation can only be assured through more consistent funding in the future almost 40 of people don t have running water she said it s not going to take one infrastructure bill to address that and it s not going to be able to be done by the end of 2024 these are challenges that are wicked permanently designated funds would be especially useful in maintaining water infrastructure in the long term alex hager kunc signs describe a pump providing safe water near town administration buildings in tohajiilee although a new pipeline will soon deliver clean water to the community asbestos pipes near homes will need costly replacements congresswoman melanie stansbury a member of the u s house whose district includes to hajiilee and albuquerque has been a high profile ally of the community s quest for new water infrastructure she also emphasized the need for dedicated federal funding and said that clean water access was at its core a human rights issue it is a moral responsibility as a nation as a people and as communities to address this issue and to ensure that every person everywhere has access to clean drinking water stansbury said she said it will take partnerships between tribes the federal government state and local authorities the private sector and philanthropists to make serious strides in the face of historically neglected tribal water infrastructure i think that to hajiilee is really a case study of a much larger issue that is systemic across the u s stansbury said which is underinvestment in tribal water infrastructure a need for the federal government to really step up and make good on its federal trust and treaty responsibilities and a need to deploy every possible resource and partnership to make sure that we re bringing safe and clean drinking water to these communities tulley cordova said she s encouraged to see tribal communities acting proactively and collaboratively to improve clean water access and said the problems facing tribes are rooted deep in the very origins of water management in the colorado river basin you begin to think about who was at the table and who wasn t at the table she said and when you look at the historical photos of the signing of different compacts what is visible there is that there was no presence of indigenous peoples participating although they ve occupied the lands and use the water resources after centuries of exclusion from discussions surrounding water use and management tulley cordova said challenges brought on by climate change are liable to usher in centuries more when you look at the impacts that indigenous communities experience she said they re heightened impacts compared to other communities by providing sustainability through water infrastructure we re also providing adaptability to climate change as well this story is part of ongoing coverage of water in the west produced by kunc in colorado and supported by the walton family foundation kunc is solely responsible for its

investment institute sees just one hike although it expects the fed to accelerate taper at next week s meeting we think the fed will tighten policy next year said wfii president darrell cronk in an outlook presentation but won t drive it off the cliff by overtightening or a policy error the one hike which could come as late as the fall said wfii head of global fixed income strategy brian rehling will depend on how economic data come in i don t think the fed needs to be aggressive inflation they said will be sustained at above trend levels but should peak in the first or second quarter yet they estimate a year over year consumer price index increase of 4 0 in 2022 cronk said growth would probably have to be quite hot to support three hikes next year in most economic cycles he said the markets get ahead of themselves in terms of expecting rate hikes if inflation moderates as most economists and the fed expect and the supply chain issues clear rehling asked does the fed really want to get aggressive ahead of next year s elections he believes the fed will be patient unless the data forces it to get aggressive the risk he said is if the fed moves faster than expected and while the fed s tone clearly has shifted in the past month or two the number of rate hikes will depend on the inflation data rehling said how long does it take to get back to pre pandemic levels and how concerned do fed officials get about inflation in addition cronk said there are lots of open chairs on the fed board and president biden is likely to try to fill them with doves or über doves and if he succeeds it will be harder to get rate hikes implemented the dollar has gone up he added which is doing some of the fed s tightening as for the summary of economic projections rehling said we will almost certainly see estimates increase but he noted those predictions often don t come to fruition there s lots of uncertainty between now and the middle of next year but he believes the nine officials that didn t expect a rate hike next year have changed their minds i would be surprised if we saw anybody not pencil in at least one rate hike next year

number and maybe more than any other van of its kind in the world the steering wheel is on the right side it removes at a click when the van stops a custom feature added to thwart any attempt by a thief people look inside and think why is there no steering wheel said sam salwei owner of the uber modified mitsubishi delica aka the slackervan salwei 40 lives in the 1988 van with partner raquel hernández cruz 41 over the past 4 years the pair has traversed the continent to teach slackline and explore as leaders of the yogaslackers group they have mechanic friends around the country and a litany of gear companies involved in a mission to make the van perfect for travel and life on the open road the couple is constantly tweaking adding and modifying the japanese made van it is to a point where salwei believes his delica may be the most modified on the entire planet slackervan from leaf springs to led the details of this van are endless from its custom leaf springs upgraded braking system and adjustable front shocks to solar panels and three yakima gearboxes on the roof inside there are comforts and necessities like a bed sink screens camera mounts led lights and dozens of usb ports scattered about for power the rear bumper is made of cedar the flooring inside is cork a small moai statue from hanga roa stands near the driver seat to protect us salwei said and there is a prayer wheel from kathmandu in back spinning as they drive the van is so feature rich that salwei printed and affixed instruction labels throughout the interior we can hardly remember how to use everything he said example labels include water fill up and use slider solar panel warning light zones and do not operate decaffeinated an oversize sticker on a window reads this is your classroom in large type hinting that life as a vagabond explorer requires embracing anything ahead that comes your way the message was transferred from salwei s former vehicle and home a 1988 ford festiva dubbed the peacelovecar it has its own feature film and was profiled in a 2013 gearjunkie article after life in the festiva the delica felt large but for most people a 66 square foot interior would give new meaning to the term tiny home the couple sleeps on a bed in the back of the van with a 4 inch latex mattress from ktt enterprises a tiny kitchen has a sink as well as a modified engel freezer and fridges to keep food fresh they cook with a single burner induction stove near the bed salwei and hernández cruz travel year round and through all climates temps can be below zero to past 100 degrees fans and vents help circulate air they have a 12v dc air conditioner unit for cold weather thermal modifications include aerogel impregnated foam lizardskin spray on insulation paint and wool insulation from havelock in the walls mitsubishi delica for van life the van is 13 feet long and weighs about 7 200 pounds the diesel engine is operated via a manual five speed transmission as is standard in japan it s set up with its steering wheel on the right the hardest part is that the windshield wiper and blinker controls are reversed salwei said it is equipped with a selectable 4 4 mode with low range lsd differential with 4 875 gears the braking system has dual piston calipers larger rotors and braided steel lines all upgrades for performance and safety its suspension includes rancho rs9000 adjustable front shocks rear air shocks bigger torsion bars and custom leaf springs as this is a 1988 vehicle there is no computer controlling the engine instead the pair rely on a system of gauges to monitor turbo boost exhaust gas temp water temp and air shock pressure a snorkel air intake is on the side to be able to cross rivers though not that raquel will let me salwei said laughing it also keeps the air going into the engine cleaner the tires are goodyear duratrac they are awesome salwei said they are quiet can drive on ice rocks and can run higher pressure to handle the heavier camper build out on the road with the comforts of home salwei has cut nine holes in the van for vents a slide open roof ragtop and other modifications a major upgrade was obtained by replacing the right side middle window with a bump out dual panel tern window the window provides extra space inside and comes with mosquito nets and privacy curtains a bed takes up the back of the van its plywood platform supports a natural rubber pad with a memory foam topper all cut to fit and measuring a bit smaller than a full size bed a dehumidifier on the ceiling automatically turns on to mitigate condensation while sleeping there s a 12 volt ceiling fan over the kitchen a sailboat mushroom style vent between the kitchen window and the cargo door gives adjustable airflow power comes via solar panels from merlin 1 065 watts salwei picked them for durability noting that rather than standard busbar connectors between cells the flexible merlin panels have over 1 000 connection points and will not get damaged by vibrations the panels are affixed to the yakima boxes three in all plus a bonus slide out solar panel that is bonded to an aluminum honeycomb board and pulls down to cover the windshield when the vehicle is stopped privacy and power salwei said keeping it fresh you might wonder how you keep such a small do it all space feeling fresh and clean after all it s basically a bedroom living room kitchen and bathroom all rolled into one salwei said that 5 years living out of the festiva taught the couple the importance of maintaining a clean and organized space onions are banned from all our vehicles raw or cooked he said we use shallots instead their scent doesn t seem to stick to the van or us as onions do he also noted dirty clothing is stored in dry bags before the two launder it with defunkify plus all smelly shoes stay off the van in additon the delica has a number of fans to move air around and for really smelly stuff salwei told us we treat with sink the stink an old trick that raquel picked up while working as a scientific scuba diver lastly he said they use a diffuser after cooking and while sleeping we love to go to sleep with a combination of clove cinnamon ginger and citrus the van smells lovely until someone decides to fart but even then it only usually lasts a few minutes or so we think solar lithium and electrified infrastructure the electric system is complex and custom with a 2 000 watt compact victron inverter charger 300 watt fanless morningstar suresine wave inverter solar charging controllers and a 210 amp sterling alternator to battery charger heated 400ah battle born batteries store the power they are monitorable via a cerbo gx victron computer interface and a victron battery monitoring gauge with a bluetooth dongle for communication far from cities a weboost cell signal amplifier and a marine antenna give extra reception bars salwei and hernández cruz need to stay in contact to run the yogaslackers from anywhere as such they have multiple cell plans at t verizon and at times google fi sim cards that they use to tether the internet to their devices a cabinet under the kitchen sink includes charging ports for camera batteries headlamps and walkie talkies electric warmth comes from 12v dc radiant heat panels at the foot and head of the bed a water heater with a 2 6 gallon insulated tank offers warm handwashing or a shower if you pull the hose equipped faucet out the window on the side kitchen sink included a full but tiny kitchen is behind the driver s seat the couple can prepare food cook and wash dishes the well sink has a homemade cover cutting board the induction stove has a single burner and is useable with the windows open wind is not a problem salwei said we use cast iron cookware and a pressure cooker this helps us to conserve energy water is filtered via a system that converts dirty water to drinkable it s a complex chain with a 50 micron pre filter followed by a 5 micron carbon block to a 1 micron carbon block finally the water goes through an led disinfection system ready for drinking or washing up the engel md 14f fridge freezer was modified to increase its height mainly because in its original configuration it is not tall enough for milk or juice containers salwei explained we replaced the original fridge top with a homemade wood box insulated with aerogel foam cabinets in the kitchen are simple plywood construction storage boxes are made with corrugated plastic and they stay in place by hidden key retractor cords for looks the boxes are covered in an ocean wood pattern wallpaper night vision illumination comes from dual beam j w speaker and vision x led headlights as well as rigid industries lights mounted on the rear bumper a night vision system from flir gives a real time forward looking infrared view you can drive at night and see via a sony tablet screen mounted on the dash we got the system because we do a lot of driving in the dark in areas with little to no street illumination hernández cruz said we almost hit a black cow standing perfectly still in the middle of the road one night and there have been countless deer a herd of bison on the road and much more the flir pathfindir ii picks up heat signatures like animals on or near the road and it emits a loud beep as a warning onscreen the system places a yellow box around an infrared highlighted animal it also shows you the whole landscape including clouds and mountains at night hernández cruz continued we saw the grand tetons in the middle of the night lighting inside the van is an organized tangle of cords switches and eight separate zones more than 50 feet of led strip lighting with adjustable colors and intensity light up all corners and nooks including even the interior of the yakima boxes on the roof securing the slackervan keeping the van safe as they travel around the continent is a priority this is the couple s home and business base with most of their worldly possessions along for the ride at all times over the van s four wheels beyond the delica s factory locks the driver door passenger door sliding door and rear door are all equipped with burly master hasp locks the keyless locks open with a code and the big hasps on the doors can discourage thieves from bashing in a window as they cannot simply reach in and unlock a door bikes are secured on the back with a big ass chain the 9 16 diameter hardened steel square link motorcycle chain is made by abus a hitchsafe key vault is embedded on the bumper this tiny safe on the exterior of the van lets them leave the keys while hiking or out in the woods during group activities whoever is back to the vehicle first can open the vault spin the door lock combination code and start the ignition gear hauling prowess yakima has been a longtime partner of the project the company provided more than a dozen products for the van including a roof rack base system that salwei explained as a layered sandwich of yakima tracks with two layers to increase height and fit the a c unit under the roof basket overall there are six yakima hd crossbars yakima skyline towers a yakima track system and a windshield fairing three gearboxes are on top the company s skybox and rocketbox models bikes mount on a rear rack which is connected to a hinged unit that swings the bikes out of the way when the rear door needs to open finally an awning the yakima slimshady pulls 6 feet out to provide instant rain protection or shade some of the photos in this article show the exo system from yakima this new configuration on the rear of the van added this fall has a swing out base with a second level exo topshelf unit this lets the pair connect a yakima bike mount and an exo gearlocker which works as another cargo box though much easier to access and reach as it s situated at knee height on the back of the van beyond the commercially available gear storage salwei and hernández cruz built an integrated bike organizer on the rear door the system holds helmets bike shoes and gear and keeps it all immediately accessible and organized when the rear door swings up everything has its place salwei said we are always ready to go where the money meets the road of course all of this didn t happen overnight nor was it free salwei said the couple paid 9 100 for the van sight unseen at the time it had a little rust and a bad alternator being established gear reviewers and leading the yogaslackers brand they received some of the gear from sponsors like battle born batteries yakima racks merlin solar flir and luminor uv but much of the labor was sweat equity and the two did the work in small chunks over time even with the sponsorship salwei and hernández cruz confirmed they have spent a small fortune building out the delica though admittedly they prefer not to think about the exact number a few months ago someone asked us to give them a number for it to be sold we couldn t come up with one mainly because how do you put a price on endless sweat blood and a lot of tears lost in the process of building our home on wheels salwei asked but i gotta say if someone were to offer us more than 100 000 we ll probably restart the tear production in another vehicle we must have inherited a nomadic gene by raquel hernández cruz when you live in a van a common question is why travel to us this question is similar to asking anyone else why breathe traveling is our way of living i am confident to say that there is a group of people that cannot thrive in one place grow roots and flourish this group to whom we belong must have inherited a nomadic gene from our ancestors thousands of years ago our species survived thanks to their ability to be mobile malleable and travel on a daily basis they experienced the world one day at a time without set schedules and daily routines other than those set by biological needs that is us sam has been living out of a vehicle since 2009 i joined him in 2012 we first lived out of a 1988 ford festiva we roamed north america teaching yoga slacklining acro yoga and leading adventure based retreats after 5 years of living together in a tiny car we decided to upgrade to a larger vehicle our requirements were simple a larger bed and space to move around sam really wanted a 4 4 vehicle with a small footprint and had been keeping an eye on the delica we got lucky to find one within a few days of searching purchasing the delica was the easy part making sure a 1988 vehicle works perfectly is a different story when we bought the van it had a faulty alternator the first trips required us to stop to charge once a day it gave us the opportunity to travel slowly sleep inside our new stock seven passenger van and plan our build soon after the u joint broke taking with it the drive shack diesel can and transfer case our previous experience living and fixing the 1988 festiva had given us the tools required to not freak out at least not too much and to realize we got this five days after the breakdown we were ready to move again i wish i could say that building and maintaining a vehicle while living in it is easy it is not it is the most challenging adventure we have ever taken the reason it works for us is because we have an array of friends across the u s willing to lend tools garages time and skills our first build took 11 days we installed the first iteration of our roof rack system electric system kitchen layout and bed frame in rhode island we knew that we wanted to live in the van for a few months before finalizing the details as the layout written on paper needed to be proven experientially that proved to be true after a few months we realized we wanted to switch our under the bed storage system as one of many examples our second build took place in california there we added a ragtop to access the roof boxes from the inside of the van and redid the bed frame and storage we added a pop out extension to the driver s side of the van the extension allowed us to add a large window to vent the van while cooking and most importantly to switch our sleeping position from long ways in the van to sideways at this time it had been almost a year since we bought the van and we had not yet done any major trips but after installing an air compressor we hit the road and traveled all the way to the arctic circle this tour allowed us to test our systems and determine what else needed to be improved a little over a year later we returned to california where we spent 6 months during the pandemic working on a new set of improvements i wish i could say the build is done but as long as we continue traveling in this van we will continue seeing new ways to make it more comfortable functional and mechanically sound that s part of the fun sam and i plan to continue traveling and building our most modified mitsubishi the adventure and our life continue on the open road follow raquel and sam at yogaslackers com

street s tech driven crunch but momentum did start to pick up downunder given the comeback was largely due to positive signs for omicron and that affects everyone hence while tuesday saw signs of fomo returning yesterday investors let loose the index opened up 60 points and stalled there for a while before a first ball wicket led to another and another and momentum began to build with half an hour to go the index was up 130 points then rain stopped play late profit taking had us back at 7400 the index pivot point of the last few months it s the point at which the market says now what with wall street taking a bit of a breather last night our futures are down 27 points this morning all sectors closed in the green albeit by varying amounts materials rose 2 1 on stronger iron ore prices and

tariff on iron ore it s already hit every australian sector it can do without and funnily none of the ones it can t there was more positive omicron news out of the us last night but after two days of rally which have taken the s p500 almost back to its high wall street backed off the pace last night three times a charm pfizer announced last night tests show two doses of its vaccine should provide protection from severe illness from omicron but three increases protection against catching omicron by 25 fold back to levels of two dose protection against the original wuhan virus moderna is also testing and dr fauci is confident of similar results given the similarity of the two mrna vaccines it was more good news for wall street on top of indications omicron only results in mild illness but while stock indices all closed in the green again the pace of excitement unsurprisingly waned in the prior two sessions the s p500 rallied over 3 and the nasdaq over 4 there was no waning of excitement in travel stocks however they had a big run for a third day and had no doubt been heavily shorted the biggest company in the world apple continues to hit new highs and last night was just

times the 210 000 job additions reported for november the assumption has always been that once fiscal handouts ended us workers would rush back to find jobs but they ended in september and there is yet no sign whatsoever as wage price inflation continues to rise the only thing left that can close the gap is an end to covid but in the us vaccine hesitancy is just as strong as going back to work

video commentary for december 8th 2021 eoin treacy s view some of the topics discussed include dollar eases renminbi breaks out wall street extends advance oil and natural gas steady broadening of breadth beginning to appear which supports the medium term bull market gundlach sees rough waters for market as fed pursues taper this article from bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers here is a section gundlach 62 said the reason why fed chair jerome powell characterizes the economy as strong but not strong enough to allow for a rate hike at this point is that the underlying condition is in fact weak artificially propped up by an unprecedented degree of stimulus here are some other takeaways from gundlach s remarks he focused heavily on inflation saying the annual pace of gains in the consumer price index could hit 7 in the next month or two he ran through numerous inflation measures and pointed out that shelter costs have climbed significantly he also said it s possible that the cpi inflation gauge won t drop below 4 throughout 2022 markets could face more volatility now that the fed has said it might quicken its tapering program gundlach reiterated that he bought european stocks for the first time in 12 years which he disclosed a few months ago he still owns some of those and they ve done just ok until recently he didn t own emerging markets equities though he envisioned a scenario when they might outperform u s firms we re looking for major opportunities and emerging markets could be one over the next few years he said the dollar has been in structural decline since 1985 he said reiterating that the twin deficit problem that s the current account gap and the federal budget deficit will cause the greenback to fall over time which bodes well for emerging markets eoin treacy s view i ve been saying for most of this year that the dollar is the lynchpin for a migration away from us dollar assets wall street has outperformed by a wide margin from the perspective of international investors since 2008 the nasdaq 100 has had an average annual return of 23 3 and the s p posted 15 86 versus between 9 and 12 4 for the europe stoxx 600 nikkei 225 s p asx 200 australia and the s p tsx canada returns for india s nifty 50 brazil s ibovespa jakarta s composite and the johannesburg all share mostly fell within the same band the big outlier has been brazil which massively underperformed with an average annual return of 1 49 over the last 13 years the bloomberg dollar index has posted a robust advance over the last six months and is currently unwinding a short term overbought condition but a sustained move below 1165 would be required to question the consistence of the advance the asia dollar index is firming from the region of the trend mean it is being aided by the resiliency of the chinese renminbi which broke out to new highs today the latin america dollar index is steadying from the region of the 2020 lows aided by the recent strength of the brazilian real and mexican peso the above charts suggest the dollar index is being heavily influenced by the determination of the boj and ecb to be the last to tighten monetary policy meanwhile other currencies are gradually beginning to exhibit relative strength china s determination to refrain from disgorging liquidity into the economy has certainly supported the renminbi that suggests regional currencies can appreciate without experiencing undue pressure record exports sharply narrow u s trade deficit this article from reuters may be of interest to subscribers here is a section the trade gap plunged 17 6 to a six month low of 67 1 billion that was the biggest percentage drop since april 2015 reflecting an increase in the flow of goods and services following disruptions caused by the covid 19 pandemic economists polled by reuters had forecast a 66 8 billion deficit exports accelerated 8 1 to an all time high of 223 6 billion the surge was led by goods exports which soared 11 1 to 158 7 billion also a record high exports of industrial supplies and materials increased 6 4 billion with shipments of crude oil advancing 1 2 billion petroleum exports were the highest on record capital goods exports increased 3 1 billion boosted by other industrial machines as well as civilian aircraft food exports rose by 2 1 billion with soybeans increasing 1 8 billion exports of consumer goods jumped 1 6 billion lifted by increases in shipments of gem diamonds as well as motor vehicles parts and engines eoin treacy s view energy independence is an oft underestimated factor in any country s economic health that s particularly true of the usa which is still unaccustomed to the benefits of being a major exporter of a commodity much of the rest of the world is in dire need of the usa is now in the privileged position of no longer being the biggest consumer of oil and gas but being among their biggest exporters that s a significant factor in insulating the broad economy from energy pressures it also has the potential to turn the dollar into a proxy for commodity currencies these factors are particularly relevant for the natural gas market which a wide arbitrage exists with european prices demand for lng tankers and port facilities is likely to continue to ramp higher and not least because of uncertainty about russia s ambitions in ukraine european natural gas continues to build support at significantly higher levels than anyone would have thought possible in years past us natural gas is currently steadying in the region of the 200 day ma exmar remains in a relatively consistent uptrend as it firms from the region of the trend mean golar lng nasdaq glng has a similar pattern teekay lng partners is on the cusp of being taken private vodafone shares jump after betaville uncooked alert this note from bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers here it is in full vodafone shares rose as much as 3 3 following a so called uncooked mention in a betaville report regarding potential private equity interest in the telecom operator shares pared gain to 1 8 as of 4 18 p m representatives for vodafone were not immediately available to comment when contacted by bloomberg via phone and email betaville says there is speculation that one of europe s largest private equity firms is looking at all of some of vodafone citing people following the situation note the speculation is described as uncooked a term the betaville blog often uses to refer to market gossip note vodafone shares have declined 5 9 ytd vs stoxx telecoms index s 9 5 gain read private equity rummages in the telco bargain bin chris hughes eoin treacy s view one of the biggest questions for investors today is how to hedge a portfolio against inflation the answer is not easy finding a business that has strong cash flows with the possible of passing on incremental price increases is a strong contender for the most attractive contender vodafone along with many other major network owners has languished over the last few years the share bottomed following a seven year downtrend in 2020 and has been forming a base since a sequence of higher reaction lows remains in place which lends a mild upward bias to the chart the price is currently firming from the most recent low at t is pricing in the high potential for a dividend cut in the aftermath of completing the demerger of warner media and merger with discovery at t will then retail ownership of 40 of the combined entity the share bounced last week from the 22 area and has so far held that low as we approach the end of the year investors may begin to accumulate oversold stocks like this in the hope that bargain hunters will return at the beginning of 2022 also see comment of the day on november 15th 2021 it s official 96 container ships are waiting to dock at socal ports this article from freightwaves com here is a section the marine exchange has just unveiled its new methodology for counting container ships waiting outside the 40 mile in port zone a new queuing system has been in place since mid november that encourages container ships to wait outside of a specially designated safety and air quality area saqa that extends 150 miles to the west of the ports and 50 miles to the north and south this has sharply reduced the number of ships closer to shore leading to suggestions that efforts to tackle port congestion are cutting into the offshore queue a misconception that should be dispelled by the marine exchange s new counting method in addition to the 96 ships waiting offshore on friday there were 31 container ships at terminal berths bringing the grand total to 127 at or near an all time high the total number of container ships either at berths or waiting offshore continues to rise it is up 25 from the beginning of november 41 from the beginning of october and 79 from the beginning of september eoin treacy s view how do politicians achieve quick results the easiest way is to change the way the data is collected if you don t like how house prices distort the data take rents instead if oil is too volatile just leave it out if the number of ships weighting a for a berth is embarrassing and the problem does not have an easy fix just change how you count the chart seminar 2022 eoin treacy s view with global vaccination rates rising the

instagram ceo adam mosseri appeared before a senate panel on wednesday as the company faces scrutiny over the potential detrimental effects its social media platform has on young people the head of a senate panel examining social media s negative effects on young people has dismissed as a public relations tactic some safety measures announced by facebook s popular instagram platform adam mosseri the head of instagram on wednesday faced off with senators angry over revelations of how the photo sharing platform can harm some young users and demanding that the company commit to making changes under sharp questioning by senators of both parties mosseri defended the company s conduct and the efficacy of its new safety measures he challenged the assertion that instagram has been shown by research to be addictive for young people instagram has an estimated 1 billion users of all ages advertisement on tuesday instagram introduced a previously announced feature that urges teenagers to take breaks from the platform the company also announced other tools including parental controls due to come out early next year that it says are aimed at protecting young users from harmful content the parental oversight tools could have been announced years ago sen richard blumenthal d conn told mosseri the newly announced measures fall short and many of them are still being tested he said a pause that instagram imposed in september on its work on a kids version of the platform looks more like a public relations tactic brought on by our hearings blumenthal said i believe that the time for self policing and self regulation is over blumenthal said self policing depends on trust trust is over mosseri testified as facebook whose parent now is named meta platforms has been roiled by public and political outrage over disclosures by former facebook employee frances haugen she has made the case before lawmakers in the u s and europe that facebook s systems amplify online hate and extremism and that the company elevates profits over the safety of users haugen a data scientist who had worked in facebook s civic integrity unit buttressed her assertions with a trove of internal company documents she secretly copied and provided to federal securities regulators and congress advertisement the senate panel has examined facebook s use of information from its own researchers that could indicate potential harm for some of its young users especially girls while it publicly downplayed the negative effects for some instagram devoted teens peer pressure generated by the visually focused app led to mental health and body image problems and in some cases eating disorders and suicidal thoughts the research detailed in the facebook documents showed the revelations in a report by the wall street journal based on the documents leaked by haugen set off a wave of recriminations from lawmakers critics of big tech child development experts and parents technology and the internet what facebook knew about its latino aimed disinformation problem facebook has long emphasized the strength of its efforts to contain misinformation targeted at latinos and spanish speakers a whistleblower s leaks show employees raising alarms about the problem as head of instagram i am especially focused on the safety of the youngest people who use our services mosseri testified this work includes keeping underage users off our platform designing age appropriate experiences for people ages 13 to 18 and building parental controls instagram is built for people 13 and older if a child is under the age of 13 they are not permitted on instagram mosseri outlined the suite of measures he said instagram has taken to protect young people on the platform they include keeping kids under 13 off it restricting direct messaging between kids and adults and prohibiting posts that encourage suicide and self harm but as researchers both internal and external to meta have documented the reality is different kids under 13 often sign up for instagram with or without their parents knowledge by lying about their age and posts about suicide and self harm still reach children and teens sometimes with disastrous effects senators of both parties were united in condemnation of the social network giant and instagram the photo sharing juggernaut valued at some 100 billion that facebook acquired for 1 billion in 2012 advertisement already in july facebook said it was working with parents experts and policymakers when it introduced safety measures for teens on instagram in fact the company has been working with experts and other advisors for another product aimed at children its messenger kids app that launched in late 2017 senators pressed mosseri to support legislative remedies for social media among the legislative proposals put forward by blumenthal and others one bill proposes an eraser button that would let parents instantly delete all personal information collected from their children or teens another proposal bans specific features for kids under 16 such as video auto play push alerts like buttons and follower counts also being floated is a prohibition against collecting personal data from anyone age 13 to 15 without their consent as well as a new digital bill of rights for minors that would similarly limit gathering of personal data from teens

washington d c following a ruling by the u s consumer financial protection bureau cfpb u s debt collectors can now contact millions of indebted americans on social media and by text messaging while critics said the messages could be lost online or sent to the wrong recipients as well as cause invasions of privacy and the rise of new hoaxes advocates claim the change is a simple update to rules created in the 1970s the rule change which was approved by the cfpb last year during the trump administration requires creditors to contact defaulters privately meaning they can send direct messages but not post on public profiles consumers can opt out of these messages but creditors do not require permission to contact people there are no rules regarding how many messages are allowed to be sent lenders argued that this rule change was needed since the fair debt collection practices act which regulates the industry became law in 1977 and is outdated the new rule limits calls to seven per week for any particular debt but people with multiple debts may still be called dozen of times debt collectors are also limited from contacting any consumer by phone within one week of speaking to them about a specific debt in a statement mark neeb ceo of the debt collector trade group aca international said the rule change is a small step forward in modernizing communications with consumers as reported by the bbc according to cbs news the rule change could affect tens of millions of people in the united states

expedition the authors argue it is the longest and last motor journey around the world it s hard to argue with that as the route closest to the equator around the globe that the duo took is fraught

finally agreed to republish the book in 1999 to share the story with a new generation of overland travelers excerpt from the book when we formed our expedition and set out in 1965 to drive around the world we had two goals first we wanted to drive in a west to east direction wherever there was land on which to drive and second by selecting a route that was closer to the equator where the earth bulges than the routes taken by the handful of expeditions that had previously driven around the earth we sought to set a record an unbeatable record for the longest such journey ever made in quest of those goals we crossed five continents traversed six of the world s most inhospitable deserts and drove from the lowest place on earth at the dead sea to within sight of the world s highest in nepal after many mishaps and adventures bombings burglaries breakdowns floods fires sandstorms stonings diseases wars and romantic entanglements we achieved both those goals and lived to tell the tale our story who needs a road was published in 1968 to unexpected critical acclaim reviewers found it enthralling wonderfully adventurous and rollicking although some said we were crazy to have done what we did who needs a road became our publisher s second best selling book of the year behind the joy of cooking the man who cycled the world by mark beaumont one thing to always remember about overland travel is that it doesn t require a big 4 4 or even a motorcycle bicycles are a great way to see the world at a pace that truly lets you immerse yourself in the culture while this book 16 is more about setting a world record 194 days and 17 hours around the globe by bicycle it is still really about the sights sounds and smells you encounter at cycling speeds when traveling unsupported over 4 continents and 18 297 miles this 2008 tale of triumph and hardships is worth a read for anyone who loves type two fun and big adventure travels if overlanding was made into a competitive challenge

when afghan refugees started arriving in the us from afghanistan following the taliban take over in august 25 of them had their period according to the organization i support the girls the organization collects and distributes essential items including bras underwear and period products to support women experiencing homelessness poverty or distress and jumped to respond to the lack of pads and tampons at the refugee agencies families have had to rely on beneficiaries of i support the girl s period product initiatives for refugees included texas refugee services adventist community services of greater washington and asylee women enterprise dana marlowe founder and executive director of i support the girls is still in the thick of handling operations for period product distribution global citizen spoke to marlowe about period poverty during refugee crises how civil society can help normalize menstruation and what she would like to see world leaders support people with periods global citizen how do conflict and crisis impact period poverty dana marlowe when conflict or crisis arises for a person who menstruates your period is still most likely going to happen whether it s a natural disaster a manmade disaster or a massive refugee crisis your period is not going to stop your body is still going to be your body your period is one more thing an individual has to manage regardless of what else is going on regardless of if there are people with guns walking the streets regardless of if you don t know how you re getting a loaf of bread to feed your children where weeks prior it was never an issue you re still going to be bleeding down your leg when you finally do get to a relatively safe haven whether it s in the us or elsewhere a lot of social service agencies do not have a budgetary line item to go out and purchase menstrual hygiene products specifically pads for refugees and they are so infrequently donated has the covid 19 pandemic exacerbated period poverty for displaced people the access to products has caught up the pandemic has put so much pressure and caused such economic injustices particularly to women they ve lost jobs they ve lost money and domestic violence has been at an all time high more women have had to evacuate their homes more people who menstruate don t have access or the financial means to get those to the products that they used to i e menstrual products more people are tapping into social service agencies climate disasters disproportionately affect women and girls you know periods don t stop for hurricanes help our ida relief efforts by donating to provide pads and underwear today donate source happyhippiefdn x theslowfactorypic twitter com jclaxzafr3 i support the girls i_support_girls september 1 2021 the pandemic coupled with being a displaced person has made managing one s period so much harder because that displaced person doesn t know necessarily where to buy pads chances are they re dealing with a lot of different agencies and organizations trying to help them they might not be able to ask for them there might be a level of embarrassment just because of different cultural norms it s hard explaining what you need in a foreign language through a mask to somebody else and that adds a whole other level of complication there s also this discomfort you re hopeful for an interpreter or a translator and you need to now talk about managing your period or maybe managing your teenage daughter s period our hope at i support the girls is that we re able to better stock the social service organizations that we support so that they will have these donations on hand how would you like to see the international community step up for displaced people who are experiencing poverty period poverty there are a couple of different angles to address period poverty for displaced folks the first one is always to find out what are people s preferences for period products that s really important to us because we know there are some very very strong preferences between reusable versus tampons versus pads having access to sanitation and water is another huge issue so i think there s a lot of education that has to happen for the community and the displaced people but also for the communities and organizations that are serving them education around where and how to purchase when you re in your new community and then education about how to safely use the products because what happens if you get to a place where you were formerly using one product and now those products are not available we need to be talking about periods we need to be talking about periods on platforms where kids and adults are i want to be able to see more global period tiktoks and learn about menstruation in other languages we need to make more menstrual products essential items just as we do food or shelter or clothing for refugees more countries need to be talking on the government level to normalize talking about periods they also need to hire and be voting in more and more people with periods into positions of power we need more world leaders who have had periods what we had for decades and decades globally is a lot of middle aged men who don t have periods who don t want to talk about periods brushing this under the rug people who experience menstruation month after month year after year decade after decade for so many years of their life are able to make different decisions for their constituents because they can view the world through their eyes shared experience is so remarkably valuable how is i support the girls working to support afghan refugees who are experiencing period poverty we have 59 affiliates since the middle of august we ve donated over 150 000 items to more than 50 organizations that are helping afghan refugees specifically we ve helped afghan refugees in 21 states we have heavily donated pads and panty liners but we ve also donated underwear bras face masks baby bottles children s toys toothbrushes shampoo conditioner comforters and mascara what can everyday people do to help fight period poverty in refugee communities the first thing is to be outspoken about period poverty whether that s sharing this article on your social media platforms which costs nothing raising awareness about period products and periods in places that you wouldn t normally if you are of the means and able to do so have menstrual products whether or not you menstruate in your bag your car your backpack your locker at school or your home for people who do menstruate and might need them you could reach out to your local refugee agencies in your cities see what they need see if they need you if it s not something you can provide can you do a collection or a drive in your place of work your school your book club your friend group you can donate money to organizations that get products out to refugees if that s something you re able to do donations make a huge difference in letting us get more products out to people that need them volunteer your time you can also advocate in other ways for policies that support menstruation you can tweet and reach out via social media in your city or country to politicians and tell them why this is important this interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity and length

t he federal reserve has spent most of 2021 saying that high inflation would be temporary and yet price rises have persistently overshot forecasts reaching 5 in october on the fed s preferred measure even as employment remains about 4m short of its pre pandemic level on december 15th the fed will decide whether to tighten monetary policy probably by accelerating the pace at which it tapers its monthly purchases of assets mostly government bonds which are currently running at 90bn per month it should go ahead and take action though uncertainty is high the fed must rapidly respond to the data it has today and then adjust as necessary as conditions evolve those data indicate that it has already fallen behind listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the rise in prices cannot be explained by a few shortages such as of second hand cars in october the median item in the consumer price index was 3 1 more expensive than a year earlier clothes prices were up 4 3 shelter such as rent was 3 5 dearer and transport cost 4 5 more in the third quarter private sector wages and salaries grew at an annualised rate of 6 5 too fast to be compatible with the fed s 2 inflation target without incredible productivity growth it is true that temporary factors have driven up inflation the 1 9trn fiscal stimulus president joe biden signed in march will not be repeated the outlay proposed in the democrats social spending bill is more spread out and partly offset by tax rises during the pandemic consumers have binged on goods supply chains have been bunged up especially as the world s factories have faced lockdowns and staff absences despite an abnormal number of americans out of work firms have struggled to fill vacancies however predicting when these pandemic related forces will ease is a fool s errand especially now that the omicron variant is spreading for as long as inflation remains high there is a growing danger that it will become entrenched the new york fed estimates that the median consumer expects prices to rise at an annual pace of 4 2 over the next three years up from 3 in january 2021 suggesting they may demand higher wages rising inflation expectations also reduce the effective cost of credit because inflation makes debts easier to repay the real interest rate over five years on government bonds is about 1 6 lower than in almost all of 2020 when the economy was far weaker the latest argument from some doves is that nominal gdp or total cash spending in the economy is merely on its pre crisis trend this proves that pandemic related distortions not excessive demand have driven up prices they say yet though this argument held in the third quarter it may already be out of date nominal gdp is expected to grow at annual rates of over 10 in the fourth quarter compared with the trend rate of just 4 america is seeing an unusual surge in demand not just constrained supply tighter monetary policy is therefore justified but if you believe the fed s theory of how its asset purchases work every bond it buys adds fresh stimulus to the economy it follows that merely tapering the pace of purchases is not tightening so why not raise interest rates instead the answer is that the fed is bound by its past guidance that it would stop buying bonds before raising rates and that it would avoid ending purchases abruptly abandoning that framework would lead investors to question the central bank s trustworthiness and to expect an excessive number of additional interest rate increases in 2022 the good news is that the fed can taper fast enough to let it raise interest rates in march if between now and then the pandemic greatly worsens consumers slash their spending on goods or many missing workers return to the labour force monetary policymakers can change course again but they must give themselves scope to raise rates soon in an ideal world it is an option that would already be on the table for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to money talks our weekly newsletter dig deeper all our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub you can also find trackers showing the global roll out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus s spread across europe

in spring 2022 the weapon will be upgraded to hit targets up to 7 km away in late november 2021 lobaev arms corporation unveiled the dxl 5 havoc sniper rifle the most powerful sniper rifle in russia according to the enterprise s creator vladislav lobaev the weapon is chambered with 50 bmg caliber rifle ammunition which is popular among nato armies and is used by snipers to eliminate light armored vehicles up to two kilometers away the weapon can disable for example a humvee from such a distance if a sniper hits it in the engine with an armor piercing round said yuri sinichkin the leading engineer at the lobaev arms corporation he suggested that the dxl 5 is better suited for bulky targets rather than hitting enemies on the battlefield as its 50 bmg caliber is more powerful compared to other sniper rifles calibers but not as accurate as the 375 or 408 chey tac we just conducted our first tests at a shooting range the weapon showed accuracy of less than 1 moa minutes of angular meaning that the dispersion between three bullets from 100 meter distance was less than 3 cm said the engineer at the moment several dxl 5 sniper rifles are being manufactured for a middle east client the company also has a blueprint of a new rifle based on the dxl 5 which will be capable of hitting targets up to seven kilometers away this new weapon will be manufactured and sent for tests in spring 2021 we will modify the rifle and use new hypersonic rounds we specially created for it the tests will be conducted next spring once we finish the current contract and deliver all the remaining rifles to our client the leading engineer revealed the company also integrated a special damper into its stock to drastically reduce the weapon s recoil and suggests that the dxl 5 is potentially the softest 50 bmg rifle on the market today this feature will increase the user s accuracy it will especially be felt while shooting targets two kilometers away said sinichkin lobaev arms considers foreign armies as the main customers for this rifle the cost of a dxl 5 is set at 25 000 without optics the company also stated that they plan to use dxl 5 s technologies and new hypersonic rounds that will be tested next spring to drastically advance snipers capabilities to put it in numbers this new ammo will allow a user who usually shoots targets at distances from 1 km to 2 km to immediately hit targets situated up to 3 km away a user who works at distances of up to 2 5 km will be able to stably hit targets 4 km away what snipers say about dxl 5 special forces instructor andrey piskunov believes that dxl 5 is a step forward for russian arms manufacturers but he doesn t believe that a new rifle from a small firearms company could have surpassed foreign weapons in quality it s as if russia created its own analogue of the iphone 11 in 2021 a technological leap for the country but there are already more advanced phones on the market piskunov admitted he states that their units actively use the 50 bmg caliber barrett s sniper rifle and won t be switching to russian made weapons for a couple of reasons first of all the dxl 5 is raw the weapon has to pass real life tests on battlefields receive user reviews and manufacturers have to fix all the issues that may occur secondly the price the officer was surprised when he heard that a dxl 5 costs 25 000 according to him that s expensive as he can buy american rifles cheaper and bring them to russia until we see in practice that the dxl 5 is worth the money and is three times better than american rifles we will not give up on the barret the officer concluded please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus

key takeaways finra released its most recent sanctions guideline effective immediately on october 20 2021 a link to that document can be found here the key change in the 2021 sanctions guideline is a new section which provides for sanctions attributable to omitted late false inaccurate or misleading consolidated audit trail system cat reports that new guideline is discussed below we also identify herein conduct that is attributable to the most onerous sanctions and compare those results to sanctions attributable to sales practice violations common to investors the disparity in the recommended disciplines may surprise you finally we explore whether recently published finra disciplinary settlements actually fall within finra s published guidelines and we offer our thoughts as to the results of that analysis new sanctions for consolidated audit trail system violations below is the newest sanction guideline for violations of the consolidated audit trail system rules this guidance is not found in the published guidelines from 2019 and it marks the only material difference between the former and the new version consolidated audit trail system cat late reporting failure to report false inaccurate or misleading reporting and clock synchronization failure principal considerations in determining sanctions nature of finra cat reporting violation extent to which violative conduct affected the regulatory audit trail whether the violation occurred over an extended period of days whether the violation was readily apparent from a review of reporting metric information provided to cat reporters through the cat reporter portal and feedback files while respondents are responsible for the systems that they use and the third party vendors that they employ the appropriate level of sanctions will depend on whether the respondent diligently chose installed and tested a system that nevertheless malfunctioned the frequency and thoroughness with which the respondent ensured that the system was operating in compliance with applicable rules and the care that the respondent exercised in undertaking all necessary steps to correct systems related malfunctions the same considerations apply to a respondent that has relied on a third party vendor s products or services monetary sanctions first action fine of 5 000 16 000 second action fine of 10 000 77 000 subsequent actions fine of 10 000 155 000 in all egregious cases whether a first second or subsequent action consider a fine greater than or equal to the high end of the range for a first second or subsequent action suspension bar or other sanctions firm subsequent actions consider suspending the firm with respect to any or all activities or functions for up to 30 business days in egregious cases consider a lengthier suspension of up to two years or expulsion of the firm individual subsequent actions consider suspending the responsible individual in any or all capacities for up to 30 business days in egregious cases consider a lengthier suspension of up to two years or a bar conduct for which finra recommends the largest monetary sanctions while analyzing the newest version of the sanctions guidelines we focused on what conduct garners the largest monetary sanctions repeat conduct in the following instances can lead to monetary sanctions up to and exceeding 310 000 certain conduct will incur additional sanctions and penalties where egregious conduct can be shown examples include best execution failure to comply with requirements for best execution proposed monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 for first action 10 000 155 000 for second action and 25 000 310 000 for subsequent actions proposed monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 for first action 10 000 155 000 for second action and 25 000 310 000 for subsequent actions marking the close or open the act of placing trades prior to the market open or close solely to influence the price of the stock proposed monetary sanction 25 000 310 000 with the fine exceeding 310 000 for egregious cases proposed monetary sanction 25 000 310 000 with the fine exceeding 310 000 for egregious cases excessive markups markdowns and excessive commissions proposed base monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 for first action 10 000 155 000 for second action and 25 000 310 000 for subsequent actions sanctions also will include in all cases the amount of the excessive markup markdown commission proposed base monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 for first action 10 000 155 000 for second action and 25 000 310 000 for subsequent actions sanctions also will include in all cases the amount of the excessive markup markdown commission research analysts and research reports failing to comply with rule requirements regarding 1 relationships between department

reports and public appearances of research analysts 2 restrictions on personal trading of research analysts and 3 disclosure requirements for research reports and public appearances of research analysts proposed monetary sanction 5 000 155 000 for negligent misconduct and fine of 10 000 310 000 and in excess of 310 000 for cases involving intentional reckless misconduct proposed monetary sanction 5 000 155 000 for negligent misconduct and fine of 10 000 310 000 and in excess of 310 000 for cases involving intentional reckless misconduct supervision systemic supervisory failures proposed monetary sanction 10 000 77 000 for responsible individuals and 10 000 310 000 for the firm with higher fines attributable with cases where aggravating factors are predominate restitution and disgorgement also will be considered conduct which garners less monetary sanctions but potentially has a greater material impact on investors in comparison we were genuinely surprised that the sanctions guidelines assign a lower monetary fine on conduct that arguably has a greater direct impact on investors legal compliance and risk teams may want to consider the potential for associated investor litigation and reputation risk in addition to the current potential fine levels when prioritizing resources and testing within compliance programs prime examples include selling away proposed monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 proposed monetary sanction 5 000 77 000 sale of unregistered securities proposed monetary sanction 2 500 77 000 and 5 000 155 000 were respondent s conduct involved a

monetary sanction 5 000 116 000 discretionary and mandatory suspensions finra s guidance for suggested suspensions generally is less rigid than the guidelines regarding monetary sanctions indeed finra gives itself wide latitude when deciding how long to seek to suspend a malfeasor suspensions can cover a period from 5 business days up to 2 years and well beyond in egregious situations with no mitigating circumstances finra can also consider a bar of an individual and expulsion of a firm under the sanction guidelines there are however certain circumstances which warrant an automatic bar or expulsion in these instances finra has no discretion examples include failure to respond to an 8210 request failure to truthfully respond to an 8210 request providing a partial but incomplete response to an 8210 request unless the person can demonstrate substantial compliance conversion regardless of the amount converted forgery unauthorized use of signatures or falsification of records without authorization and in furtherance of another violation cheating using and impostor or possessing unauthorized materials in qualifications examinations or in the regulatory element of continuing education finra enforcement settlements often include sanctions far broader than published guidelines finra frequently seeks sanctions through regulatory settlements that far exceed those outlined in the sanction guidelines and recently published finra regulatory settlements illustrate that firms are accepting those settlements the following settlements summarize instances in which the agreed upon sanctions far exceeded those recommended or recognized in finra s sanction guidelines finra case 2016049087201 where a firm was censured and fined 1 500 000 for failing to provide branch managers with

markets the proposed monetary sanctions for best execution violations range from 5 000 77 000 for first action and up to 310 000 for third actions and all subsequent actions no prior actions were indicated in this instance the settlement is more than 10 times the upper range for initial penalties finra case 2019063058701 where a firm was censured and fined 750 000 for failing to establish maintain and enforce wsps to address unsuitable short term trading of mutual funds and municipal bonds in customer accounts and over concentration of customer accounts in puerto rican municipal bonds the proposed monetary sanctions for systemic supervisory failure violations range from 10 000 310 000 for responsible firms the settlement is more than double the guideline upper range finra case 2018057162401 where a firm was censured and fined 30 000 for submitting inaccurate data to the order audit trail system in certain roes consisting of combined order execution reports with inaccurate account type codes and orders reported with inaccurate order received timestamps proposed monetary sanctions for inaccurate reporting within audit trail systems range from 5 000 16 000 for first action offenses no prior actions were indicated in this instance the settlement is almost double the guideline upper range finra case 2018058595601 where a firm was censured and fined 250 000 as a result of a broker agent engaging in unsuitable and excessive equity and options trading and used margin in senior customers accounts the proposed monetary sanction for unsuitability violations range

of such documents or identify the individuals responsible for achieving compliance with record retention requirements the firm also failed to provide finra with requisite 90 day notice prior to storing the subject records electronically the proposed monetary sanctions for systemic supervisory failure violations range from 10 000 310 000 for responsible firms the settlement is almost is more than triple the guideline upper range by comparison we found the following settlements in which the agreed upon discipline was commensurate with that recommended by the sanctions guidelines finra case 2016048614701 where a firm was censured and fined 250 000 for its failure to identify its alternative trading system as an sci entity and establish reg sci policies and procedures for the system for

structured as a contingency offering of securities on behalf of an issuer the firm deposited investor funds into a bank account that it established and controlled not a separate bank account as agent or trustee rather than with a bank that had agreed in writing to hold the funds in escrow it was also found that the firm wilfully violated the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act rule 10b 9 by failing to promptly return funds to investors after the minimum contingency amount was reduced the proposed monetary sanctions for improper use of client funds range from 2 500 77 000 given the disparity in results with sanctions falling both within and significantly above the ranges contemplated by finra s published sanctions guidelines firms should consider whether the applicable facts and circumstances warrant sanctions larger than what is called for in the sanctions guidelines and whether mitigating factors can be asserted to reduce the overall exposure marshalling information and presenting mitigating factors to finra is critical in posturing effectively during settlement negotiations considerations for mitigation should include no prior similar infractions lack of customer harm customer remediation efforts if customer harm is present self reporting significant remedial actions elimination of the action product or process which gives rise to the infraction voluntary increased training conclusion in assessing and mitigating regulatory and enforcement risk appreciation of the facts and circumstances is critical while the industry may hope that the sanctions guidelines provide a degree of consistency predictability and general fairness practitioners should understand that results will vary significantly based on the facts of each case finra member firms should seek to ensure that all possible mitigating factors are properly considered by finra in reaching the matter s resolution savvy institutions should pay special attention to trends in finra

former vice chair for supervision randal k quarles covered a broad range of topics in his farewell remarks he celebrated the overall strength of the banking system and suggested areas where there is latitude for regulatory change or recalibration mr quarles addressed a number of areas including among other things general strength of banks mr quarles stated that the covid 19 pandemic demonstrated the overall strength of the banking system given that banks had performed well on stress tests throughout the pandemic he added the resilience of banks during the covid event coupled with the results of stress tests demonstrate that the overall level of capital in the banking system is more than ample mr quarles stated that the covid 19 pandemic demonstrated the overall strength of the banking system given that banks had performed well on stress tests throughout the pandemic he added the resilience of banks during the covid event coupled with the results of stress tests demonstrate that the overall level of capital in the banking system is more than ample leverage ratio mr quarles stressed that the leverage ratio requirement was too often becoming the binding constraint on banks with the perverse result being that banks have incentive to invest in riskier assets as opposed to for example u s government securities non u s banks governor quarles suggested that the level of capital or total loss absorbing capacity of non u s banks doing business in the united states may be too high and that the requirements should be re examined governor quarles suggested that the level of capital or total loss absorbing capacity of non u s banks doing business in the united states may be too high and that the requirements should be re examined stress tests mr quarles praised the performance of the frb s stress testing during the pandemic but cited excessive volatility in banks capital requirements as an area for reform to enable firms to manage their capital effectively without large year over year shifts in regulatory required capital mr quarles recommended that such excessive volatility be addressed by averaging the results of the current year s stress test with the corresponding stress test results from the previous two years he argued that this would allow firms that hold the risk profile of their balance sheets relatively constant to maintain the same relative level of required capital from year to year mr quarles praised the performance of the frb s stress testing during the pandemic but cited excessive volatility in banks capital requirements as an area for reform

emphasized that the greatest focus should be on improving our supervisory communications process and outlined a three pronged approach for such improvement mr quarles stated that the frb should i restore the supervisory observation category for items of concern that have not yet risen to the level of a matter requiring attention mra ii ensure that mras are limited to either violations of law or regulation or material safety and soundness issues and iii establish a routine practice of independent review of important supervisory communications and guidance documents mr quarles proposed

ensure that mras are limited to either violations of law or regulation or material safety and soundness issues and iii establish a routine practice of independent review of important supervisory communications and guidance documents digital assets governor quarles expressed concern that undue regulation would discourage assets such as stablecoins he noted his disagreement with one conclusion in the recent report of the president s working group on financial markets that recommended that only insured depository institutions should be issuers of stablecoins however he agreed with the concept that the assets backing any stablecoins should be held by an insured depository institution governor quarles expressed concern that undue regulation would discourage assets such as stablecoins he noted his disagreement with one conclusion in the recent report of the president s working group on financial markets that recommended that only insured depository institutions should be issuers of stablecoins however he agreed with the concept that the assets backing any stablecoins should be held by an insured depository institution lending by the federal reserve during the pandemic governor quarles differentiated the two types of federal reserve loans made during the pandemic one type to support institutional liquidity and another type to provide credit to needy borrowers including households businesses and local governments as to these two types he indicated that the federal reserve in its traditional role as lender of last resort should continue to be the agency responsible for providing what he called liquidity facilities to support liquidity during a financial crisis but he did not believe that the federal reserve should be the provider of what he called broadly used credit facilities that support the extension of long term credit to the real economy households businesses and governments governor quarles differentiated the two types of federal reserve loans made during the pandemic one type to support institutional liquidity and another type to provide credit to needy borrowers including households businesses and local governments as to these two types he

during a financial crisis but he did not believe that the federal reserve should be the provider of what he called broadly used credit facilities that support the extension of long term credit to the real economy households businesses and governments financial stability board activities and non u s banks mr quarles argued that addressing weaknesses in the financial system related to non bank financial intermediation nbfi remains one of the most important tasks for the financial stability board fsb he highlighted the progress of the fsb on this issue including the fsb s policy proposals addressing structural vulnerabilities in money market mutual funds commentary steven lofchie a number of mr quarles remarks indicate that there should be some modest decrease of bank capital calibration particularly as to the treatment of foreign banks and as to the leverage ratio it is unlikely that those suggestions will be priorities for the current administration the most significant big picture remarks made by mr quarles were as to the role of the federal reserve in extending credit following the pandemic in particular he asserted that the federal reserve s role in extending credit should be limited to supporting liquidity it should not be a supplier of general credit to needy borrowers a role he described as more appropriate to agencies that are directly controlled by congress commentary sebastian souchet mr quarles comments on digital assets are intriguing if for no other reason than his somewhat surprising praise of such assets as a welcome innovation previous comments by mr quarles expressed significant caution with respect to a federal reserve issued central bank digital currency and may have been interpreted by some as a general skepticism of the digital asset space overall yet his farewell remarks make clear his view that financial regulators should welcome responsible innovation create a regulatory environment that not only allows for such innovation but encourages it query how much mr quarles remarks on digital assets are a reflection of prudential regulators growing acceptance of the view that digital assets are here to stay mr quarles also raises some interesting policy questions for digital asset regulation he argues that regulation limiting custodial wallet providers affiliation with commercial entities is unwarranted and that t is not at all clear what regulatory interest would be furthered by such a limitation which is much more restrictive than we require for nondigital assets these comments reflect a recurring fundamental question for financial regulation to what extent if any should there be a separation of commercial activities from the provision of financial services acting occ comptroller hsu posed essentially the same question in recent remarks on prudential regulation of digital assets stating that the rapid expansion and mixing of wholesale and retail activities at some crypto firms raise the question of whether there ought to be glass steagall like separation of activities in the crypto space notably acting comptroller hsu left that question unanswered setting aside the question of whether it is prudent for current financial regulations to not more fully separate a banking entity s commercial activities from its provision of financial services regarding nondigital assets arguably due to the repeal of certain provisions of the glass steagall act digital assets and digital asset related activities pose rather novel regulatory concerns regarding systemic risk conflicts of interest and excessive concentration of market power as noted by acting comptroller hsu in his recent remarks many of the larger digital asset firms especially those receiving the economic benefits of economies of scale and scope as well as first mover advantages aim to become universal i e offering everything from crypto custody to retail brokerage to market making to asset management to prime brokerage to the extent that such a universal digital asset firm exists its presence in the market may have anti competitive implications and may pose systemic issues due to concentration of market power affiliation of custodial wallet providers with commercial firms in particular with respect to such universal firms where digital asset custodial services and commercial services are provided by essentially the same entity may only exacerbate any anti competitive effects and further concentrate such a firm s market power relatedly as emphasized by the report on stablecoins published by the president s working group on financial markets such affiliation of wallet providers with commercial firms may lead to advantages in accessing credit or using data to market or restrict access to products his combination could have detrimental effects on competition and lead to market concentration in sectors of the real economy pg 14 of the report cadwalader s steven lofchie contributed to

face a real risk of persecution or serious harm that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within paragraphs 339c and 339ca iii of the immigration rules article 3 of the european convention on human rights echr that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within paragraphs 339c and 339ca iv of the immigration rules a person is able to obtain protection from the state or quasi state bodies a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory a claim is likely to justify granting asylum humanitarian protection or other form of leave and if a claim is refused it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 decision makers must however still consider all claims on

section 2 3 convention reason s 2 3 1 a person s actual or imputed membership of a particular social group psg 2 3 2 lgbti persons in sri lanka form a particular social group psg within the meaning of the refugee convention because they share an innate characteristic or a common background that cannot be changed or share a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to their identity or conscience that they should not be forced to renounce it and have a distinct identity which is perceived as being different by the surrounding society 2 3 3 in the country guidance case lh and ip gay men risk sri lanka cg ukut 00073 iac promulgated on 18 february 2015 heard on 6 8 august 2014 the upper tribunal found that although all lgbti persons form a psg with regard specifically to those who are in a civil partnership or married that they do not consider that individuals whose civil partner status or status as married homosexuals is not reflected in their legal status in their country of origin form a separate particular social group para 25 2 3 4 although lgbti persons in sri lanka form a psg establishing such membership is not sufficient to be recognised as a refugee the question to be addressed is whether the particular person will face a real risk of persecution on account of their membership of such a group 2 3 5 for further guidance on convention reasons see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 4 risk a general points 2 4 1 sri lanka has a total land area of 65 610 sq km and an estimated population of over 23 million the number of persons in sri lanka who identify as lgbti is estimated to be between 5 and 12 of the population estimated up to approximately 1 469 574 people see societal norms 2 4 2 paragraphs 35 and 82 of the determination of the supreme court s ruling in hj iran and ht cameroon v secretary of state for the home department uksc 31 heard 10 11 12 may and promulgated 7 july 2010 has set out the approach to take and established the test that should be applied when assessing a claim based on a person s sexual orientation which can also be applied to claims based on a person s gender identity expression 2 4 3 for further information see the asylum instruction on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim and gender identity issues in the asylum claim b state treatment of lgb persons 2 4 4 same sex sexual acts for both men and women are a criminal offence even if they are consensual under section 365 and 365 a of the penal code those who are prosecuted under these sections face a term of imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and also may face a fine lack of legal interpretation means that the police can arrest and detain lgb persons even if no sexual act took place see statutory laws and implementation and enforcement of the law 2 4 5 while other laws do not specifically relate to lgb persons they are sometimes arrested under the vagrancy ordinance which gives the authorities the power to detain those who they consider to be loitering in public according to one source section 353 of the penal code which relates to abduction is also used against those in same sex relationships particularly lesbians antidiscrimination laws do not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression there is little information pertaining to the exact reasons for or how frequent and widespread such arrests are in the sources consulted see other legal provisions affecting lgbti persons 2 4 6 official figures on crime between 2016 and 2018 reported by the sri lankan police in 2018 show the following 2016 33 gay men were prosecuted 100 of the cases filed 2017 6 gay men were prosecuted 75 of the cases filed 2018 9 gay men were prosecuted 100 of the cases filed 2 4 7 details regarding the prosecutions including whether the cases were unnatural offences that included same sex acts carried out without consent could not be found in the sources consulted official figures on the prosecutions of gay men and those in the lgbti community generally in sri lanka have not been specifically reported on since 2018 but it has been claimed that between october 2019 and october 2020 6 gay men were prosecuted see implementation and enforcement of the law 2 4 8 in the country guidance case lh and ip gay men risk sri lanka cg ukut 00073 iac promulgated on 18 february 2015 heard on 6 8 august 2014 the upper tribunal ut noted that s 365 dates from before sri lanka s independence in 1948 but that there have been no prosecutions since independence para 16 it also found that in general the treatment of gay men in sri lanka does not amount to persecution or serious harm para 123 3 2 4 9 the ut in lh and ip also found that there is a significant population of homosexuals and other lgbt individuals in sri lanka in particular in colombo while there is more risk for lesbian and bisexual women in rural areas because of the control exercised by families on unmarried women and for transgender individuals and sex workers in the cities it will be a question of fact whether for a particular individual the risk reaches the international protection standard and in particular whether it extends beyond their home area para 123 4 2 4 10 the findings in lh and ip were in part based on the us state department s human rights report of 2013 which stated that the police sometimes detained harassed extorted money from and assaulted members of the lgbti community subsequent ussd human rights reports including the most recent covering events in 2020 have reported the same type and level of treatment sources including the ussd have reported on isolated incidences of mistreatment of lgbti persons since 2017 namely 7 persons who were forced to undergo physical examinations to provide proof of same sex conduct including forced anal and vaginal examination and 6 gay men who were physically mistreated and threatened in custody following their arrest in october 2019 however there are few reported cases of harassment by the authorities and the evidence does not demonstrate that the situation has changed significantly for lgbti individuals since the findings in lh and ip see implementation and enforcement of the law and arrests and detention of lgb persons 2 4 11 evidence does not indicate that incidences of detention of those seen to be loitering or the threat of the use of section 365 and 365 a are generally sufficiently serious by their nature and repetition as to amount to persecution and therefore do not warrant a departure from the finding made in lh and ip 2 4 12 on 15 july 2015 the supreme court of sri lanka heard and on 30 november 2016 handed down their judgment in galabada payagalaga sanath wimalasari and others vs officer in charge sc appeal no 32 11 this court hearing addressed the constitutional challenge to section 365a of the penal code gross indecency convictions following a magistrate in 2003 imposing a term of imprisonment of one year and fine of rs 1 500 of two gay men following consensual sexual activity in a public place such conduct could also lead to a prosecution in the uk 2 4 13 the supreme court heard the evidence again and concluded that there was no reason to interfere with the finding of guilt in this case however the supreme court went on to look into whether the sentence imposed on the appellant was excessive in light of the circumstances of this case although the supreme court stated that whilst in some countries criminalisation of same sex acts had been repealed they noted that in sri lanka it remained part of the law however given that the incident had taken place over 13 years previously the appellants lack of previous convictions or criminal history and considering the fact that the act was consensual the supreme court ruled that a custodial term of imprisonment did not appear to be commensurate with the offence the one year sentence was set aside and substituted with a sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment suspended for a period of 5 years in order to offer the offenders the opportunity to reform 2 4 14 the supreme court in the case of galabada took into consideration the fact that the act itself was consensual but noted that same sex activity remained illegal in sri lanka and could therefore not overturn the guilty verdict 2 4 15 although the supreme court in galabada did not overturn the guilty verdict as the law was correctly applied in 2003 and had not changed since it showed a nuanced approach by overturning the custodial sentence although it suggested the offenders should have an opportunity to reform the court gave no indication of what that might mean and although conversion therapy happens in sri lanka there is no evidence that this is forced upon a person by the state or was referred to in the galabada case see conversion therapy 2 4 16 in 2018 the courts in the uk allowed an asylum appeal submitted by a sri lankan national against the decision to refuse her application for asylum on the basis of her profile as a transgender woman in a relationship with a gay man the secretary of state appealed the court s decision to grant the appeal on the basis it amounted to an error of law as it departed from the established position of the risk to gay men in lh and ip in november 2018 the uk upper tribunal dismissed the secretary of state s appeal and held in the unreported determination in secretary of state for the home department v mkmr pa 01821 2018 heard 1 november 2018 promulgated 26 november 2018 that the galabada case shows at the very least that contrary to the basis on which the tribunal proceeded in lh and ip at that the criminal law has been used in sri lanka if only once but nonetheless recently and in a judgment of the sri lankan supreme court 2 4 17 in the case of galabada two men were prosecuted for engaging in oral sex in public whereas the appellant in the mkmr case was trans and engaged to be married as such any conclusions drawn from this case should be looked at in light of these specific aspects notwithstanding this the upper tribunal noted that the argument in the grounds that the judge approached the case on a syllogistic basis that just because two gay men indulged in an incident that breached public order it did not mean that all gay men in sri lanka will receive the same treatment does not stand up to analysis this is not what the judge said he considered whether the appellant would be at risk and found that he would 2 4 18 furthermore whilst the upper tribunal in this case stated that the grounds argue that the judge was wrong not to follow the country guidance in lh and ip we are satisfied that in the light of that judgment it was open to the judge to take the view that judgment in galabada was cogent evidence providing strong grounds for not following lh and ip and to find that there was a reasonable degree of likelihood that the appellant would be at risk of persecution on return we also note that in lh and ip the tribunal accepted that transgender individuals might be more at risk than other gay men and in the present case the appellant is seeking to transition to female therefore they do not appear to be endorsing a departure from lh and ip but merely concluding that the first tier tribunal judge was open to do so in that particular case 2 4 19 although mkmr suggested that the first tier judge was open to consider whether the galabada verdict was cogent evidence for not following lh and lp it is unlikely that this would prove to be enough on its own having taken into account all other country information 2 4 20 whilst incidents of harassment assault extortion through money or sexual favours by the authorities do take place including reports of a few individuals having been beaten and undergoing forced physical examinations at the hands of the authorities the available country evidence however does not in general establish that a person who is open about sexual orientation is likely to face treatment that is generally sufficiently serious by their nature and repetition as to amount to persecution or serious harm 2 4 21 available evidence shows that arrests and prosecutions of lgbti persons has occurred similarly there is evidence of incidences of mistreatment against them however relative to the estimated population of people who identify as lgbti in sri lanka the scale and extent of such incidences is low the reporting often describes or conflates discrimination intimidation abuse and violence without specifying the scale and extent of each therefore a person may be able to establish a real risk of persecution or serious harm but in general lgbti persons are unlikely to be subject to treatment by the state that is sufficiently serious by its nature or repetition to amount to persecution each case must be considered on its own facts and the onus is on the person to demonstrate that they would be at risk of persecution or serious harm on return to sri lanka 2 4 22 on 1 march 2021 zero discrimination day president rajapaksa tweeted that he was determined to secure everybody s right to a dignified life irrespective of various grounds including gender and sexual orientation this was seen by lgbt activists as a ground breaking statement the first open acknowledgement of lgbt rights by a sri lankan head of state see official views on sexual orientation and gender identity 2 4 23 if a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not if it is concluded that a material reason for the person living discreetly on their return would be a fear of the persecution which would follow if they were to live openly then other things being equal their application should be accepted each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return 2 4 24 for further guidance on assessing risk see the asylum instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 4 25 decision makers must also refer to the asylum instructions on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim and gender identity issues in the asylum claim c state treatment of trans and intersex persons 2 4 26 there are no laws which specifically criminalise transgender or intersex people in sri lanka however section 399 of the penal code which bans cheating by impersonation is sometimes used against trans persons on the basis that their gender expression does not match the gender stated on their id and as such the state sees them as pretending to be a different gender the police arrest people under the vagrancy ordinance which gives the authorities the power to detain people who they consider are loitering in public see trans persons and other legal provisions affecting lgbti persons 2 4 27 the vagrancy ordinance is also sometimes used against lgb persons but transgender persons are more likely to be affected by this owing to their increased visibility those who engage in sex work or who have a lower social economic status particularly trans women are more vulnerable to abuse sexual harassment and mistreatment while in police custody see arrests and detentions of trans persons and societal norms gender and sexual identity 2 4 28 the upper tribunal in lh and ip found that while there is more risk for transgender individuals and sex workers in the cities it will be a question of fact whether for a particular individual the risk reaches the international protection standard and in particular whether it extends beyond their home area para 123 4 2 4 29 the risk of arrest for trans persons is generally higher than the rest of the lgb community owing to their increased visibility whilst incidents of harassment by the authorities do take place the country evidence does not indicate that they are generally sufficiently serious by their nature and repetition as to amount to persecution or serious harm however decision makers must consider whether there are particular factors relevant to the person which might make the treatment serious by its nature or repetition 2 4 30 cpit was unable to find any information about the number circumstances or treatment of intersex persons there is however no reason to believe that they are treated differently from other sexual minority groups 2 4 31 if a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not if it is concluded that a material reason for the person living discreetly on their return would be a fear of the persecution which would follow if they were to live openly then other things being equal their application should be accepted each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return 2 4 32 for further guidance on assessing risk see the asylum instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 4 33 decision makers must also refer to the asylum instructions on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim and gender identity issues in the asylum claim d societal treatment of lgb persons 2 4 34 anti lgb sentiment is deeply ingrained in sri lankan culture with most sri lankans holding conservative views about sexual orientation and gender identity however a recent study sponsored by the foreign commonwealth and development office suggested attitudes may be changing and those with a more positive attitude towards lgbt people are likely to be under 30 years old living in urban areas educated to tertiary levels or higher have a higher level of awareness of lgbt identities report more interaction with lgbt people and are likely to follow buddhism or hinduism however the study continued to reveal positive and negative perceptions are held depending on a particular issue and context which suggests there is work to be done to address stigma and stereotypes and build knowledge and awareness there is no legislation which protects lgb persons from discrimination or hate crimes see societal norms and statutory laws 2 4 35 lgb persons face stigma discrimination harassment emotional and verbal abuse and pressure and coercion into heterosexual marriage most lgb persons do not live openly as lgb persons due to social stigma however treatment of members of the lgb community varies with those from higher economic and educated backgrounds being more likely to be open about their sexual orientation with friends and family those from poorer more rural areas particularly lesbian and bisexual women face more family pressure to conform to gender norms see societal norms 2 4 36 some families pressured lgb persons to seek treatment to cure their sexual orientation considering their children s behaviour as an early indication of them being gay see societal norms and conversion therapy 2 4 37 lgb persons frequently face discrimination in accessing employment housing and health services in order to avoid discrimination and hate crimes some members of the lgb community hide their identity see societal treatment violence and discrimination and access to services 2 4 38 there are no services such as restaurants bars shops or public spaces to socialise that cater for openly lgb people the online lgb community has however increased particularly on social media sites such as facebook which are seen as safe areas for socialising and organising dates the lgb activist community is small but increasingly assertive ngo equal ground who work for the lgb community have faced discrimination when organising events and have faced difficulties in their attempts at engaging with the government on lgb issues other lgb activists or those working for their rights have faced threats and attacks on social media or been denied registration see lgbti community and society lgbti websites and online access lgbti community and activists and government recognition and restrictions 2 4 39 the upper tribunal in lh and ip found that there is a significant population of homosexuals and other lgbt individuals in sri lanka in particular in colombo and that while there is more risk for lesbian and bisexual women in rural areas because of the control exercised by families on unmarried women and sex workers in the cities it will be a question of fact whether for a particular individual the risk reaches the international protection standard and in particular whether it extends beyond their home area para 123 4 2 4 40 in general the level of societal discrimination and abuse faced by lgb persons in sri lanka is not sufficiently serious by its nature and repetition as to amount to persecution or serious harm however decision makers must consider whether there are particular factors relevant to the person including their ethnic or religious background socio economic factors age and family background which might make the treatment serious by its nature or repetition see also the country policy and information notes on sri lanka minority religious groups and sri lanka tamil separatism 2 4 41 if a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not if it is concluded that a material reason for the person living discreetly on their return would be a fear of the persecution which would follow if they were to live openly then other things being equal their application should be accepted each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return 2 4 42 for further guidance on assessing risk see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 4 43 decision makers must also refer to the asylum instructions on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim and gender identity issues in the asylum claim e societal treatment of transgender and intersex persons 2 4 44 transgender persons face threats harassment and stigma from the community and owing to their increased visibility are more likely to face discrimination in access to services such as housing employment and health care see societal treatment violence and discrimination 2 4 45 transgender persons could face a risk of ill treatment at the hands of their family who may use physical and emotional violence as punishment to force gender conformity some families may pressure individuals to undergo conversion therapy in an attempt to get them to conform to gender norms see societal norms and conversion therapy 2 4 46 the upper tribunal in lh and ip found that there is a significant population of homosexuals and other lgbt individuals in sri lanka in particular in colombo and that while there is more risk for transgender individuals and sex workers in the cities it will be a question of fact whether for a particular individual the risk reaches the international protection standard and in particular whether it extends beyond their home area para 123 4 2 4 47 the level and frequency of discrimination and violence faced by transgender persons may differ according to their socio economic status and or geographic location see societal norms 2 4 48 see also the earlier paragraph which has details of a study of societal attitudes to all lgbt people 2 4 49 in general trans persons in sri lanka face a risk of societal discrimination and violence and those who are open about their gender identity may be at risk of treatment which by its nature and repetition amounts to persecution however this may differ depending on an individual s socio economic status religion ethnic group and geographic location see also the country policy and information notes on sri lanka minority religious groups and sri lanka tamil separatism 2 4 50 cpit could find no information about the number circumstances or treatment of intersex persons there is however no reason to believe that they are treated differently from other sexual minority groups 2 4 51 if a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return 2 4 52 for further guidance on assessing risk see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 4 53 decision makers must also refer to the asylum instructions on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim and gender identity issues in the asylum claim 2 5 protection 2 5 1 where the person has a well founded fear of persecution from the state they will not in general be able to obtain protection from the authorities 2 5 2 where the person has a well founded fear of persecution from non state actors including rogue state actors decision makers must assess whether the state can provide effective protection 2 5 3 there are no legal safeguards to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity incidents of homophobia frequently go unreported due to people wanting to protect their identities police often misinterpret the laws on the basis of a person s appearance or behaviour and there have been reports of police assaulting harassing anally probing and extorting money or sexual favours from lgbti persons particularly in colombo as well as other areas see state attitudes and treatment 2 5 4 the lack of anti discrimination legislation to protect the rights of lgbti persons has meant that they have no recourse to a remedy when particular laws are used against them in a discriminatory manner such discrimination is further enabled and promoted by the continued criminalisation of same sex activity and therefore stigmatisation of lgbti persons lgbti persons who are the victims of violence or hate crimes will often not report these crimes to the police without fear that their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression will be exposed or highlighted this can lead to further discrimination and marginalization and to potential prosecution under articles 365 and 365a of the penal code see implementation and enforcement of the law 2 5 5 effective protection in individual cases is often unavailable and in general the state appears able but unwilling to offer effective protection as such the person will not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities however each case will need to be considered on its facts see official response to anti lgbti violence and pro lgbti marches gay pride 2 5 6 for further guidance on assessing the availability of state protection see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 6 internal relocation 2 6 1 where the person has a well founded fear of persecution or serious harm from the state they are unlikely to be able to relocate to escape that risk 2 6 2 where the person has a well founded fear of persecution or serious harm from a non state actor including rogue state actors decision makers should consider each case on its individual circumstances to ascertain if this is localised and could be removed by internal relocation 2 6 3 sri lanka has a total land area of 65 610 sq km and an estimated population of over 23 million the law allows for freedom of internal movement and the government has generally respected these rights although security checkpoints and roadblocks still occur in parts of the country 2 6 4 the upper tribunal in lh and ip gay men risk sri lanka cg ukut 00073 iac found that internal relocation would normally be sufficient to enable an individual to avoid the risk of serious harm persecution since risks are usually from family friends or neighbours especially for gay men particularly if they relocated to the more gay friendly cities such as colombo paragraph 119 the tribunal also held that where a risk of persecution or serious harm exists in an appellant s home area there may be an internal relocation option particularly for individuals returning via colombo from the united kingdom paragraph 123 5 2 6 5 decision makers must give careful consideration to the relevance and reasonableness of internal relocation taking full account of the individual circumstances of the particular person 2 6 6 internal relocation is not viable if it depends on the person concealing their sexual orientation and or gender identity expression in the area of relocation for fear of persecution 2 6 7 for further guidance on internal relocation see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status and the asylum instruction on sexual identity issues in the asylum claim 2 7 certification 2 7 1 where a claim is refused it is unlikely to be certifiable as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 2 7 2 for further guidance on certification see certification of protection and human rights claims under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 clearly unfounded claims country information note most sources refer to lgb persons collectively rather than individual groups the exception is usually trans persons therefore because of the way reports quoted within the country information section of this cpin have been written and set out information about lesbians has been included within sections headed lgb persons and transgender persons are usually considered separately 3 legal context section 3 updated 30 november 2021 3 1 statutory laws 3 1 1 article 12 of the constitution states that all persons are equal before the law and that no citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race religion language caste sex political opinion place of birth or any other such grounds it does not however include sexual orientation or gender identity among the grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited 3 1 2 same sex acts are a criminal offence in sri lanka even when they are consensual section 365 of the penal code states that whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be punished with fine and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for injuries caused to such person 3 1 3 section 365a of the penal code further states that any person who in public or private commits or is a party to the commission of or procures or attempts procure the commission by any person of any act of gross indecency with another person shall he guilty of an offence and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person 3 1 4 the australian government s department for foreign affairs and trade s dfat country report for 2019 the 2019 dfat report noted that sections 365 and 365 a of the penal code make it a criminal offence to engage respectively in carnal intercourse against the order of nature and acts of gross indecency these are commonly understood to apply to sexual acts between same sex individuals and can attract sentences of up to 10 years prison and a fine 3 1 5 the us state department s country report on human rights practices covering events in 2020 stated the law criminalizes consensual same sex sexual conduct between adults those convicted of engaging in same sex sexual activity in private or in public face 10 years imprisonment antidiscrimination laws do not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity 3 1 6 according to an equal ground publication called my rights my responsibility published in january 2020 this law is inherently problematic for several reasons it fails to define what amounts to against the order of nature does not provide direction as to what qualifies as gross indecency and fails to indicate the distinction between public and private the lack of legal interpretations allows law enforcement to abuse the powers given to them by virtue of these laws to arrest detain or harass persons of the lgbtiq community by wilfully misinterpreting the laws and its intentions sections 365 and 365a specifically speak about consenting sexual relations and does not limit it to same sex acts 3 1 7 the report continued in fact the section includes both heterosexual and same sex acts alike and apply to any sexual act between persons if such an act falls within the interpretation of against the order of nature and or is grossly indecent 3 1 8 an october 2020 article published by groundviews by shihara maduwage media and communications officer at equal ground explained according to section 365 sexual intercourse needs to occur for it to be constituted as a crime in the eyes of the law 365a on the other hand is more ambiguous the term gross indecency can be interpreted in different ways and does not necessarily mean that a sexual act needs to take place for a charge to be placed in other words a simple act such as holding of hands by a same sex couple in public can be constituted as an act of indecency and they can be arrested this means that the police are free to judge what constitutes as gross indecency and arrest individuals whether they are lgbtiq persons or not further in both these provisions whether the acts are consensual or not is not taken into account 3 2 trans persons 3 2 1 there are no recent sources which give information on laws directly concerning trans persons see sources consulted in the bibliography however section 399 of the penal code states a person is said to cheat by personation if he cheats by pretending to be some other person or by knowingly substituting one person for another or representing that he or any other person is a person other than he or such other person really is amnesty international and world political review noted that this law has been used to target trans persons on the basis that they are pretending to be a different gender with the malicious intent of cheating others 3 2 2 a joint parallel report to the un committee on the elimination of discrimination against women of 2017 regarding sri lanka s protection of the rights of lbti persons by kaleidoscope human rights foundation and equal ground sri lanka observed ransgender persons in sri lanka often have a difficult time obtaining official documentation that reflects their preferred name and gender this means that transgender persons are effectively prevented from accessing an accurate national identity card or passport 3 2 3 a report for the un committee on economic social and cultural rights regarding violations against lgbtiq people compiled by equal ground and the center for international human rights cihr dated may 2017 stated sri lanka fails to respect the gender identity of transgender people by failing to enact into law an administrative procedure whereby transgender individuals can obtain upon simple request identity documents that match their name and gender identity at present in order to obtain revised identity documents transgender individuals must undergo psychiatric evaluation hormone therapy and surgical treatments which may or may not be wanted and if wanted may not be available due to issues of access and cost as a result many transgender individuals have not been able to obtain national identity cards and other official documents that accurately reflect their name and gender identity leaving them vulnerable to humiliation discrimination harassment and the possibility of violence at each of the many times in daily life when such documents must be presented 3 2 4 the international lesbian gay bisexual trans and intersex association ilga noted in their trans legal mapping report recognition before the law published in november 2017 that in order to change a person s sex on their birth certificate they can obtain a gender recognition certificate gic issued by the ministry of health nutrition and indigenous medicine however the gic is only issued after the person receives psychiatric diagnosis of transsexualism based on the international classification of disease 10th revision is referred for hormone and surgical treatment and undergoes treatment in accordance to the world professional association of transgender health s standards of care this is only available for those over 18 years of age 3 2 5 in a letter dated 27 august 2018 the british high commission in colombo stated that individuals are now able to have their change of gender recognised a gender recognition certificate grc can be applied for which then enables the issuance of a new passport and national identity card the british high commission colombo met someone who has gone through this process and who advised that it was handled in a relatively short period of time the only drawback is that the new passport carries an endorsement that states that the bearer is a transgender person whose previous passport was issued under such name and such gender marker 3 3 intersex 3 3 1 cpit was unable in the sources consulted to find information on laws relating to intersex persons in sri lanka see bibliography 3 4 other legal provisions affecting lgbti persons 3 4 1 in december 2019 amnesty international noted that the vagrants ordinance a 178 year old law has been used to disproportionately target lgbti people allowing the police to take them into custody and even put them in prison to extort or harass them however this source does not provide evidence as to the prevalence of this continuing 3 4 2 according to an equal ground publication called my rights my responsibility published in january 2020 section 353 of the penal code relating to abduction is also used against individuals in same sex relationships especially targeting lesbians in a similar manner the vagrants ordinance no 4 of 1841 is also used to disproportionately target and punish community members the intention of this archaic law is to punish those deemed to be rogues and vagabonds behaving in an idle and disorderly manner section 07 of the vagrants ordinance is commonly used to arrest members of the community for soliciting and acts of public indecency 4 state attitudes and treatment section 4 updated 30 november 2021 4 1 implementation and enforcement of the law 4 1 1 attorney at law dushantha kularathne told sri lanka brief in january 2017 that homosexuality in sri lanka is definitely an offence but conceded that it is indeed open to interpretation homosexuality among other things comes under unnatural offences or acts of a sexual nature that go against nature as per section 365 of the penal code according to kularathne however no cases have been reported of anyone actually being prosecuted for being gay in other words the law exists but it s not implemented not exactly says kularathne i can t say that it s not implemented it can be implemented it s just that our courts of law and our police officers don t go up to the extent of implementing it as it is as it s set out in the law he said when asked for any examples kularathne said that although he has not heard of anyone been prosecuted solely for being gay there have been cases in high court for unnatural offences that included acts of a homosexual nature carried out without consent but with consent i have not seen a single case to date that is very unlikely to happen those sort of prosecutions never happen said kularathne not that it cannot happen it can he hastened to add but not to my knowledge 4 1 2 an article published by the wire in january 2017 noted sri lanka s cabinet rejected a proposal to end discrimination based on sexual orientation because it could legitimise homosexuality which is illegal on the island a government minister said on wednesday january 18 health minister rajitha senaratne said the cabinet had refused to endorse a provision in a proposed human rights plan that would have undermined the code there was a provision referring to the sexual orientation of individuals and we clearly said it was not acceptable said senaratne who is also the government spokesman the government is against homosexuality but we will not prosecute anyone for practising it the minister said adding that the island s conservative buddhist clergy was also opposed to the provision he said the proposed national human rights action plan included a provision to remove discrimination based on sexual orientation the article added rights activists say although there have been no known prosecutions in recent decades article 365 of the penal code is discriminatory and stigmatises homosexuality 4 1 3 the sri lanka brief in january 2017 reported that a statement by the national peace council in response to the government s decision not to proceed with legal reform that decriminalizes homosexuality said we note that same sex relations are rarely if ever prosecuted in the sri lankan courts 4 1 4 a report for the un committee on economic social and cultural rights regarding violations against lgbtiq people compiled by equal ground and the center for international human rights cihr dated may 2017 stated sri lanka continues to criminalize adult consensual same sex sexual conduct this leads to arbitrary arrests and detentions police harassment and acts of extortion 4 1 5 the women and media collective report disrupting the binary code experiences of lgbt sri lankans online published in december 2017 noted that ue to the generally private contexts in which most sexual acts take place sections 365 and 365a are nearly ineffective against the criminalised acts themselves still even without enforcement the laws act to suppress the identities and relationships of people with alternative sexual orientation and or gender identities 4 1 6 in a letter dated 27 august 2018 the british high commission in colombo stated that same sex relations are illegal but the fco is not aware of any prosecutions there have been no reports of those identifying as lgbt having their homes hotel rooms raided by police 4 1 7 in reference to the 2018 performance report of the sri lanka police a report submitted to parliament to measure police effectiveness against objectives being gay is considered a vice which is defined as offences that impact adversely on morality and well being which is expected from the society the report reveals that under this provision the police prosecuted 33 men for homosexuality in 2016 6 in 2017 and 9 in 2018 however the details surrounding these offences including whether the cases were between consenting same sex adults are not known 4 1 8 furthermore official police reports show that in 2019 710 cases of unnatural offences grave sexual abuse were recorded of which 699 were pending at years end and in 2020 677 cases were reported of which 665 were pending at years end the 2019 performance report of the sri lanka police did not include any information on arrests or prosecutions of lgbti persons however the figures again do not provide details of the offences or a breakdown of how many of the cases recorded were between consensual same sex adults cpit could not find information pertaining to how many men or woman have been prosecuted for their sexuality if at all since 2018 in the sources consulted see bibliography 4 1 9 an october 2020 article published by groundviews by shihara maduwage media and communications officer at equal ground stated in relation to these figures this also shows that the legal system does not take consent nor the age of consent into account when considering sexual relations among same sex adults ironically while the report does distinguish between cases of consensual same sex sexual relations and cases of sexual abuse it does dedicate a separate section to record cattle theft this highlights the vague imprecise and unclear nature of sri lanka s laws criminalising same sex sexual relations among consenting adults leaving ample room for the police to abuse these laws and use them to target the lgbtiq community 4 1 10 amnesty international considered in december 2019 that despite every citizen having their fundamental right to equality protected under article 12 of the constitution lgbti individuals continue to be harassed marginalized and abused on the basis of their real or perceived gender identity and or sexual orientation 4 1 11 the ussd report covering 2020 stated although prosecutions were rare human rights organizations reported police used the threat of arrest to assault harass and sexually and monetarily extort lgbti individuals 4 1 12 although the law does not criminalise being gay lesbian or having any particular sexual orientation equal ground noted in their january 2020 publication my rights my responsibility that there have been incidents reported where the police has arrested lgbtiq individuals using threat of these laws for socializing in public 4 1 13 an october 2020 article published by groundviews by shihara maduwage media and communications officer at equal ground stated in september a local newspaper revealed that the fort magistrate s court was set to sentence two men who had confessed to engaging in same sex sexual relations the news garnered quite a bit of attention and stirred up controversy however this is nothing new the police repeatedly persecute the lgbtiq community in sri lanka using several sections in the penal code primarily sections 365 and 365a in a facebook post lgbtiq activist and lawyer aritha wickramasinghe highlighted another case where the police had arrested three gay men in a hotel room in colombo in 2019 according to mr wickramasinghe the men were not engaging in sexual relations but they are being prosecuted for same sex sexual relations because they had condoms in their wallets 4 1 14 the same article further noted the existence of these anti lgbtiq laws coupled together with their murky and vague nature enables the police and lawmakers to enforce these laws as they see fit anecdotal evidence shows that most of such cases are not even brought to courts instead the police uses the threat of arrest to intimidate lgbtiq individuals often to solicit bribes in addition the trauma of such experiences prevents victims from reporting police abuse harassment and undue arrests what this means is that since most lgbtiq individuals fear the police more than the courts these laws impose a power imbalance and allows the very people who are meant to protect the law to break it 4 1 15 on 6 august 2021 the morning a sri lankan news source reported this past week a video clip was shared widely on social media of a counsellor being discriminatory against the lgbt community at a training session with the sri lanka police in kandy the video featured counsellor ama dissanayake inciting her audience to declare loudly that they as parents do not wish for their children to fall prey to a homosexual amongst other things she goes on to also claim that if everyone was to engage in same sex relationships then you or i won t be here as a man and woman must come together to procreate 4 1 16 the report continued we reached out to lawyer and iprobono equality director aritha wickramasinghe with regards to this matter where a counsellor is making such harmful statements at a sri lanka police training session wickramasinghe stated it s a training given to the sri lanka police that is spreading misinformation discrimination and hate against a marginalised community so the police could be in violation of the right to equality and the non discrimination provisions as this is their training programme he added the attorney general has held on several occasions that discrimination against lgbt individuals violates the right to equality under article 12 and the freedom from discrimination under article 12 1 of the constitution sharing further about the duty that befalls the sri lanka police he added the sri lanka police have a responsibility to uphold the constitutional rights of citizens including when conducting their training because their training has a direct impact on how they conduct their duties he further noted lgbt individuals risk becoming victimised and persecuted because of this training and this training proves that homophobia is being institutionalised in police education 4 1 17 on 4 august 2021 the colombo gazette sri lanka s leading news website reported in relation to counsellor ama dissanayake s comments that the government says discussions are still ongoing with regards to lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt rights in sri lanka cabinet co spokesman keheliya rambukwella said that while discussions are ongoing with regards to lgbt rights constitutionally it is not recognized as far as the constitution of sri lanka goes it is not permitted but there are discussions ongoing this subject has been discussed over and over again but right now it is not legalized he said however he said he was not aware if the police are acting against any lgbt activities there are representations made from various quarters it has not been completely ruled out nor has it been accepted he said the minister was responding to a question raised by daily mirror at a post cabinet press conference over a video shared on social media showing a counsellor discriminating against the lgbt community at a training session with the police 4 1 18 in november 2021 a news article by the sri lankan daily mirror reported that ten civil society activists have filed a writ petition in the court of appeal challenging the ever rising abuse harassment and discrimination against individuals of the lesbian gay bisexual transgender intersex and questioning lgbtiq community at the hands of the police the petitioners are seeking a writ of prohibition preventing police from conducting training sessions lectures or seminars which dehumanize and discriminate against the lgbtiq community in the country they have cited inspector general of police c d wickramarathna ama dissanayake a counsellor and psychologist who conducted a training program at the police auditorium in kandy and deputy inspector general of police chandana alahakoon as respondents the petitioners state that according to an island wide survey conducted by the petitioners in 2020 2021 titled mapping lgbtiq identities in sri lanka 12 of the total population who interviewed for the survey identified themselves as lgbtiq a projected total of 1 469 574 individuals within the projected base of persons between the ages of 18 65 in sri lanka the petitioners state that it is now common knowledge that members of the lgbtiq community face grievous prejudice in their daily lives and most concerningly that they even find themselves in situations that pose a direct threat to their lives and wellbeing at the hands of other individuals and public authorities the petitioners said the second respondent ama dissanayake was seen and heard conducting a training program at the police auditorium in kandy proclaiming to the entire audience of police officers most explicitly that homosexuals in sri lanka are predatory and inquired from the participants of concern about their children falling prey to homosexual individuals she has further stated that homosexuality is a complete affront to social and biological norms as such relationships cannot result in procreation the petitioners said the video relating to police the councillor educating and encouraging police officers to discriminate against the lgbt community has been uploaded in its entirety on the youtube channel 4 2 arrests and detention of lgb persons 4 2 1 a 2016 human rights watch hrw report stated lgbti people arrested based on their gender expression gender identity or sexual orientation are typically detained without proper cause or evidence and consequently are rarely detained for extended periods of time as a result they may have less overall exposure to police officials in detention and may experience less abuse than sri lankans arrested for other crimes 4 2 2 in november 2016 the sri lankan supreme court heard a case commonly referred to as galabada from 2003 in which an accused appellant was charged along with another accused before the magistrates court for committing an act of gross indecency between two persons in terms of section 365a of the penal code court documents show that the magistrate had found the appellant and the other accused guilty despite the intercourse being consensual and imposed a term of imprisonment of one year and imposed a fine of rs 1 500 with a default sentence of 6 months the supreme court heard all the evidence again and determined that the sentence of the one year term of imprisonment should be set aside and substituted with a sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment suspended for a period of 5 years with the supreme court stating that the offenders should be afforded an opportunity to reform themselves 4 2 3 human rights watch reported in september 2019 that some lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt people particularly those who are visibly gender non conforming face arbitrary arrest police mistreatment 4 2 4 the november 2019 dfat report noted that police have arrested individuals under these sections but no prosecutions have occurred in recent times according to local lgbti sources police use sections 365 and 365 a of the penal code or the vagrants ordinance which empowers authorities to detain people considered to be loitering in public to threaten harass extort money and sexual favours and arbitrarily arrest and detain lgbti individuals 4 2 5 equal ground noted in their january 2020 publication my rights my responsibility that law enforcement is known for its culture of arbitrary arrests and detention and the wilful misinterpretation of these laws allow them to easily target the lgbtiq community in short the lgbtiq community remains fearful of a police force that is known for a culture of intolerance and abuse towards them 4 2 6 the 2020 ussd report noted that on october 20 human rights watch and lgbtq rights ngo equal ground said in a statement that authorities had subjected at least seven persons to forced physical examinations including forced anal and vaginal examination since 2017 in an attempt to provide proof of homosexual conduct lgbtq rights advocates said that authorities abused six defendants detained for male homosexual conduct following their arrest in october 2019 this included whipping them with wires and courts ordering three of the men to undergo hiv tests without their consent the results of which were made public in court one defendant said that after the police severely whipped him they forced him to undergo an anal examination in another case a man was threatened that a choice to reject an anal exam could be used against him in a potential prosecution 4 2 7 in october 2020 gay star news a news website focused on issues related to the global lgbti community also reported on the case of six men who were detained and mistreated a lawyer revealed he had defended six men in the last 12 months accused of gay sex this remains illegal in sri lanka with a punishment of up to 10 years in jail and fines the men say the authorities whipped them with wires before making them have anal probe tests the court ordered three of the men to also have hiv tests without their consent 4 2 8 according to the freedom house freedom in the world report 2021 covering events in 2020 lgbt people face some official harassment a rarely enforced article of the penal code prescribes up to 10 years in prison for same sex sexual activity 4 3 arrests and detentions of trans persons 4 3 1 the 2016 hrw report stated ajith rohana senior superintendent of police of colombo north told human rights watch that he was aware of concerns that transgender people have expressed about police mistreatment specifically he acknowledged that police have arrested people for loitering in a public place and carrying condoms he further noted that police occasionally arrested transgender people for cheating by personation which is illegal under section 399 of the penal code when this happened transgender people were generally taken to a police station for questioning and held there for five to six hours he said in addition some transgender people reported verbal abuse from police officers rohana said that the national police training curriculum has addressed some of these concerns since 2011 initially incorporating them into refresher courses for advanced officers and now introducing such concerns to new officers 4 3 2 the same report cited incidents where two transgender women one from colombo and the other from jaffna had been arrested for cheating by personation 4 3 3 kajal a south asian magazine reported in an article dated march 2018 that public spaces in sri lanka are heavily policed for decency and lgbtq people face arrest or extortion if they are caught 4 3 4 the 2019 dfat report noted that transgender individuals particularly individuals who are biologically male but have transitioned to female by virtue of being more visibly identifiable are considered particularly vulnerable 4 3 5 an equal ground publication called my rights my responsibility published in january 2020 noted that section 399 of the penal code is frequently misused to abuse and arrest transgender individuals by the police because their gender expression do not match the gender stated on their national identification documents wrongfully claiming that it is cheating by personation which is a definition adopted by law enforcement contrary to the intention of and the definition in law additionally the law does not consider whether or not the impersonation is of a real or imaginary person 4 3 6 in october 2020 gay star news reported on one instance concerning mistreatment of a transgender man the lawyer also said that in 2019 police forced a transgender man to undergo a so called virginity test to do this a judicial medical officer inserted two fingers inside the man s vagina the police attempted to prosecute the man for same sex conduct but a magistrate dismissed the case the court recognized the trans man s gender recognition certificate and his marriage to a cisgender woman as valid 4 3 7 according to the 2020 ussd report transgender persons continued to face arbitrary detention 4 4 arrests and detentions of intersex persons 4 4 1 cpit was unable in the sources consulted to find information on arrests and detentions of intersex persons in sri lanka see bibliography 4 5 official discrimination and harassment 4 5 1 a report for the un committee on economic social and cultural rights regarding violations against lgbtiq people compiled by equal ground and the center for international human rights cihr dated may 2017 stated the lack of any constitutional protection or anti discrimination laws or policies has exposed lgbtiq individuals to pervasive discriminatory treatment in all aspects of daily life including employment housing health care education and law enforcement 4 5 2 the dfat report for 2019 noted that equal ground in its 2017 mapping study found that 46 7 per cent of lgbti people experienced police harassment lgbti victims of abuse and harassment including by the police are generally unwilling to file complaints due to safety concerns and a reluctance to bring attention to their sexual orientation meaning their incidence goes largely unreported 4 5 3 in june 2019 groundviews reported that emergency has serious implications for lgbtqia or queer sri lankans in the immediate term for a community that already faces harassment and violence by security forces while navigating their daily lives the spectre of increased security checks and procedures is daunting this is particularly acute for transgender sri lankans who ordinarily face higher scrutiny because their official identification documents may not match their gender identity and presentation 4 5 4 amnesty international also reported in october 2019 that lgbti people routinely face harassment and discrimination at the hands of the police and other state officials 4 5 5 an equal grounds publication called my rights my responsibility published in january 2020 stated that law enforcement is known for its culture of arbitrary arrests and detention and the wilful misinterpretation of these laws allow them to easily target the lgbtiq community the tumultuous relationship between the police and the lgbtiq community is also evident in the way police officers hurl homophobic slurs at these individuals often in very public places ponnaya faggot come here samanalaya butterfly derogatively used to mean queer or pansy where did you go when such abuse if perpetrated by the same institutions that are meant to protect the peace and security of all citizens it is no surprise that lgbtiq individuals hesitate to actually lodge complaints of the violence and discrimination they are subject to in short the lgbtiq community remains fearful of a police force that is known for a culture of intolerance and abuse towards them 4 5 6 a recent research project undertaken by the asia pacific transgender network aptn in 2020 and published in march 2021 looked at conversion therapy practices ctps being implemented against trans and gender diverse people in a variety of asian countries including sri lanka the report noted that trans and gender diverse citizens as well as cisgender non heteronormative citizens especially those from underprivileged and socio economically deprived backgrounds face considerably high levels of transphobic and homophobic violence from law enforcement agencies in a recent mapping lgbtiq identities in sri lanka exercise by equal ground where qualitative 8 focus group discussions in 4 districts and quantitative national survey covering all 25 districts with a sample size of 4500 data collection techniques were utilised it was found that in a recent mapping lgbtiq identities in sri lanka exercise by equal ground where qualitative 8 focus group discussions in 4 districts and quantitative national survey covering all 25 districts with a sample size of 4500 data collection techniques were utilised it was reported that the survey results show that 12 of the total population interviewed for the survey identified themselves as lgbtiq which can be projected to a total of 1 469 574 individuals within the projected base of people between the ages of 18 65 in sri lanka 4 6 official response to anti lgbti violence 4 6 1 outright international following its study of interviewing 33 lesbians bisexual women and trans people lbt published its findings in may 2016 this research thus suggests that incidents of physical violence both in the public and private spheres remain under reported and undocumented and that lbt people who experience physical violence rarely seek compensation redress or even counselling from mental health service providers who work with women who have experienced violence such as domestic violence programs or support groups when they were the victims of violence in a public space such as on the street at community gatherings in public transport or at the workplace and targeted for their gender non conformity or sexual orientation there was reluctance to report the violence for fear of being personally exposed as lbt even when the crime is not related to their sexuality or gender identity lbt individuals feel vulnerable because of a penal code provision that can be read to criminalize adult consensual same sex sexual activity in fact some of the lbt people we spoke to specifically cited both section 365a of the penal code and the vagrants ordinance as reasons used to target them for arrest and harassment police in sri lanka are generally perceived by the lbt community as dangerous a reason for this perception is that police officers use blackmail and violence against people who they perceive to be homosexual bisexual or transgender in this context interviews revealed that lbt persons doubted the possibility of getting redress for violence by police additionally the court system in sri lanka is generally not victim friendly court hearings are open to the public which deters most people from reporting violence they experience to the police so as to avoid going to court they fear that their sexual orientation and gender identity could be exposed in open court when the reasons for the violence are revealed furthermore as mentioned earlier in this chapter the human rights commission the police commission the public services commission and the judicial services commission are not trusted to function independently since these commissions are made up of presidential appointees 4 6 2 in july 2016 delegates from a uk home office fact finding mission to sri lanka the 2016 uk ffm met with a representative from equal ground eg a non profit organisation seeking human and political rights for lgbt community of sri lanka the uk ffm delegates asked equal ground whether the government police or judiciary provided lgbti persons with security and justice but were told no they do not but during the 2016 pride celebration there were a lot of threats from sinhala buddhist nationalists particularly towards a public event equal ground eg was planning to hold to publicise colombo pride 2016 eg made a complaint to a police station about the threats and plain clothes police officers were sent to protect them the police took no action against the buddhist nationalists the buddhist nationalists never turned up but all threats are taken seriously on an individual basis police do not protect in fact they are the main perpetrators of violence and discrimination against lgbti persons 4 6 3 a report for the un committee on economic social and cultural rights regarding violations against lgbtiq people compiled by equal ground and the center for international human rights cihr dated may 2017 stated sri lanka continues to criminalize adult consensual same sex sexual conduct this leads to arbitrary arrests and detentions police harassment and acts of extortion reluctance on the part of lgbtiq people to report crimes to the police and more generally the perceived legitimization of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity 4 6 4 in march 2019 the sri lanka daily mirror reported that speaking to the daily mirror lgbtiq rights activist rosanna flamer caldera said that people have erroneously made up their minds against females and the lgbtiq community in sri lanka she stated that there is too much impunity in sri lanka and there is no legal action being taken against those who harass women and lgbtiq people which ultimately contributes to such incidents 4 6 5 amnesty international noted in a report dated 7 december 2019 discussing the release of a comic book detailing the experiences of four lgbti people that the stories that highlight the experiences show the alarming and various ways the police handle cases that involve lgbti people often treating them like criminals when they are the ones being victimized individuals in sri lanka continue to face discrimination abuse and a complete lack of protection for their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity 4 6 6 dfat noted in november 2019 that according to local sources police protection of lgbti individuals at public events such as lgbti marches has increased since 2015 local sources identified extremist buddhist and muslim groups as posing particular threats to the lgbti community 4 6 7 a recent research project undertaken by the asia pacific transgender network aptn in 2020 and published in march 2021 looked at conversion therapy practices ctps being implemented against trans and gender diverse people in a variety of asian countries including sri lanka the research involved 15 interviews and interactions with members of the trans community including lgbti community leaders and human rights professionals the report noted as a result of the cultural practice of never questioning one s elders the interviews helped shed light on the fact that there exists a great deal of reluctance among trans and gender diverse people affected by ctps to file cases against their perpetrators the fear of further violence from law enforcement ill treatment and systemic discrimination at the hands of the judiciary and further repercussions and the transphobia that may follow if their stories were to become public are among the reasons that keep many trans and gender diverse people from making complaints or taking legal action against perpetrators of ctps despite the lack of clear legislation that protects the rights of trans and gender diverse citizens certain mechanisms such as lodging complaints at the sri lanka medical council remain open to trans and gender diverse people victimised by ctps respondents repeatedly highlighted the clear need for protective legislation that identifies the harmful consequences of conversion practices and bans them in tandem strong awareness raising campaigns and multi pronged efforts to challenge transphobia homophobia and intersexphobia are an absolute priority in lankan society homophobic and transphobic colonial era laws are still being used to promote conversion practices among both non het and non cis citizens by instilling fear in them and by subjecting them to explicit threats of prosecution overall major gaps remain in the legal protections for trans and gender diverse citizens 4 7 official views on sexual orientation and gender identity 4 7 1 the 2019 ilga report on state sponsored homophobia stated that in 2013 the then president mahinda rajapaksa denied a spousal visa to the norwegian ambassador s same sex wife in a discussion with representatives from the bodhu bala sena he explained that the country s sinhala buddhist identity would come to an end if we allow these actions in a january 2017 interview the minister for justice wijeyadasa rajapaksa basing his argument on the religious nature of sri lankan society said regarding 365 and 365a under no circumstance are we going to change that law elsewhere he called homosexuality a mental disorder a comment that sparked public outcry in august 2017 he said that lesbianism equals sadism and advocated the rape of lesbians by convicted sexual offenders to cure them he added lesbianism is at least an act of gross indecency and unnatural 4 7 2 the same report also noted in november 2018 the sri lanka president accused his political opponent of rejecting national values for a butterfly life and claimed that his decisions were led by a butterfly caucus the sinhalese term for butterfly is used as a derogatory term alluding to lgbt people this led to a protest in colombo by lgbt activists protesting the president s insidious references degrading the lgbtiq community as well as a media statement condemning the president s statements 4 7 3 the 2019 dfat report stated local sources told dfat that the current government is more open than the previous one to the concerns of the lgbti community the government accepted recommendations to combat discrimination against lgbti individuals as part of its most recent universal periodic review at the hrc november 2017 including specific recommendations to amend sections 365 and 365 a of the penal code although it rejected recommendations to decriminalise same sex conduct a pride parade has been held in colombo since 2005 albeit in a low key manner because of security concerns the colombo pride parade was not held in 2019 following the easter sunday terrorist attacks although a festival of other lgbti events did proceed the media discusses lgbti issues openly and some lgbti individuals have adopted a high profile particularly in colombo 4 7 4 despite these instances on 01 march 2021 sri lanka president gotabaya rajapaksa tweeted today is zerodiscriminationday as the president of ika i am determined to secure everybody s right to live life with dignity regardless of age gender sexuality race physical appearance and beliefs 4 7 5 in response to president rajapaksa s statement prominent lgbt sri lankan human rights activist and lawyer aritha wickramasinghe posted on social media site facebook commending the tweet in a powerful message today president gotabaya rajapaksa announced that he was determined to secure everybody s right to a dignified life irrespective of various grounds including gender and sexual orientation president rajapaksa becomes the first head of state in sri lanka to openly acknowledge the rights of lgbt sri lankans a remarkable statement he stands in stark contrast to his predecessor president maithripala sirisena who openly espoused homophobia and used terms like butterflies to ridicule lgbt people this was despite being elected on a platform of inclusion thank you mr president for acknowledging our right to a dignified life free from discrimination 4 8 ombudsman complaints mechanism s 4 8 1 according to an equal ground publication called my rights my responsibility published in january 2020 which focuses on the rights and laws that affect the lgbtiq community in sri lanka there is no specific legal device to address the rights and protections of the lgbtiq community and therefore common law applies however the sri lankan constitution grants fundamental rights fr to all citizens and these rights should not be violated other than in exceptional situations specifically mentioned in the constitution and within the emergency laws of the country which allows specific restrictions 4 8 2 the article went on to note that any action violating your rights in chapter iii of the constitution which lists your fundamental rights is grounds enough for you to file a fr petition in the supreme court 4 8 3 the same article also noted that complaints can also be lodged with the human rights commission of sri lanka the national authority for the protection of victims of crimes and witnesses and the national police commission 5 societal norms section 5 updated 30 november 2021 5 1 overview 5 1 1 according to the cia world factbook the estimated population of sri lanka in july 2021 was 23 044 123 the number of lgbti persons in sri lanka could be as high as 5 of the population according to a daily mirror sri lanka an online article published in january 2018 the article noted a mapping study recently conducted by equal ground reported that 19 6 percent of people over 18 living in colombo matara nuwara eliya galle identify as lgbt this may seem a rather large proportion and the report does mention that this number may be slightly skewed for the simple reason that the enumerators conducting the mapping were lgbtiq friendly and therefore approached more lgbtiq persons for the study it also mentions that lgbt persons felt more comfortable with these enumerators and therefore felt free to identify themselves 5 1 2 rosanna flamer caldera the executive director of equal ground the main lgbt organisation in sri lanka described in the daily mail article the situation for lgbt people sri lanka noting that stigma and discrimination forced lgbt persons underground making it difficult to determine accurate numbers of those who identify as lgbt 5 1 3 in a recent mapping lgbtiq identities in sri lanka exercise by equal ground where qualitative 8 focus group discussions in 4 districts and quantitative national survey covering all 25 districts with a sample size of 4500 data collection techniques were utilised it was reported that the survey results show that 12 of the total population interviewed for the survey identified themselves as lgbtiq which can be projected to a total of 1 469 574 individuals within the projected base of people between the ages of 18 65 in sri lanka among them 8 identified themselves as bisexual 0 5 as gay 0 5 as lesbian 1 as transgender and 2 as other the highest number of those identifying themselves as lgbtiq was found between the ages of 18 29 5 1 4 the report further noted that 11 of lgbtiq respondents had faced some form of abuse or discrimination due to their sogie compared to the 8 of non lgbtiq respondents the most common challenges faced were verbal abuse assault discrimination and harassment by the police by family and or at work 5 1 5 roar media reported in 2018 that younger lgbtiq activists tell us that revealing their true gender identity is easier in colombo the community is larger and the general populace are more tolerant as a result 5 1 6 the same article also noted however that according to tanya the acting executive director of heart to heart lanka it is still difficult for people from poorer families to come out find jobs or be treated with dignity it s very hard in reality it s quite alright for the posher colombo 07 people they can be doctors and lawyers and such the poorer people have it harder and are often mistreated which is why they leave their families or live a life of secrecy it s also really hard to find work thanks to societal perceptions which again is why you get many trans people who are engaged in sex work or who are dancers she added when roar media queried as to why the trans community claimed colombo to be more open and accepting if it wasn t so tanya told us that it was because where most of the trans community converge there s more of a network here and there are a lot more facilities than there are outstation you do get a lot of closeted people in colombo as well but you also get a good support system you won t see hundreds of us in public though because we re a relatively small community in a country with an already small population it s not like in america or india and all she concluded this isn t to say that there is enough trans visibility in colombo the activists tell us that transmen have a harder time revealing their gender identity 5 1 7 in a letter dated 27 august 2018 the british high commission in colombo stated that there remains significant social exclusion for being lgbt which is perpetuated by stigma cultural taboos and conservative traditional and religious attitudes 5 1 8 the 2019 dfat report noted that reliable figures on the size of sri lanka s lgbti community are not available equal ground a local ngo advocating for lgbti rights estimates that between 5 and 10 per cent of sri lanka s total population could be lgbti according to local sources the lgbti community faces threats harassment and forced heterosexual marriage from family and members of the community some middle and upper class educated and urban sri lankans are open about their sexuality within their family and community circles however risks are higher for lesbian and bisexual rural women due to more traditional familial expectations and values many lgbti individuals especially muslims hide their identity to avoid harassment local sources told dfat that some families pressure lgbti individuals to seek treatment to cure their homosexuality at dedicated profit making centres or through witchcraft local sources told dfat that hostility toward lgbti individuals was across the board and was not confined to a particular ethnic group or geographic area colombo western province kandy central province and galle southern province are considered more tolerant of sexual orientation relative to other parts of sri lanka some lgbti individuals have chosen to relocate to these centres which have larger lgbti communities and support networks according to local sources anti lgbti sentiment is deeply ingrained in sri lankan culture and society particularly in rural areas the majority of sri lankans hold conservative views about sexual orientation and gender identity and many prioritise collective values over individual rights 5 1 9 a study was conducted by the social scientists association for the westminster foundation for democracy under the commonwealth equality project on the knowledge attitudes and perceptions of sri lankans about sri lankan lgbt persons in 2020 the study was comprised of a structured questionnaire available in sinhala tamil and english and was distributed among 2130 people in all of sri lanka s 25 districts the sample was composed of respondents from different genders age education and religious groups the study found that the survey revealed a mixed picture the vast majority of people think that lgbt people face discrimination violence and or abuse because they are lgbt and a majority do not agree that they should be punished however positive and negative perceptions are held depending on a particular issue and context which suggests there is work to be done to address stigma and stereotypes and build knowledge and awareness 5 1 10 the same study revealed many respondents had positive attitudes towards lgbt persons in varied contexts for instance 59 7 said they will not be ashamed to travel next to a gay or lesbian person attitudes were mixed or negative in some contexts on whether it would be shameful for a transgender person to be president of sri lanka 49 5 agreed and 48 disagreed 5 1 11 the study also highlighted positive perceptions are evident in some contexts a majority of people 72 5 said a person living life as a lgbt person should not be punished for their sexual identity 65 said a lgbt person can do a job as well as any other person and just over half 51 4 said they would support legislation to ensure the rights of lgbt persons however negative perceptions are evident in some contexts closer or more personally relevant to a respondent 59 5 said renting their house to a lgbt person would be a problem 48 6 said it would not be shameful to have a lgbt child 44 4 said it would respondents subscribe to many social prejudices against sri lankan lgbt persons for instance 51 4 said they go against my religion and 52 3 said association encourages a person to become like them although upwards of 40 disagreed 5 1 12 more key findings of the same study included the vast majority of respondents acknowledge discrimination is experienced by lgbt persons in different public and private contexts in sri lanka irrespective of the respondents awareness attitudes and perceptions of lgbt examples of percentages of respondents who said sri lankan lgbt persons are discriminated or harassed because they are lgbt persons include 89 said lgbt persons face violence and abuse on social media because they are lgbt 87 said lgbt persons face discrimination in finding rental housing and or in school because they are lgbt 69 said lgbt persons face discrimination by the police because they are lgbt 5 2 societal norms gender and sexual identity 5 2 1 in an undated page on sri lanka s customary norms religious beliefs and social practices that influence gender differentiated land rights the food and agricultural organisation of the united nations fao noted that the gender division of household labour is deeply ingrained though it is more flexible in the lower castes and classes women generally make decisions on household matters education of children and health men make other major decisions such as buying and selling of assets traditionally women engage in household work and income generation within the home and contribute to the household economy by working in family farms 5 2 2 outright international following its study of interviewing 33 lbts published its findings in may 2016 and noted that twelve out of 33 interviews highlighted the constant pressures that butch lesbians and transgender people face in having to perform and live according to culturally expected gender norms from being forced to marry to having to wear particular clothes and maintaining certain hairstyles all of which were experienced as psychological and emotional violence cultural and gender norm enforcement was also experienced as violence when interviewees were quizzed about their gender identity when using public toilets similarly some interviewees were forced to keep their sense of self a secret and not look too gay in order to keep the family reputation intact some interviewees also spoke of being denied jobs or promotions on the basis of their gender expression not looking feminine enough and losing employment because their identity cards did not match their appearance 5 2 3 according to the institute for participatory interaction in development ipid report rapid situation assessment of transgender persons in sri lanka published in december 2016 the sri lankan transgender community use the term nachchi to identify themselves similar to hijras in india which they use to recognise the male to female transgenders although generally the term transgender includes various groups including cross dressers transsexuals and gender non confirming persons some transgender persons experience a fluidity of identities 5 2 4 as specified in the human rights watch report all five fingers are not the same discrimination on grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation in sri lanka 15 august 2016 in sri lanka ideas about the way men and women should look and act are deeply entrenched those who challenge gender norms including many lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex lgbti people may face a range of abuses from private individuals that compromise the quality and safety of their daily lives and their ability to access services that are central to their realizing basic human rights the abuses experienced by transgender people are part of a broader picture of discrimination faced by gender non conforming people in sri lanka lgbti people in general may face stigma and discrimination in housing employment and health care in both the public and private sectors social standing plays a significant role in the discrimination that lgbti people face those who are poor who engage in sex work or who obviously do not adhere to rigid gender norms are most vulnerable to abuse including physical assault or arrest 5 2 5 in july 2016 delegates from a uk home office fact finding the 2016 uk ffm mission to sri lanka met with a representative from equal ground eg a non profit organisation seeking human and political rights for lgbt community of sri lanka who stated three quarters if not more of the lgbti communities in sri lanka live a double life they hide their sexual orientation quite often they are forced into heterosexual marriages some of them actually get into heterosexual marriages because they think that is the right thing to do so that it hides their sexual orientation mostly those are gay men lesbian and bisexual women are pretty much forced by families to get married to men against their will 5 2 6 a world political review article from 2017 noted that social standing plays a significant role in the discrimination that lgbti people face those who are poor who engage in sex work or who obviously do not adhere to rigid gender norms are most vulnerable to abuse 5 2 7 the women and media collective report disrupting the binary code experiences of lgbt sri lankans online published in december 2017 noted that this state of invisibility and isolation is broadly a result of sri lankan conservatism in which attitudes towards and discourses on sexuality and sexual relationships are heavily controlled by societal and cultural forces opposed to sexual and gender diversity sexual conservatism in sri lanka regulates individuals through gender roles based on a rigid male female binary construct sex is restricted by a logic of reproduction sexuality is restricted to marriage and those who pursue sexual activity outside the confines of a marriage especially women are vilified sexual issues are privatised to such an extent that discussion in the public sphere is discouraged sex education in public schools is virtually non existent and only exists in a few private schools 5 2 8 the 2019 dfat report stated that according to local lgbti sources homosexual women face added difficulties in being open about their sexuality sources told dfat

washington d c following a ruling by the u s consumer financial protection bureau cfpb u s debt collectors can now contact millions of indebted americans on social media and by text messaging while critics said the messages could be lost online or sent to the wrong recipients as well as cause invasions of privacy and the rise of new hoaxes advocates claim the change is a simple update to rules created in the 1970s the rule change which was approved by the cfpb last year during the trump administration requires creditors to contact defaulters privately meaning they can send direct messages but not post on public profiles consumers can opt out of these messages but creditors do not require permission to contact people there are no rules regarding how many messages are allowed to be sent lenders argued that this rule change was needed since the fair debt collection practices act which regulates the industry became law in 1977 and is outdated the new rule limits calls to seven per week for any particular debt but people with multiple debts may still be called dozen of times debt collectors are also limited from contacting any consumer by phone within one week of speaking to them about a specific debt in a statement mark neeb ceo of the debt collector trade group aca international said the rule change is a small step forward in modernizing communications with consumers as reported by the bbc according to cbs news the rule change could affect tens of millions of people in the united states

call on the federal government to study financial threats posed by china including recommendations for limiting the dangers within the international monetary fund and the financial stability board from growing beijing influence china linked to facebook disinformation op facebook recently published a study revealing that chinese state actors took part in a public relations campaign designed to convince publics around the world that the covid 19 pandemic did not begin in wuhan china the operation was outlined in a november report by meta facebook s new parent company on coordinated inauthentic behavior as a result a network of fake chinese facebook accounts was removed from the social media platform other fake accounts were found linked to similar operations by palestinians poles and belarusians a total of 737 fraudulent facebook accounts were killed along with 115 fake instagram accounts and 99 false facebook pages and 26 fake facebook groups facebook said the chinese influence operation involved 524 facebook accounts 20 pages and four groups all were removed the operation was detailed in a section of the report called the swiss biologist that never was produced by meta threat intelligence analyst ben nimmo mr nimmo did not respond to a request for comment according to the report the chinese operation began on july 24 when someone posing as a swiss biologist named wilson edwards claimed on facebook and twitter that the u s government was pressuring the world health organization who to blame china for the virus outbreak behind the pandemic two days after the posts hundreds of social media accounts emerged around the world echoing the false persona followed within a week by headlines claiming u s intimidation of the who in chinese state media including the communist party affiliated global times and party mouthpiece people s daily the meta report described the influence operation as a hall of mirrors exhaustively reflecting and amplifying the comments of one fake persona on the platform our investigation uncovered that almost the entire initial spread of the wilson edwards story on our platform was inauthentic the work of a multipronged largely unsuccessful influence operation that originated in china the report said the operation brought together the original fake account several hundred additional inauthentic accounts and a cluster of authentic accounts including those that belonged to employees of chinese state infrastructure companies across four continents outside these clusters only a handful of real people engaged with the operation s content the chinese operators behind the campaign sought to mask their identities but facebook online sleuths found links to government linked entities including employees of the sichuan silence information technology co ltd a chinese information security company chinese individuals linked to state infrastructure companies also took part this is the first time we have observed an operation that included a coordinated cluster of state employees to amplify itself in this way the report said the campaign has been echoed by government propaganda seeking to obscure the origins of the pandemic as emanating from china chinese state media have engaged in extensive disinformation operations citing official foreign ministry spokesmen who falsely asserted the virus originated in a u s army laboratory biden official taiwan is a model of democracy the biden administration this week is hosting an online conference aimed at promoting democracy and has included representatives from taiwan in the program a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the program defended the inclusion of the island nation in the participants we see taiwan as a leading democracy and it has a robust experience in advancing a more transparent expansive and vibrant democracy the official said it is a powerful example we also see it as a global leader in developing best practices for safeguarding against disinformation and the use of emerging technology to make governance more transparent and responsive asked about chinese government objections to including taiwan the official said the interactions with the taiwanese would be conducted under the u s one china policy the 1979 taiwan relations act and other diplomatic notes on china we think taiwan can make meaningful commitments toward the summit s objectives of countering authoritarianism fighting against corruption and advancing human rights at home and abroad the official said for those reasons taiwan has been included in the three day meeting this week that brought together government leaders and non government democracy advocates the official side stepped a reporter s question about recent chinese state media reports claiming beijing s communist system is a form of democracy we see the summit s goals as being about much more than one government the official said the chinese communist party outlet people s daily reported on wednesday that democracy is a common value of humanity and an ideal that has always been cherished by the communist party of china that was the conclusion of a government white paper published dec 4 china s ruling communist party has stated in earlier publications that china will never be governed by a western style democratic system and that the party believes democracy must be limited to the 93 million members of the ccp and its collective dictatorship under the central committee and seven member standing committee of the politburo president biden is

after a recent screening of don t look up the new netflix original from writer director adam mckay star leonardo dicaprio explained why he did this film dicaprio has long been an advocate for the environment and for years had been looking for a film to underline the message that climate change is killing this world and we need to save it but how do you make that sad message into a good movie sure there have been documentaries even popular ones but those never rarely break through a big blockbuster action movie could get that idea across too but it would likely be buried in set pieces and rock ballads finally though the oscar winner found his answer in don t look up a film that s funny without being slapstick dramatic without being melodramatic and brutally honest about the state of the world it s highly unlikely don t look up will make climate or covid deniers change their tune but it s a truly fantastic attempt to do so and in the end even if it doesn t dicaprio is part of yet another excellent smart entertaining piece of cinema it s co written and directed by mckay the big short but also anchorman and step brothers dicaprio plays dr randall mindy a michigan state professor who one night realises one of his doctoral students kate dibiasky jennifer lawrence has discovered an asteroid but not just any asteroid this one s headed directly for earth and is all but guaranteed to wipe all life off the face of the planet these are the facts and even though they re cataclysmic to say the least randall and kate know they have to tell the world that world includes president janie orlean played by meryl streep her chief of staff and son jason jonah hill a fellow scientist named dr teddy oglethorpe rob morgan and many many others played by the likes of cate blanchett timothée chalamet mark rylance melanie lynskey ron perlman ariana grande tyler perry himesh patel and more it s a cast that much like dicaprio s enthusiasm shows a near universal trust in the material and its importance unfortunately for the characters of randall and kate though the world is less trusting and they re at first met with almost total scepticism and negligence just as one might expect our world to react to news of irreversible doom slowly but surely though the message does get out there and don t look up takes several unexpected and clever twists and turns ranging from laugh out loud hilarious to completely harrowing and downright bleak meryl streep is a president with a slogan cap image netflix for a film with such dire subject matter to not just be entertaining and propulsive but also funny and smart without being preachy is a minor miracle thankfully the balancing feels almost easy in mckay s hands his cast is so beyond talented their ability to bounce off each other gives everything a very natural feel nothing is only funny or only dramatic it s all jumbled up in just the right way certain scenes are intercut edited with stock footage when there is a stronger message that needs to be conveyed and as the situation becomes increasingly dire the mckay dials back the drama to something more comforting he s five steps ahead of the audience the entire way and it works wonders as for the main characters lawrence s kate is angriest at the world and becomes the recognisable mirror for the audience especially as she s treated increasingly worse dicaprio s randall is a bit more willing to compromise his beliefs and the choice drives him into some uncomfortably darker places plus as you d expect from two a list oscar winners both navigate those arcs with nuance and grace every emotion and reaction is right where it needs to be to hold the film and characters together playing the president and her son streep and hill are basically the comic relief and have some super twisted silly scenes history might suggest that s more in hill s wheelhouse but streep hangs right alongside him reminding us that she s probably the best actress there ever was along the way mckay introduces new characters and situations that get at the idea of the world s inevitable doom in other ways too rylance is a character that s supposed to be a jeff bezos elon musk type who thinks money and technology have all the answers blanchet and perry are news hosts who try and make even the sickest news bright and sunny patel is a journalist always looking for the sensationalist angle grande is a celebrity with zero perspective and as each of these characters come in and out of randall and kate s story the audience is left to analyse their own lives and thoughts image netflix put all that together and yes don t look up is great but what takes it to a whole other level is its malleable universality after enduring nearly two years of a deadly global pandemic watching a movie about people not believing basic science and facts to their own detriment feels all too familiar and relatable however mckay wrote don t look up well before covid 19 about the ever present horrors of climate change then there s also criticisms of the media generational disconnects corporate institutions and more that it works on so many levels allows each viewer to engage with it in their own unique way and that only elevates everything happening on screen don t look up isn t going to be a movie for everyone it can be a little preachy a little awkward and a little on the nose but those are mere blips on the radar compared to the big one in the centre that adam mckay and his incredible cast have made a popcorn movie about climate change that will hopefully have an impact like the one the characters are warning everyone about it opens in select theatres now and comes to netflix december 24

tumbled to 17 02 if the investment bubble around ballard has burst it s certainly not the only company in canada s cleantech sector that witnessed huge gains in their share price early in 2021 only to see them come crashing down many analysts say it s a natural hangover from 2020 a year in which governments in europe the u s china and canada signalled plans for major emission reduction stimulus programs but some have been slow to materialize and some programs have been scrapped leaving investors focused on the companies long road to executing their ambitious plans i think realism sort of re entered this space kate charlton i think realism sort of re entered this space said kate charlton vice president of investor relations at ballard like ok let s start looking at the fundamentals let s start looking at the growth trajectory so i think there was a level setting across the sector indeed the reasons may vary but taken as a group the sheen around canada s cleantech sector disappeared in the last three quarters of the year advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content lion electric co a montreal based electric bus and truck manufacturer that has won praise and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and provincial money to build assembly plants in quebec reached 28 39 per share in june now it is trading at 12 57 per share a 55 per cent drop xebec adsorption inc a montreal clean energy company that converts methane leakage from landfills and elsewhere into renewable natural gas peaked at 11 11 per share in january it has since fallen 78 per cent to 2 45 vancouver s nano one materials corp which designs lithium ion battery anodes peaked at 6 09 per share in january then fell 47 per cent to 3 21 loop energy which like ballard designs and manufactures hydrogen fuel cell stacks debuted on the toronto stock exchange in february and was trading at 16 90 per share by march but has since dropped to 4 34 or roughly 74 per cent what binds the companies together is that each is making a product connected to the transition away from fossil fuels much of which is being driven by government policies and emission targets advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content rupert merer an analyst at national bank financial who covers several of the companies listed above plus others not mentioned said much of the share price is driven by fund flows many canadian cleantech companies are listed in the major environmental exchange traded funds which saw enormous support at key moments in late 2020 and early 2021 sector wide we saw a huge inflow of capital at the beginning of the year said merer we thought it might come back with cop26 and it really hasn t but cleantech companies listed in u s exchanges from electric vehicle makers such as tesla inc and rivian automotive inc to canada s own battery recycler li cycle holdings corp continue to see sky high premiums and trade at massive valuations in relation to their revenues if we put aside the share price performance for a moment and just look at this valuation on these companies yes the prices are down but it doesn t seem like the market is saying these companies aren t on a path to growth said merer the canadian stocks on a relative basis are actually more attractive he said given that investors are assigning lower multiples advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content still trying to tap an emerging demand for an emerging product is a difficult proposition and many analysts are trying to figure out whether the market got ahead of the company or whether the company got ahead of the market at ballard for example the company entered 2021 preparing for a groundswell of demand for its hydrogen fuel cell stacks it expanded its production capacity in british columbia by six times at a cost of roughly us 20 million meanwhile last year chief executive randy macewen spent his christmas and new year s eve quarantined alone in a guarded hotel suite in china where the company is building what he has described as the largest manufacturing facility in the world for heavy duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles capable of producing 20 000 vehicles per year at a cost of around us 67 million together the expansions cost us 87 million and the company posted us 96 million in revenue over the trailing 12 months photo by darryl dyck for national post files macewen has said the company is also hoping to reduce the costs of making its fuel cell stack and module products by 70 per cent by 2024 some analysts say the company s plan to try cut costs by achieving scale makes sense but so far the scale it s preparing for hasn t materialized advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in china it struck a joint venture with weichai motors the world s largest diesel manufacturer hoping to gain entry into the market while the chinese government has started announcing the names of regions where it will fund research into hydrogen technology and start to develop an industry chain so far it hasn t added shandong province where ballard built its plant to that list charlton the ballard spokeswoman said the company isn t worried about it but at the most recent earnings call macewen fielded five questions about china including when he expects clarity on government policies whether domestic competitors are catching up technology wise when the next sale might come there and so on he called the lack of policy clarity out of china disappointing and referred to the market as a wildcard for its growth projections but ultimately couldn t really predict when the market will pick up the company has formed many partnerships including in north america and europe all of which macewen said could soon translate into revenue i think the question is when will we see what s the linkage between when the order book starts to materialize and then subsequently revenue said macewen i think it s a year is about right advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by darryl dyck for national post files whether it s out of freefall yet isn t clear the stock dropped 13 per cent in november following its earnings calls as analysts ramped down expectations for revenues there s been sort of a shift in focus from what space are you exposed to to can you execute on the growth in this space said sean keaney an analyst with eight capital research i think that ballard as a cleantech bellwether has maybe been a lightning rod for that kind of attention investors are starting to realize that while government policies are clearly driving an energy transition it s going to take awhile said keaney recommended from editorial why calgary s new mayor wants to declare a climate emergency where are canada s green jobs a new sector slowly emerges canadian cleantech s 335 surge in financing sets up record year carbon as an untapped resource a new crop of alberta companies take on the co2 challenge in the meantime investors seem focused on execution supply chain issues have been headline news for months and merer said lion electric encountered problems obtaining enough adhesive materials to build its products and thus its works in progress inventory has been slowly building advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content at xebec the company continues to make its clean energy systems at a profit but it had to revise its guidance after it missed revenue expectations some companies such as ballard simply don t issue guidance it s been through a bubble in 2000 the original dot com bubble when it s share price surpassed 164 and then plummeted to less than a dollar and rarely broke above 5 in the ensuing two decades somehow it survived ballard has been around for longer than i have been alive

posted wednesday december 8 2021 6 48 pm tower at a joint meeting between the city of tower and the gundersen trust board the group heard from two community foundations interested in taking over management of the trust fund through conversion to a community foundation model the group also heard that the option of continuing to independently manage the trust through frandsen bank and trust was off the table the trust board needs to make a decision on the future management of the trust and any decision that is made will require court approval steve vranich sr vice president and trust officer at frandsen was not able to attend the meeting due to a family emergency but he wrote to gundersen treasurer steve wilson detailing his recommendations for the trust board i must say that after reading the letter from the quinlivan and hughes law firm and the options they outline it may be best to partner with a community foundation he wrote frandsen would still be interested in partnering with a community trust to manage investment of the assets he said some members of the trust board have indicated they would prefer to keep control over the trust and work with a local bank this option would still require the trust to seek court approval and also would require an annual audit and other attorney fees costs which are currently adding up to more than what the trust earns in interest in a year vranich said he had spoken with karl samp at the brainerd lakes area foundation they would hire us to manage the assets of your portfolio he said they have the expertise on assisting the city of tower to build and maintain the foundation and we have the expertise on investing the funds they do not invest foundation monies but hire third party investors to do so which is what our role would be the july 14 letter he was referencing was work from the quinlivan and hughes law firm hired by the trust board that outlined three options for the board to consider for the future of the assets of the trust the current legal and tax status of the trust which now totals over 900 000 has been the focus of the trust board this past year as they work to create a new framework that would allow for the trust to earn more income the purpose of the trust was to create income to contribute to the city and its residents in perpetuity the attorney s review of the trust brought into focus questions about how the trust is currently being operated as a government trust and the fact the trust had never applied for 501 c 3 non profit status there is still uncertainty as to the exact legal status of the gundersen trust attorney brad hanson wrote to the trust board in addition investment restrictions placed on the trust s assets in a 2018 court order meant the investment options for the money were severely limited to options that currently and expected in the near future are earning almost negligible amounts of interest income even before the presentation by two community foundation representatives some trust board members had reservations about moving the funds to a community foundation once you sign it away it is gone said trust board member dena suihkonen i don t think the gundersen family gave it to us for something future generations can t decide on you are taking away future generations rights to possibly come up with a better way it is very clear in the historical record that this was something given for the perpetual benefit of the city said wilson it was clear that when they set up the initial court order they wanted a permanent endowment switching the money to a community foundation model does not change this wilson noted and the authority for spending the proceeds would still be at the local level not decided by the community foundation but others noted that the local group does not have the expertise to be managing this fund on its own we can t match the investment brains that do this seven days a week said trust board member and city council member sheldon majerle and if it isn t in a foundation we need to deal with the irs and auditors trust board chair jesse gornick said the board might have to look into hiring someone as their board treasurer if they choose to continue managing the fund themselves another expense and this also wouldn t guarantee a long term outlook for the investments a community foundation approach can create a stable source of investment profits guaranteeing a specific return on the funds invested mostly between four and five percent any income earned in a year above that amount gets reinvested in the principal and helps create a cushion for years when the market is poor at the joint meeting the council and board heard from representatives from two minnesota based community trusts duluth superior area community foundation and brainerd lakes area foundation community trusts are non profits set up to professionally manage investments that then pay out a stable income to the beneficiary year after year the city would need to terminate the trust and then transfer the funds to the community foundation which would carry out the purpose of the trust this option also removes the need for an annual audit and other attorney fees community foundations have guidelines for how they invest their clients money investments are governed by statute said duluth superior foundation development officer mark danielson who attended the meeting in tower danielson said their current investment mix is about 70 percent in stocks and 30 percent in bonds their stock investments are all in index funds which reflect broad swaths of the stock market and have low investment related costs we have a pretty straightforward investment philosophy he said the foundation manages over 100 million in assets and a total of about 450 individual funds the foundation would charge a 0 55 percent fee annually on the total amount in the fund they also are hiring a new investment manager and that charge will total 0 1 percent we are solid with sound investment management danielson said we are based in northeastern minnesota we understand our communities steve joul president ceo and karl samp executive director from the brainerd lakes community foundation gave their presentation via zoom their foundation started with about 18 5 million in assets but now manages over 200 million in assets in over 850 funds most based in central minnesota they also have a focus on helping communities grow their funds by soliciting new donations and bequests costs for this fund would be 1 0 percent for an endowed fund and 1 25 percent on a flex fund plus an investment fee that ranges from 0 24 percent to 0 57 percent or the option of using frandsen at 0 6 percent both funds would then distribute the proceeds to the city which would need to set up a board like the current gundersen trust board to oversee distribution of the income each year the distribution would need to fit charitable guidelines currently the gundersen trust is set up to distribute 75 percent of its annual income to the city s general fund and 25 percent to community education and recreation for city residents the actual terms of the distribution would be set by the future court order dismantling the current trust and selection of a community foundation the board made no decisions on selecting an option at this meeting a motion by wilson to eliminate the consideration of option1 continuing to locally manage the fund failed on a 3 3 vote with board members john burgess dena suihkonen and sheldon majerle voting against frandsen is saying thanks but no thanks said tower council member joe morin but council members did not decide to weigh in with a vote at this meeting i don t believe that frandsen doesn t want our business said burgess let s hear from frandsen that would solve my situation i am only one vote wilson noted the board already had frandsen s answer in writing the board decided to have a second meeting in december to hear from the st paul foundation and also to see if steve vranich from frandsen was willing to attend the meeting in person or via zoom to answer questions the meeting date will be set sometime in the second or third week of december in other business the trust board decided not to automatically renew a group of five cds at frandsen bank which are currently earning 07 percent or less the board is also looking into hiring a new audit firm

the rapid growth of fintech companies has received a great deal of attention despite this attention the drivers and consequences of fintech s disruptive forces on financial markets remain open to debate recent voxeu columns tackle some of these issues for example navaretti et al 2018 illustrate the competitive effect of fintech in the financial intermediation industry while cornelli et al 2020 investigate the economic drivers of fintech credit growth in a cross country study another important question related to fintech s role for financial markets is the impact that fintech has on small and medium sized enterprises smes in the aftermath of the global financial crisis a series of capital and other regulations enacted to make banks more resilient may have had the unintended consequence of widening the sme credit gap e g acharya et al 2018 cortés et al 2020 yet smes constitute a segment of the corporate landscape that is heavily dependent on bank financing since corporate bond markets are typically precluded to them in this respect the promise of fintech may materialise in its ability to narrow the sme credit gap with respect to the question outlined above the literature does not offer a conclusive answer it is still unclear whether fintech platforms reach borrowers underserved by more traditional financial intermediaries or whether fintech platforms and banks compete for the same segment of firms these two very different scenarios also yield distinct predictions for fintech s impact on firms investment and financing choices in our recent paper eça et al 2021 we aim to shed light on these issues by zooming in at the firm level studying the determinants of firms and more specifically smes choice to switch to fintech platforms as well as the implications of fintech lending availability for firms investment and financing policies we are in a unique position to study the role of new fintech lending models for smes thanks to our access to a dataset from a leading independent fintech platform in portugal that directly links retail investors to sme borrowers we combine these data with administrative databases that report financial statements for the universe of non financial firms financial statements for banks and matched bank firm loans from the central credit register a crucial aspect of our data is the availability of information about both the firms who manage to borrow through the fintech platform and the firms who apply but get rejected by the platform including financial data and the characteristics of the banks serving these firms this feature allows us to study the determinants of the demand for fintech lending and also to investigate the firm level consequences of obtaining a fintech loan holding fixed such a demand defining the fintech clientele we start by studying the fintech platform clientele and exploring the characteristics of fintech applicants versus the non applicant firms in our sample we find that fintech platforms cater to larger smes with higher profitability and low credit risk importantly we find that firms who apply for fintech funding are significantly more likely to already have bank debt in their debt structure and at the same time do not exhibit higher levels of overdue debt when we compare accepted versus rejected applications i e the sample is restricted to firms that apply to fintech lending we find that the fintech platform s choice is markedly tilted toward larger more profitable firms with more leverage and less overdue debt this first set of results contrasts with the traditional financial intermediation literature sharpe 1990 which suggests that competition should lead newcomers to allocate capital toward lower quality and younger firms in addition our results deviate from the existing empirical findings on peer to peer p2p platforms which indicate that fintech serves a riskier unexplored market segment in consumer loans de roure et al 2016 hau et al 2019 di maggio and yao 2020 and mortgage origination buchak et al 2018 fuster et al 2018 a second set of results allow us to shed further light on the reason why firms decide to apply to the fintech platform we study the characteristics of the banks that have a lending relationship with the smes in our sample we find that smes are more likely to apply for fintech lending if they have relationships with banks with less stable sources of funding lower liquidity of assets and lower capital ratios this indicates that one of the reasons why firms switch to fintech is to reduce their exposure to banks that are less able to absorb shocks and more likely to cut lending activity during liquidity crises khwaja and mian 2008 ivashina and scharfstein 2010 these results highlight the importance of banks quality and their resilience to shocks in the decision to access fintech lending platforms how do firms use fintech loans to explore the effects of obtaining fintech lending on firm investment and financing policies we restrict our analysis to the set of firms who apply to the fintech platform by comparing accepted applicants to firms who applied but get rejected by the platform we can effectively hold fixed the demand for fintech credit focusing on the real effects of its supply we find that firms increase assets employment and sales following fintech lending firms that access fintech lending experience an 8 2 percentage point increase in asset growth a 5 1 percentage point increase in employment growth and a 5 8 percentage point increase in sales growth relative to the control group of rejected applicants we also find an increase in investment of 1 5 percentage points of assets relative to firms with rejected applications in addition we do not observe any significant impact of fintech loans on profitability which indicates that fintech loans contribute to firm growth without sacrificing profitability we observe an important impact of fintech lending also on firms debt structure firms that access the fintech platform increase their leverage by 4 9 percentage points relative to rejected firms this increase is reflected in both long term and short term leverage in addition net of fintech loans we find that firms decrease long term bank debt and increase short term bank debt we find a 6 4 percentage point decrease in long term bank leverage and a 2 1 percentage point increase in short term bank leverage relative to the control group of rejected applicants thus our findings suggest that access to fintech lending allows firms to expand their debt capacity and substitute long term bank lending with long term fintech lending since fintech loans are unsecured these results also point to another important determinant of firms choice to apply to fintech platforms there are several reasons why smes may prefer to finance their growth with long term debt for example they may want to avoid the refinancing risk inherent in short term debt see diamond 1991 diamond 1993 brunnermeier and yogo 2009 however most smes are limited in their availability of collateral and tighter regulation and higher capital requirements make long term unsecured loans to smes unattractive to banks cortés et al 2020 chernenko et al 2019 fintech provides firms with an alternative to access unsecured long term financing we also observe that access to the fintech platform allows smes to further diversify their pool of lenders fintech loans allow firms to add new bank relationships and reduce their dependence on a single bank as indicated by a drop in the share of firm debt accounted by its main bank while obtaining a fintech loan seems to increase the firm s cost of debt we find a reduction in the cost of bank debt i e cost of debt excluding fintech loans this suggests that the diversification of lenders that firms achieve after obtaining a fintech loan leads to a reduction in the cost of bank debt policy implications overall our results indicate that fintech lending platforms are beneficial to smes but for reasons that are not necessarily the ones expected ex ante fintech platforms do not seem to serve young untested firms with no prior access to the banking system thus the benefits of fintech do not seem to lie in increased financial inclusion of small businesses fintech however does allow high quality smes to finance their growth and at the same time diversify their lending relationships our results suggest that the smes who apply to fintech platforms want to reduce their exposure to shocks to the banking system which may curtail their available financing and ultimately adversely affect their growth the fact that smes are interested in securing long term fintech debt also aligns well with the notion that firms in our sample want to protect themselves against credit supply shocks references acharya v v a n berger and r a roman 2018 lending implications of us bank stress tests costs or benefits

on monday president biden released the united states strategy on countering corruption which details how the united states will work domestically and internationally with governmental and non governmental partners to prevent limit and respond to corruption and related crimes it outlines five pillars of work which include modernizing efforts to fight corruption enacting gap filling legislation to curb illicit finance increasing federal and state enforcement actions and leveraging foreign assistance to achieve anti corruption policy goals the detailed strategy is the latest in a series of initiatives and actions in 2021 that have firmly established that the administration is cracking down on corporate crime and ramping up scrutiny on compliance programs across sectors with a host of measures aimed at filling gaps in anti corruption cybersecurity and esg enforcement with respect to civil enforcement the administration has requested an unprecedented interagency review of existing regulations to tackle new and emerging threats to american business and government increased criminal prosecutions are also expected as the doj announced significant changes to its corporate criminal enforcement policies as enforcement priorities shift in the first year of the new administration companies should heed deputy attorney general lisa monaco s stark warning to actively review their compliance programs to ensure they adequately monitor for and remediate misconduct or else it s going to cost them down the line corporate corruption and compliance the biden administration kicked off its anti corruption campaign in march when secretary of state antony blinken banned ihor kolomoyskyy a former ukrainian governor and billionaire accused of significant corruption from entering the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa penalties hit record highs in 2020 and 2019 and are only expected to gain momentum as the biden administration renews its commitment to fighting corruption both at home and abroad in a june 2 speech the acting assistant attorney general nicholas mcquaid declared that fcpa cases remain a priority and that there is more to come in 2021 1 also in june president biden issued his national security memorandum that declared anti corruption a core national security interest the memo initiated a unique interagency review expected to culminate in recommendations as to how the us can modernize intelligence collection streamline enforcement methods and build stronger international partnerships to curb global corruption although the doj and securities exchange commission sec have been the primary enforcers of anti corruption statutes 2 biden s memo called on thirteen additional government agencies to address all forms of illicit finance in the united states and international financial systems 3 notably this directive closely follows the anti money laundering act of 2020 amla which greatly expanded the government s power to investigate and prosecute financial crime terrorist financing and international bribery schemes agencies are expected to release their reports this month around the same time president biden will meet with world leaders at the summit for democracy where anti corruption talks and new department of treasury sanctions against individuals engaged in corruption and serious human rights abuses are already on the agenda while the substance of agency recommendations remains to be seen they will almost certainly result in an uptick of fcpa and money laundering enforcement actions in the coming months in addition the government will likely take advantage of new provisions of the amla which have expanded the government s subpoena power increased penalties and improved whistleblower rewards and protections cybersecurity in 2021 a growing number of hackers targeted the us economy including critical infrastructure at least partly in response to the colonial pipelines ransomware attack that shut down the largest pipeline in the us and led to fuel shortages across the east coast the biden administration issued a may 12 executive order with the goal of modernizing the federal government s cybersecurity systems the order was but the first in a series of white house initiatives this year aimed at securing and defending public systems from cyber criminals observing that federal action alone is not enough to combat cyber attacks on july 28 the president issued a national security memorandum that directed agencies to develop voluntary cybersecurity goals for private owners and operators of critical infrastructure and formally established the president s industrial control system cybersecurity ics initiative the ics initiative is a voluntary collaborative effort between multiple federal agencies and the critical infrastructure community that has rallied over 150 utilities serving 90 million americans committing to deploy updated cybersecurity technologies in august a meeting between president biden and private sector leaders similarly resulted in major private sector companies including apple google ibm microsoft and amazon committing to initiatives that presumably will improve the security of information and operational technology and the supply chains they support government agencies have also warned of increased enforcement actions against companies that fail to maintain adequate cybersecurity practices and related internal controls 4 moreover in september the department of the treasury s office of foreign asset control ofac issued an updated advisory warning that ransomware payments to foreign actors subject to us sanctions will result in ofac enforcement and sanctions up to 20 million per violation 5 and in october the doj contributed to the effort with the announcement of its civil cyber fraud initiative which plans to use the false claims act to pursue cyber related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients in addition to ofac and doj enforcement the sec and federal trade commission ftc have continued their pursuit of companies that mislead customers with respect to cybersecurity practices in violation of securities laws and the federal trade commission act although the sec saw an 18 decrease in total enforcement actions brought in 2021 such a decline is likely attributable to the first year of a new administration seeking to reevaluate its regulatory priorities and re staff top positions now that many of the leadership positions have been filled and strategies have been defined we can expect increased scrutiny and government enforcement action for companies that fail to implement adequate internal controls including those that relate to cybersecurity programs in addition to the patchwork of industry specific enforcement mechanisms already available to the government deputy attorney general lisa monaco in a recent op ed urged congress to pass comprehensive federal legislation that would create a national standard for private companies to report cyber incidents congress has answered the call with multiple bills aimed at increasing cybersecurity spending and breach reporting requirements already on the table for the 117th session accordingly many corporations have invested in technical legal and communications resources that can quickly and accurately identify data breaches to meet expectations for internal and external reporting requirements cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies have become attractive investments for some in the market as well as a preferred payment method for the distribution of contraband and other illegal goods and services although regulatory statutes do not specifically address the cryptocurrency market the sec and commodity futures trading commission cftc have maintained that their respective regulations are flexible enough to cover digital assets the sec has stated that the howey test is sufficient to determine if a cryptocurrency is a security the cftc has stated that certain cryptocurrencies are commodities subject to at least the cftc s enforcement jurisdiction the new administration appears committed to these approaches the sec recently has been leading the charge to bring the cryptocurrency community into compliance with existing regulations chairman gary gensler announced in august that he agrees with his predecessor s view that almost every ico is a security and is therefore subject to the full gambit of existing securities laws the sec brought a total of 16 enforcement actions in the past year against entities that offer unregistered icos or make misleading statements to induce the purchase of digital assets the cftc also has been active bringing a number of cases involving allegations of fraud and manipulation in addition to failure to register with the agency in september the cftc imposed a 1 25 million penalty against kraken one of the largest digital asset exchanges in the us for offering digital assets without being registered as a futures commission merchant and in october fined bitfinex 1 5 million for similar allegations the cftc imposed a 41 million fine against another exchange tether for making false or misleading statements about its stablecoin us dollar tether token these cases suggest that the cftc will not hesitate to assert its enforcement authority over cryptocurrency exchanges that violate the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations and will continue to collaborate with the doj and other agencies to ensure compliance 6 in addition to civil enforcement the doj in october announced the creation of its national cryptocurrency enforcement team ncet that will coordinate investigation and enforcement efforts of various criminal violations involving digital assets the doj has a wide variety of federal charges at its disposal to deal with the misuse of cryptocurrency including wire fraud mail fraud securities fraud and money laundering among others despite this extensive arsenal of civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms multiple government agencies have called on congress to fill gaps in the existing regulatory framework that continue to widen as the digital currency marketplace grows the sec asked congress for additional plenary authority to write rules for and attach guardrails to crypto trading and lending cftc acting chairman rostin behnam stated in his nomination hearing before the senate agriculture committee in october that congress should consider expanding the cftc s authority to include direct authority to regulate cryptocurrencies in a november report the department of treasury similarly urged congress to pass legislation to ensure that stablecoins are subject to consistent and comprehensive federal oversight with much at stake the cryptocurrency industry itself has weighed in on the matter with coinbase the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the us asking congress to create a new regulator with sole authority over the emerging marketplace these suggestions come as congress explores multiple legislative bills directly impacting the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries in its 117th session updated guidance and increased regulation is expected until then the government has encouraged companies to register their digital assets rather than attempt to take advantage of ambiguities in the developing legal landscape environmental social and governance the biden administration is also prioritizing increased regulation in esg space starting with a january 27 executive order that placed the climate crisis at the center of us domestic and foreign policy the order directed government agencies to make achieving environmental justice part of their missions by developing programs policies and activities to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health environmental climate related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities as well as the accompanying economic challenges of such impacts pursuant to this directive in february the sec announced a review of its 11 year old climate related disclosure guidance and in march announced the creation of its climate and esg task force led by the sec s deputy director of enforcement a clear signal that updated disclosure requirements and increased enforcement are soon to follow consistent with its top down direction in march the cftc established a new climate risk unit to address the role of derivatives in transitioning to a low carbon economy the doj closely followed suit in june announcing a rollout of environmental justice teams ejt the first of which popped up in the u s attorney s office for the eastern district of new york in a recent conversation with bracewell ejt chief matt silverman discussed how his team will prioritize environmental justice in its investigations and enforcement actions in addition to these various government agencies the house committee on oversight and reform recently opened an investigation into oil company conduct alleging that the fossil fuel industry has prevented serious action on climate change through a disinformation campaign similar to that of the tobacco industry decades ago a second climate related executive order signed in may ordered the financial stability oversight counsel to consider issuing a report detailing plans that member agencies are taking to improve climate related disclosures and to incorporate climate related financial risk into regulatory and supervisory practices one such agency the financial industry regulatory authority finra appears to be taking the lead on diversity equity and inclusion dei disclosures requesting public comments for updates to its dei rules in june just last month acting finra chair eileen murray defended increased government regulation of esg in an interview with cnbc calling esg an ecosystem that will require regulators business and educators to work together to protect esg conscious investors murray also applauded the sec s decision in august to approve nasdaq s new board diversity requirements and hinted that future regulations may reflect a similar comply or disclose framework the promise of esg disclosure standards from the sec cftc and finra suggests greater scrutiny and enforcement action on corporations that may toe the line between puffery and misrepresentations in public facing esg statements until then the new climate and esg task force has promised to identify and target material gaps or misstatements in issuers disclosures of climate risks under existing rules forecast the themes coming out of the administration in 2021 have been consistent greater government scrutiny on corporate conduct with a nose to the ground for signs of corruption across sectors and a higher standard of scrutiny on representations that tout esg values as hallmarks of responsible corporate citizenship cyber activity both on the adversarial and regulatory sides has increased and can be expected to continue to increase in 2022 as the u s government issues a call to arms which includes a carrot in the form of some level of assistance to private corporations that join hands with the government and a stick to those that fail to implement adequate security measures and internal controls in addition as cryptocurrencies continue to challenge the traditional banking system the government will try to shore up regulatory schemes with gap filling legislation and aggressive enforcement action which will likely require updates to companies existing aml programs with respect to criminal investigations the deputy attorney general has instructed her prosecutors to be bold and we can expect them to enthusiastically carry out that mandate to be well positioned for the year ahead now is the time for belt tightening in compliance systems and controls meagan c maloney also contributed to this article 1 nicholas mcquaid acting assistant attorney general dep t of justice keynote address at the foreign corrupt practices act new york june 2 2021 2 in the first corporate fcpa settlement of the year the sec and doj imposed a 43 million fine against foster wheeler for its involvement in a bribery scheme that took place in brazil press release u s securities and exchange commission sec charges amec foster wheeler limited with fcpa violations related to brazilian bribery scheme june 25 2021 3 in addition to the sec the commodity futures trading commission cftc has also stated an intention to bring enforcement actions alongside the doj in cases where its markets are implicated the first of which resulted in a 95 7 million fine against vitol inc for foreign corruption related commodity exchange act violations press release commodity futures trading commission cftc orders vitol inc to pay 95 7 million for corruption based fraud and attempted manipulation dec 3 2020 4 press release u s securities and exchange

record inflation a global supply chain in turmoil and critical national labor shortages have combined to turn the 2021 holiday shopping season into a hot mess as shipping delays out of stock issues and higher prices lead to curves on the usual road to completing gift lists in a new deseret news hinckley institute of politics poll a majority of utahns said they re making adjustments to navigate the holiday shopping challenges in a year expected to still outpace the record holiday spending set in 2020 the survey conducted nov 18 30 found that about 1 in 5 utahns say they are spending less than in previous years and almost a third started holiday shopping earlier than usual and while 17 of respondents said they d be turning to in person shopping to avoid shipping delays 39 said their shopping tactics hadn t been changed by the unique circumstances this year the polling was conducted by dan jones associates of 812 utah registered voters it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 44 percentage points even as some holiday shoppers in utah and across the country say they are tightening their belts in the midst of inflation that reached a 30 year high in october and is expected to continue retail industry experts believe 2021 holiday spending will still surpass the record 789 4 billion mark set last year shoppers walk through city creek center in salt lake city on wednesday dec 8 2021 shafkat anowar deseret news while the 2021 cyber week the holiday shopping window that begins on thanksgiving and ends on cyber monday failed to outpace the same stretch of 2020 for the first time industry watchers said that was an outgrowth of much higher volumes of earlier than usual holiday purchases spurred in part by retailers offering early discounts with early deals in october consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like cyber monday and black friday said taylor schreiner director of adobe digital insights in a press release this was further fueled by growing awareness of supply chain challenges and product availability it spread out e commerce spending across the months of october and november putting us on track for a season that still will break online shopping records that outsized volume of early shopping included almost 110 billion in online purchases from nov 1 to nov 29 a jump of nearly 12 over last year and 22 of those days

availability challenges this year in online shopping have pushed more customers back to brick and mortar businesses some of whom have worked to mitigate supply chain challenges with more careful inventory management and committed efforts to bring shoppers in early among those is salt lake independent bookseller king s english bookshop in an october deseret news interview king s english co owner calvin crosby said supply chain transportation issues combined with understaffed manufacturing and distribution operations amid national labor shortages is amplifying challenges for retailers in all sectors for booksellers he said publishers and distributors put out notice that on hand inventories would likely not be replenished until after the holidays forcing the hands of owners to either stock up early or risk being left with empty shelves during the high volume holiday shopping season october is the new december crosby said we ve done some really heavy ordering so much so that it s led to interesting storage challenges for our small store but the abundance of inventory is necessary knowing that our options will dwindle later in the season along with the front loading as

availability and supply chain challenges is well stocked for the season people have gotten the word on supply chains sartain said we re certainly seeing earlier shopping and higher volumes on a daily basis than we have historically sartain said his store which has been a staple for many utah families since 1988 has been prepared for the earlier than usual crowds and timed its pre holiday ordering and inventory buildup accordingly he also noted how the unique conditions created by the converging supply chain labor shortage and inflation issues have made the retail season tricky to predict even for a business that s successfully weathered 33 years of holiday madness it s typical to see an explosion in store volume over the weeks between thanksgiving and christmas sartain said but with the steady and substantial increases we ve already seen i m left wondering whether the trend will continue or if we ll get a slump

smith commercial fishermen soon may be able to take more whitefish from green bay the wisconsin department of natural resources is moving toward a permanent rule change that would allow increased commercial harvest of lake whitefish in southern green bay the modification has been years in the making and is a response to a good news bad news situation on the sunny side of the equation the whitefish population in the bay has been increasing for more than a decade according to dnr data advertisement advertisement in a happy surprise the native fish successfully adapted to the onslaught of invasive species such as round gobies and zebra and quagga mussels and not only survived but restored spawning runs on several tributaries to the bay including the menomonie river with a downturned mouth whitefish are able to take advantage of the billions of new benthic or bottom dwelling animals carpeting the lake bed the increase in whitefish already spurred a thriving new winter sport fishery in the bay thousands of ice anglers now head to sturgeon bay and other door county sites to try their luck on whitefish kyle tokarski of green bay lands a lake whitefish while ice fishing near sturgeon bay more oil fouled snowy owl found at milwaukee recycling center is recovering at the wisconsin humane society advertisement advertisement more smith hawk study seeks to unlock secrets of redtails more outdoors calendar the unhappy news is playing out on the other side of the door peninsula where the moonlight bay stock once the largest whitefish population in the wisconsin waters of lake michigan has declined substantially commercial fishers there have been unable to catch their quotas in 2015 for example the netters landed just 24 of their allowed take so the dnr has been working on a plan to shift commercial effort to the richer waters of green bay especially the southern bay known as zone 1 and reduce it on lake michigan zone 3 and part of zone 2 advertisement advertisement an earlier attempt to modify the commercial whitefish rule was shelved by the dnr in 2016 due to public opposition at the time some members of the lake michigan commercial fishing board floated the notion of keeping and selling walleyes and other sport fish as bycatch sport anglers and others spoke out loudly against that idea many believing it would lead to targeting of prized sport fish and result in a depletion of the resource this time is different there is no talk of selling walleyes or other incidentally caught sport fish and to its credit over the last several years the dnr worked with partners including uw green bay commercial fishers and wisconsin sea grant to monitor the whitefish harvest in trap and gill nets advertisement advertisement more smith whitefish rule change must follow science there s a lot more data available now than five years ago dnr lake michigan fisheries supervisor brad eggold gave an update on the lake michigan and green bay commercial fishing study wednesday at the natural resources board meeting in madison eggold acknowledged it s a really complex issue but explained why the agency maintains the green bay whitefish population can sustain additional harvest the dnr estimates the green bay population of whitefish increased from about 6 million fish in 2008 to about 16 million in 2018 over the same period the whitefish spawning biomass increased from about 15 million pounds to about 37 million pounds advertisement advertisement to assess the effects of trap and gill nets on sport fish over the last two years a uw green bay graduate student accompanied commercial fishermen and documented the results of 593 trap net lifts and 29 large mesh gill net lifts overall non target gamefish bycatch was relatively low according to the dnr report based on the observed number of walleyes in the nets the agency projects about 13 000 walleye would be caught by commercial fishermen targeting whitefish in green bay in 2021 and about 1 300 of them would die by comparison the sport angler harvest of walleye in green bay was estimated at 91 000 fish in 2019 the dnr estimates the bay s walleye population at more than 2 million fish advertisement advertisement most of the incidental catch of walleyes occurred in the southern part of the bay in addition higher numbers of whitefish discards typically fish smaller than the 17 inch minimum commercial size limit were seen in the south the dnr has yet to release its final whitefish rule proposal but the draft calls for a total allowable catch of 1 176 889 pounds for green bay and 800 407 pounds for lake michigan the final rule will detail how the shares are split among the three zones it will also likely include a new restricted area in southern green bay in which trap net fishing would be allowed by permit only the measure would mitigate bycatch issues with non target sport fish and sublegal whitefish that become discards according to the dnr advertisement advertisement and the electronic fish harvest reporting system efhrs will become mandatory for commercial netters eggold said the final rule is expected to be released to the public in the coming weeks and presented to the nrb in january application deadline reminders friday is the deadline to submit applications for drawings for 2022 wisconsin bear and spring turkey tags the applications are

washington d c following a ruling by the u s consumer financial protection bureau cfpb u s debt collectors can now contact millions of indebted americans on social media and by text messaging while critics said the messages could be lost online or sent to the wrong recipients as well as cause invasions of privacy and the rise of new hoaxes advocates claim the change is a simple update to rules created in the 1970s the rule change which was approved by the cfpb last year during the trump administration requires creditors to contact defaulters privately meaning they can send direct messages but not post on public profiles consumers can opt out of these messages but creditors do not require permission to contact people there are no rules regarding how many messages are allowed to be sent lenders argued that this rule change was needed since the fair debt collection practices act which regulates the industry became law in 1977 and is outdated the new rule limits calls to seven per week for any particular debt but people with multiple debts may still be called dozen of times debt collectors are also limited from contacting any consumer by phone within one week of speaking to them about a specific debt in a statement mark neeb ceo of the debt collector trade group aca international said the rule change is a small step forward in modernizing communications with consumers as reported by the bbc according to cbs news the rule change could affect tens of millions of people in the united states

the recently held virtual meeting of the climate summit between us president joe biden and chinese president xi jinping might have initiated some meaningful contact between the two states but it has not broken ground on resolving the lingering us china trade war disputes the proceedings also established that both states continue to see the indo pacific region as a contestable ground in the immediate future overall the multilateral balance is in bad shape the us is increasingly looking inward rather than at global interests some have hoped for another us moment of splendid isolation but the us retracting its commitments across the world is unlikely especially in the face of china s relentless economic surge china is not just an economic superpower but a diplomatic and development behemoth as well russia has also established control and power beyond its borders not least through the provision of arms and controlling global energy supply chains in europe the us has always relied on allies to compete for global hegemony but this is easier said than done in the existing global structure there would have been hope for reinvigorating the pax americana had the us not dashed its support among european allies and enabled a spate of new alliances such as aukus and the middle eastern quad that push america s narrow security agendas where instead there are opportunities to leverage in global diplomacy development and economic connectivity the fate of nato and even the unsc hangs in the balance with a growing conflict resolution mandate but waning resources and conviction to lead in the indo pacific broadening relationships and coordination with australia japan and india continues to remain a priority for the us china on the other hand is looking at more economic cooperation as a means to spread influence and gain access to important markets and trade routes aukus and defence agreements with india beca in recent years clearly identify china as the main threat the next order of business for the us in this sphere would be to increase defence cooperation between its partners closer contacts of india with australia new zealand and the uk for more cooperation in the indo pacific while australia views its alliance with the us as the cornerstone of its security policy china is also a major economic partner for canberra but the deal through aukus to buy nuclear powered submarines is a primary example of canberra looking to reassert itself in its maritime backyard the erosion of the relative position of the us vis a vis china is also driving australia to engage more directly in the indo pacific region and to encourage the development of a new regional architecture alliances aside good old hard defence capabilities continue to dominate national budgets with significant spending on both sides a look at the numbers of total defence spending of the us and china however indicates that the competition the us refers to is actually skewed in favour of washington even the most inflated estimates of china s defence spending put the number somewhere between 35 billion and 65 billion a year these figures pale in comparison to corresponding us data which indicates defence spending was 766 58 billion in 2020 this basic disparity will not change anytime soon for several reasons first china still has a number of economic challenges to overcome before it can plough unlimited resources into building its capacity to invest in its defence second even if china specifically looks to compete with the us military in both quantity and quality it still has to play catch up the us owned capital stock of modern military equipment is valued at roughly 1 trillion china s defence assets at this point amount to 100 billion in comparison there is also still some scepticism regarding china s parity with the us in the oceans beijing is set to operationalise its first aircraft carrier soon according to satellite images but the exact date is still unclear there are estimates that this could happen anywhere in the next three to six months the us in comparison already has 11 however technological advancements and greater research and development of technology might help speed things up for china the recent hypersonic missile test looks to have us based experts worried the missile was launched from china went around the world and then deployed a payload on a target in china meaning that china could soon be capable of circumventing missile defence systems on the furthest targets these developments have led to rising tensions which places a significant burden on the international system as the risk of conflict is enhanced especially with the us militarising its asia policy the camp formations that are taking shape or are being imposed perhaps by an over anxious american establishment are reminiscent of a forced polar mentality that will be detrimental to the interests of the region in the long run at another level at the bilateral summit biden briefly addressed china s unfair trade and economic policies and how they harm american workers and raised concerns about human rights abuses in xinjiang tibet and hong kong while reiterating american support for taiwan despite their differences and continued trade war both countries do seem wary of the responsibility that falls on them to put guardrails on potential economic and geopolitical conflict between them flaring up into the unmanageable diplomatic or kinetic realm the us and china both pay high taxes on each other s imports as a consequence of the trade war that began between the two under trump in 2018 that ultimately resulted in escalating import tariffs and subsequent supply chain disruptions affecting businesses and individuals worldwide under the still unresolved trade war china is still more than 180 billion short of a pledge to purchase 380 billion in american products before a deadline of december 31 2021 while the recently held virtual meeting of the climate summit between joe biden and xi jinping has ushered in some optimism regarding engagement between the two states it has not broken ground on resolving the lingering us china trade war disputes the indo pacific is likely to remain a hotbed of tension and arms build up with no actual conflagration of violence in the short and medium terms at the moment the issue of taiwan has been identified as the potential matchstick that could turn tensions into something uglier however all indications by the us point to a hesitation to engage because one misstep could lead to an extended conflict that spills beyond the indo pacific waters for now both sides will have an uneasy impasse and continue defence spending with heedless arms hoarding the competition for extending power over the pacific is very much on the writer is a researcher at jinnah institute he tweets wastia
what caused the amazon web services outage will there be more share copy link copy whether you have a kid obsessed with watching shows on disney plus or here trading stock on robin hood you re probably really really frustrated for hours yesterday maybe even still this morning so what on earth is going on here amazon web services also known as aws experienced a massive service outage yesterday in major websites and apps across the country were affected so we re talking from netflix to venmo and even united airlines customers could not access the site to watch movies or make transactions even amazon s own applications and employees and sellers used to coordinate package deliveries went down leading to shipment delays all over the country in a statement to news the aws spokesperson said that the team was working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible now some businesses are still down this morning so for a deeper look at the outage and what you need to know should it happen again we re joined by senior retail reporter for business insider on your cane on you thank you so much for joining us on morning rush so the cause of this outage is still a mystery this morning and i just mentioned a few you know united airlines netflix give us a sense about how dominant amazon web services is in our daily lives absolutely and thanks for having me um so yes this outage is definitely an indicator that the web is reliant on amazon all these different companies need to rely on amazon aws um for their daily operations and that means that when amazon goes down you know so does a lot of a lot of the site that it really affects people s um you know you know not only their online deliveries but their ability to watch shows their ability to buy tickets for different events i mean it s just it s so it s such a massive thing although i will say we re starting to get clues about what happened here um this morning my colleagues eugene kim and catherine long reported from leaked memos that there was some sort of massive traffic surge at least that s what amazon is internally blaming um and they re not exactly sure where that came from but basically it caused a lot of congestion across a number of network devices in northern virginia which is amazon s biggest region so we re starting to piece together the clues of what happened but the exact cause is still forthcoming very interesting so most people logged on yesterday whether it was disney plus or delta airlines and naturally blame those companies for the surface failures so what does a situation like this due to a company s reputation with its customers because i know if i have an issue and i repeatedly have an issue that may not even be their fault but i m gonna say you know what i got to cut this service off that is a great point yeah it can be something definitely that s not the company s fault and still be a huge headache for consumers right that they re going to remember and i think even worse that this is the holiday season so when you re trying to get your presence in or whatnot or trying to do something on one of these sites that s a huge headache i mean you mentioned is the bus it s turning in uh you know if your kids are upset because they can t watch their show you know that that might stick in your mind um i think that in terms of brand reputation this is not necessarily going to be like a disaster for any one of these brands including amazon because i think people understand that things happen um but if something like this were to become a you know a habit that i think people would certainly be pretty if that in terms of their brand reputation that would be certainly a pretty massive dent um i think we ll have a better sense of like how often this will happen or what could happen going forward once we know the source of this right um obviously people are pretty freaked out whenever something is sort of a like a privacy issue or a leak so if this is some sort of like web attack i think that could end up having more of an impact on the reputation than if it s just some sort of like glitch or traffic surge that they couldn t anticipate and usually those traffic surges don t last this long from yesterday some even still this morning so what is the likelihood that we will see an outage like this of this magnitude again that is such a good question right because yeah we don t typically see something going on for this long and i think not only our consumers wondering that but actually employees as well i talked to some amazon warehouse worker um the other day and they were telling me they were bored stiff and they were just kind of standing around waiting for the day to start again uh and it was you know there were just basically like stuck at work with nothing to do for hours um and i think without knowing what the cause was it s really hard to say going forward whether this could happen again or to this degree and that s i think what makes it scary because the web is so reliant on amazon consumers are so reliant on amazon so when we don t know what s happening it s like this happening i can t not go to amazon every single day on you kane senior retail reporter for insider thank you so much for joining us this morning have a good one thanks for having me thanks get national breaking news alerts the latest
