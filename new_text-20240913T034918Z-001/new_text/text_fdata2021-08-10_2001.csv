ftse 100 closes 9 points higher us blue chips weak but off worst energy stocks weak with crude prices 5 00pm small gains impress the ftse 100 index managed some modest gains on monday helped by some m a chatter a fairly impressive achievement when weakness in oil majors was taken into account as well as early weakness by us blue chips at the close the uk blue chip index was 9 35 points or 0 1 higher at 7 132 30 only just below the day s peak of 7 138 805 and well above the session low of 7 089 74 on wall street around london s close the dow jones industrials average was down 66 points or 0 2 at 35 132 albeit off early lows while the broader s p 500 slipped 0 1 but the tech laden nasdaq composite added 0 2 chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig a global leader in online trading commented markets are firmly into the dog days of august as the limited range of today s moves testifies it is hardly surprising with much of earnings season out of the way and with us markets sitting on a very strong run higher over the past six months non farm payrolls are out of the way too and so we now find ourselves deep in the quiet period until the jackson hole meeting at the end of the month while precious metals prices have rebounded today oil remains under pressure but while there might well be some delta variant fears driving the move the fact that equities have remained broadly calm points towards an odd disconnect either equities are blithely ignoring a major worry or oil prices are undergoing a self contained selloff that is being driven chiefly by supply concerns beauchamp concluded ultimately indices continue to lack direction a state of affairs that may well prevail for the rest of the month as august lives up to its reputation as a rather dull month for equities 3 15pm weak start on wall street us equities have opened lower on balance the dow jones industrial average was down 84 points 0 2 at 35 125 while the s p 500 was 5 points 0 1 weaker at 4 431 in london the ftse 100 is just 9 points lower and back above 7 100 at 7 114 the ftse 250 is practically unchanged helped by keen demand for outsourcing group capita plc lse cpi and shipping services

it has not been a good day for commodity prices especially gold while gold is down by about 1 and silver 1 7 the oil price has taken a right shellacking with brent crude for october delivery us 2 65 lower at us 68 05 a barrel commodities more sensitive to the economy such as copper and crude oil remained near session lows said fawad razaqzada at thinkmarkets com these commodities have been hurt by growing concerns over the delta variant of the coronavirus rising cases and more lockdowns have had a direct impact on travel and thus oil demand recovery with the opec raising oil output gradually the potential for slower recovery of demand specifically fuel demand has eased concerns about a tight market meanwhile it is worth keeping a close eye on us oil inventories with florida and texas being the epicentres of the outbreak if us oil inventories start to build again this will surely weigh on oil prices further he suggested commodity prices over the last year natural gas 92 gasoline 84 corn 72 heating oil 67 wti crude 63 brent crude 58 soybeans 52 copper 49 coffee 49 sugar 44 wheat 43 cotton 40 palladium 16 lumber 4 platinum aim zero 4 silver 14 gold 15 charlie bilello

demand growth the restrictions have been introduced to limit the spread of the delata variant of the coronavirus the restrictions include flight cancellations warnings by 46 cities against travel and limits on public transport and taxi services in 144 of the worst hit areas sp angel said china reported 125 new covid 19 cases today up from 96 on sunday the weakness of the oil price seems to be having a knock on effect on the share price of bp plc lse bp which is down 1 3 at 303 45p and royal dutch shell nyse rds a plc which is 1 3 lower at 1 448 6p despite the heavily weighted oil stocks toiling the ftse 100 has almost wiped out the morning s losses and is down 7 points 0 1 at 7 116 12 40pm us stocks to open lower us stocks are expected to open slightly lower on monday edging back from last week s record highs as a drop in commodity prices indicated some investor unease about the strength of the economic recovery in spite of friday s stronger than forecast july non farm payrolls futures for the dow jones industrial average ticked 0 2 lower while futures for the broader s p 500 index also shed 0 2 and nasdaq 100 futures were relatively flat benchmark brent crude oil prices dropped nearly 4 on a un climate change warning as china introduced new virus clampdown measures meanwhile gold and silver prices briefly fell before recovering most of the lost ground amid rising bond yields and strength in the dollar folllowing the latest jobs report which is expected to lead to a tapering by the federal reserve sooner rather than later investors also have the ongoing earnings season to keep an eye on with tyson foods nyse tsn and vaccine developer biontech scheduled to report ahead of the new york opening bell while amc entertainment is expected to post earnings after the markets close household names such as walt disney and airbnb nasdaq abnb are also scheduled to report later this week a jolts report on job openings in june will also be eyed for more information on the labour market in london either my screen has frozen or the ftse 100 is stuck in concrete following a quick screen refresh it appears the footsie has moved in the last hour it s a bit lower at 7 090 down 33 points 0 5 11 10am takeover activity enlivens dull proceedings it has been a dull start to the week in london but there has been plenty of takeover activity real imagined or threatened to spice up proceedings as well as the previously mentioned interest in sse and entain see earlier reports we ve had us fags maker philip morris international increasing its bid for vectura group plc aim vec the respiratory drugs group and topping the offer from private equity group carlyle group that had been backed by the vectura board it s slightly odd to see a tobacco group make a bid for a company whose stated aim is to improve the health of humans but philip morris whose best known brand is marlboro has upped its offer to 165p a share from 150p valuing vectura at 1 02bn carlyle s rival offer was pitched at 155p a share itself an increase on an initial offer of 130p a share that the vectura board was happy enough to accept back in may in what now looks like a colossal misjudgement another bidding war is revving up over morrison wm supermarkets plc where us private equity giant fortress increased its agreed bid to 272p from its previously agreed bid of 254p the takeover panel has given clayton dubilier rice cd r more time to decide whether it wants to make a rival offer the put up or shut up deadline for cd r was today but has now been extended to 20 august halma plc lse hlma the safety controls engineer was off 0 2 at 2 893p after it announced it had recently completed three acquisitions for 48 8mln and sold texeco for 65mln lastly deliveroo plc lse roo

utilities you know it is a risk off day london s index of heavyweight shares was down 21 points 0 3 at 7 102 with investment platform operator hargreaves lansdown plc lse hl down 9 9 at 1 478p leading the retreat after its full year results disappointed the group s chief executive officer chris hill bragged about a record 223 000 net new clients in the year but operating costs which had been

plc lse sse severn trent lse svt plc and united utilities plc all fine companies no doubt but as dull as ditchwater sse up 3 4 was the best performer of the three as activist investor elliott group

recruitment firm pagegroup lse page plc was 4 5 lower at 2 047 29p after its interims failed to make the grade much better h1 at pagegroup lse page but still below 2019 since shares are back above 2019 levels i can t see they are worth buying at the moment and i m a shareholder rodney hobson rodneyhobson august 9 2021 generally recruitment companies offer decent insight into the health of the economy as companies look to hire when times are good so the reinstatement of the first half dividend at pagegroup lse page and a big recovery in revenue and profit reinforces the idea there was a material global rebound in the first six months of 2021 said aj bell s investment director russ mould somehow i feel there is a but coming the bad news is pagegroup lse page isn t sounding quite as upbeat about the remainder of the year as the emergence of new covid variants sees restrictions remain in place in several of its markets it is also possible to note a degree of uncertainty about whether recent growth is a short term effect driven by pent up demand or something more sustainable mould said 8 20am lacklustre start as expected the ftse 100 opened the first trading session of the new week in negative territory taking its cue from asia s main markets the dip into the red was marginal and sustained by thin trading volumes the miners were on offer early on after some fairly anaemic chinese trade data over the weekend the decline in gold to levels last seen in may appeared to have little impact on the sector while crude oil s fall had a marginal effect on bp lon bp on the face of it results from the funds supermarket group hargreaves lansdown lon hl appeared robust the market however was unimpressed with the shares marked down 7 1 in the opening exchanges 6 50 am subdued start predicted the ftse 100 looks set to make a subdued start to proceedings taking a cue from asia s main markets well those of them open with japan and singapore closed trading volumes were a little thin in the region as traders took stock of friday s better than expected jobs print and some lacklustre chinese trade data out over the weekend eye catching was the tumble in the price of gold to five month lows more difficult to fathom was the reason with the most widely cited cause the breach of a technical support level for the precious metal with liquidity at zero to non existent this morning it is clear that when gold moved through 1 750 an ounce it set off a cascading negative feedback loop of stop loss selling into a market with no bids said jeffrey halley analyst at oanda the decline in crude oil prices was easier to fathom fears that that spread of the covid delta variant may put the kibosh on travel appears to have been the trigger for the 1 9 drop looking ahead the

chinese think tanks unveil truth about u s covid 19 fight the report release conference was held in beijing august 9 2021 photo science and technology daily the chongyang institute for financial studies renmin university of china together with taihe think tank and intellisia institute release report on truth about america s fight against covid 19 pandemic in beijing on august 9 2021 the report america ranked first the truth about america s fight against covid 19 is the first report in the world to unveil the truth about america s fight against covid 19 the united states ranked the first in the covid resilience ranking bloomberg reported on june 28 2021 this goes against basic human ethics this spin will not help future generations to understand the current world history either realistically or objectively according to the report only for politics not for life as of august 7 2021 the u s has reported 35 530 951 cumulative confirmed cases of covid 19 these include 613 658 deaths both numbers rank the first in the world the report stressed that behind the cold numbers lies the domestic politics of the u s particularly the highly politicized partisanship which has taken many lives of the people who need not have died it s a slaughter said american epidemiologist william foege the report noted that from the first covid 19 outbreak there are many disagreements among the two parties of the u s that hold the country back from nucleic acid testing masks wearing social distancing home quarantine vaccinations to the distribution of strategic medical reserves and emergency relief bills between federal state and local levels and executive legislative and judicial branches and between conservative and liberal media the federal system under the competition between the two major parties failed to take on responsibilities giving prevarications at different levels it constituted a disunited america image in the fight against the pandemic the report stressed save the stock market not to save lives the u s stock market has soared since hitting a low on march 23 2020 after the federal reserve took extraordinary measures to create more money from march 2020 to january 2021 the combined wealth of more than 600 u s billionaires increased from an estimated 2 947 trillion to 4 085 trillion an increase of 38 6 percent the federal reserve printed excessive money in fact the u s in a year and a half printed nearly half of all the dollars for more than 200 years however countries around the world have to bear the burden of inflation instability and bubble pressures that they should not have to suffer from such a beggar thy neighbor approach has brought additional economic and social pressures to countries suffering from the covid 19 outbreak this can even lead to political conflict and regional chaos warned the report violation of common scientific knowledge and origin tracing terrorism the covid 19 pandemic in the u s had been excessively politicized due to political disputes this was reflected in the control methods of the pandemic it went against common sense in prevention and control policy measures virus origin tracing investigation and so on to exploit the pandemic for political purposes the u s government has suppressed scientists and professional opinion scientists who denied the lab leaks were subjected to cyber violence and harassment this affected their normal work and even physically threatened their safety understanding the origins of the virus is a serious scientific and medical issue that aims to prevent the next pandemic and protect the lives and health of people in all countries the u s government however is making a presumption of guilt on this issue washington is presupposing the conclusion of wuhan laboratory origin and obstructing the scientific tracing work said the report worse still the u s has been manipulating the vaccine map and manipulating global public opinion by practicing origin tracing terrorism intensified racial conflicts and social unrest under the pandemic the american people s right to live in health has not been equally guaranteed the social ethical crisis and humanitarian disaster have caused a serious imbalance in the sense of security and gain for different groups of people and the bonds that maintain social cohesion in the u s are being torn apart by the disparity between rich and poor social division class solidification racial conflicts regional conflicts and intergenerational conflicts according to the report the conspiracy about the origins of covid 19 has fueled bullying against asians as pointed out in the report asian american discrimination cases nearly doubled in march 2021 alone social unrest is a chronic illness in the united states and the covid 19 pandemic acted as an amplifier for existing divisions in 2021 the u s had the highest level of social unrest among developed countries far higher than the u k canada spain and many other developing countries the two political parties and the elites in the u s however are still hyping and amplifying the aforementioned division they are doing this either to gain voter support or to solidify the vested interest structure of the political and economic oligarchy the american public is increasingly seeing the u s government as only representing the interests of a few vested interest groups the pandemic is a global public health crisis that requires countries around the world including the u s to pool their resources to fight the pandemic however as the world s top superpower said the report the u s has allowed the virus to spread resulting in the serious deterioration of pandemics in other countries it has shirked its responsibilities and tried to use the world health organization as a tool to defend its own interests and pursued anti pandemic egoism and vaccine nationalism objective facts have shown that the u s is well deserved to be the world s no 1 anti pandemic failure the world s no 1 political blaming country the world s no 1 pandemic spreader country the world s no 1 political division country the world s no 1 currency abuse country the world s no 1 pandemic period turmoil country the world s no 1 disinformation country and the world s no 1 origin tracing terrorism country the report concluded covid 19 is probably the greatest test of governance the world has seen since the second world war the united states and the west failed miserably martin jacques former senior fellow of cambridge university said via video link

iqbal surve s sekunjalo independent media is in court fighting off a union owned co investor s bid to reclaim r300 million the south african clothing and textile workers union was one of the major funders of sekunjalo s takeover of independent media in 2013 sekunjalo claims it doesn t owe them or its major creditor the public investment corporation anything in april 2019 the investment arm of the south african clothing and textile workers union sactwu hit sekunjalo independent media sim with a r295 6 million claim for failing to repay debts related to the buyout of independent media in 2013 sim is the company through which surve controls the newspaper group while sactwu investments group sig is one of the minority shareholders of sim that gave surve r150 million to fund the 2013 takeover with interest this debt has doubled and constitutes 15 of the union company s assets one of the larger funders the public investment corporation pic has also launched a separate liquidation application sim was due to repay the debt and interest by 14 august 2020 subject to sig being entitled to demand immediate repayment in the case of a default event on 8 april 2019 sactwu s lawyers wrote to sim calling up the loan and citing the admissions made by surve at the mpati commission of inquiry into the affairs of the pic that independent media had failed to repay its multi billion rand debt to both the pic and the government employees pension fund sim disputed the claim but it has already taken more than two years for the case to get to court in part because sim resisted disclosing internal documents that might help sactwu prove its claim in december last year sactwu was finally forced to launch a separate court case to compel sim to disclose information things came to a head with a court date set for 5 may this year for sig s application to force sim to hand over documents not for the actual claim days before going to court sim came forward with most of the outstanding information sought and the parties abruptly settled the dispute around documents this had the effect of keeping evidently sensitive information about the ailing independent media group out of court and consequently out of the public eye from the court papers that have been filed in the western cape high court surve s company comes across as cynically exploiting the trust or naivety of its partners to sidestep the r300 million debt sim failed to acknowledge questions or answer them despite assurances from its pr company that they were received on the other side of the coin the papers suggest the union was easily taken for a ride and that it was poorly served by its general secretary andre kriel who signed the agreements on behalf of sig taken for a ride sim s pleadings in response to sig s claim seem to lay bare how surve ran circles around sactwu allegedly getting the union to sign away its entire r300 million debt and 8 shareholding in sim in exchange for shares in another surve company sagarmatha technologies that turned out to be practically worthless even if the debt still existed kriel signed a separate subordination agreement putting the debt at the back of a queue of very significant creditors meaning that the debt will almost certainly never have to be repaid what s more sim claims that africa s largest asset manager and custodian of all civil servants pensions the pic fell into the exact same trap it is unambiguously sim s position that it owes the pic nothing whatsoever because it too signed up for sagarmatha shares in exchange for the moneys owed in the pic s case the disappearing and subordinated debt would be well over r1 billion this consists of loan debt and preference shares overdue for redemption this might explain why the pic liquidation application has seemingly languished since november 2019 although the asset manager would not be drawn on this when contacted by amabhungane in response to detailed questions the pic simply replied that this matter is indeed before the court in the sactwu case the union s claim is based on a default event that occurred when sim missed a repayment to the pic sim s first defence was that it didn t have to repay a non existent loan to understand how sactwu and the pic allegedly signed away hundreds of millions of rands belonging to workers and pensioners we have to return to 2017 the sagarmatha gambit by 2017 it was clear that independent media was struggling and that sim would not be able to repay the loans raised to fund the takeover but surve s sekunjalo group was paving the way for an audacious plan to expand its technology business and rescue its media business with several billion rands in new funding from the pic then still controlled by surve s friend dan matjila surve was going to list two companies on the jse ayo technology solutions and sagarmatha in the case of ayo r4 3 billion was successfully raised from the pic in a rushed process circumventing key safeguards and waiving protections to secure some part of the investment ayo did list but while the pic paid r43 00 per share they are now trading at r3 50 there is a court process underway where the pic is trying to recoup pensioners money a mere three months after ayo the listing of sagarmatha was being pushed through with a target of raising r7 5 billion from investors as with ayo it was very likely that the investors were in fact mainly the pic led by matjila both listings were effusively promoted by independent media but when subjected to outside scrutiny it was clear that the companies were not worth nearly what they claimed they intended to use the money principally to bail out buy or subsidise other surve companies in the case of the sagarmatha listing the intention was to pay off all sim and independent media s debt and also buy out minority shareholders including the pic and sactwu this would be done by giving everyone sagarmatha shares the pic would in effect be giving surve money and forgiving his debts to the pic in exchange for the shares which were given an extraordinary pre listing valuation as amabhungane revealed here kriel defended sig s acceptance of sagarmatha shares in exchange for the money it is owed and the 8 of sim it owns according to him the union accepted the value attached to the shares by sim itself sactwu did not conduct an independent evaluation or independent due diligence it relied on the representations of value made to it as subsequently confirmed by independent expert opinion of the value of the share price he told amabhungane in written replies the expert opinion kriel is referring to is one complied by a california company called redwood valuation partners and included in sagarmatha s pre listing documentation as amabhungane has previously reported this opinion was based on questionable financial and non financial information and assumptions made by management sign on the dotted line crucially both sactwu via sig and the pic allegedly entered into two agreements with sim in the run up to the listing one was the share and claims sale agreement and the other was a subordination agreement the share and claims deal was the one that would transform sig s r300 million loan into sagarmatha shares in the case of the pic more than r1 5 billion consisting of debts and shares would disappear to be replaced with sagarmatha shares kriel who also heads the union s investment company now claims he and his co directors never actually signed the agreement seemingly an opportunistic argument copies attached to the court papers show that kriel and his sactwu colleagues did initial every single page including the bottom corner of the final signature page they also all signed a board resolution approving the agreement on 22 november 2017 but no one actually signed the proverbial dotted line on the last page of the document as the designated representative of sactwu it might have been an oversight but the union has tried to exploit it as best it can in its court papers stating no director of the plaintiff executed the sale agreement and accordingly the sale agreement was not concluded and it did not take effect even though the agreement was expressly tied to the listing of sagarmatha it never expressly said that the listing had to succeed instead the effective date is the day the jse approves it and a notice is published on the stock exchange s news service sens that happened on 28 march 2018 the sagarmatha listing was aborted after the jse withdrew its approval based on technical shortcomings in meeting the listing requirements sactwu is now trying to argue its way around this apparently shoddy drafting on a proper construction or alternatively by virtue of a tacit term to the sale agreement if the listing did not occur on or about 6 april 2018 the effective date of the sale agreement would be deemed not to have occurred and the sale agreement would be regarded as being of no force or effect sig s claim states a r300 million phone call even if the sactwu and pic debt still exists sim argued that it cannot be made to repay it thanks to a remarkable subordination agreement sactwu signed as did the pic allegedly apart from sactwu and the pic sim has a major creditor in the form of a chinese consortium called interacom it is owed just shy of r1 billion which due to the subordination agreements ranks above the other funders debts if the pic really is bound by an agreement like this it could be another explanation for its half hearted liquidation application it would not receive any dividend from a liquidation the circumstances under which kriel signed the sig subordination agreement on 1 december 2017 are particularly embarrassing painting him as a naïve and incompetent manager of union members money according to sactwu s court papers it only took a phone call from takudzwa hove the chief operations officer of independent to convince kriel that the agreement was both necessary and harmless mr hove representing the first defendant orally made the following representations to mr kriel representing the plaintiff the subordination agreement would only be utilised by in the context and for the purpose of the listing of sagarmatha if and when the auditors of sagarmatha and or the johannesburg securities exchange jse required the plaintiff s claim to be subordinated for purposes of the listing of sagarmatha hove according to sactwu emphasised the subordination agreement would in any event lapse and be of no further force or effect one week after the date on which sagarmatha was scheduled to be listed on the jse exchange this of course didn t happen sactwu complained in addition to being false the representations made by mr hove were material and made by him on behalf of the first defendant with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to enter into the subordination agreement such error on the part of kriel was reasonable and justifiable entitling the plaintiff to resile from and terminate the subordination agreement according to sactwu using the subordination agreement to repudiate debts at this point exhibits bad faith constitutes unconscionable conduct on the part of the first defendant and would result in gross injustice or gross iniquity to the plaintiff the problem for sactwu and kriel is that the explicit terms of the agreement clearly opened the union to precisely this kind of danger it doesn t once mention the listing of sagarmatha instead it records that the subordination shall remain in force and effect for so long only as the liabilities of the company as fairly valued exceed its assets as fairly valued that means the subordination remains in place until sim s hopeless insolvency is reversed a very unlikely prospect after the sagarmatha listing got scuppered had the listing gone ahead the subordination really would have disappeared anyway but only because the debt itself would have been swopped for shares kriel maintains there is no way he could have suspected hove was allegedly lying sactwu firmly rejects your implied assertion of carelessness and or incompetence as its pleadings make plain material but false misrepresentations were made to sactwu and there was no reason at all for sactwu to doubt or call into question the representations made to it by a senior sim executive he told amabhungane there was certainly no reason at that time for sactwu to disbelieve the representations made by the chief financial officer of sim as a further defence he points out that a far larger and more sophisticated investor made the same mistake the gepf was the other significant loan creditor of sim there was certainly no indication from sim that the gepf had refused to sign its identical subordination agreement it has only subsequently transpired that the gepf has put in issue the validity of the execution of the subordination agreement executed on its behalf by former ceo considering the dire state of sim s finances sactwu may be hoping that the pic doesn t beat it to the punch to try to reclaim its substantially larger claim on iqbal surve s shrinking pockets source news24
the specter of terrifying volcanic eruptions is emblazoned in our imaginations from childhood an earth shattering explosion followed by gushing bursts of lava and billowing smoke the dangers of large scale volcanic eruptions are very real in the worst case scenario an extremely rare and powerful supervolcanic eruption might even devastate the planet but scientists now warn it wouldn t even take such an extreme outburst to trigger a global catastrophe according to new research much smaller scale volcanic events can still unleash sufficient chaos to imperil the modern world even a minor eruption in one of the areas we identify could erupt enough ash or generate large enough tremors to disrupt networks that are central to global supply chains and financial systems says global risk researcher lara mani from the university of cambridge at the moment calculations are too skewed towards giant explosions or nightmare scenarios when the more likely risks come from moderate events that disable major international communications trade networks or transport hubs moderate eruptions might not seize our attention quite as much as their more thunderous counterparts but they can wreak more havoc case in point the magnitude 6 eruption mount pinatubo in the philippines in 1991 was approximately 100 times more powerful than the magnitude 4 eruption of iceland s eyjafjallajökull in 2010 but eyjafjallajökull turned out to be most costly volcanic eruption in history with a damage bill of us 5 billion to the global economy whereas the losses from mount pinatubo s far greater eruption were only a fraction of that us 740 million in 2021 adjusted for inflation how is this imbalance possible mani and her team call it the vei gcr asymmetry a new kind of paradigm where the danger of volcanoes global catastrophic risk gcr doesn t rise in line with the power of volcanoes volcanic explosivity index vei historically assessments of volcanic risk have suggested that the more powerful a volcano s eruptions the greater a danger it presents in terms of global catastrophic risk a relationship that can be called vei gcr symmetry but this might not be the case any more as much of the world s critical infrastructure today including international shipping passages submarine telecommunications cables and aerial transportation routes is not especially close to the volcanic regions that produce the most powerful eruptions with a vei of 7 or 8 we observe that many of these critical infrastructures and networks converge in regions where they could be exposed to moderate scale volcanic eruptions vei 3 6 the researchers write in their study these regions of intersection or pinch points present localities where we have prioritized efficiency over resilience and manufactured a new global catastrophic risk landscape according to the team s analysis there are seven of these pinch points around the globe where critical infrastructure elements now lie dangerously close to vei 3 to 6 magnitude eruptions these include taiwan which produces a huge amount of the world s microchips the global supply of which is jeopardized by proximity to the tatun volcanic group tvg in the us moderate eruptions in the pacific northwest have the potential to disrupt trade and travel in both the us and canada causing massive economic harm meanwhile volcanoes in iceland have the potential to create a pinch point in the north atlantic disrupting aerial traffic between london and new york and causing serious delays for trade and transportation networks other international pinch points located in the mediterranean and around malaysia threaten some of the world s busiest shipping routes another located in the luzon strait is a key route for underwater telecommunications cables connecting china hong kong taiwan japan and south korea all of which could be damaged by eruptions causing submarine landslides and tsunamis causing severe disruptions to communications abilities and global financial markets these sorts of downstream consequences aren t the first things that spring to mind when we think of the destructive power of volcanoes but maybe they should be the researchers suggest it s time to change how we view extreme volcanic risk mani says we need to move away from thinking in terms of colossal eruptions destroying the world as portrayed in hollywood films the more probable scenarios involve lower magnitude eruptions interacting with our societal vulnerabilities and cascading us towards catastrophe the findings are reported in nature communications

by governments during the covid 19 pandemic the ebola clinical trial was sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of which fauci is director as one of then president trumpâ s chief medical advisers on covid 19 he must have known that remdesivir had aâ 50 death rate compared to 35 of two other drugs in the trial â and that serious side effects including at least one death led to the drug being pulled and research on it abandoned â did anthony fauci know about remdesivirâ s death rate oh you better believe it and now he was going to push this on the masses â ardis told the corona investigative committee organized by german american lawyer reiner fuellmich who specializes in the prosecution of fraudulent global corporations ardis said that fauci cited only the ebola trial and a study from remdesivirâ s manufacturer gilead sciences inc on just 53 covid 19 patients when he chose it as the leading contender to fight the pandemic virus gileadâ s â cohort studyâ conducted for â compassionate useâ on patients with covid 19 was only 28 days long it reported that of 61 patients treated with the drug eight were excluded for missing information â 32 60 of 53 remaining patients reported adverse events including increased liver enzymes diarrhea rash and kidney function impairment twelve patients 23 had â seriousâ adverse events including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome septic shock acute kidney injury and hypotension low blood pressure side effects or symptoms each of these symptoms â â multi organ failure â septic shock â acute kidney injuryâ andâ hypotensionâ â are described in medical literature as features of covid 19 itself ardis said that many baffling symptoms that doctors began attributing to sars co v2 the virus that causes covid 19 early in the pandemic were in fact side effects of the remdesivir used to treat it fauci â knew it for two years before he mandated this drug that it was deadly â ardis said â i call it fauciâ s genocide â wolfgang wodarg a physician politician and former head of the public health department in flensburg germany agreed with ardis that remdesivir is â very toxicâ and was misused for an uncertain diagnosis based on a pcr test that is now in question â they said â this is covid 19 they all die â but they killed them i think this is something like genocide â wodarg agreed curious rise remdisivirâ s rise to the top of covid 19 therapeutics is marked by many odd favors and chances just two days after sars co v2 was declared the cause of covid 19 on january 8 researchers from gilead the university of north carolina and vanderbilt university published aâ studyâ reporting that remdesivir could inhibit the related mers coronavirus in both test tubes and mice two weeks later doctors treated the first confirmed patient with covid 19 in the united states with remdesivir â which had never been authorized for any condition theyâ published in the new england journal of medicineâ that the 35 year old patient survived at the time it was reported as a triumph for the drug but current centers for disease control and prevention cdc data on theâ covid 19 infection fatality rateâ in 35 year olds is 0 0005 or 0 05 the man had a 99 5 chance of surviving his infection in any case the national institutes of health nih â announced on aprilâ 29 that an interim analysis from a large scale placebo controlled clinical trial found that remdesivir reduced the median time that severely ill hospitalized covid 19 patients took to recover from 15 days to 11 days there was no statistically significant impact on mortality â this will be the standard of care â â fauci said announcing the findings to reporters â when you know a drug works you have to let people in the placebo group know so they can take it â â what it has proven is a drug can block this virus â he said remarkably based on the slender data the niaid which is a division of nih made theâ â secretive and bureaucraticâ â decision to give the placebo group in the study remdesivir effectively ending any study of differences between the two groups mixed results fauci didnâ t mention to the public the results of a smaller placebo controlled study of remdesivir on hospitalized covid 19 patients in china â published on the same day in the lancet the study reported no statistically significant benefit from the drug which did not reduce viral load of infections either two days later the food and drug administration fda also failed to cite the chinese data when it granted remdesivir â brand named veklury â emergency use authorization eua status awaiting formal approval then president donald trumpâ held a press conference in the oval office with gilead ceo daniel oâ day celebrating the eua for the drug which he described as theâ â hot thingâ â in the media gilead soon announced itsâ price tagsâ for the drug in june 2 340 for a five day treatment course in developing nations and 3 120 in the u s by the end of the month then department of health and human services secretary alex azar said in a statement that trump had â struck an amazing dealâ to buy the drug at the lower rate and bought up all of the available remdesivir stock for american use only u s leads deaths it was during this time that america suffered the highest death rate from covid 19 in the globe ardis told the corona investigative committee â before may 10 the united states had a lower coronavirus death rate than other high mortality countries but after that date all six of the other high mortality countries belgium france the netherlands spain sweden and the united kingdom had lower death rates than the united states â according to anâ october 2020 reportâ from the center for infectious disease research and policy cidrap â very very bad look for the fdaâ many scientists were baffled by the meteoric rise of remdesivir which showed weak benefits at best in october just before the fda granted the drug final approval aâ world health organization studyâ found the drug didnâ t decrease mortality or hospital stays an article inâ scienceâ noted that the drug was approved in â unusualâ circumstances that gave gilead advantages no outside experts were consulted as was usual for the process for example the who data were ignored and gilead failed to report the dismal findings â even though it knew about them â to the european union as it negotiated prices a week before the study was publicized â this is a very very bad look for the fda and the dealings between gilead and eu make it another layer of badness â eric topol a cardiologist at the scripps research translational institute who objected to remdesivirâ s fda approval toldâ science bad look and mixed trial results aside gilead has been a big winner in the covid 19 pandemic hauling in record breaking profits last week the drug company reported its second quarter 2021 revenue ofâ 6 2 billionâ increased 21 compared to the same period in 2020 â primarily due to vekluryâ remdesivir â longer hospital stays scientists and studies continue to back and forth over vekluryâ s benefits and reported serious side effects including kidney and liver failure even as the drugâ s use has expanded to pregnant women and minors dozens ofâ clinical trialsâ of remdesivir are still underway a number of case reports describe remdesivir side effects oneâ published in februaryâ describes a 36 year old hospitalized covid patient who developed a slow heartbeat after taking the drug and recovered when it was discontinued â considering the frequent use of remdesivir in patients with covid 19 physicians should be aware of this possible adverse event â the researchers concluded anotherâ case reportâ describes a 64 year old whose remdesivir treatment for covid 19 was stopped with evidence of liver injury from the drug aâ meta analysisâ of nine of 680 published studies on the drugâ s use in covid 19 published in january reported that it decreased mortality but a study published last month inâ the journal of the american medical association infectious diseasesâ reported that remdesivir use in u

advisor returns as of august 9 2021 it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to evan loh chief executive officer evan evan loh chief executive officer thank you paul good afternoon and thank you all for joining our second quarter earnings and corporate update call paratek remains focused on excellence in operational execution and delivery against our stated corporate priorities in order to generate value for patients and our shareholders accordingly we remain confident that our efforts in 2021 will firmly establish the foundation for the continued and long term commercial growth of nuzyra and demonstrate continued forward progress in all aspects of the barda bioshield public private partnership which is designed to develop nuzyra as a novel medical countermeasure for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax as you can see from this next slide nuzyra s quarter over quarter growth continued into the second quarter of this year generating a total of 52 8 million in net u s sales this revenue includes 14 9 million from the core nuzyra commercial business a 13 increase over the first quarter of 2021 and an 84 increase over the second quarter of 2020 we believe this quarter over quarter growth was not only a significant achievement in this volatile and rapidly evolving healthcare setting but serves as a reflection of the clinical importance of positive patient outcomes with nuzyra and the overall strength of our commercial business the balance of the 52 8 million in net u s sales was secured from the first barda procurement delivered and accepted by barda in june of this year accordingly paratek recorded revenue of 37 9 million from this procurement in the second quarter of this year our confidence in the long term commercial success of nuzyra remains unabated based upon the strong foundation of demand for nuzyra that our sales and marketing teams have established in the first two years of the commercial launch which focused solely on the hospital care setting in early 2021 based upon performance data from a focused primary care sales pilot program conducted in the second half of last year we expanded our commercial promotion into the primary care setting to date early signals of the trial and adoption in the community launch appear promising and augur well for future long term growth as seen on this next slide the monthly commercial revenue curve continues to validate that nuzyra s commercial performance to date represents one of the most successful antibiotics launched in the last five years the nuzyra commercial launch dynamics continue to materially differentiate from any other iv oral antibiotic launches we believe that the strength of the commercial business is driven by disciplined operational execution combined with nuzyra s many clinically important product attributes that include first broad spectrum efficacy including resistant pathogens across two common indications second a favorable safety profile consistent with nuzyra s tetracycline heritage and third convenient once daily oral and iv formulations that enables nuzyra s utility in multiple settings of care we anticipate that the positive growth trajectory of the core nuzyra commercial business will continue through the balance of this year given the encouraging inbound feedback from the primary care based physicians who have consistently articulated the need for a well tolerated once daily oral broad spectrum antibiotic that includes coverage against mrsa for skin infections further we believe that this community expansion will materially benefit from the additional long term value of the recently fda approved oral only regimen in pneumonia for nuzyra adam will provide more details on the community expansion during his prepared remarks in addition to the continued growth and success of the commercial business we are focused on three foundational catalysts beyond the community expansion for the nuzyra u s launch that we believe will create near and long term value for paratek all of these having occurred in the second quarter of this year first as a continued validation of the broad based commitment of barda to this unique bioshield funded public private partnership we were excited to announce that barda has accepted delivery of the first procurement of nuzyra valued at 37 9 million second in late may of this year we received fda approval of our nuzyra snda for the oral loading dose regimen in pneumonia we believe that this will be an important catalyst that will broaden and further expand the commercial growth opportunity for nuzyra in both the hospital outpatient and primary care settings we plan to launch the second community based indication as we enter this year s fall winter pneumonia season third the initiation in june of this year of a phase 2b study for nuzyra in a rare disease pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterium abscessus for which there are no approved therapies to further support the need for additional clinical research two recognized ntm experts who are also ntm treatment guideline authors collaborated on a recently published review article that expands on the current guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary mycobacterium abscessus infections these authors included omadacycline in their recommended ntm abscessus treatment options and also noted that additional clinical studies in this disease are desperately needed randy will provide more details on our ntm program later in his prepared remarks i would also like to note an important recognition of the clinical utility of nuzyra that occurred in july and another potential future milestone anticipated in the second half of this year that we believe will create longer term value for paratek first last month in july cdc s guideline for the treatment and prophylaxis of plague was updated to include nuzyra the addition of nuzyra to the cdc guidelines provides further validation now across multiple agencies including beyond cdc fda and barda within the department of health and human services of the potential utility of nuzyra against pathogens that cause health and bioterrorism security threats such as anthrax and plague a second event or milestone which we anticipate will occur later this year is the approval of nuzyra in china the approval in china will trigger a 6 million milestone payment from zai lab and will make nuzyra available in one of the largest antibiotic markets in the world today it is important to note that both of these last two catalysts remind us that antibiotics are truly global products we cannot forget that antimicrobial resistance is an ongoing pandemic that requires innovation such as that represented by nuzyra in order to stay ahead of bacteria s ability to create new mechanisms of resistance before i hand the call over to adam i would now like to provide paratek s second quarter 2021 financial highlights second quarter 2021 total revenue was 57 5 million which is comprised of the following nuzyra generated 52 8 million in net u s sales during the second quarter of 2021 this revenue is comprised of first 14 9 million from the core commercial business which represents a 13 increase over the first quarter of 2021 and an 84 increase over the second quarter of 2020 and importantly 37 9 million from the first of our broader procurements government contract service and grant revenue earned from costs incurred under the barda contract was 4 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 0 9 million in the second quarter of 2020 we anticipate a modest step up in contract service and grant revenue earned under the barda contract as we move through the year driven by activities associated with the u s onshoring of nuzyra manufacturing the continued enrollment of the fda post marketing required study in pneumonia and further progress of the preclinical in vitro studies and large animal pharmacokinetic or pk studies in the anthrax program research and development expenses were 6 5 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 4 6 million for the same period in the prior year the increase in r d expenses for the second quarter of 2021 was primarily due to 4 2 million in costs that were reimbursed under the barda contract which included costs for the u s onshoring of nuzyra manufacturing and for fda post marketing requirements which includes the preparatory work for the pediatric studies with nuzyra in addition to the ongoing pneumonia study the remaining increase is mainly the result of start up costs incurred for the phase 2b ntm abscessus study selling general and administrative expenses were 27 1 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 21 million for the same period in the prior year the increase in sg a expense is primarily the result of costs incurred for the nuzyra community expansion and an increase in stock based compensation expense due to the probability and timing of the achievement of performance based vesting milestones paratek reported net income of 9 7 million or 0 20 of earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of 23 1 million or 0 53 loss per share for the same period in 2020 as of june 30 2021 paratek had 75 3 million in cash and cash equivalents based upon our current operating plan we anticipate our existing cash and cash equivalents plus the 37 9 million received from barda in july of this year for the first procurement of nuzyra provides for a cash runway through the end of 2023 with a pathway to cash flow breakeven i would now like to turn the call over to adam adam adam woodrow president and chief commercial officer thanks evan the commercialization of nuzyra continues to progress well with consistent quarter over quarter growth seen since launch despite continued access challenges due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic as you can see from slide 11 nuzyra core commercial net revenue grew 13 in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of this year more than double the rate of growth compared to the prior quarter nuzyra gross demand increased from 14 6 million in the first quarter of 2021 to 18 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 an increase in 4 million in total thus growth continues to be driven by demand nuzyra s once daily well tolerated oral and intravenous formulations combined with nuzyra s broad spectrum profile offers a much needed new life saving antibiotic that is uniquely positioned to be applicable in every setting of care from the hospital and its potential to minimize hospital stays to the community where there is a tremendous unmet need for a well tolerated once daily oral broad spectrum antibiotic that includes coverage against mrsa for skin infections these attributes in addition to having an approval in two common indications have enabled nuzyra s launch to materially differentiate itself from other recent iv oral antibiotics launched in the united states as discussed in previous calls our initial strategy was to launch into hospitals focusing on the key influencers in the antibiotic sector that being infectious disease physicians in parallel we worked with the payers to gain favorable access in the outpatient community setting as we enter 2021 roughly two years after launch over 85 of our business was generated by hospital based physicians with iv doctors making up approximately 70 of our prescriber base this validates the need for effective iv oral antibiotics for patients hospitalized with serious community acquired infections or cabp today we continue our focus on growing our hospital business we are however cognizant that hospitals continue to provide physical access challenges as they did for much of 2020 and these challenges are greater than those seen in the primary care setting we ve also found formulary and stewardship committees remain distracted and focused on covid 19 and while face to face sales representative access to physicians in hospitals has clearly improved during 2020 it is difficult to predict when the hospitals will fully open up in the meantime our hospital team continues to execute on its hybrid model which entails successfully working virtually and in the adjacent sites of care where the more impactful face to face access is more readily gained this strategy has enabled us to maintain our growth trajectory as we see new accounts adopt nuzyra for specific patient types such as patients with pneumonia and a high risk of c diff infection or for patients with a skin infection and multiple comorbidities or allergies as highlighted on this slide at the beginning of 2021 having established iv endorsement and good patient access to nuzyra in the community we started recruiting a field force to expand promotion into the 2 2 billion total addressable market for skin infections in the community current generic antibiotic options in the community setting are universally challenged by either significant bacterial resistance or serious safety concerns limiting their utility during q2 2021 we met our goal of 40 fully trained primary care specialists detailing our oral only skin indication to a target audience of community based physicians made up of primary care doctors podiatrists and a select group of high prescribing dermatologists our sales message is to provide primary care physicians with a treatment option for serious skin infections that can potentially avoid the need for hospitalization start at home stay at home with nuzyra once a day resonates with physicians in today s covid 19 environment after an initial settling in period this team is performing well and prescriptions are tracking to the plan we developed based on the pilot program we ran in 2020 we have also recently received positive feedback on the reception of a small community based medical science liaison team that randy will provide more details on later in the call the second quarter has also confirmed our initial utilization expectations in the community where we see primary care physicians and podiatrists in particular trial nuzyra earlier more frequently and after fewer sales calls when compared to hospital based ivs or pulmonologists we assume the faster uptake in the primary care setting is likely the result of the absence of stewardship committees and formulary restrictions found in the hospitals as well as the tremendous unmet need in the community for a new effective and well tolerated oral antibiotic in the skin indication the key to success in the primary care setting are ensuring access to nuzyra for a patient and fulfilling prescriptions in a timely manner with that said we are particularly pleased with our progress in the payer environment between the insured patients and the medicare patient population where we see the vast majority of our prescriptions we now have over 132 million lives covered with limited or no restrictions but perhaps what is more important is that after completing the benefits investigations our specialty network is able to fulfill approximately 95 of all prescriptions written usually within 24 hours and regardless of payer coverage status our objective in the primary care setting moving forward is to fine tune our community targeting strategy based on the characteristics of the initial trialists and their utilization data to accelerate initial trial and repeat usage we continue to evaluate this significant opportunity for further expansion and are looking forward to the launch in the fall of the cabp oral indication which we estimate to have a total addressable market worth some 1 5 billion in summary we anticipate the momentum in hospitals and primary care will continue through 2021 and expect to see continued growth as we launch our newly approved oral only dosing for cabp in the fall and maintain our focus on gaining new trialists and repeat usage by building awareness and establishing trust and credibility with physicians who are saving lives and treating serious community infections every day and with that i d now like to turn the call over to randy randy brenner chief development and regulatory officer thanks adam let me start with some updates regarding our barda program as you heard from evan a few minutes ago we were excited to announce that barda accepted delivery of the first procurement of 2 500 anthrax treatment courses of nuzyra valued at 37 9 million upon completion of the delivery of the first procurement barda asked paratek to be a distribution partner for nuzyra should an anthrax attack and outbreak occur paratek has agreed to partner with barda on this work and our current contract was modified last week to include an additional scope of work and funding for this effort should the united states government trigger a distribution request we are excited to expand this partnership in the distribution phase and use paratek s distribution infrastructure and network to further play a part in protecting americans with regards to the timing of future procurements as we noted last month these will be linked to specific development milestones barda s confirmed to us that satisfactory top line data from the pilot efficacy study for the treatment of anthrax in rabbits will trigger the next procurement we expect to have top line data in hand by the second half of 2022 together with barda we continue to make great progress on the animal rule development program for anthrax efforts this year are focused on the evaluation of pharmacokinetics of omadacycline in both rabbit and nonhuman primate animal models for inhalation anthrax a pk study in rabbits was completed earlier this year a second pk study in rabbits and an initial pk study in monkeys is planned for the fall with regards to our barda sponsored onshoring program we are pleased to report on its continued progress in collaboration with barda all of our onshoring partners have now been selected paratek and our u s onshoring partners have completed the knowledge transfer and initial analytical and process development work for our api process additionally we have ordered the necessary equipment and began construction of the facilities to enable commercial production of omadacycline api work is also ongoing at the partners for our u s drug product facilities where we have similarly completed the knowledge transfer and initial analytical and process development for omadacycline tablets and we ll move forward with the engineering phase of this project later this year for the omadacycline iv drug product we ve selected our u s onshoring partner and are in the beginning phase of the project barda continues to partner with paratek to fund our fda post marketing commitments recall that this contract line item is valued at approximately 77 million and includes reimbursement for our ongoing adult pneumonia iv to oral post marketing study commitment as well as reimbursement of our pediatric and microbiologic surveillance programs following omadacycline s placement on fda s essential medicines list last year in july nuzyra was added to the cdc s updated guideline on antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of plague recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response the addition of nuzyra provides further validation across multiple agencies within the department of health and human services of the potential utility of nuzyra against pathogens that can cause health and bioterrorism security threats such as anthrax and plague plague is a disease that affects humans and other mammals it is caused by the bacteria yersinia pestis humans usually get plague after being bitten by a rodent flea that is carrying the plague bacterium by handling an animal infected with plague or inhalation of infected droplets if not identified and treated with an effective antibiotic plague can be rapidly fatal it is present in the u s today and cases are most commonly reported in the western and southwestern states including arizona california colorado new mexico and texas where wild rodents carry the bacteria and represent a surrogate for human infection risk consistent with our commitment to build nuzyra s long term value we continue to actively pursue life cycle initiatives for nuzyra in may we received fda approval of our snda for the oral loading dose regimen of community bacterial pneumonia which was a big milestone for the program this achievement as noted by both evan and adam will augment the community launch as we enter into the second half of the year and the pneumonia season approaches in addition we have continued to advance our clinical development program for nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease caused by mycobacterium abscessus or ntm as a reminder pulmonary ntm abscessus is a rare and orphan disease with no fda approved therapies inbound feedback from the kol community has continued to highlight the clinical unmet need for an efficacious and well tolerated once daily oral antibiotic to treat infections caused by mycobacterium abscessus based upon our internal market analytics pulmonary mycobacterium abscessus represents a 1 billion addressable market in the u s alone start up activities for our phase 2b clinical study for treatment of pulmonary ntm with omadacycline are underway clinical sites for this study are actively prescreening patients and we anticipate initiation of patient enrollment soon as a reminder the study is a three month randomized placebo controlled monotherapy design that will enroll approximately 75 patients with pulmonary ntm infections caused by mycobacterium abscessus as this is a rare disease enrollment is estimated to take approximately two years this study will provide much needed placebo controlled trial data in mycobacterium abscessus patients most recently two ntm experts who are also ntm treatment guideline authors collaborated on a recently published review article that expands on the current treatment guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary mycobacterium abscessus infections the authors included additional agents which are highlighted in green on this slide including omadacycline in their recommended treatment options based on omadacycline s potent in vitro activity and reports of clinical success in real world case series in particular the authors highlighted the potential of the oral formulation of omadacycline given the lack of currently available oral treatment options and listed it first in order of preference for the new oral options they included the authors also noted that clinical trials in this disease are urgently needed thus the excitement we have for our randomized study in ntm abscessus that we ve just initiated in addition to ntm data generation will continue to expand throughout 2021 through multiple avenues first we continue to generate data with our partners within the u s government and one of the in vitro biothreat studies has resulted in an abstract that was accepted at idweek second additional evidence continues from our growing iir program this includes study of c difficile infections bone and joint infections and ntm both mac and mycobacterium abscessus two iirs have completed this year and nine are currently underway from our iir program we have three abstracts that have been accepted at eccmid or idweek with one lead author receiving the idweek training award for the abstract and third real world evidence from three ongoing observational studies and independent case series continue to be presented at conferences and published in peer reviewed journals that describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with challenging infections particularly in ntm and osteomyelitis that receive omadacycline as a therapeutic agent a real world retrospective claims analysis is underway that assesses the patterns of inpatient and outpatient antibiotic utilization in cabp and skin this study will generate a series of publications with the first abstract of nuzyra to be presented at idweek 2021 later this year all of this work has resulted in the acceptance of 11 manuscripts for publication this year that address the use of nuzyra in special pathogens populations or disease states and will further define its unique therapeutic profile the medical affairs team has several activities planned to further support the community launch and the expansion of scientific education into this new healthcare base this includes the placement of a small number of targeted community based education medical science liaisons to further augment the primary care launch through scientific exchange we have strategically placed them in densely populated metropolitan areas with a large presence of primary care practitioners education will focus on community antimicrobial resistant trends associated with the community acquired pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections the most up to date clinical care algorithms for these infections coupled with the most pressing unmet needs associated with their treatment options as you know we also have an ongoing omadacycline nda review in china and i m pleased to note that the regulatory process continues to make good progress with the approval expected later this year which would trigger a 6 million milestone payment from zai lab to paratek we believe that the china approval and launch as well as the additional data generation opportunities being pursued by paratek will further broaden the potential for nuzyra to reach into new and clinically important patient populations at this point we would now like to open the line for questions questions answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session we will pause for a moment as callers join the queue the first question is from ed arce from h c wainwright please go ahead ed arce h c wainwright co analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the continued progress this quarter three questions for me firstly you had mentioned for the barda contract this next procurement is upon the data from rabbits expected in the second half of next year i m wondering if that would trigger the second procurement or is there any other before then and that s the only one that we have visibility to in the timeline and then secondly the community launch upon the start of the pneumonia season i m wondering if you could give us a little more detail around exactly when activities would ramp up for that and i know you mentioned msls and some of those being placed in densely populated areas but exactly what kind of activity do you think could best explain how you expect to really reach the physicians there and then lastly with the ntm enrollment expected to take about two years is there any expectation for perhaps any interim data or any related publications before then related to ntm thanks so much evan loh chief executive officer ed it s evan thank you very much for the questions so with regards to the next procurement maybe i ll have randy address that question randy brenner chief development and regulatory officer sure so yes so thanks ed yes your statement is correct that the data readout in the second half of next year regarding the pilot rabbit treatment efficacy study is in relation to the next procurement or what we refer to sometimes as the second procurement we re still in discussions with barda over the definition of progress and how the third and fourth procurements will be what they ll be linked to and we ll certainly share that once those discussions are complete evan loh chief executive officer and i think since you re already speaking randy maybe you could take ed through his third question which is around the ntm trial and any visibility on interim data or publications randy brenner chief development and regulatory officer yeah so as of now ed it is a placebo controlled randomized trial with no plans for interim analyses built into that that being said we do anticipate not from our phase 2b study but from much of what i mentioned with regards to ongoing activities within iirs and other case series being published that during the course of this clinical program there ll be multiple ntm publications related to omadacycline and its use in that patient population that will be coming out periodically over time evan loh chief executive officer yes fair to say that the mike rybak database is probably going to be the largest one right randy randy brenner chief development and regulatory officer yes i mean that s part of our iir program evan loh chief executive officer yes ok adam other features of what activity you re planning for the community launch to ensure that we can reach the appropriate physicians adam woodrow president and chief commercial officer yes thanks ed so you asked when we re going to start well we ve obviously been looking at this for some time now and right now we ve just finalized our messaging and our materials for our representatives we ve got all of our training programs put in place our representatives are being briefed at the end of this month into september and they will obviously be fully trained on the oral only dosing regime in addition we ve got an education that we ll be doing through the community based msls just a small team but there s a good education that needs to be done and can be completed by them we are also targeting obviously community based pulmonologists they will be added to the target list of our specialty representatives and also we will be selecting high prescribing respiratory primary care doctors that will be added to the core list that at the present time is really very much focused on skin the story is simple and will be kicked off in september in time for the flu campaign and we ll share more details of exactly what we ve done at the next call evan loh chief executive officer and then ed just to add because you specifically asked about the msls i can tell you in the few months that they ve been out there the enthusiasm from the primary care physicians has been terrific and they are thrilled to learn about antibiotic resistance i think we ve been a little surprised how little these physicians are aware of even the resistance numbers and resistance patterns within their own regions they re welcoming the opportunity to continue to educate themselves on treatment paradigms resistance patterns and other things so the msl experience to date in the community has been really really positive and we anticipate that excitement to only continue to grow ed arce h c wainwright co analyst fantastic thanks so much operator the next question is from suji jeong from jefferies please go ahead suji jeong jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter could you share with us your current strategy or thoughts for the commercial allocation for nuzyra in europe and also my second question is currently what percentage of those scripts come from the off label use thank you evan loh chief executive officer so suji i ll take the first part with regards to europe as you recall when we actually submitted our maa we utilized the exact same database that we used that was fda approved and ema requested a second pneumonia study and thus we are conducting that second pneumonia study because of the fact that our analytics told us that the eminent need was primarily in terms of resistant pathogens in the pneumonia sector we decided to withdraw our application and we had initially planned to await the results of that second pneumonia trial the other exciting aspect of europe that we think is a big opportunity as well as we ve explored the rare disease ntm we ve learned that in fact there is as much ntm there in the european theater as there is in the u s it is truly a global disease and we think that there may be an opportunity here to leverage the randomized phase 2b data as a way to open the door to have further discussions with the ema specifically about what development and registration program would look like for ntm in addition to the other indications that we had originally sought adam do you want to take adam woodrow president and chief commercial officer yes i ll pick that up evan so suji you asked the question about what percentage of our business is off label as we went into this year about half of our business was off label as we promote to infectious disease consultants for skin and pneumonia they tend to use our drug in other indications notably sort of osteo and some ntm we re now obviously migrating and adding to that with promotion in primary care and we re seeing a steady increase in the utilization for skin in the primary care setting with that promotion which is starting to eat into the sort of i suppose proportion of our business that is off label the reason for that being that primary care physicians tend to stay on label in terms of their utilization so right now it s probably about 50 50 but i would expect that that will come down and we ll end up with a mix of about 60 40 probably as we go into 2022 evan loh chief executive officer yes suji just as one other addition to my earlier comments when you look at the strategy that we undertook specifically about withdrawing the application it was important for us to be able to preserve the maximum amount of market exclusivity and as you know the clock starts ticking on your initial indication which could have been for the skin indication which we thought was less valuable ultimately for us as well and we do think that as we consider a rare disease opportunity like ntm i think that there is going to be recognition for i think the innovation and the value of that provides in a rare disease and orphan setting suji jeong jefferies analyst i see great thank you operator the next question is from robert hazlett from btig please go ahead robert hazlett btig anlayst yes thanks apologies if you ve commented on this but maybe adam or evan you could comment on the physician access for your sales force is it normalized at this point and are you expecting any potential wobbliness with regard to that as different covid variants kind of course their way through the system if you commented my apologies adam woodrow president and chief commercial officer no i sort of mentioned it in my commentary bert hospital access is still not where we would love it to be which is back to where it was pre covid it s still restricted quite significantly in some parts of the country it s geographically dispersed and it s really difficult to predict where that s going to go for exactly the reason you re intimating the new guidelines and changes i don t think actually help us at this present time having said that the access in the primary care setting with our primary care field force is very very good and even the hospital team continue to work successfully in the adjacent sites of care and through a sort of remote setting evan loh chief executive officer yes and i think the other aspect of the primary care access that i think is important to us is the fact that as adam has described in the past i think that there is just a very a much larger search field to actually find physicians that have patients that have the unmet need that nuzyra can provide in addition to that i think our specialty pharmacy approach has really i think risen to the occasion in terms of optimizing its performance with regards to ensuring fulfillment mostly within a 24 hour period of time for individuals that receive prescriptions for nuzyra and that s even generally in the case of accounts even on the medicare side where we don t have formulary listing we do have enough of the trusting relationship there with those physicians and the providers where positive patient outcomes is really continuing to be very much aligned with what they are trying to deliver as well as what we care about most robert hazlett btig anlayst just one more related component so you commented on it earlier i think with regard to the resistance data that you re providing is that resonating as it used to in days of old with different antibiotics i d love to just hear how that s playing out in the field evan loh chief executive officer adam adam woodrow president and chief commercial officer yes i can answer that because i ve been to some recent advisory boards it s fascinating but actually in the pneumonia space because there s not been anybody in there the physicians are blissfully unaware of how poor the susceptibility is for strep pneumo for example with the oral antibiotics that they prescribe so there is a little bit of education to do there which is what we were mentioning earlier on having said that of course one of the benefits is that we get a significant share of voice in that space where we ll be the sort of first once a day drug in that space in some time for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia and the skin space they re far more aware of it because there s been a number of products that have promoted the challenges with oral drugs with our mrsa coverage so cabp is a greenfield site for us and really they are shocked and surprised when they see how poor the oral drugs are i mean you have to remember that they re using drugs that are between sort of 25 and 50 years old and the resistance rates vary from sort of 50 to 20 at the best and so we really do provide a highly efficacious alternative in a package that appears to have really good safety data evan loh chief executive officer i think bert another data point maybe i ll have randy comment on is the feedback that we have from our small focused msl interactions with the primary care docs randy brenner chief development and regulatory officer yes i mean it s very similar to what adam just mentioned most of them are aware of antimicrobial resistance i mean obviously they hear about it just like everybody else does and knows it exists and also very much aware of mrsa and immersed in the challenges around there but in the pneumonia space in particular there is the lack of understanding why patients they get zipans two or three times keep coming back and it s not working and equating that to as adam said that 25 to 45 or 50 resistance rates that exist for many of the generic antibiotics so in the community it s definitely a message that docs are aware of but the education is certainly helping them understand how bad the resistance patterns are in the different regions that we re talking to them in robert hazlett btig anlayst thanks appreciate the color i look forward gaining traction as you really lean into the oral sales effort thanks evan loh chief executive officer thank you bert operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to evan loh for any closing remarks evan loh chief executive officer in closing i would like to thank you all for your time and attention today your continued interest in nuzyra and paratek are important to us the journey of making nuzyra a commercial success is well underway as the wealth of microbiologic data and clinical outcome studies on nuzyra continues to expand we are increasingly confident in the potential of nuzyra to be an effective and a much needed addition to the armamentarium of antibiotics available to physicians to save lives in multiple settings of care the opportunities ahead of us to be able to provide a novel life saving antibiotic to patients motivates us all at paratek we look forward to keeping you apprised of our continued progress goodbye for now operator duration 45 minutes call participants paul arndt lifesci advisors evan

522 note to supplemental financial information adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda ffo and normalized ffo and where appropriate their corresponding per share metrics are non gaap financial measures the company believes that these measures are important operating measures that supplement discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations and are used to review and assess operating performance of the company and its properties and their management teams the company believes that it is useful to provide investors lenders and security analysts disclosures of its results of operations on the same basis that is used by management ffo in particular is a widely accepted non gaap supplemental measure of performance of real estate companies grounded in the standards for ffo established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and impairment of depreciable real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis ebitda adjusted ebitda and normalized ffo are useful as supplemental measures of performance of the company s properties because such measures do not take into account depreciation and amortization or with respect to ebitda the impact of the company s tax provisions and financing strategies because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land this accounting presentation assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes at a level rate over time because of the unique structure design and use of the company s properties management believes that assessing performance of the company s properties without the impact of depreciation or amortization is useful the company may make adjustments to ffo from time to time for certain other income and expenses that it considers non recurring infrequent or unusual even though such items may require cash settlement because such items do not reflect a necessary or ordinary component of the ongoing operations of the company normalized ffo excludes the effects of such items the company calculates adjusted net income by adding to gaap net income expenses associated with the company s debt repayments and refinancing transactions m a activity and certain impairments and other charges that the company believes are unusual or non recurring to provide an alternative measure of comparing operating performance for the periods presented even though expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions may be recurring the magnitude and timing fluctuate based on the timing and scope of m a activity and therefore such expenses which are not a necessary component of the ongoing operations of the company may not be comparable from period to period other companies may calculate adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda ffo and normalized ffo differently than the company does or adjust for other items and therefore comparability may be limited adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda ffo and normalized ffo and where appropriate their corresponding per share measures are not measures of performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net income as indicators of the company s operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap this data should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its filings with the

the new report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the un panel of experts who carry the responsibility of synthesising knowledge and key messages from the most credible sources of climate science comes at a critical moment with three months to go to the cop26 summit in glasgow extreme weather events are wreaking havoc globally including across europe china india siberia and the united states the piercing wake up call we need the report is stark but unequivocal widespread and rapid changes in the climate driven by warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are causing accelerating disruption in every region across the world the five co 2 emissions scenarios outlined in the report are especially revealing the five potential pathways ranging from a future with ambitious emissions cuts to carrying on business as usual show that global warming of 2 c above 1850 1900 levels the upper limit set by the paris agreement will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades with an immediate step change to that effect the report outlines where we are headed in terms of global temperatures even under the least damaging scenario the best estimate involves temperatures exceeding the critical 1 5 c guardrail in the middle of the century before dropping under that level by 2100 the other options frankly don t bear thinking about keeping hope limiting warming to 1 5 c is still within reach while the report makes for sober reading it is the war cry we need world leaders to hear there must be deep and rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions starting now the ipcc s special report on 1 5 c made it clear that the consequences of exceeding that level of warming will be severe a fact underscored dramatically by the recent wave of extreme weather events at our current level of around 1 2 c the ipcc s new report shows the 1 5 c goal is not lost we can still get there but we need to act fast as i discussed in a recent blog g20 and ministerial level meetings over the past month showed promise with governments putting more political weight behind the 1 5 c goal this new report from the ipcc should add to this resolve by world leaders which is critical for vulnerable countries most affected by the changes in the climate reinforcing the need for adaptation and attention for loss and damage while much of the public reaction to the report has been on how we can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change the report has an important message on adaptation and loss and damage it reiterates that no matter which scenario you look at the stock of greenhouse gases already locked into the system is already causing widespread devastation and will continue to do so regardless of rapid decarbonisation efforts the report states that past emissions have already led to unavoidable future changes in ocean temperature and sea level rise these changes are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales with further global warming every region will increasingly experience climate impacts with impacts more widespread at warming of 2 c than 1 5c and even more widespread and pronounced for higher warming levels this is a timely reminder of the need to increase support and finance for adaptation and to step up financial and technical support for vulnerable countries experiencing loss and damage pressure mounts on g20 countries to step up these ipcc reports are hugely significant they are signed off by 195 national governments with their technical experts contributing to it reviewing it and shaping it these governments cannot look at this report and disregard it they have helped develop it and the messages within it will also stimulate social movements and climate activists to redouble their cries for radical change the report reiterates the urgent need for g20 countries to step up to submit more ambitious ndcs as agreed at their recent g20 meeting in italy and to make long term strategies for rigorous decarbonisation of economies a mandatory requirement all before cop26 rapid phase out of coal power and ending coal finance need more ambitious action from g20 countries than we are currently seeing as does the ending of public subsidies to fossil fuel industries even the traditionally cautious international energy agency has called for an immediate stop to all new fossil fuel supply projects as part of its proposed pathway to a global energy system with net zero emissions by 2050 further the climate finance delivery plan to reach the promised us 100bn per year being developed by germany and canada is a welcome move but the plan needs to be believable climate vulnerable countries have waited long enough for this support and as the science shows continue to suffer the impacts of climate change in the meantime the science speaks for itself the ipcc report is a reminder of the systemic challenge of the climate crisis and its far reaching impacts the need to address this challenge requires a multi pronged approach that looks at the interlinkages with nature and biodiversity energy transport urban development livelihoods social justice and much more the report s findings come at a critical moment in this super year journey world leaders must listen to the science the decisions they take this year will be make or break for climate nature and people in the coming decades science must inform that legacy

and local supply chain issues up until now beeks has provided a private cloud product with a level of shared network infrastructure hosted in the beeks domain explains mcarthur although we were having great meetings with banks and the bigger financial institutions who love our message and our agility we kept bumping our head against the issue of internal controls using shared networks the shared infrastructure platform was causing problems with security data access and data sovereignty says mcarthur these may not be so significant in the generic cloud but they are show stoppers in the financial sector replacing shared infrastructure through a dedicated client owned environment was key its single user interface has been designed to help customers manage their own capacity from end to end with ease scaling up and down or deploying and removing services is effortless the platform can be hosted by beeks within any of the world s leading financial data centres and take advantage of

solutions optimised specifically for capital markets and financial services that allow customers to consume compute storage and analytics through managed hosting public cloud services or on premise

tested over the last decade we are one of the only firms in the world with dedicated expertise in building networking and automating private virtual machines and analytics for the financial markets in that sense proximity cloud is not a new product it s an iteration of all the components we ve spent the last ten years building and automating all brought together in a plug and play package what is new is the software layer that brings all the components together and enables point and click management through a brand new user interface

in april 2019 the investment arm of the south african clothing and textile workers union sactwu hit sekunjalo independent media sim with a r295 6 million claim for failing to repay debts related to the buyout of independent media in 2013 sim is the company through which survé controls the newspaper group while sactwu investments group sig is one of the minority shareholders of sim that gave survé r150 million to fund the 2013 takeover with interest this debt has doubled and constitutes 15 of the union company s assets one of the larger funders the public investment corporation pic has also launched a separate liquidation application sim was due to repay the debt and interest by 14 august 2020 subject to sig being entitled to demand immediate repayment in the case of a default event on 8 april 2019 sactwu s lawyers wrote to sim calling up the loan and citing the admissions made by survé at the mpati commission of inquiry into the affairs of the pic that independent media had failed to repay its multi billion rand debt to both the pic and the government employees pension fund sim disputed the claim but it has already taken more than two years for the case to get to court in part because sim resisted disclosing internal documents that might help sactwu prove its claim in december last year sactwu was finally forced to launch a separate court case to compel sim to disclose information things came to a head with a court date set for 5 may this year for sig s application to force sim to hand over documents not for the actual claim days before going to court sim came forward with most of the outstanding information sought and the parties abruptly settled the dispute around documents this had the effect of keeping evidently sensitive information about the ailing independent media group out of court and consequently out of the public eye from the court papers that have been filed in the western cape high court survé s company comes across as cynically exploiting the trust or naivety of its partners to sidestep the r300 million debt sim failed to acknowledge questions or answer them despite assurances from its pr company that they had been received on the other side of the coin the papers suggest the union was easily taken for a ride and that it was poorly served by its general secretary andré kriel who signed the agreements on behalf of sig taken for a ride sim s pleadings in response to sig s claim seem to lay bare how survé ran circles around sactwu allegedly getting the union to sign away its entire r300 million debt and 8 shareholding in sim in exchange for shares in another survé company sagarmatha technologies that turned out to be practically worthless even if the debt still existed kriel signed a separate subordination agreement putting the debt at the back of a queue of very significant creditors meaning that the debt will almost certainly never have to be repaid what s more sim claims that africa s largest asset manager and custodian of all civil servants pensions the pic fell into the exact same trap it is unambiguously sim s position that it owes the pic nothing whatsoever because it too signed up for sagarmatha shares in exchange for the money owed in the pic s case the disappearing and subordinated debt would be well over r1 billion this consists of loan debt and preference shares overdue for redemption this might explain why the pic liquidation application has seemingly languished since november 2019 although the asset manager would not be drawn on this when contacted by amabhungane in response to detailed questions the pic simply replied that this matter is indeed before the court in the sactwu case the union s claim is based on a default event that occurred when sim missed a repayment to the pic sim s first defence was that it didn t have to repay a non existent loan to understand how sactwu and the pic allegedly signed away hundreds of millions of rands belonging to workers and pensioners we have to return to 2017 the sagarmatha gambit by 2017 it was clear that independent media was struggling and that sim would not be able to repay the loans raised to fund the takeover but survé s sekunjalo group was paving the way for an audacious plan to expand its technology business and rescue its media business with several billion rands in new funding from the pic then still controlled by survé s friend dan matjila survé was going to list two companies on the jse ayo technology solutions and sagarmatha in the case of ayo r4 3 billion was successfully raised from the pic in a rushed process circumventing key safeguards and waiving protections to secure some part of the investment ayo did list but while the pic paid r43 per share it is now trading at r3 50 there is a court process under way where the pic is trying to recoup pensioners money a mere three months after ayo the listing of sagarmatha was being pushed through with a target of raising r7 5 billion from investors as with ayo it was very likely that the investors were in fact mainly the pic led by matjila both listings were effusively promoted by independent media but when subjected to outside scrutiny it was clear that the companies were not worth nearly what they claimed they intended to use the money principally to bail out buy or subsidise other survé companies in the case of the sagarmatha listing the intention was to pay off all sim and independent media s debt and also buy out minority shareholders including the pic and sactwu this would be done by giving everyone sagarmatha shares the pic would in effect be giving survé money and forgiving his debts to the pic in exchange for the shares which were given an extraordinary pre listing valuation as amabhungane revealed here kriel defended sig s acceptance of sagarmatha shares in exchange for the money it is owed and the 8 of sim it owns he said the union accepted the value attached to the shares by sim itself sactwu did not conduct an independent evaluation or independent due diligence it relied on the representations of value made to it as subsequently confirmed by independent expert opinion of the value of the share price he told amabhungane in written replies the expert opinion kriel is referring to is one compiled by a california company called redwood valuation partners and included in sagarmatha s pre listing documentation as amabhungane has previously reported this opinion was based on questionable financial and non financial information and assumptions made by management sign on the dotted line crucially both sactwu via sig and the pic allegedly entered into two agreements with sim in the run up to the listing one was the share and claims sale agreement and the other was a subordination agreement the share and claims deal was the one that would transform sig s r300 million loan into sagarmatha shares in the case of the pic more than r1 5 billion consisting of debts and shares would disappear to be replaced with sagarmatha shares kriel who also heads the union s investment company now claims he and his co directors never actually signed the agreement seemingly an opportunistic argument copies attached to the court papers show that kriel and his sactwu colleagues did initial every single page including the bottom corner of the final signature page they also all signed a board resolution approving the agreement on 22 november 2017 but no one actually signed on the proverbial dotted line on the last page of the document as the designated representative of sactwu it might have been an oversight but the union has tried to exploit it as best it can in its court papers stating no director of the plaintiff executed the sale agreement and accordingly the sale agreement was not concluded and it did not take effect even though the agreement was expressly tied to the listing of sagarmatha it never expressly said that the listing had to succeed instead the effective date is the day the jse approves it and a notice is published on the stock exchange s news service sens that happened on 28 march 2018 the sagarmatha listing was aborted after the jse withdrew its approval based on technical shortcomings in meeting the listing requirements sactwu is now trying to argue its way around this apparently shoddy drafting on a proper construction or alternatively by virtue of a tacit term to the sale agreement if the listing did not occur on or about 6 april 2018 the effective date of the sale agreement would be deemed not to have occurred and the sale agreement would be regarded as being of no force or effect sig s claim states a r300 million phone call even if the sactwu and pic debt still exists sim argued that it cannot be made to repay it thanks to a remarkable subordination agreement sactwu signed as did the pic allegedly apart from sactwu and the pic sim has a major creditor in the form of a chinese consortium called interacom it is owed just shy of r1 billion which due to the subordination agreements ranks above the other funders debts if the pic really is bound by an agreement like this it could be another explanation for its half hearted liquidation application it would not receive any dividend from a liquidation the circumstances under which kriel signed the sig subordination agreement on 1 december 2017 are particularly embarrassing painting him as a naïve and incompetent manager of union members money according to sactwu s court papers it only took a phone call from takudzwa hove the chief operations officer of independent to convince kriel that the agreement was both necessary and harmless mr hove representing the first defendant orally made the following representations to mr kriel representing the plaintiff the subordination agreement would only be utilised by in the context and for the purpose of the listing of sagarmatha if and when the auditors of sagarmatha and or the johannesburg securities exchange required the plaintiff s claim to be subordinated for purposes of the listing of sagarmatha hove according to sactwu emphasised the subordination agreement would in any event lapse and be of no further force or effect one week after the date on which sagarmatha was scheduled to be listed on the jse this of course did not happen sactwu complained in addition to being false the representations made by mr hove were material and made by him on behalf of the first defendant with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to enter into the subordination agreement such error on the part of kriel was reasonable and justifiable entitling the plaintiff to resile from and terminate the subordination agreement according to sactwu using the subordination agreement to repudiate debts at this point exhibits bad faith constitutes unconscionable conduct on the part of the first defendant and would result in gross injustice or gross iniquity to the plaintiff the problem for sactwu and kriel is that the explicit terms of the agreement clearly opened the union to precisely this kind of danger it doesn t once mention the listing of sagarmatha instead it records that the subordination shall remain in force and effect for so long only as the liabilities of the company as fairly valued exceed its assets as fairly valued that means the subordination remains in place until sim s hopeless insolvency is reversed a very unlikely prospect after the sagarmatha listing got scuppered had the listing gone ahead the subordination really would have disappeared anyway but only because the debt itself would have been swopped for shares kriel maintains there is no way he could have suspected hove was allegedly lying sactwu firmly rejects your implied assertion of carelessness and or incompetence as its pleadings make plain material but false misrepresentations were made to sactwu and there was no reason at all for sactwu to doubt or call into question the representations made to it by a senior sim executive he told amabhungane there was certainly no reason at that time for sactwu to disbelieve the representations made by the chief financial officer of sim as a further defence he points out that a far larger and more sophisticated investor made the same mistake the gepf was the other significant loan creditor of sim there was certainly no indication from sim that the gepf had refused to sign its identical subordination agreement it has only subsequently transpired that the gepf has put in issue the validity of the execution of the subordination agreement executed on its behalf by former ceo considering the dire state of sim s finances sactwu may be hoping that the pic doesn t beat it to the punch to try to reclaim its substantially larger claim on survé s shrinking pockets dm

when he first became eligible for the coronavirus vaccine in illinois tom arnold 68 says he didn t need any convincing he raises cattle hogs and chickens in elizabeth a small rural town in the northwest corner of the state after all who better to understand why herd immunity matters than a herdsman being a livestock producer i m well aware of vaccinations and vaccines he says that s how we develop immunity in our animals we re always vaccinating the breeding stock to pass on immunity to the little ones boosting covid 19 vaccination rates in rural america is now less a problem of access and more an issue of trust only about 40 of people in the county where arnold lives jo daviess are fully vaccinated so he doesn t get why people are acting like the pandemic is over scientists say under vaccinated parts of the country like jo daviess are at serious risk especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads rapidly it s why farmers and ranchers need to speak openly about why they ve chosen to be vaccinated says carrie cochran mcclain chief policy officer with the national rural health association one of the hardest things about the vaccination effort is that it really at this point is almost down to those one on one kinds of conversations she says can beefrunner boost vaccines cochran mcclain s association has teamed up with the national farmers union to try to get more farmers to promote the vaccine in their rural communities they ve created an online toolkit for rural farmers with information and talking points for starting up conversations ryan goodman 32 is giving it a try he s a cattle rancher in virginia and self described agriculture advocate on instagram and twitter he s known as beef runner goodman has been using his social media accounts to engage with followers about the vaccine he says he s not sure he s changed any minds but he s encouraged when skeptics who seem unconvinced return to chat more i m a fan of saying no one conversation changes someone s mind especially when you disagree on a topic that might be as hot or as political as vaccines goodman says he d like to see more farmers speaking up because in rural towns farmers have long roots extending back generations making them more trusted than even health experts he says everybody looks at joe down the road and thinks hey you know what might be his experiences on this topic or this issue goodman says listen to what he or she may say larry lieb farms 92 acres of soybean and timber in central illinois and also raises a few cows and pigs he says he wondered whether the vaccine could be safe given how quickly it came to market and he really only got it for one reason my daughter s a respiratory therapist and she told me i was gonna get it lieb says plain and simple unlike some of his relatives lieb says he does not buy into conspiracy theories about the vaccine but he says he avoids those conversations altogether it s their own personal choice he says on issues where they re set in their ways you know it s futile to try less covid 19 more farming the pandemic has had a huge economic impact on farmers says mike stranz vice president of advocacy for the national farmers union there s been so much upheaval in the agricultural economy and in our communities stranz says we need to start moving past that and vaccines are the way towards that vaccination rates have consistently lagged in rural communities and an analysis from npr and johns hopkins university in june found new covid 19 hotspots are cropping up in areas with dangerously low vaccination rates especially in the south midwest and west urban and rural areas have been seeing similar rates of new covid 19 cases lately according to an analysis from the university of iowa but some states including illinois missouri and utah are seeing higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas recent polls suggest most unvaccinated people don t want the vaccine but cochran mcclain says she hopes farmers don t get discouraged and says she has this message for people like lieb he may not feel like his voice is much but we believe it s very strong and important tom arnold says he believes the vaccine saves lives but he doesn t think it s his job to try to convince his neighbors or friends he s also got limited capacity for new challenges i m already overworked and underpaid arnold says the vaccine rollout so far has coincided with some of the busiest times of the year for farmers if he gets into a conversation with someone about the vaccine he says he ll express to them that he s a livestock producer and understands how they work but i don t elaborate arnold says unless people are asking me and usually they don t this story is part of a reporting partnership that includes illinois public media side effects public media npr and kaiser health news copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

agency results so far tell us about the future for the groups first the good news the agency groups seem to be back on track no surprise that all of them have shown strong growth the more important point is how they compare with 2019 and there the news is positive wpp said its q2 organic revenues were 1 3 higher than q2 2019 0 5 for h1 with publicis groupe pointing to a 2 improvement over the quarter and interpublic with a very strong 7 9 improvement over q2 2019 that is important for several reasons first the trend is your friend and for the agencies it suggests a better trend than pre pandemic when the agency groups were mainly seeing organic revenue declines that may lend weight to the argument advertisers have recognised the value of agency services second it hints that some of the pricing pressure on services may be lessening and the reduced repitching activity as highlighted by wpp may suggest a desire for stability from advertisers that back on track view is also reinforced by the raising of guidance by most of the groups omnicom has been more circumspect so wpp and interpublic raised top line guidance from the mid single digit organic revenue growth to 9 10 and both publicis and wpp said they should be back to pre pandemic levels by year end one year earlier than expected in some ways that is no surprise as companies would have been conservative in guidance but it does also reflect the growing strength of the advertising recovery as shown not only by increasing advertising forecasts but also the very strong advertising rebound not only in online but also television one interesting point though is the agencies are not seeing much of this come through to the bottom line and there are already clear signs of costs re entering the system particularly on incentives and to a lesser degree staff numbers so while the agencies have generally raised top line guidance in some cases considerably their margin upgrades have been more muted interpublic upped its margin guidance by 50 basis points 0 5 publicis by the same or slightly more but wpp stuck to its range although it said it would be at the top end of the range the fact is incentives are coming back sharply for wpp the increase in incentive payments 48m in h1 2020 to 244m in h2 2021 alone created a 400bps headwind in margins despite appearances to the contrary the outlook for staffers might be quite positive another thing that is clear is the continuing importance of the media businesses to the agency groups only wpp really gives enough information to hazard an educated guess at how much media contributes to profitability but the short answer is a lot wpp stated in h1 that group m made up 36 of group revenues implying around 1 76bn of revenues assuming an operating margin in the low twenties that suggests group m made around 390m of operating profits or two thirds of wpp s overall h1 profit number while there may be some differences in some of the other groups particularly with omnicom given its slightly unusual revenue mix the general message remains the same media is vital for profitability for the groups more glass half empty than half full now to the less good news first it is evident that the agencies have rebounded but also that they are losing share to other entrants one obvious candidate is sir martin sorrell s s4 capital and while there is some fierce debate on the relevance between the two categories there is no doubt that when it comes to the pace of growth s4 is the speedboat and the global agency groups the oil tankers s4 raised its organic revenue growth forecast for 2021 from 30 to 35 having raised it previously from 25 margins are also generally higher while not as high profile other groups such as you mr jones and next 15 are also making inroads second the creative business remains a not particularly attractive business model for the agency groups yet one that still has to be part of the repertoire of agency groups i have used wpp again not to pick on them but because rightfully they provide enough transparency to crunch the numbers and they are a good proxy for all the groups based on the h1 report their creative focused businesses probably made less than 5 operating margin thus dragging down the overall margins for the groups there is not a clear answer yet as to how that can change third and this is more of a minor point although more strategic china looks as though it will never fulfil the hopes of the agency groups as a major engine for their businesses go back a decade or more and the agencies were extolling the potential seismic opportunity in china and other markets such as india and brazil yet for most agency groups it is only mid single digits of their overall revenues and far less important to their groups than markets such as the uk or even germany moreover china is the one market where while advertising growth is expected to be strong at over 20 in 2021 the agencies are not seeing meaningful growth coming through that suggests the agencies have failed to penetrate the domestic market and are relying more on international groups that might be more cautious spending on advertising in china than let s say the united states these issues are also reflected in the stock market valuations while the agency groups have recovered from last year interpublic s share price is up nearly 100 from one year ago with publicis up 86 wpp up 59 and omnicom up 38 their price earnings p e valuations remain muted and low by historic standards publicis trades at less than 11 times the consensus p e for fy22e according to refinitiv data with wpp and omnicom at under 12 times although interpublic is higher at over 14 times p e however compare that with s4 capital which interestingly has risen just marginally higher than interpublic over the past year which trades at over 40 times consensus earnings for this year when it comes to investors the view for the agency groups is more half empty than half full the question is whether this can change generally i think the agencies are perhaps in a better position than the consensus thinks but it is clear it will take time to turn things around and in an environment where competition is increasing perhaps investors do have a solid reason for erring on the side of caution at this particular time ian whittaker is founder and

iqbal surve s sekunjalo independent media is in court fighting off a union owned co investor s bid to reclaim r300 million the south african clothing and textile workers union was one of the major funders of sekunjalo s takeover of independent media in 2013 sekunjalo claims it doesn t owe them or its major creditor the public investment corporation anything in april 2019 the investment arm of the south african clothing and textile workers union sactwu hit sekunjalo independent media sim with a r295 6 million claim for failing to repay debts related to the buyout of independent media in 2013 sim is the company through which surve controls the newspaper group while sactwu investments group sig is one of the minority shareholders of sim that gave surve r150 million to fund the 2013 takeover with interest this debt has doubled and constitutes 15 of the union company s assets one of the larger funders the public investment corporation pic has also launched a separate liquidation application sim was due to repay the debt and interest by 14 august 2020 subject to sig being entitled to demand immediate repayment in the case of a default event on 8 april 2019 sactwu s lawyers wrote to sim calling up the loan and citing the admissions made by surve at the mpati commission of inquiry into the affairs of the pic that independent media had failed to repay its multi billion rand debt to both the pic and the government employees pension fund sim disputed the claim but it has already taken more than two years for the case to get to court in part because sim resisted disclosing internal documents that might help sactwu prove its claim in december last year sactwu was finally forced to launch a separate court case to compel sim to disclose information things came to a head with a court date set for 5 may this year for sig s application to force sim to hand over documents not for the actual claim days before going to court sim came forward with most of the outstanding information sought and the parties abruptly settled the dispute around documents this had the effect of keeping evidently sensitive information about the ailing independent media group out of court and consequently out of the public eye from the court papers that have been filed in the western cape high court surve s company comes across as cynically exploiting the trust or naivety of its partners to sidestep the r300 million debt sim failed to acknowledge questions or answer them despite assurances from its pr company that they were received on the other side of the coin the papers suggest the union was easily taken for a ride and that it was poorly served by its general secretary andre kriel who signed the agreements on behalf of sig taken for a ride sim s pleadings in response to sig s claim seem to lay bare how surve ran circles around sactwu allegedly getting the union to sign away its entire r300 million debt and 8 shareholding in sim in exchange for shares in another surve company sagarmatha technologies that turned out to be practically worthless even if the debt still existed kriel signed a separate subordination agreement putting the debt at the back of a queue of very significant creditors meaning that the debt will almost certainly never have to be repaid what s more sim claims that africa s largest asset manager and custodian of all civil servants pensions the pic fell into the exact same trap it is unambiguously sim s position that it owes the pic nothing whatsoever because it too signed up for sagarmatha shares in exchange for the moneys owed in the pic s case the disappearing and subordinated debt would be well over r1 billion this consists of loan debt and preference shares overdue for redemption this might explain why the pic liquidation application has seemingly languished since november 2019 although the asset manager would not be drawn on this when contacted by amabhungane in response to detailed questions the pic simply replied that this matter is indeed before the court in the sactwu case the union s claim is based on a default event that occurred when sim missed a repayment to the pic sim s first defence was that it didn t have to repay a non existent loan to understand how sactwu and the pic allegedly signed away hundreds of millions of rands belonging to workers and pensioners we have to return to 2017 the sagarmatha gambit by 2017 it was clear that independent media was struggling and that sim would not be able to repay the loans raised to fund the takeover but surve s sekunjalo group was paving the way for an audacious plan to expand its technology business and rescue its media business with several billion rands in new funding from the pic then still controlled by surve s friend dan matjila surve was going to list two companies on the jse ayo technology solutions and sagarmatha in the case of ayo r4 3 billion was successfully raised from the pic in a rushed process circumventing key safeguards and waiving protections to secure some part of the investment ayo did list but while the pic paid r43 00 per share they are now trading at r3 50 there is a court process underway where the pic is trying to recoup pensioners money a mere three months after ayo the listing of sagarmatha was being pushed through with a target of raising r7 5 billion from investors as with ayo it was very likely that the investors were in fact mainly the pic led by matjila both listings were effusively promoted by independent media but when subjected to outside scrutiny it was clear that the companies were not worth nearly what they claimed they intended to use the money principally to bail out buy or subsidise other surve companies in the case of the sagarmatha listing the intention was to pay off all sim and independent media s debt and also buy out minority shareholders including the pic and sactwu this would be done by giving everyone sagarmatha shares the pic would in effect be giving surve money and forgiving his debts to the pic in exchange for the shares which were given an extraordinary pre listing valuation as amabhungane revealed here kriel defended sig s acceptance of sagarmatha shares in exchange for the money it is owed and the 8 of sim it owns according to him the union accepted the value attached to the shares by sim itself sactwu did not conduct an independent evaluation or independent due diligence it relied on the representations of value made to it as subsequently confirmed by independent expert opinion of the value of the share price he told amabhungane in written replies the expert opinion kriel is referring to is one complied by a california company called redwood valuation partners and included in sagarmatha s pre listing documentation as amabhungane has previously reported this opinion was based on questionable financial and non financial information and assumptions made by management sign on the dotted line crucially both sactwu via sig and the pic allegedly entered into two agreements with sim in the run up to the listing one was the share and claims sale agreement and the other was a subordination agreement the share and claims deal was the one that would transform sig s r300 million loan into sagarmatha shares in the case of the pic more than r1 5 billion consisting of debts and shares would disappear to be replaced with sagarmatha shares kriel who also heads the union s investment company now claims he and his co directors never actually signed the agreement seemingly an opportunistic argument copies attached to the court papers show that kriel and his sactwu colleagues did initial every single page including the bottom corner of the final signature page they also all signed a board resolution approving the agreement on 22 november 2017 but no one actually signed the proverbial dotted line on the last page of the document as the designated representative of sactwu it might have been an oversight but the union has tried to exploit it as best it can in its court papers stating no director of the plaintiff executed the sale agreement and accordingly the sale agreement was not concluded and it did not take effect even though the agreement was expressly tied to the listing of sagarmatha it never expressly said that the listing had to succeed instead the effective date is the day the jse approves it and a notice is published on the stock exchange s news service sens that happened on 28 march 2018 the sagarmatha listing was aborted after the jse withdrew its approval based on technical shortcomings in meeting the listing requirements sactwu is now trying to argue its way around this apparently shoddy drafting on a proper construction or alternatively by virtue of a tacit term to the sale agreement if the listing did not occur on or about 6 april 2018 the effective date of the sale agreement would be deemed not to have occurred and the sale agreement would be regarded as being of no force or effect sig s claim states a r300 million phone call even if the sactwu and pic debt still exists sim argued that it cannot be made to repay it thanks to a remarkable subordination agreement sactwu signed as did the pic allegedly apart from sactwu and the pic sim has a major creditor in the form of a chinese consortium called interacom it is owed just shy of r1 billion which due to the subordination agreements ranks above the other funders debts if the pic really is bound by an agreement like this it could be another explanation for its half hearted liquidation application it would not receive any dividend from a liquidation the circumstances under which kriel signed the sig subordination agreement on 1 december 2017 are particularly embarrassing painting him as a naïve and incompetent manager of union members money according to sactwu s court papers it only took a phone call from takudzwa hove the chief operations officer of independent to convince kriel that the agreement was both necessary and harmless mr hove representing the first defendant orally made the following representations to mr kriel representing the plaintiff the subordination agreement would only be utilised by in the context and for the purpose of the listing of sagarmatha if and when the auditors of sagarmatha and or the johannesburg securities exchange jse required the plaintiff s claim to be subordinated for purposes of the listing of sagarmatha hove according to sactwu emphasised the subordination agreement would in any event lapse and be of no further force or effect one week after the date on which sagarmatha was scheduled to be listed on the jse exchange this of course didn t happen sactwu complained in addition to being false the representations made by mr hove were material and made by him on behalf of the first defendant with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to enter into the subordination agreement such error on the part of kriel was reasonable and justifiable entitling the plaintiff to resile from and terminate the subordination agreement according to sactwu using the subordination agreement to repudiate debts at this point exhibits bad faith constitutes unconscionable conduct on the part of the first defendant and would result in gross injustice or gross iniquity to the plaintiff the problem for sactwu and kriel is that the explicit terms of the agreement clearly opened the union to precisely this kind of danger it doesn t once mention the listing of sagarmatha instead it records that the subordination shall remain in force and effect for so long only as the liabilities of the company as fairly valued exceed its assets as fairly valued that means the subordination remains in place until sim s hopeless insolvency is reversed a very unlikely prospect after the sagarmatha listing got scuppered had the listing gone ahead the subordination really would have disappeared anyway but only because the debt itself would have been swopped for shares kriel maintains there is no way he could have suspected hove was allegedly lying sactwu firmly rejects your implied assertion of carelessness and or incompetence as its pleadings make plain material but false misrepresentations were made to sactwu and there was no reason at all for sactwu to doubt or call into question the representations made to it by a senior sim executive he told amabhungane there was certainly no reason at that time for sactwu to disbelieve the representations made by the chief financial officer of sim as a further defence he points out that a far larger and more sophisticated investor made the same mistake the gepf was the other significant loan creditor of sim there was certainly no indication from sim that the gepf had refused to sign its identical subordination agreement it has only subsequently transpired that the gepf has put in issue the validity of the execution of the subordination agreement executed on its behalf by former ceo considering the dire state of sim s finances sactwu may be hoping that the pic doesn t beat it to the punch to try to reclaim its substantially larger claim on iqbal surve s shrinking pockets source news24

eur usd drops to fresh multi month lows on tuesday amid sustained usd buying rising bets for an earlier fed taper continued acting as a tailwind for the greenback covid 19 jitters further benefitted the safe haven usd and added to the selling bias the eur usd pair remained on the defensive through the early part of the european session on tuesday and dropped to over four month lows amid sustained us dollar buying interest investors have been pricing in the prospects for an early tapering of the fed s massive monetary stimulus amid signs of substantial further progress in the labor market recovery this in turn was seen as a key factor that continued acting as a tailwind for the usd the us bureau of labor statistics reported on monday that the number of job openings increased by 590 000 to a record high 10 1 million on the last business day of june this comes on the back of friday s blockbuster nfp report which forced investors to bring forward the likely timing for the fed policy tightening the fed officials have also started to guide the market towards early tapering and higher interest rates as soon as 2022 speaking at an online event on monday atlanta fed president raphael bostic said that the fed could begin tapering between october and december or earlier if there is another month or two of strong job gains adding to this boston fed president eric rosengren noted that the us central bank should announce in september that it will start reducing its 120 billion in monthly purchases of treasury and mortgage bonds this fall the repricing of the fed s tapering plan pushed the yield on the benchmark 10 year us government bond to three week highs beyond the 1 30 threshold apart from this worries about the potential economic fallout from the fast spreading delta variant of the coronavirus further benefitted the greenback s relative safe haven status that said slightly oversold conditions on intraday charts held bearish traders from placing fresh bets there isn t any major market moving economic data due for release from the us hence the focus will be on the release of us consumer inflation figures on wednesday which will be looked upon for a fresh directional impetus in the meantime the broader market risk sentiment along with us bond yields might influence the usd price dynamics and produce some trading opportunities around the major short term technical outlook from a technical perspective the pair already seems to have found acceptance below a short term ascending trend line extending from september 2020 swing lows this further adds credence to the bearish outlook and supports prospects for additional weakness hence some follow through slide towards challenging ytd lows around the 1 1700 mark touched in march remains a distinct possibility the downward trajectory could further get extended towards the next relevant support near the 1 1610 1 1600 horizontal zone on the flip side attempted recovery moves might now confront immediate resistance near the 1 1800 mark any further move up is likely to meet with some fresh supply and remain capped near the 1 1830 35 region a sustained strength beyond might trigger a short covering move and push the pair towards the 1 1880 supply zone this is closely followed by the 1 1900 mark which if conquered might negate the bearish bias bulls might then aim to reclaim the key 1 2000 psychological mark the latter coincides with the very important 200 day sma and should act as a key pivotal point for the pair s next leg of a directional move
tell us about the moment you first became interested in wine my first ever job was on the north coast of spain a tiny brasserie with fresh fish cooked over fire and wine served without a label from a winery 500 meters down the road this was my first real engagement with food and wine in combination and it changed my life tell us about your wine list at the pem it s a really lovely blend of wines from independent hands on growers with great stories from the communities in which they re located or great wines from iconic timeless houses over the course of your career have you had any wine related disasters my first time ordering at the hand flowers we had a power cut and i had to stock check by candlelight it was chaotic as it was just before christmas all the computers were down and i had to hand write the orders the system sent a double order by mistake and when the stock arrived it blocked up half the pub but we did get through it name your top three restaurant wine lists excluding your own kerridge s bar and grill at the corinthia the naughty piglets in brixton and the crown burchetts green where they have blackboard list of very wonderful wines to try and you can haggle on the price who do you most respect in the wine world perhaps not a hugely known producer but i have enormous respect for pierre frick whose winery is in pfaffenheim alsace he was the first person who fully explained to me how his biodynamic vineyard operated and shared the advantages of his hands off approach to production he was inspirational and very exciting what s the most interesting wine you ve ever come across this would be a champagne called substance by jacques selosse which is created with 100 chardonnay grapes using the solera system for the first fermentation on tasting in the glass it reveals five or six completely recognisable styles such is the depth and complexity it s hard to get hold of unfortunately what are the three most overused tasting notes supple it s such a wishy washy term then there s dry as a concept most wines are dry it s thrown about without real precision and finally mouth filling which is a cumbersome statement with no nuance what s the best value wine on your list at the moment and why ciu ciu falero oris bianco dop which we sell by the glass emma underwood the general manager of the pem and i are particularly fond of it it sits beautifully alongside several dishes on sally abé s menu and is incredible value there s a lovely story behind the name of the winery too the growers named it after their grandchildren s word for the trains that run alongside the vineyard ciu ciu what is your ultimate food and drink match rib of beef cooked over fire with a red from ribera del duero it brings back memories of my first job old world or new world old world what is your pet hate when it comes to wine service in other restaurants not being able to reach my wine who is your favourite producer at the moment and why crystallum pinot noir has been eye opening its method of wine making in south africa is really unique there s a very burgundian approach and the winery creates a beautiful balance of traditional wine making with new world swagger embracing the terroir it works with as a sommelier what question do you most get asked by customers what is your favourite wine which wine producing region country is currently underrated at the moment and why the wines of georgia this is a country with a long standing tradition of wine making long before vines came into mainland europe they use traditional methodsand have been dismissed because they re not often enough in the public eye but the winemakers really know what they are doing it s your last meal and you can have a bottle of any wine in the world what is it and why vega sicilia unico 2008 i shared this with my brother during the first christmas we lived together as adults we ran a little pub together and saved up for a special bottle for our christmas meal just the two of us and it has huge sentimental value it tastes opulent and goes sensationally well with a rib of beef

this article appears in the august 23 30 2021 issue seated on an armless mustard green chair margaret evans is nude and pregnant the evidence of pregnancy s toll appears throughout her body in the blue vein that ripples along one breast her mottled legs her flushed face she looks out at us confident and calm but also carries some tension as her arms seem to grip the seat perhaps to hold herself upright in the pose 1 books in review alice neel the art of not sitting pretty by phoebe hoban buy this book painted late in alice neel s career when the artist was 78 margaret evans pregnant 1978 provokes a feeling of wonder and awe how could someone have captured another person s essence this almost soulful likeness in paint there seem to be two subjects the sitter herself and the physical fact of her pregnancy which is depicted without a value judgment as neither a life affirming force nor a societal trap we are simply in the presence of a woman who is present in her body holding space with her like some kind of communion 2 such is the force of an alice neel painting standing before one can be a profound experience the new yorker art critic peter schjeldahl once wrote that her art beyond being something to look at is something that happens to you neel was an artist whose life spanned the majority of the 20th century despite the ebb and flow of movements and trends during that time she remained a figurative painter making mostly but not entirely portraits a word she rejected for its bourgeois connotations she preferred the phrase pictures of people and called herself an anarchic humanist as she explained in a 1950 interview for me people come first i think i have tried to assert the dignity and eternal importance of the human being 3 a recent retrospective at the metropolitan museum of art in new york city alice neel people come first centered this humanism as the driving philosophy of neel s work the exhibition is also traveling to the guggenheim bilbao and the fine arts museums of san francisco it positioned her as a kind of model for the socially engaged artist similar to how phoebe hoban in the new introduction to her recently reissued biography alice neel the art of not sitting pretty describes her subject as arguably america s first feminist multiculturally conscious artist such characterizations aren t wrong but they also neuter our understanding of neel and her work while eliding her whiteness they oversimplify a far more complex story 4 behind the general terms lie a host of specific political affiliations neel was a lifelong member of the communist party an ally to black and brown artists and a cause célèbre of the feminist art movement yet in reading hoban s biography one gets the sense that like so many artists neel wasn t great at practicing solidarity because she was consumed by her own vision the clearest expression of her beliefs lay in her art her commitment to painting people from which she never wavered you can see it in her haunting scenes of new york city during the great depression her equally rigorous portraits of leftist leaders neighbors in spanish harlem and art world denizens her unsentimental depictions of pregnant women and mothers male nudes and gay couples she was drawn she said to fellow survivors of the rat race people who struggled and who generally didn t appear as complex individuals if they appeared at all in western art 5 popular swipe left below to view more authors swipe the toxic culture at tesla the toxic culture at tesla feature bryce covert the

enthusiasm marks the end of an era the end of curb your enthusiasm marks the end of an era books the arts daniel bessner in order for people to come first in neel s work her art had to come before people often to others detriment a large portion of hoban s biography details dramatic episodes and conflagrations conjuring a woman who caused as well as bore a lot of pain she was known to take advantage of people and to goad and provoke those closest to her her family life was rife with abuse and abandonment of which she was the victim aggressor and abettor while watching alice neel the 2007 documentary by her grandson andrew neel that surveys the familial fallout of her choices i found myself thinking about picasso another brilliant painter whose legacy is similarly enmeshed in his interpersonal sins the point in either case isn t to judge an individual s actions or to seek an impossible separation of the artist from the art it is instead to think about the costs of greatness and how in retrospect we can move past the one dimensional narratives of genius if anything part of what makes neel s art so compelling is how her life work and beliefs existed in constant tension 6 alice neel was born on january 28 1900 in merion square penn to parents whom hoban describes as economically lower middle class she grew up in nearby colwyn a stifling town where she felt out of place both geographically and emotionally other people loomed too large everybody could knock me off base neel recalled i d make such an effort to be what they wanted a pretty little girl that i wouldn t be myself at all from an early age art became her way of dealing with that alienation a space in which she could express an inner life that was at odds with her environment 7 margaret evans pregnant 1978 courtesy of the institute of contemporary art the metropolitan museum of art still she didn t pursue art in earnest until she was 21 when she entered the philadelphia school of design for women as hoban notes her academic choice was significant the school s approach reflected the legacy of one of its most famous teachers robert henri a cofounder of the movement known as the ashcan school henri was a proponent of realism who believed that art should seek to represent truth rather than beauty 8 neel took the call to realism to heart she went out into the streets of philadelphia to paint and attended a local sketch club where the models were ordinary people she was also part of the first generation of female art students allowed to study live male nudes the path of realism reflected how neel understood her place in the world i had a conscience about going to art school she said because when i d go into the school the scrub women would be coming back from scrubbing office floors all night it killed me that these old gray headed women had to scrub floors and i was going in there to draw greek statues 9 in 1924 while away at summer school in the nearby countryside neel met the first in a line of men with whom she would have tumultuous relationships as well as children the painter carlos enríquez who came from a wealthy landed cuban family enríquez and neel fell in love and quickly wed then moved to havana where their lives were a study in class contrast the couple stayed in the family mansion but took frequent trips to impoverished neighborhoods to paint people they met on the street they became part of the burgeoning art scene and began showing their work including in an exhibition of cuban avant garde art where it garnered critical attention 10 one of neel s contributions was a 1926 rendering of a mother and child that was also on view at the met the piece which offers a glimpse of her young brushy style represents an early interest in a subject that was about to consume her her first daughter with enríquez santillana del mar was born at the end of 1926 within six months neel had left havana for colwyn taking santillana with her though she never explained her reasons it was a sign of the struggle between making art and mothering that she would face and depict for the rest of her life including in a series of intimate diaristic watercolors from around this time one titled the family 1927 shows a smiling enríquez lying down with santillana who seems to almost dangle off the side of the bed a topless neel holds her daughter in place while bending sharply at the waist as if from exhaustion 11 enríquez soon rejoined neel and they moved to new york where they painted in a city swirling with modernist ideas and energy but enríquez s family sent him little money and they struggled to find sources of income then suddenly santillana died of diphtheria before her first birthday neel was devastated 12 their second daughter isabella lillian nicknamed isabetta was born in 1928 but stability remained elusive as the stock market crashed the couple s relationship deteriorated in 1930 enríquez took isabetta to havana left her with his family and went to paris neel had thought they would travel together but instead her husband abandoned her at the same time she abandoned isabetta you see i had always had this awful dichotomy neel later said i loved isabetta of course i did but i wanted to paint 13 neel faced an impossible choice that has haunted countless creative women pursue her art or subsume it to the burdens of parenting she chose her work at great emotional cost in august 1930 she suffered a nervous breakdown she was hospitalized in philadelphia and briefly released only to attempt suicide at her parents house back in the hospital neel continued her attempts until a social worker gave her a sketch pad it was the drawing that helped me decide to get well she said later she was transferred to a private sanitarium to recover her haunting 1931 drawing suicidal ward depicts a smiling male doctor in a room full of beds and delirious female patients it recalls her 1928 29 painting well baby clinic which features a handful of almost angelic looking medical staff tending to a ward of new mothers who appear largely possessed an indication of how clearly neel understood the patriarchal nature of such institutions 14 as for isabetta she was raised by enríquez s sisters and remained estranged from her mother she had kids of her own but never told them about neel s existence in 1982 after three previous attempts isabetta died by suicide as hoban writes her nonrelationship with her mother would significantly shape her life from neel s particular pains isabetta inherited her own 15 if neel s 20s were shaped by her struggle to navigate her situation as a working class woman and artist in her 30s she found a politics that helped her make sense of that identity after recovering she returned to new york city where she moved to greenwich village with her new partner a communist sailor named kenneth doolittle she was surrounded by fellow artists intellectuals and writers and began showing her work in earnest receiving her first mention in an american publication in 1933 a critic in the philadelphia inquirer wrote of her art there is nothing pretty about these pictures but they have substance and honesty 16 neel s work was wide ranging during this period as she experimented and honed her voice sometimes she painted somber cityscapes a style that was well represented in the work she did during the new deal years beginning with the public works of art project in 1933 by september 1935 the pwap had become the works progress administration which paid neel 103 40 a month to submit a painting every six weeks creating her own version of the then prevalent social realist style she depicted the economic and emotional realities of the city in scenes of may day parades and longshoremen congregating after work using a dark palette and an unromantic gaze she also dabbled in more surreal and playful territory synthesis of new york great depression 1933 features skeletons walking the streets and mannequins flying overhead like angels a radical 1933 nude portrait of the writer joe gould portrays him with three sets of genitalia 17 the new deal had a significant financial effect on neel s life but it also gave her purpose and a feeling of solidarity with other artists for the first time art rather than being considered an intellectual luxury was being classified as wage earning work hoban writes artists of the time felt an uplifting sense of unity that they channeled into unions and associations some of which neel joined given her immersion in this milieu and her longstanding interest in depicting working people it is no surprise that she became a member of the communist party in 1935 18 related article mike gold avant garde bard of proletarian new york j hoberman the marxists were the only ones who recognized her the novelist phillip bonosky a longtime friend of neel s and a fellow party member told hoban she was not only an artist but a woman not only a woman but a lost woman she was an unmarried woman and she had everything against her but she found a home there she found people who respected her the art historian andrew hemingway notes that many were drawn to the party because it offered the most sustained critique available of class racial and sexual inequality he adds that neel may also have been attracted to communism s seeming promise of a kind of personal freedom that she valued deeply 19 she remained a party member for the rest of her life and in 1981 became the first living american artist to have a retrospective in the soviet union but it was the intellectual and collective spirit that attracted her more than the hands on work of organizing as charles keller a onetime art editor at new masses told hoban she showed her views through her work which i think was more important in many respects than distributing leaflets and organizing meetings indeed art became the expression of neel s commitment her point of participation 20 email recognizing this the communists supported her work for decades long before the art world took an interest in her that included the illustrations she did for publications like masses mainstream as well as enthusiastic reviews by colleagues like mike gold whose 1950 daily worker piece on neel gave the met retrospective its title gold also organized one of neel s few solo shows of the 1950s while bonosky put together the later one in the ussr 21 meanwhile some of the earliest portraits in her mature style in which the paint seems activated by the process of bringing out people s inner lives feature party leaders and activists but it wasn t only or even primarily by depicting party leaders that neel broadcast her views it was through her portraits of ordinary people like the ones she d been making since the extracurricular outings of her school days such paintings increasingly became her focus starting in 1938 the year of her first solo show in manhattan when she also relocated to spanish harlem 22 neel s relationship with doolittle had been rocky and at the end of 1934 in a fit of possibly drug fueled rage he slashed and burned hundreds of her artworks she called the episode a personal holocaust and in the wake of it fled the village 23 neel began dating the musician josé santiago negron next and moved with him to el barrio a largely working class puerto rican neighborhood where she thought she d find more truth although her words suggest naivete or condescension her portraits of her neighbors are compassionate and rigorous the spanish harlem portraits including her multiple depictions of a local boy named georgie arce whose variable looks and moods suggest a closeness between him and neel are perhaps the purest articulations of her communist and humanist beliefs they manifest the dignity of her working class subjects without becoming propaganda they re also significant historically given that portraits have often represented the wealthy and powerful who could afford to commission likenesses of themselves when working people of color do appear in the western canon they re chronically depicted as archetypes canvases for a white artist s projections by contrast as curator kelly baum noted in the met catalog neel s paintings grant visibility to subjects who remained largely absent from the precinct of fine art breaking the monopoly that white upper class men had long enjoyed on the category of human being 24 although neel had moved away from the creative heart of new york city her career continued to progress until the mid 1940s when abstraction particularly abstract expressionism became the vogue the change was total figuration was out she was very bitter about being marginalized like that being wiped off the map simply because she insisted on being a realist bonosky said 25 her personal life too remained tumultuous in 1939 neel gave birth to a son richard but negron left her shortly thereafter she then began a relationship with sam brody a leftist photographer who helped found the film and photo league they had their own son hartley in 1941 brody believed in neel s work and helped her financially emotionally however they were as neel put it homicidal meets suicidal by all accounts she did plenty of instigating but brody had a fierce temper he sometimes abused neel but his primary target was richard she tolerated this person that she knew was abusing me richard said in the 2007 documentary speaking publicly about the situation for the first time i don t hold that against her but the facts are the facts the world isn t just you the world is you and your relationship with the other people 26 in the documentary hartley explains to the filmmaker andrew neel who is also hartley s son that brody s abuse was the reason he ultimately rejected his father as well as why andrew never knew his grandfather the moment evokes parallels with isabetta s family you can feel neel s descendants trying to reconcile her brilliance with their lingering hurt 27 the 1950s were a low point for neel why can t i get a gallery she asked bonosky here i am a genius and i need to show my canvases i m inundated with them her apartment overflowed with paintings she couldn t exhibit or sell portraits of neighbors work echoing back to her wpa days like the occasional protest scene and even quiet still lifes and semi abstract cityscapes anyone who visited would be similarly inundated as neel subjected them to a show and tell of her work and the stories behind it one visitor called the experience a type of theater which was unparalleled bonosky had the idea to turn these impromptu talks into slide lectures starting with one in 1953 at the communist party s jefferson school a short piece in the daily worker reported on an enthralled audience frequently breaking into applause at particularly striking scenes by the time neel s career took off in the 1960s she was ready to take her show on the road the talks and lectures she gave burnished her reputation for being funny frank and foul mouthed they also helped make her famous 28 the countercultural revolution opened up a whole new space for neel the unofficial art world ban on figuration was dropped and a new kind of social and political consciousness came into fashion in the early 60s neel signed with a gallery received renewed press attention and started showing again soon at a rapid pace an exhibition opening next month at david zwirner gallery will focus on work from the earlier pre fame part of her career hoban offers the remarkable statistic that while neel had only six solo shows between 1927 and 1964 she had more than 60 in the last two decades of her life this was partly because she began painting portraits of art world insiders curators like the metropolitan museum s henry geldzahler poets like frank o hara who was also a curator at new york s museum of modern art and artists like robert smithson 29 yet she never softened her exacting gaze neel s portraits are so striking because her renderings of people s bodies seem to also show something of their souls that quality intensified as she lightened her palette and began outlining her subjects in blue rather than black which served to highlight and almost buoy them her backgrounds contained more abstract passages of paint and in some cases she stopped filling in whole sections her remarkable 1972 portrait of andy warhol shows him topless with closed eyes wearing a medical corset below the gunshot scars crisscrossing his chest he sits on a couch that s simply a tan outline with patches of blue hovering around his head and torso neel uses a bare composition to cut through the cloud of warhol s celebrity and present him as a mere mortal 30 the 60s were also when neel began painting pregnant nudes an exceedingly rare subject in western art history these marvelous and uncomfortable portraits of women who bear not just their own pregnancies but the social realities that come with them suggest a dynamic of love and pain as do neel s many renderings of mothers and children from this time in nancy and the twins 1971 neel s daughter in law gives a swelling breast to one of her babies the blue veins in it mimic the outline of nancy s eyes which stare at the viewer with exhaustion these paintings are startlingly honest about the personal and political ramifications of childbearing which neel herself confronted time and again 31 it s no wonder that second wave feminists anointed her a forebear whose recognition was long overdue neel had spent decades observing society from her point of view as a woman what the movement saw as feminist however she saw as her communist devotion to the human being it was politics by another name this helps explain why she never formally identified as a feminist and why her relationship to the movement was vexed she didn t see herself in solidarity with other women especially the white middle class drivers of the second wave so much as with working class people the world over 32 but just as marxism had given neel a framework for understanding her own life feminism created a framework by which the rest of the world could make sense of her from the paintings she d made to the ways she d been marginalized feminist artists and art historians looked to neel as a trailblazer they supported her as the communists had long done they even petitioned the whitney museum of american art to give her an exhibition as did neel s sons in 1974 those efforts paid off with her first retrospective at 74 years old she was finally vindicated i had always felt that i didn t have a right to paint because i had two sons and i had so many things i should be doing neel said after the show i didn t feel that way anymore 33 neel would live for another decade during which time her career would continue its rise posthumously her success has been even greater neel s legacy has not only survived her but continued to grow exponentially hoban writes when i was coming up as a young feminist art critic neel seemed larger than life a bold and tragic figure a woman ahead of her time who suffered because of it while there is truth to that narrative the more i scrutinized it the more i came to understand that the reality was as it always is more tangled neel s life abounded with contradictions a devoted mother who abandoned a child a lifelong communist and loner a feminist who didn t define herself as such she was an artist who committed herself to humanity yet whose depictions of people are so severely honest they have the power to shock 34 hoban grapples with these incongruities while the met retrospective largely excluded them this may have been necessary an exhibition isn t a biography but missing the details of neel s life means missing the impact of some of her art if you don t know the story of her relationship with isabetta you won t get the full weight of an infamous nude portrait she made of her daughter when the girl was 6 35 one place where the contradictions did peek through was in a striking portrait called richard in the era of the corporation 1978 79 it shows neel s eldest son wearing a suit and tie with a shiny helmet of hair he grips the armchair he s sitting in perhaps a bit wary of his mother who according to the wall text at the exhibition thought the painting represented a time when the corporation enslaved all these bright young men like her son in fact several shots in the documentary alice neel show richard sitting below the portrait at one point he crosses his legs as he does in the artwork and discusses his staunch support for richard nixon there are very few people that are as right wing as i am he says and there were very few people that were as left wing as i was when i was a kid 36 how do we define someone s legacy is it through their work or their family their politics or their personal life in a way i think none of those things mattered to neel as much as making art painting was the closest she got to freedom and she pursued it no matter the cost 37

analysts are calling for significant gains in these fast paced stocks for the past nine months the stock market has been practically unstoppable the benchmark s p 500 hasn t undergone a single 5 drop and it s nearly doubled since hitting its bear market low on march 23 2020 but despite this record breaking rally wall street still sees value in a number of high growth stocks based on the highest price target issued by a wall street investment bank or analyst the following five growth stocks are expected to return 110 to as much as 393 to shareholders coinbase global implied upside of 152 the first rapidly growing stock with abundant upside at least according to investment firm d a davidson is cryptocurrency brokerage and ecosystem coinbase global coin 0 47 if the lofty 650 price target set by d a davidson comes to fruition coinbase would deliver gains of 152 to its shareholders relative to where it closed this past weekend on one hand revenue and profits have soared for coinbase net revenue in the first quarter catapulted to 1 6 billion from 179 million in the year ago period with net income of 771 million up from 32 million growing institutional interest in digital currencies like bitcoin and ethereum along with rapidly rising prices for the big two in crypto drove investors to the platform on the other hand the coinbase operating model has virtually no barriers to entry and its trading fees are at risk of constantly being undercut by other cryptocurrency exchanges additionally instead of thriving off of innovation coinbase is effectively held hostage by external interest in bitcoin and ethereum and the price performance of the big two digital currencies when bitcoin declined by 80 following its late 2017 peak coinbase s revenue was nearly halved long story short while sales growth has been impressive coinbase isn t charting its own path to success its reliance on external factors makes 650 a target that s unlikely to be reached cresco labs implied upside of 160 one industry where you ll find no shortage of aggressive price targets is cannabis specifically the u s pot industry if the highest price target assigned by wall street of nearly 29 for cresco labs crlbf 4 15 proves accurate investors in this marijuana stock could enjoy upside of 160 and unlike coinbase this is a price target that i believe can eventually be achieved like other multistate operators cresco is expanding its retail operations organically and via acquisition in june it opened its 33rd dispensary nationally and it holds enough retail licenses in its back pocket to eventually have closer to four dozen operating dispensaries from a retail perspective cresco appears to be focusing its efforts on high dollar states as well as those that issue licenses on a limited basis e g illinois ohio and pennsylvania the advantage of limited license states is they re purposefully reining in competition that means cresco will have a genuine opportunity to build up its brands in key markets without the fear of being overrun by a multistate operator with deeper pockets cresco is also the cannabis industry s leading wholesaler of weed even though wholesale cannabis produces weaker margins than retail cresco labs has more than enough volume to make up for it that s because it holds one of only a handful of cannabis distribution licenses in california this license gives the company access to more than 575 dispensaries throughout the golden state baidu implied upside of 141 in spite of a recent crackdown by the chinese government on a host of tech stocks wall street remains largely undeterred that china based internet search giant baidu bidu 0 30 will head higher in fact based on the high water analyst price target of nearly 395 baidu could offer gains of as much as 141 the most obvious catalyst for baidu is its domestically dominant internet search engine according to globalstats baidu has controlled between 66 9 and 79 9 of all internet search share in china over the trailing 12 months just as advertisers line up for placement on alphabet s leading internet search engine google they re willing to pay big bucks to reach internet users in china beyond the sustainable double digit sales growth potential of internet search baidu is seeing exceptional early returns from its investment in cloud services and artificial intelligence ai though these ancillary operations only accounted for 21 of first quarter sales revenue jumped by 70 what s more cloud services and ai offer higher margins relative to marketing revenue over time we should see these ancillary segments really boost baidu s cash flow generation while i wouldn t count on 395 anytime soon i do believe 395 is a reasonable future price target for the fast growing baidu intercept pharmaceuticals implied upside of 393 if you re looking for a company with make or break opportunity biotech stock intercept pharmaceuticals icpt might be for you this polarizing small cap drug developer with a focus on therapies to treat liver diseases has price targets from wall street ranging from as low as 16 to as high as 82 if this upper target comes to fruition shareholders would nearly quintuple their money the promise and peril for intercept lies with obeticholic acid oca an experimental treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash which affects between 2 and 5 of adults in this country and has no cure in one respect oca met one of its two co primary endpoints in the phase 3 regenerate study a statistically significant improvement in fibrosis without a worsening of nash however the highest and most effective dose also led to a large number of cases of pruritus itching in trial participants ultimately intercept s top drug candidate received a complete response letter from the food and drug administration the plan for intercept is to provide additional safety and trial data with the goal of resubmitting the application even if oca is approved and targeted at a small subset of the sickest patients it could offer blockbuster sales potential in this untapped indication the other consideration here is ocaliva the brand name version of oca is already approved to treat primary biliary cholangitis and is on track to bring in 325 million to 340 million in sales this year with an existing safety profile and a modestly growing sales floor intercept s risk reward ratio looks favorable nio implied upside of 110 a fifth and final growth stock with serious upside according to wall street is china based electric vehicle ev manufacturer nio nio 1 74 if the loftiest price target of more than 92 were to come true investors would see their shares more than double in value the excitement surrounding nio has to do with the impending electrification of china s automobiles the society of automotive engineers of china predicted back in 2018 that half of all vehicles sold in the world s largest auto market would run on alternative energy by 2035 with the ev industry predominantly nascent in china the door is wide open for multiple companies to gobble up significant share having resolved any funding concerns with capital raises the focus now is on nio s production expansion even facing industrywide chip shortages nio still managed to deliver almost 21 900 evs during the second quarter which was more than double what it delivered in the year ago period assuming chip supply issues can be resolved somewhat soon nio s annual ev run rate output should climb toward 150 000 additionally nio is enticing new buyers with its battery as a service program enrolling in this monthly fee based program can lop thousands of dollars off the initial purchase price of a vehicle all while improving buyer loyalty for nio a 92 price target might be a bit much for a company that s produced fewer than 118 000 evs inception nevertheless its execution of late is commendable

release we also present free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures presented as supplemental measures of the company s performance they are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap free cash flow represents net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures ebitda represents net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda before stock based compensation expense and gain loss on change in value of derivative warrant liability and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for hedging activities free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because we believe they provide additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry we use free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplements to gaap measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies to make budgeting decisions to allocate resources and to compare our performance relative to our peers additionally these measures when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework which management uses in addition to historical operating results as the basis for financial operational and planning decisions and present measurements that third parties have indicated are useful in assessing the company and its results of operations free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital needs free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt or cash income tax payments although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in this industry may calculate free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than vertex energy does limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure for example adjusted free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized in accordance with gaap are unaudited and have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap the company s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items we compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure we encourage investors and others to review our business results of operations and financial information in their entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non gaap measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for more information on these non gaap financial measures please see the section titled

any such jurisdiction non gaap financial measures in addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in this earnings release we also present free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures presented as supplemental measures of the company s performance they are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap free cash flow represents net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures ebitda represents net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda before stock based compensation expense and gain loss on change in value of derivative warrant liability and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for hedging activities free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because we believe they provide additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry we use free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplements to gaap measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies to make budgeting decisions to allocate resources and to compare our performance relative to our peers additionally these measures when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework which management uses in addition to historical operating results as the basis for financial operational and planning decisions and present measurements that third parties have indicated are useful in assessing the company and its results of operations free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital needs free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt or cash income tax payments although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in this industry may calculate free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than vertex energy does limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure for example adjusted free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period free cash flow ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized in accordance with gaap are unaudited and have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap the company s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items we compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure we encourage investors and others to review our business results of operations and financial information in their entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non gaap measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for more information on these non gaap financial measures please see the section titled reconciliations of free

keith roysdon special to the star press muncie ind if you think the selection of vehicles on many auto dealers lots is looking sparse it s not your imagination thanks to global supply chain problems namely a shortage of computer chips production of new vehicles has been stalled and delivery of vehicles to your neighborhood car lot has been as slow as it s been in decades the production shortfall along with other issues like higher than expected demand for vehicles since the early days of the covid 19 pandemic has made it harder to find a new car used cars are flying off the lots and dealers are asking recent customers if they d be willing to sell their cars back at dealers like victory honda in muncie fewer than two dozen new cars were in stock within the last two weeks that s a tenth of the number the dealership would like to offer and car buyers report varying degrees of difficulty in finding a car not to mention their car of choice for the right price and in a reasonable amount of time i had a very hard time finding an affordable vehicle for months said brittany dibattiste who ended up buying a used car from its owner most of the blame for the bottleneck of new vehicles goes not solely to the pandemic this time but to the production of computer chips it s a problem exacerbated by bad decisions by the auto industry computer chip shortage hits home even before the pandemic forbes reported in july production of semiconductors made from elements that true to their name conduct some but not all electricity to a computer chip in china was in flux production issues at intel and united states restrictions on chinese manufacturers stressed the auto industry forbes wrote the computer chips are essential to most new cars and trucks sold in the united states when the pandemic hit auto manufacturers expected a sharp downturn in car buying and canceled orders for new vehicles labor shortage why are businesses struggling to find workers but demand for new cars continued to be strong and rose for several months in a row in 2020 chip manufacturers were unable or unwilling to help when automakers begged for more of their product to meet demand for new vehicles the lack of new auto product meant that beginning in mid 2020 it was harder to find new vehicles prices were higher rental car companies sold much of their fleets and couldn t replace them and used cars were worth their weight in gold or at least computer chips the pandemic was disruptive because it closed factories around the world said michael hicks an economist at ball state university if you drive by victory honda or elsewhere they have almost no inventory there hicks said there s relief down the road but it could take a while at victory honda the inventory is a little more than a tenth of what it should be said jason shively general manager dealerships that normally have 200 new vehicles in stock have 20 the flow into the dealership of as many as 60 new cars each month has been reduced by as much as a tenth production has come back some but not enough to keep up shively said many dealerships in lafayette richmond and muncie contacted for this article declined to comment or failed to respond to the inquiry stay informed and support local journalism subscribe today using the link at the top of this page at bob poynter ford in seymour the usual stock of new and used cars is greatly reduced co owner j d roberts said we normally have 150 to 180 used cars right now we have about 80 roberts said we re turning our inventory 20 times a year compared to our typical 11 or 12 turns as for new vehicles roberts said right now we have 48 new between two dealerships the ideal number would be 600 roberts said he hasn t been selling vehicles at more than the manufacturer s suggested retail price the vehicles are selling quickly if a car lands on our lot we get three calls from in state and out of state he said some hopeful car buyers are taking every route they can find to find a vehicle sometimes that s as easy as visiting a car dealership sometimes it means searching for someone who ll sell them a used car waiting for some buying off the lot for others some car buyers have been able to find the vehicles they want kimberly livingston of muncie bought a kia telluride and her husband bought a jeep wrangler she couldn t find the kia she wanted in muncie but found it in indianapolis the jeep came in about a month i ended up waiting four or five months for the kia she said it was definitely a different experience than i ve ever had buying a car before bryan byers also of muncie was able to find the vehicles he wanted a toyota 4runner and 2002 camaro z28 on local lots he traded in his old vehicles the trades went off without a hitch electric vehicles indiana gives utilities 5 5 million to build electric vehicle chargers across the state i think i did well on both of them byers said he added that his daughter had leased a toyota corolla and when the lease was up at toyota of muncie it made sense for her to buy the car due to lack of inventory that would be anywhere close in price kathleen scott bought her 2019 honda hrv new at an indianapolis dealer and had it serviced in muncie in recent weeks she s been asked by both dealerships if she would consider selling it back to them i told them i m not interested in selling she said you want me to sell you my vehicle but you don t have anything to sell me huge surge in demand dibattiste needed a dependable and affordable vehicle for transporting herself to and from school for the next 18 months i looked at dealerships first but everything was so overpriced or way too far away to look at it i gave up on that idea after a couple of months she found a fortville man who had previously sold her father in law a vehicle she bought a 2002 honda accord it isn t the prettiest and has a lot of miles but they took very good care of it i am thankful i found my accord she said buyers trying to find the best deal or the lowest interest rate caused a huge surge in demand hicks said michael hicks the inflation puzzle partly solved hicks said the surge in demand follows the biggest economic shock since the great depression in terms of its effects and speed it s the worst in history we lost one in four jobs in 90 days last year it took from october 1929 to the summer of 1933 for us to lose a quarter of jobs last year it took us from february to april on the car side all factories close for a couple of months then the stimulus had a better effect than expected so now is the time when people have 5 or 10 thousand dollars sitting around to make down payment on a car or home it s nothing permanently destructive as a consequence hicks added and the good news is that except for computer chips there are several hundred thousand cars assembled roberts said that at his seymour ford dealership the plan is for the automaker to ship some vehicles to dealers and the dealers will install the chips when they become available i d much rather have the vehicle here tangible and we install the chips roberts said is a return to normal within sight shively said i think production levels equal to demand is within sight but as far as excess production to bring inventory levels back up to normal that still seems pretty far off hicks agreed it will even back out he said but it could well persist for a year

now apple may scan photos on uk iphones too tool that checks for child sex abuse images could be on its way to britain apple tool to scan iphones for child sex images could be coming to the uk neuralmatch analyses users images and photo that are stored on icloud backup pictures are compared to database of known child sex abuse material csam any matches to the csam are alerted to the appropriate authorities an apple tool that scans iphones for child sex abuse images could come to the uk neuralmatch analyses users images that are stored on its icloud backup system it compares them with a database of known child sex abuse material csam and alerts the authorities if matches are found the tech giant yesterday said it hoped to expand the feature due out in the us this autumn to other countries the uk s internet watch foundation which works to eliminate child sexual abuse online said it would welcome the software which puts child safety at the forefront of new technology an apple tool that scans iphones for child sex abuse images could come to the uk stock image but jim killock of the uk s open rights group said it could sooner or later open a back door for mass government surveillance of individuals apple rejected the claim saying let us be clear this technology is limited to detecting csam stored in icloud and we will not accede to any government s request to expand it it added we have faced demands to build and deploy government mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before and have steadfastly refused those demands we will continue to refuse them in the future susie hargreaves chief executive of the iwf said this is a great example of a technology company doing the right thing and creating equivalency neuralmatch analyses users images that are stored on its icloud backup system it compares them with a database of known child sex abuse material csam and alerts the authorities if matches are found stock image they have acknowledged that while customers privacy must be respected and protected it cannot be at the expense of children s safety this system is a promising step in making the internet a safer place for everyone apple is introducing two features on us iphones designed to protect children one blurs sexually explicit images received by children in the messages app and can notify a parent if a child aged under 13 decides to view it the second is neuralmatch that system has been trained on 200 000 sex abuse images collected by the national center for missing and exploited children if a certain number of images are marked suspect apple will pass the information onto the authorities apple defends plan to scan iphones for child sexual abuse images saying its algorithm can only identify flagged photos and the likelihood of a false positive is less than one in one trillion per year by dan avery for dailymail com apple is pushing back against criticism over its plan to scan photos on users iphones and in icloud storage in search of child sexual abuse images in a frequently asked questions document focusing on its expanded protections for children apple insisted its system couldn t be exploited to seek out images related to anything other than child sexual abuse material csam the system will not scan photo albums apple says but rather looks for matches based on a database of hashes a type of digital fingerprint of known csam images provided by child safety organizations while privacy advocacies worry about false positives apple boasted that the likelihood that the system would incorrectly flag any given account is less than one in one trillion per year apple also claims it would refuse any such demands from government agencies in the us or abroad the cupertino based corporation announced the new system last thursday that uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to scan images for matches to known abuse material provided by the national center for missing exploited children a leading clearinghouse for the prevention of and recovery from child victimization child advocacy groups praised the move but privacy advocates like greg nojeim of the center for democracy and technology say apple is replacing its industry standard end to end encrypted messaging system with an infrastructure for surveillance and censorship apple will use hashes or digital fingerprints from a csam database to scan photos on a user s iphone using a machine learning algorithm any match is sent to apple for human review and then sent to america s national center for missing and exploited children other tech companies including microsoft google and facebook have shared what hash lists of known images of child sexual abuse csam detection for icloud photos is built so that the system only works with csam image hashes provided by ncmec and other child safety organizations reads the new faqs this set of image hashes is based on images acquired and validated to be csam by child safety organizations apple says a human review process will act as a backstop against government abuse and that it will not automatically pass reports from its photo checking system to law enforcement if the review finds no objectionable photos a new tool coming with ios 15 will allow apple to scan images loaded to the cloud for pictures previously flagged as presenting child sexual abuse critics warn the system opens a giant back door to spying on users apple distributed this internal memo this morning dismissing their critics as the screeching voices of the minority i will never stop screeching about the importance of privacy security or civil liberties and neither should you pic twitter com lldfxeuixl eva evacide august 6 2021 we have faced demands to build and deploy government mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before and have steadfastly refused those demands the company wrote we will continue to refuse them in the future apple has previously altered its practices to suit various nations before in china one of its biggest markets it abandoned the encryption technology it uses elsewhere after china prohibited it according to the new york times while the measures are initially only being rolled out in the us apple plans for the technology to soon be available worldwide the technology will allow apple to flag images to the authorities after being manually checked by staff if they match child sexual abuse images compiled by the us national center for missing and exploited children ncmec apple will scan images that are sent and received in the messages app if nudity is detected the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned that the photo might contain private body parts siri will intervene when users try to search topics related to child sexual abuse if a child under the age of 13 sends or receives a suspicious image parents will get a notification if the child s device is linked to family sharing on friday eva galperin cybersecurity director for the digital civil rights group electronic frontier foundation eff tweeted a screenshot of an email to apple staffers from marita rodriguez ncmec executive director for strategic partnerships thanking them for finding a path forward for child protection while preserving privacy what are hashes used by apple facebook google and twitter to locate child abusers the technology works by creating a unique fingerprint called a hash for each image reported to the foundation these fingerprints are then passed on to internet companies to be automatically removed from the net once an image has been targeted an employee will look at the content of the file and analyze the message to determine if it should be handed over to the right authorities the system that uses the same technology as facebook twitter and google employ to locate child abusers advertisement it s been invigorating for our entire team to see and play a small role in what you unveiled today martinez reportedly wrote we know that the days to come will be filled with the screeching voices of the minority our voices will be louder but eff s india mckinney and eric portnoy caution such optimism is naïve in a statement the pair said it would only take a tweak of the machine learning system s parameters to look for different kinds of content the abuse cases are easy to imagine governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent lgbtq content or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers they warned eff acknowledged child exploitation was a serious problem but said at the end of the day even a thoroughly documented carefully thought out and narrowly scoped backdoor is still a backdoor whatsapp ceo will cathcart joined the chorus of critics in a string of tweets friday confirming the facebook owned messaging app would not follow apple s strategy i think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people s privacy all over the world cathcart tweeted apple s system can scan all the private photos on your phone even photos you haven t shared with anyone that s not privacy ceo will cathcart said whatsapp will not adopt apple s strategy to address the sharing of child sexual abuse material csam calling child sexual abuse material and those who traffic in it repugnant cathcart added that people have asked if we ll adopt this system for whatsapp the answer is no we ve had personal computers for decades and there has never been a mandate to scan the private content of all desktops laptops or phones globally for unlawful content it s not how technology built in free countries works he said this is an apple built and operated surveillance system that could very easily be used to scan private content for anything they or a government decides it wants to control advertisement the updates will be a part of ios 15 ipados 15 watchos 8 and macos monterey later this year

san diego ca aug 10 2021 globe newswire via newmediawire sigyn therapeutics inc otc markets sigy a medical technology company focused on the treatment of sepsis and other life threatening inflammatory conditions today released the following note authored by its chairman and ceo jim joyce sigyn therapeutics was founded on the belief that a properly designed medical device could address sepsis and other life threatening inflammatory conditions that remain beyond the reach of drug therapies this belief is reflected through our development of sigyn therapy since december 2020 we reported results from a series of studies that have demonstrated first in industry capabilities of sigyn therapy to address pathogen sources of inflammation deadly toxins and relevant inflammatory mediators among the therapeutic targets validated were viral pathogens including covid 19 bacterial endotoxin relevant inflammatory cytokines il 6 il 1b tnf a and hepatic toxins ammonia bilirubin and bile acid we also completed a study that modeled our ability to capture cytovesicles that transport inflammatory cargos throughout the bloodstream contributing to these expansive capabilities is a formulation of adsorbent components that are incorporated within sigyn therapy our adsorbent formulation provides more than 170 000 square meters of surface area on which to adsorb and remove bloodstream targets this equates to more than 40 acres of surface adsorption area in each adult version of sigyn therapy conversely consider that the 340 million market value of our closest public comparable is driven by an adsorption device market cleared to treat life threatening inflammatory conditions outside the u s with approximately one fourth of our surface area capacity and based on an adsorbent bead component whose maximum pore size to eliminate inflammatory targets is reported to be 5 nanometers sigyn therapy has been demonstrated to address inflammatory targets as well as pathogen sources of inflammation whose molecular size can exceed 100 nanometers in size beyond our broad spectrum capacity to remove bloodstream targets we disclosed on july 29th the completion of our first in mammal pilot study that demonstrated the safe administration of sigyn therapy during six hour treatment exposures in the coming months we will continue to collect animal safety data which will be included in an investigational device exemption ide that we are drafting for submission to the united states food and drug administration fda to support the initiation of human clinical studies sincerely jim about sigyn therapeutics sigyn therapeutics is focused on a significant unmet need in global health the treatment of life threatening inflammatory conditions that are precipitated by cytokine storm syndrome the annual market opportunity exceeds 20 billion sigyn therapy is a multifunctional blood purification technology designed to mitigate the cytokine storm that underlies sepsis the 1 cause of in hospital deaths and other high mortality inflammatory disorders commonly induced by bacterial and viral pathogens to overcome the limitations of previous therapies sigyn therapy addresses the source of inflammation viral pathogens bacterial toxins in concert with the broad spectrum depletion of inflammatory cytokines from the bloodstream additionally the device establishes a therapeutic strategy to target cytovesicles that transport inflammatory cargos throughout the circulatory system sigyn therapy incorporates a formulation of adsorbent components that optimize the broad spectrum elimination of therapeutic targets from the bloodstream without the risk of direct blood cell interactions to support widespread implementation sigyn therapy is a single use disposable device designed for use on the established infrastructure of hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy crrt machines already located in hospitals and clinics worldwide the company has also completed studies that reinforce the potential use of sigyn therapy to address acute and chronic liver indications with an initial focus directed toward hepatic encephalopathy to learn more visit www

the owner of iowa s shuttered cricket hollow zoo lost their appeal last week after having their animals seized as part of a years long campaign against them by activist groups pamela and thomas sellner of manchester lost their animals and their life s work after major attacks by the deceptively named people for the ethical treatment of animals and a lawsuit by the animal legal defense fund who alleged that the zoo was a public nuisance despite there being no complaints from neighbors or local law enforcement the animal rights organizations do not believe that any animals should be in human care except under their terms and control so they targeted this small private zoo that was started as a passion project by a family of iowa farmers after visiting the zoo the judge remarked the smell was horrific i mean i understand you ve got seven scheduled days of trial but what i saw today paints a picture a thousand words can t describe it is unclear if a dairy farm has ever had a nice smell the court s references to the site visit give us pause the appeals court s decision stated but the court ultimately allowed the defense to present its case and based the final order on the evidence while there very well may have been unsatisfactory conditions at the zoo one has to wonder why they wouldn t just volunteer to help or pitch in for this family that clearly has a great love of animals instead of spending millions to destroy them speaking to the gateway pundit pamela sellner described years of abuse and intimidation by the animals rights activists as well as their shocking behavior during the animal seizure sellner said that they appealed twice and lost both times so the organization came and took all of their tigers soon lions were added to the threatened list and the aldf came and took her deceased son s lion as well the stress of the incident gave her a mini stroke causing her to lose half of her eyesight in 2019 sellner was sued by the animal rights group for being a public nuisance and on the first day of the trial everyone including the judge went to visit her property she says it was a cold and windy day most of the aldf lawyers came from california and weren t dressed for the weather she said they walked through with their teeth chattering it wasn t quite time to hibernate the bears yet but they were really groggy that day because it was so cold sellner explained that the judge was not supposed to talk to anybody during the walk through because the court reporter wasn t there so everyone walked through silently instead of remaining impartial the judge went on to go ballistic on sellner saying that the small private zoo was not up to the same standards as the san diego zoo or seaworld which the judge said she had been to before the trial the aldf had sent an undercover activist from utah to the park to photograph each animal and take inventory of what they had we just thought she was a regular guest at the zoo sellner said sellner says that the woman did not even know what kind of animals she was talking about during her testimony at one point mistaking a mule for a horse at one point sellner says the judge held up a photograph of one of the snakes from the reptile house and asked earnestly do you think this snake looks sad following her own testimony on the final day sellner was told that the decision could take up to 60 days but offered a deal in which they could compromise and just take all the large animals she declined about three weeks later the judge came back with her decision that the animal rights group could take all of the exotic animals but spared her farm animals when they came out to take stuff they started at the farm end sellner said they took a lot of my farm animals first she never got to watch how they tranquilized and took her primates sellner protested and said that nowhere in the order did it authorize them to take amphibians from the aquariums but the man told her that he did not care what it said and that he was leaving with them i found out later that they killed my two foot long snowflake eel that was very special to me sellner said it was my pride and joy they also took my five foot caiman out of her water and paraded her outside in the december cold for photos before throwing her in their truck sellner said the activists took her wallaby which she says they killed within three days of having it they claimed that i had starved it to death but i know that isn t true they wouldn t provide a necropsy or any photos of it that wallaby was raised by its mother it wasn t hand raised sellner explained she believes that they broke its neck the group did not return until several days later if the family had not checked the property for animals and fed and maintained them many of the animals that they left likely would have suffered without food or water during this time sellner says that the judge changed her ruling four times during the raids from originally only saying that they could take the exotics then expanding to her farm domestic animals and even horses she graciously let me keep my family poodle sellner said why was my poodle even up for grabs by the end of 2019 the animal right activists had already stolen her animals sellner said so she was going to turn her usda license in and reapply the following year the usda said that would be fine sellner is now facing a contempt charge for moving animals off the property before the animal rights groups could come take them in her op ed for the register kuehl concluded it should not fall on private citizens to take legal action to protect these animals it seems that is something both parties can agree with why are private organizations being allowed to seize anything from anyone they don t quit sellner said everything i worked a lifetime for is gone cassandra fairbanks is a former leftist who came out in support of donald trump in 2016 she has been published in the international business times rt sputnik the independent and countless other publications

financial measures this press release contains certain non ifrs measures specifically adjusted ebitda and total recurring revenue these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of the company s results of operations from management s perspective accordingly these measures should not be considered in isolation
