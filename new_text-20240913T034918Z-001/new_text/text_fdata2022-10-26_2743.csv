chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed

had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my

between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and

arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed china unfavourably with 51 having a favourable view by 2022 a stunning 82 were unfavourable a level only exceeded in sweden japan and australia voters across western democracies also increasingly distrust globalisation fuelled by growing economic inequality a majority across 28 leading economies told research firm edelman in 2017 that globalisation is taking us in the wrong direction alarmingly edelman found in 2019 that only 18 of respondents across developed economies affirmed that the system is working for me with 34 being unsure and 48 outright declaring the system is failing them support for democracy has weakened in parallel especially among the young political scientists yascha mounk and roberto stefan foa respectively of john hopkins and cambridge universities found in 2017 that whereas 75 of americans born in the 1930s agreed it is essential to live in a democracy the figure was just 28 among millennials similar trends can be observed in many other countries this has helped into power populists from hungary s viktor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro to donald trump and most recently giorgia meloni italy s most right wing leader since mussolini note that italy had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my third scenario they are frequently invoked as the exemplar of stagflation with soaring prices stubbornly high unemployment and plenty of labour strife however global tensions had eased at least between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and societies could range from minor to dramatic with considerable variation across industries and regions zeroing in on the underlying dynamics and contemplating their potential impact on business government and society is something we should all do to effectively navigate the rapids ahead author david bach rio tinto chair in stakeholder engagement and professor of strategy and political

there are few better ways of understanding the global economy than watching the performance of britain s biggest bank hsbc under noel quinn s leadership has pulled out of france and is exiting canada and greece with its big footprint in china and the pacific a headquarters and retail bank in the uk and as the principal conduit for money passing from hong kong to new york it is a critical barometer on the state of the world with its big footprint in china a headquarters in the uk and as the principal conduit for money passing from hong kong to new york hsbc is a critical barometer on the state of the world underlying earnings for the third quarter when hsbc made 5 4billion show rising interest rates mean banks that manage to limit bad loans in an era of recession will become cash machines hsbc upgraded its net interest forecast for the whole of 2022 to 28 3billion and to 31 9billion for 2023 it is hard to think that rishi sunak and his chancellor jeremy hunt will not see this as a windfall to be raided as they seek to close the gap in the public finances the scale of hsbc s balance sheet means it will be one of the largest beneficiaries from the widening interest rate margins it also has problems to contend with hsbc may not have been a victim of the biggest chinese property insolvency when evergrande began struggling under a mountain of debt last year but the gloom that has cast over the whole real estate sector in the region requires big provisions against future losses the liz truss episode at number 10 and the volatility on uk financial markets also meant a modest 177million set aside quinn is reshaping the bank with its biggest 8 3 per cent shareholder ping an with close connections to beijing looking over its shoulder the chinese insurer wants hsbc to split off its asian operations from the rest reality is that hsbc while hugely important in the pacific has a unique role connecting the far east to financial centres in new york and london the bank is being shy on why it has decided to replace finance chief ewen stevenson a refugee from rbs now natwest and insists it is nothing to do with strategy his replacement by george elhedery the co head of global banking and markets could well be a signal to ping an of the importance of investment banking and trading moreover in hsbc fashion it signals a succession structure when quinn is through with his disposals over the years hsbc often has threatened to move its hq from london to asia the possibility of yet another bank tax will cause squeals however the political clampdown in hong kong and the increasing authoritarianism in beijing make it imperative that hsbc still has an alternate identity and imprimatur of bank of england regulation old hand at the age of 80 american activist nelson peltz unlike his president joe biden shows no signs of giving in to the ravages of age down the decades he has made a habit of shaking up the fast moving consumer goods sector his fingerprints are to be seen all over mondelez the owner of cadbury schweppes now part of coke kraft heinz nestle and proctor gamble it should come as no surprise that when the veteran dealmaker came knocking on unilever s door the board decided to let him in he was regarded as more dangerous outside blackfriars than inside by the time peltz arrived chief executive alan jope had made his unsuccessful pass at what is now haleon gsk s consumer healthcare arm and put in place a reorganisation some believe that the latter came too late for jope to extend his life in the top job the search is on for a successor historically at unilever internal appointments are preferred however with peltz s network of contacts in the food and allied industries it is not that surprising that he is exploring names unilever is not known for modest pay levels nevertheless poaching from the us where executive salaries and bonus arrangements are in the stratosphere may be tricky one cannot blame peltz for trying but the nominations committee headed by chairman nils andersen should feel put upon second hand watchers of the apprentice will know that previously owned clothes are a fashionable online category data from hipster tech bank revolut shows the whole vintage sector is booming with antique furniture sales up 71 per cent spending on vinyl records 17pc ahead and used glassware sales ahead 29 per cent who needs shiny new things
chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance

groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was

inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now

hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties

chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed china unfavourably with 51 having a favourable view by 2022 a stunning 82 were unfavourable a level only exceeded in sweden japan and australia voters across western democracies also increasingly distrust globalisation fuelled by growing economic inequality a majority across 28 leading economies told research firm edelman in 2017 that globalisation is taking us in the wrong direction alarmingly edelman found in 2019 that only 18 of respondents across developed economies affirmed that the system is working for me with 34 being unsure and 48 outright declaring the system is failing them support for democracy has weakened in parallel especially among the young political scientists yascha mounk and roberto stefan foa respectively of john hopkins and cambridge universities found in 2017 that whereas 75 of americans born in the 1930s agreed it is essential to live in a democracy the figure was just 28 among millennials similar trends can be observed in many other countries this has helped into power populists from hungary s viktor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro to donald trump and most recently giorgia meloni italy s most right wing leader since mussolini note that italy had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my third scenario they are frequently invoked as the exemplar of stagflation with soaring prices stubbornly high unemployment and plenty of labour strife however global tensions had eased at least between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and societies could range from minor to dramatic with considerable variation across industries and regions zeroing in on the underlying dynamics and contemplating their potential impact on business government and society is something we should all do to effectively navigate the rapids ahead author david bach rio tinto chair in stakeholder engagement and professor of strategy and political

in discussing financial results and guidance the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the non gaap financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and are presented because management has

items are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management and make it easier for investors analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year over year results this earnings release and the accompanying tables also provide certain revenues and expenses as well as non gaap measures excluding the impact of foreign exchange we calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period results non gaap financial measures such as non gaap earnings and related eps information are adjusted to exclude certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics such as being highly variable difficult to project unusual in nature significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results these items are excluded from non gaap earnings and related eps information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company s business nor

first quarter of 2022 significant r d charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third party intellectual property rights are no longer excluded from our non gaap financial measures we made these changes to our presentation of non gaap financial measures following comments from and discussions with the u s securities and exchange commission for purposes of comparability the non gaap financial measures for the prior periods have been updated to reflect this change because the non gaap financial measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures presented in the press release that are prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and will also be available on the company s website at www bms

gaap operating expenses and non gaap tax rate is not provided because comparable gaap measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation namely we are not able to reliably predict the impact of specified items or currency exchange rates beyond the next twelve months in addition the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors the variability of the specified items may have a

against major currencies has eased as data releases including manufacturing housing and even the seemingly stubborn labor market suggest the economy is slowing in response to higher interest rates

chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed china unfavourably with 51 having a favourable view by 2022 a stunning 82 were unfavourable a level only exceeded in sweden japan and australia voters across western democracies also increasingly distrust globalisation fuelled by growing economic inequality a majority across 28 leading economies told research firm edelman in 2017 that globalisation is taking us in the wrong direction alarmingly edelman found in 2019 that only 18 of respondents across developed economies affirmed that the system is working for me with 34 being unsure and 48 outright declaring the system is failing them support for democracy has weakened in parallel especially among the young political scientists yascha mounk and roberto stefan foa respectively of john hopkins and cambridge universities found in 2017 that whereas 75 of americans born in the 1930s agreed it is essential to live in a democracy the figure was just 28 among millennials similar trends can be observed in many other countries this has helped into power populists from hungary s viktor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro to donald trump and most recently giorgia meloni italy s most right wing leader since mussolini note that italy had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my third scenario they are frequently invoked as the exemplar of stagflation with soaring prices stubbornly high unemployment and plenty of labour strife however global tensions had eased at least between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and societies could range from minor to dramatic with considerable variation across industries and regions zeroing in on the underlying dynamics and contemplating their potential impact on business

chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed china unfavourably with 51 having a favourable view by 2022 a stunning 82 were unfavourable a level only exceeded in sweden japan and australia voters across western democracies also increasingly distrust globalisation fuelled by growing economic inequality a majority across 28 leading economies told research firm edelman in 2017 that globalisation is taking us in the wrong direction alarmingly edelman found in 2019 that only 18 of respondents across developed economies affirmed that the system is working for me with 34 being unsure and 48 outright declaring the system is failing them support for democracy has weakened in parallel especially among the young political scientists yascha mounk and roberto stefan foa respectively of john hopkins and cambridge universities found in 2017 that whereas 75 of americans born in the 1930s agreed it is essential to live in a democracy the figure was just 28 among millennials similar trends can be observed in many other countries this has helped into power populists from hungary s viktor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro to donald trump and most recently giorgia meloni italy s most right wing leader since mussolini note that italy had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my third scenario they are frequently invoked as the exemplar of stagflation with soaring prices stubbornly high unemployment and plenty of labour strife however global tensions had eased at least between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and societies could range from minor to dramatic with considerable variation across industries and regions zeroing in on the underlying dynamics and contemplating their potential impact on business

october 25 2022 after delivering his first speech as prime minister rishi sunak was on tuesday appointed as britain s third prime minister this year after outgoing leader liz truss submitted her

leader on monday after a prior stint as chancellor himself addressing the nation in downing street tuesday shortly after his appointment by king charles iii sunak said the country faced profound economic crisis i will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government s agenda sunak vowed capping the latest extraordinary twist in uk politics following boris johnson s demise in july truss chosen by tory members over sunak in the summer to replace johnson left office as the uk s shortest serving premier in history the 47 year old wished the new leader every success noting she remained more convinced than ever that britain needs to be bold in confronting the challenges it faces sunak countered that though truss was motivated by a well intentioned desire to kick start growth her tax cutting measures were mistakes nonetheless and i have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister in part to fix them he said the government i lead will not leave the next generation with a debt to settle that we were too weak to pay ourselves he added helping to drive the pound more than one percent higher against the dollar sunak a wealthy descendant of

scandals that brought johnson down vowed his own premiership would offer integrity professionalism and accountability at every level in some of the other cabinet retentions aimed at stability sunak

instead of johnson loyalist jacob rees mogg sunak brought close ally dominic raab back as deputy prime minister and justice secretary and veteran cabinet member michael gove to tackle the country s entrenched regional inequality mordaunt remains in a post overseeing government business in parliament which may disappoint the ambitious centrist who had been tipped for a more senior role the line

is set to meet early wednesday british media said before sunak faces his first weekly face off with opposition parties at prime minister s questions in parliament in his first call with a foreign

as you progress through your adult life money management skills are vital for instance figuring out when and how to consolidate debt or managing your monthly budget is crucial knowing how to use credit cards responsibly is perhaps one of the most essential skills you should have though famous billionaire warren buffett has been disdainful of credit cards on multiple occasions his comments are worth considering so we ll take a few moments to break them down what does buffett say about credit cards buffett is an american business magnate who has been in the public eye for many years he is the ceo and chairman of berkshire hathaway a famous conglomerate headquartered in omaha nebraska buffett is worth about 95 billion today most individuals and families don t plan to accrue wealth to rival buffett s however whenever this highly successful businessman talks about his financial habits you should consider taking his advice to heart buffett doesn t like credit cards and he says he pays for about 98 of his purchases in cash instead at a berkshire hathaway shareholder s meeting in 2020 buffett spoke about a friend who came into money and asked for advice buffett advised her to pay off her credit card debt before doing anything else why buffett s advice makes sense if you take the time to analyze buffett s response it makes sense think about this if you invest in the stock market for an extended period you should historically see a return on your investment of 9 10 you might even see as much as a 12 15 return if it s a bull market meanwhile if you re carrying any credit card debt you re probably paying an average interest rate of 18 on it the interest rate on some of your individual cards might be more or less than that but 18 is the current average if you look at it that way you ll realize that you re losing money through credit card interest payments as long as you continue carrying debt millions of americans have at least some credit card debt and the interest payments are part of what s harming their ongoing financial strategies should you get rid of your credit cards warren buffett has never said you should get rid of your credit cards and it would be unrealistic to do so after all it s genuinely difficult to pay for everything in cash you can t use cash to pay for something you re buying through an online website like amazon most people don t like to carry large amounts of money when they re doing their weekly grocery shopping you need credit cards to pay for things like airline tickets or when you re booking hotels online getting rid of your credit cards isn t the solution to negating all of your credit card debt instead if you ever see a significant windfall it s best to use that money to pay off all of your credit card debts before you even begin to think about investing that s what warren buffett was trying to tell his friend use your credit cards responsibly you re probably not ever going to amass a fortune like warren buffett s but that doesn t mean you can t follow the advice he gave his friend you can keep the credit cards you have but exercise restraint with them try not to carry debt on your credit cards since the high interest rates you ll pay can easily wipe out the money your investments are bringing in if you use credit cards only when you can afford to pay off the balance at the end of that billing cycle you ll be in good shape you won t have to pay any exorbitant interest rates on your debt and you can also take advantage of the perks your card offers that s the best possible use of credit cards as financial tools if you want to be a responsible adult see campaign contact information name michael bertiniemail press credello comjob title consultant tags go media

chinese leader xi jinping s recent speech to the communist party congress could be one of the most consequential of the decade he told the audience and the world that his economic growth crushing zero covid policy is here to stay and that beijing is more determined than ever to reunify with taiwan peacefully if possible and by force if necessary we are living in a moment of deep geopolitical rifts and extraordinary economic uncertainty epitomised by xi s pronouncements the world is clearly not reverting to some pre covid status quo instead a combination of underlying forces has upended the previous world order and ushered in a period of profound disorder i want to look at four of these forces the deterioration in us china relations russia s war in ukraine populism and inflation to construct some political economic scenarios for the next two to five years any list of destabilising global forces is necessarily incomplete i won t consider climate change or biodiversity loss arguably the greatest challenges facing humanity a possible covid resurgence the impact of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies or the role of rogue regimes from iran to north korea instead i m focusing on the areas that i believe will have the greatest impact on global business over the next several years particularly because of their expected interaction 1 russia s war in ukraine not only did russian troops fail to subdue kyiv quickly as both the kremlin and many western observers had assumed russia looks increasingly likely to lose the war the mobilisation of reservists and nuclear sabre rattling notwithstanding there are three reasons for this first the extraordinary poise and courage of the ukrainian people armed forces and leaders second utter chaos on the russian side and third the remarkable unity across the west that has provided ukraine s troops with sophisticated weapons training and intelligence while slowly crippling russia s economy via boycotts and sanctions western businesses made important contributions as hundreds pulled out of russia stranding assets and foregoing profits western unity faces its greatest test this winter if gas supplies in europe run low and sky high energy prices accelerate an expected slide into recession individual european governments may well waver over ukraine if confronted by angry and cold voters of course europe s dependence on russian gas is self inflicted as recently as 2014 only about 20 of eu gas was russian by early 2022 it was almost 40 despite loud warnings from washington germany the continent s largest economy actually increased its dependence after putin s illegal annexation of crimea berlin viewed russian gas as cheaper and more sustainable than alternatives greater reliance also fitted a german foreign policy doctrine vis a vis the soviet union russia dating back five decades called wandel durch handel change through trade while dangerously naive in hindsight a similar philosophy informed us policy toward china until recently creating dependencies that are not vastly different 2 us china relations for four decades following then us president richard nixon s groundbreaking trip to china in 1972 the us sought better relations with beijing via closer economic integration things began to change during barack obama s second term in response to xi jinping s muscular posture at home and abroad before subsequently rupturing with donald trump s trade war if anything the biden administration has accelerated the switch from cooperation to confrontation via beefed up security alliances in the region with countries like australia export controls for advanced technologies such as microprocessors and de facto defence commitments to taiwan a day after xi s speech at the party congress the us secretary of state antony blinken told an audience at stanford university that in relation to strategically important taiwan beijing was now determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline than previously over the past several months i have spoken with hundreds of mainly european senior executives about the current geopolitical panorama many described the difficult decision to withdraw from russia yet for most russia represents less than 5 of their business when asked what they would do if the taiwan situation escalates the silence was deafening with massive dependence on and exposure to both the american and chinese markets leaders from industries including automobiles and consumer and luxury goods readily admit they have no playbook 3 populism one reason why us policy toward beijing is unlikely to soften is that china is one of few things the highly polarised us electorate agrees on in 2011 only 36 of americans viewed china unfavourably with 51 having a favourable view by 2022 a stunning 82 were unfavourable a level only exceeded in sweden japan and australia voters across western democracies also increasingly distrust globalisation fuelled by growing economic inequality a majority across 28 leading economies told research firm edelman in 2017 that globalisation is taking us in the wrong direction alarmingly edelman found in 2019 that only 18 of respondents across developed economies affirmed that the system is working for me with 34 being unsure and 48 outright declaring the system is failing them support for democracy has weakened in parallel especially among the young political scientists yascha mounk and roberto stefan foa respectively of john hopkins and cambridge universities found in 2017 that whereas 75 of americans born in the 1930s agreed it is essential to live in a democracy the figure was just 28 among millennials similar trends can be observed in many other countries this has helped into power populists from hungary s viktor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro to donald trump and most recently giorgia meloni italy s most right wing leader since mussolini note that italy had the world s second highest dissatisfaction rates with democracy in a 2021 survey topped only by greece 4 inflation this deep discontent with the prevailing political economic order was before inflation reached levels not seen in four decades by hiking benchmark interest rates in response the us federal reserve and european central bank accept they may trigger a recession most analysts now expect one on both sides of the atlantic in 2023 meanwhile china s zero covid policy continues to weaken the world s second largest economy while its struggling property sector threatens to engulf the global financial system pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist did not mince words about the world economy at the organisation s annual meeting in early october warning that the darkest hours are still ahead and calling the outlook very painful but an even greater fear is stagflation interest rate hikes that crush growth send unemployment soaring and fail to meaningfully reduce inflation the interaction of such economic dynamics with anti establishment populism would surely be profoundly destabilising for an already shaky global order four scenarios drawing on the forces described above i have been urging business leaders from across sectors to contemplate four scenarios scenarios are not about predicting the future they are about preparing for the future amidst uncertainty i locate the possibilities along two dimensions one economic and one geopolitical on the economic dimension the best case is that central banks and policymakers quickly bring inflation under control recessions in major markets are short lived and a global economic recovery begins in the second half of 2023 and accelerates in 2024 at the other extreme aggressive interest rate hikes might surface and exacerbate structural weaknesses in the global economy leading to a period of prolonged stagflation similarly with geopolitics vladimir putin might discover a face saving retreat from ukraine while xi with his third term secured could dial back his rhetoric regarding taiwan or more pessimistically ukraine could worsen sharply for example if putin chooses to use tactical nuclear weapons or nato is directly drawn into the conflict meanwhile nationalist fervour might lead xi to issue taiwan an ultimatum or an accidental use of force by either side could trigger a broader conflict by combining these different possibilities i create my four scenarios for illustrative purpose i associate each with a decade of the 20th century not because history will repeat itself but to crystallise what is at stake and how much the possible futures differ four scenarios when the pandemic s end seemed in sight several observers predicted a return of the roaring twenties the original roaring twenties occurred after the first world war when the league of nations ushered in a short period of international cooperation global trade resumed and economies recovered a latter day equivalent certainly remains possible if global tensions ease and the economy recovers quickly alternatively we can imagine an economic recovery without easing global tensions the early 1980s come to mind when decisive action by the chairman of the us federal reserve paul volcker reduced inflation and after a short recession growth resumed and the stock market boomed internationally however things were less rosy the us soviet 1970s detente came to an end with respective boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 olympics a proxy war in afghanistan and a renewed nuclear arms race the 1970s are my third scenario they are frequently invoked as the exemplar of stagflation with soaring prices stubbornly high unemployment and plenty of labour strife however global tensions had eased at least between the superpowers the spy who loved me captured the zeitgeist as james bond teamed up with a soviet agent to save the world compare this to the 1930s another decade in the 20th century characterised by high unemployment low growth and economic turmoil fascism swept away nascent democracies global tensions escalated and the world experienced a catastrophe that remains singular in human history the world today is very different from the decades in these scenarios technology has ushered in unprecedented connectedness stakeholders have become far more powerful and global supply chains and financial systems have vastly increased economic interdependence one hopes the horrors of the 20th century combined with the unimaginable destructiveness of modern weaponry limit potential conflict escalation yet the contrast between the decades highlights how changes in just two variables might distinguish a scenario that is great from one that is good one that is bad and one that is truly terrible asking which is the most likely is the wrong question it is more important for business leaders governments and individuals to recognise that the previous world order is gone the most resilient organisations will be the ones that make decisions on the basis of a clear sense of purpose and strong values not rigid strategies or action plans globalisation will not suddenly end but firms will increasingly make decisions that go beyond looking for the cheapest supplier or the biggest new market the next few years are probably also not the best time for businesses to strive for maximum efficiency cash will be king slack good and flexibility vital also it will be critical for business leaders to proactively convey what they stand for ideally before they get asked about the future of their china business how they might handle labour unrest or whether they believe in free and fair elections this period of disorder could be short or long and the impact on organisations and societies could range from minor to dramatic with considerable variation across industries and regions zeroing in on the underlying dynamics and contemplating their potential impact on business government and society is something we should all do to effectively navigate the rapids ahead author david bach rio tinto chair in stakeholder engagement and professor of strategy and political

providence republican candidate for governor ashley kalus faces allegations she bounced a paycheck and cheated the chief operating officer of adhereon an illinois based company that sought to market breast implant devices out of a 125 000 salary and even more in stock a lawsuit filed in chicago pits kalus and her husband plastic surgeon dr jeffrey weinzweig against adhereon s former coo kelley folino who was kalus boss when they both worked for illinois gov bruce rauner it accuses the weinzweigs of common law fraud and essentially torpedoing adhereon as part of a squeeze out plan to avoid cutting folino in on the assets she helped market company is broke end of story end of company end of friendship kalus allegedly wrote folino on march 14 2018 before the dispute escalated into the breach of contract lawsuit as recently as march 31 2022 kalus identified herself as the ceo of adhereon and her husband as the ceo of the related novaplast in a filing with the rhode island ethics commission campaign dismisses validity of suit the suit is meritless kalus campaign spokesman matt hanrahan wrote in response to a journal request for comment this case has been dismissed twice previously and a motion to dismiss will be filed shortly to again knock out the plaintiff s recently filed amended complaint scott lucas attorney for folino notes that the first time the case was dismissed it was at folino s request to change venue in an aug 1 filing while kalus was campaigning for governor of rhode island her lawyers in chicago wrote that folino s lawsuit is littered with generic vague and conclusory allegations against ashley jeffrey novaplast and jw plastic surgery they also argued that the weinzweigs ashley and jeffrey cannot be held personally liable for the alleged breach of a supposed oral contract for equity because adhereon was never properly organized and thus did not exist a judge at least partially agreed dismissing the lawsuit but folino has filed an amended complaint on monday kalus lawyer filed this response to folino s latest bid for a hearing on a hearing on why kalus should not be held in contempt thus folino has made clear her intent to impact the governor s race in rhode island with the july 21 order which folino now thinks can be used against the treasurer of ashley s campaign to freeze any assets kalus response said folino is completely out of control and this court should take steps to ensure that she is not able to do any permanent damage to this court ashley s campaign or the voters of rhode island ashley kalus the gop candidate for governor releases some of her tax returns what do they say what happened to kalus company the legal dispute revolves around plastic surgery and bone reconstruction technology weinzweig developed years earlier while working at the university of massachusetts at lowell after getting a master s degree kalus joined her husband in illinois where he was launching a new plastic surgery practice she also got involved in politics and worked on republican rauner s campaign as did folino when rauner took office in 2015 he hired folino as deputy chief of staff and kalus as director of public engagement the two women became friends in 2016 kalus left state government and according to the lawsuit aggressively recruited folino to go into business together helping commercialize breast implant devices developed by weinzweig and selling branded silicone based products and materials used for treatment of scars the startup company formed to do the work was adhereon and on aug 1 2017 after folino s employment with the illinois department of commerce ended and in reliance on promises and inducements ashley made on adhereon s behalf the lawsuit says kelley decided not to pursue other employment opportunities and began working full time on adhereon s development the business agreement between folino and the weinzweigs was verbal and never codified in a written contract folino was initially going to have the role of ceo but that was changed to coo and co founder according to the complaint which said she was to be paid 26 6 of adhereon s common stock and once a certain number of scar treatments were sold a 125 000 per year salary but after kalus and folino worked together through 2017 to get adhereon off the ground by early 2018 things had begun to unravel gubernatorial forum mckee kalus paint rhode island in stark contrasts at journal public s radio debate reality is we can t pay salaries as folino was trying to schedule meetings to have stock issued in february 2018 a 7 000 paycheck to folino just the second she had received from adhereon bounced according to the lawsuit then on march 13 kalus wrote the company is in worse shape than expected reality is we can t pay salaries nor are we in a position to personally loan the company any more money according to the complaint i know this might not be what you expected the next day folino and kalus met for breakfast and kalus said adhereon was insolvent ashley stormed out after kelley reminded her kelley had earned equity in the company and was entitled to her promised salary the complaint said after folino was cut off from the company email server kalus texted company is broke end of story end of company end of friendship the weinzweigs actions were designed and intended by the weinzweigs to squeeze kelley out of adhereon by excluding kelley from participating as a member of management and as a shareholder of adhereon and causing kelley financial distress through the denial of her past and future wages and her share of the value and distributions of adhereon the complaint said folino sued for breach of contract in may of 2018 and the case has been twisting and turning since the illinois secretary of state s corporate database lists adhereon as dissolved the weinzweigs have argued there are virtually no assets left in adhereon and the commercialization licenses for the umass developed patents are held by novaplast which they control this summer judge allen price walker denied a request by folino to place the assets of adhereon into receivership but ordered the weinzweigs not to transfer any assets other than in the ordinary course of business operations folino is currently chief of staff at the paulson institute a think tank founded by former u s treasury secretary henry paulson panderson providencejournal com 401 277 7384 on twitter patrickanderso_ campaign reports following the money in the race for ri governor

generally accepted accounting principles gaap the non gaap financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and are presented because management has evaluated the company s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation as applicable and believes that the non gaap financial measures presented portray the results of the company s baseline performance supplement or enhance management analysts and investors overall understanding of the company s underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current past and future periods in addition non gaap gross margin which is gross profit excluding certain specified items as a percentage of revenues non gaap operating expenses which is marketing selling and administrative and research and development expenses excluding certain specified items non gaap marketing selling and administrative expenses which is marketing selling and administrative expense excluding certain specified items and non gaap research and development expenses which is research and development expenses excluding certain specified items are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management and make it easier for investors analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year over year results this earnings release and the accompanying tables also provide certain revenues and expenses as well as non gaap measures excluding the impact of foreign exchange we calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period results non gaap financial measures such as non gaap earnings and related eps information are adjusted to exclude certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics such as being highly variable difficult to project unusual in nature significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results these items are excluded from non gaap earnings and related eps information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company s business nor reflect the company s underlying business performance similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including amortization of acquired intangible assets including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments acquisition and integration expenses restructuring costs accelerated depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment and intangible assets divestiture gains or losses stock compensation resulting from acquisition related equity awards pension legal and other contractual settlement charges equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments and amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from celgene in our 2019 exchange offer among other items deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates beginning with the first quarter of 2022 significant r d charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third party intellectual property rights are no longer excluded from our non gaap financial measures we made these changes to our presentation of non gaap financial measures following comments from and discussions with the u s securities and exchange commission for purposes of comparability the non gaap financial measures for the prior periods have been updated to reflect this change because the non gaap financial measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures presented in the press release that are prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and will also be available on the company s website at www bms com within the attached financial tables presented certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers also note that a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap gross margin non gaap operating expenses and non gaap tax rate is not provided because comparable gaap measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation namely we are not able to reliably predict the impact of specified items or currency exchange rates beyond the next twelve months in addition the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors the variability of the specified items may have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future gaap results website information we routinely post important information for investors

charlieaja istock via getty images the u k has just been through a big economic and financial mess as it has tried to bring about the government that it needs the recent chaos in the u k developed from a new government that tried to do a lot of things that people really didn t want that government under the leadership of newly chosen prime minister liz truss tried to produce a supply side economic program that emulated the former work of prime minister margaret thatcher the result financial markets collapsed ms truss had to back off ms truss had to resign and a new prime minister was chosen and financial markets recovered the british economy was not growing that fast but the british economy is on the brink of a tide of rising inflation something that the bank of england has already been fighting this past month the rate of inflation in the united kingdom was in excess of 10 0 percent a level unseen for forty years the british bond market reacted the stock market reacted things in the financial world became quite uncomfortable the call according to the editorial board of the financial times was for the public finances and the broader economy to be put back on an even keel while dealing with the cost of living squeeze and a credible plan for tax and spending that is the task facing the newest prime minister rishi sunak according to the opinion piece mr sunak has the right experience and outlook to take control at a time of deep economic crisis the united states perhaps the united states needs to take some note of the british experience the federal reserve system in the united states has been fighting a battle against inflation however the latest rate of inflation in the united states has been 8 2 percent again a level that has not been experienced in the u s for about forty years but even before the biden administration took office they have been talking up stimulus programs to support faster economic growth in the united states the presence of the covid 19 pandemic contributed to the expansion of economic programs that graced the biden administration program federal deficit as a percent of gdp federal reserve one can see that even from 2014 the federal deficit as a percentage of gdp was moving down the pandemic and following recession just caused the situation to worsen another look can be taken as the total debt as a percentage of gdp total public debt as a percent of gdp federal reserve on can see that before the great recession the total public debt of the united states was about 60 percent of annual gdp following the great recession this ratio moved up to about 100 percent and now the biden administration is facing a debt burden that is over 120 percent of the gdp and growing the united states is fighting rapidly increasing inflation and a growing debt burden not unlike what great britain was facing the future unfortunately the picture we have been examining is only a small part of the picture what about the impact is the russian invasion of ukraine have on this situation what about the possibility that china will invade taiwan what about the stirring energy crisis something the saudis seem to be adding to what about the supply shortages that ado not seem to be letting up and what about other things that do not even make this list at the present time policymakers are facing a multitude of problems as they try to bring inflation under control without throwing the economy into a descent the british were hit specifically with a political challenge one that threw bond markets into a fall one that disrupted other major british markets the british reacted and stated in effect no we don t want all this stimulation now especially as we are trying to bring inflation under control maybe the united states needs to listen to a little part of this message mr rishi sunak stated on tuesday our country is facing a profound economic crisis he promised that he would prioritize economic stability and confidence most of all he would try and restore trust in building that trust financial trust is a big part of what must be restore does the united states have something to learn from this my answer to this question is obviously yes as i suggested in the first paragraph above this period is a very messed up time a lot of things don t make sense we have low levels of unemployment businesses seem to be going along pretty well there is a lot of economic brightness to be seen in the future yet we are facing rapid inflation we have many markets that are in disequilibrium we have lost a lot of individuals from the work force as the labor force participation rate has fallen schools are in trouble plus several other things that we can mention uncertainty dominates the economy and the world maybe it is time to step back a little bit and not just keep throwing at the wall to see what sticks we ve done that once in the last several years and see where it has gotten us maybe right now we need to step back and quite attempting to push more and more stimulus into the land maybe we need to introduce some financial competence to the picture maybe we need more than anything to build some stability and trust into the system maybe this is what the stock market would like to see hopefully the british will set us an example of how to return to stability and trust let s wish them the best of luck
pennsylvania democratic senate candidate john fetterman who has worked to garner support from gop voters in the keystone state ahead of next month s election previously claimed that the republican hard core base represents nationalism xenophobia and homophobia fetterman s comments came during a podcast conversation with the delco young democast at the pennsylvania young democrats convention in august 2018 speaking about efforts to engage with republican voters across the state during his campaign for lieutenant governor of pennsylvania fetterman said there are some in the republican party that are unreachable you know nationalism xenophobia homophobia just overall i mean that s the southern strategy right that s been part of the republican hard core base since the republican party made it part of their base fetterman added fetterman previously said he didn t want support from those who cheer for trump hold opposing beliefs fetterman who now serves as the lieutenant governor of pennsylvania said at the time that he believed there were individuals who voted for former president donald trump in the 2016 presidential election who were reachable and could be persuaded into voting for him and that his party has a message that is unapologetically democratic and unapologetically progressive fetterman s outlook on republicans has seemingly changed however as his campaign aims to win support from gop voters in the state ahead of the november election earlier this month fetterman s senate campaign launched the republicans for fetterman initiative which featured ads with comments from alleged conservative voters in the state who say they will vote for fetterman over his republican opponent dr mehmet oz in the november 8 midterm election the effort according to a report from nbc10 philadelphia consists of both digital and television ads fetterman has also touted the support he is receiving from republicans on the campaign trail writing in a tweet this month that he is deeply grateful to have the support of vince tulio a montgomery county resident who said he has been a republican his entire life and will vote for fetterman another fetterman ad showcasing a self described republican voter from pennsylvania which was paid for by the democratic senatorial campaign committee and is titled that s the point features colleen bixler of westmoreland county in the ad bixler said she is tired of washington republicans and mitch mcconnell they just work for the lobbyists to rig everything for the rich trading stocks to benefit themselves sign bad trade deals side with corporations bixler claimed in the ad now mitch is spending millions to stop john fetterman john will ban them from trading stocks lower taxes on working people fight to make stuff here fetterman won t fit in in washington that s the point despite the support he is receiving from some supposed republicans in the state fetterman has a history of telling voters that he does not want their support if they hold certain beliefs fetterman supported ending cash bail so we don t criminalize poverty and we don t criminalize race during a february 2016 interview with in these times magazine prior to trump s victory over former secretary of state hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election fetterman who was campaigning for the senate while serving as the mayor of braddock was asked about the make america great again slogan that the trump campaign had adopted in his response fetterman said he did not want support from those who cheer for trump and claimed the then presidential candidate had said reprehensible things about a number of subjects my campaign has released a one sentence press release calling donald trump a jagoff which is western pennsylvania for jerk fetterman said at the time populism has a dark side and donald trump is mining that for all it s worth by saying reprehensible things about muslims about immigrants about you name it if you get to live vicariously through that and cheer him on i don t expect to get your vote and frankly i don t want it similarly fetterman said a month later that he did not want support from those who oppose the acceptance of syrian refugees in america primarily child refugees fetterman s remarks were captured in a video that was uploaded to youtube by the middletown democratic party in march 2016 click here to get the fox news app when you listen to the kind of poisonous rhetoric that s coming from the other side it s a race to the bottom on who can say the nastiest ugliest things about immigrants with ignoring the reality that they came from somewhere too you know marco rubio s family fled a dangerous regime that wanted to get nuclear weapons that were sworn enemies of the united states fetterman said where s marco rubio come from cuba but marco rubio and the republicans turn their backs on any syrians coming into this country how is it any different if you think that we should not let in a little five year old syrian orphan boy into this country then i don t want your vote he added i really don t because we are better than that as a country fetterman and oz will face off in a televised debate on tuesday just two weeks ahead of the state s senate election

domestic and foreign portfolio in the stock market is an extension in bearish trend the market has suffered since the beginning of sequential interest rate hikes in may 2022 currently at 15 5 per cent according to him investors exercised extreme caution in the month of september 2022 and are possibly still exercising extreme caution till date due to prolonged repricing of securities across markets and instruments a large number of investors might have decided to immunize their investments in less volatile instruments including short term money market instruments and currencies notably u s dollars that also explains the reason for the persistent depreciation of naira in the black market the chief operating officer supra commercial trust limited mr charles fakrogha said the drop in domestic and foreign portfolio exposure in the stock market for the month of september was a reflection of macroeconomy challenges according to him the hike in mpr by cbn to 15 5 per cent double digit inflation rate security challenges among others discouraged investors to invest in the stock market the managing director chief business officer optimus by afrivest mr ayodeji ebo had attributed that decline in foreign and domestic investors to persistent rise in fixed income yield due to the hike in mpr by regulatory authority analyst at pac holdings mr wole adeyeye said some investors migrated from stock market to fixed income market in a move to take advantage of high yields which was triggered by the recent hike in the policy rate also foreign investors avoided nigerian stock market due to the upcoming general elections weak local currency and insecurity in the country on his part the vice president highcap securities limited mr david adonri said the stock market commenced declining performance when the monetary policy committee mpc of cbn increase the interest rate he noted that other macro economy indicators such as inflation rate and scarcity of foreign exchange have also

parts of the mississippi river are lower than they have ever been according to national weather service records dating to 1954 corn exports are down 21 this year soybean exports are down 12 adm believes u s grain prices will drop helping them offset the lost revenue from decreased exports while low water in the mississippi river will hurt iowa s farmers archer daniels midland co executives said their business will be just fine ceo juan luciano told analysts on a call tuesday morning that the multinational agricultural conglomerate will continue to ship less grain from north america through the end of this year citing the drought that has caused closures and backlogs along the mississippi this month but luciano said adm will be able to export extra corn and soybeans through the gulf coast early next year to make up for the current shortage in the meantime he told analysts the company will ship more grain from terminals in south america plus with prices falling as crops pile up at local elevators and terminals amid the reduced shipping volume he predicted lower prices will help adm s other lines of business further offsetting their shipping losses in particular he expects a boost to the company s processing plants which crush soybeans to produce animal feed and oils the company which operates plants in iowa including one is des moines also processes corn into ethanol as beans are not exported that matters luciano said and that may be a boost for the crush business that you may be able to crush lower priced beans or maybe eventually lower priced corn more adm executive s timely stock sale saves him up to 2 million chief financial officer vikram luther told analysts that the price benefit to the company s crushing business will more than offset its problems on the mississippi while experiencing rising costs on inputs from fertilizer to chemicals to labor farmers have benefitted from high commodity prices corn traded at 6 86 a bushel on tuesday up 74 from the 3 94 price they received two years ago soybeans traded at 13 82 a bushel up from 9 19 two years ago however those farmers now need to find a place to put the corn and soybeans they re harvesting this fall a drought particularly in the upper ohio river valley has choked the tributaries that feed into the mississippi river an important transportation route for the agricultural economy including in iowa which has dozens of terminals on the river for companies that ship corn and soybeans from the midwest down the river to the gulf coast where about 60 of crop exports leave the country narrowed shipping channels have limited the mississippi s capacity and in some cases left water too low to be navigable according to the national weather service some areas around memphis were at levels lower than any point since the government began keeping track in 1954 to dredge some areas deeper officials closed parts of the river around hickman kentucky and stack island mississippi earlier this month causing a backlog more why did iowa adm wheat mill close former workers say manager buyouts led to wastewater crisis shipping costs have exploded moving a ton of grain south from terminals in st louis cost 105 85 a ton as of oct 11 about five times the cost a year earlier though the prices has fallen somewhat more recently exporters have not moved nearly as much grain as they usually do this time of year through last week shippers had transported 3 8 million metric tons of corn this year down 21 from this point last year according to a usda export inspection report shippers had handled 7 6 million metric tons of soybeans down 12 from last year luciano called the current environment unprecedented he said the company will not be able to export soybeans at the same rate as usual though he believes the company can hold corn longer you re going to see that in the first quarter of 2023 he said overall the company on tuesday reported an operating profit of 1 56 billion for the quarter ending sept 30 an increase of 56 from last year in part the company s positive report comes because of a downturn last year when hurricane ida s wreckage hurt adm s ability to export grains the company also reported that it benefitted from increased demand for crushed soybeans to make animal feed and oils like renewable diesel adm executives said they earned 90 100 per metric ton of crushed soybeans last quarter up from 50 60 during the same time last year the company s ethanol business did well though it didn t report its specific earnings adm pointed to an industry figure that showed manufacturers making 52 cents per gallon of ethanol sold up from 23 cents per gallon a year earlier more taiwan trade delegates visiting iowa pledge to buy nearly 3 billion of u s corn soybeans overall adm earned 1 83 per share last quarter beating the consensus analyst expectation of 1 43 a share according to factset luciana told analysts tuesday that he expects the company s full year financial report to show adm earned 7 per share for 2022 up from a previous estimate of 6 50 a share the business at this point in time is hitting in all cylinders luciano said luther the chief financial officer said the company s ethanol business will not perform as well in the last three months of the year as it did during the same period last year when they average manufacturer earned 1 45 per gallon adm s stock closed at 91 17 a share tuesday afternoon up 2 for the day the company s stock price has increased 35 since the start of the year tyler jett covers jobs and the economy for

the social media debate on our story about sweet betty s closing has been um interesting opinions have been wide ranging from people don t want to work to restaurant owners don t pay enough a sampling and my thoughts yet you have the government saying that unemployment is at all time low but retail or restaurant has lack of employees well if unemployment is low that means there are fewer people looking for work that means it is harder for existing businesses to fill open positions more people working leads to a lack of employees looking for work that was a small business they should have been able to run themselves with little help i know because i did the same exact thing they either weren t willing to do what it takes to be successful or they weren t willing to pay someone what they were worth simple as that clearly a comment by somebody who has never owned a food service business running such a business means multiple jobs overlap taking orders cooking food washing dishes cashing out customers and then somebody has got to keep the books it s not a one or two person business they are getting money to stay home and not work stop the free hand outs and watch how many people look for work extended unemployment benefits ended a long long time ago and the economic evidence is the payments had little impact when still active on people s willingness to work there are currently 900 people drawing unemployment in genesee county according to the most recent labor department data that is not a number that screams people are mooching off unemployment insurance payments 3 unemployment rate yet why are there almost a million on welfare time for workfare for the lazy actually in the u s there are nearly 60 million people drawing some sort of assistance and nearly all of them who are of working age and not on full disability have jobs then there are the people who blamed the owners love how they say it s the workers why not blame the owners for not paying more for the work or putting on the work outfit and working themselves simple supply demand and people have a life simple you wanna pay minimum wage you get minimum result crazy how they re closing and many other family owned restaurants aren t time to stop blaming staff and look to themselves as to where the problem lie whether it be their management or their product and some readers did jump to their defense such as susan macomber the owners family and friends worked there 99 of the time they were very hard working and very friendly and the food was delicious the owners also closed for holidays and closed at times to give their workers some time off because they couldn t get enough help and they paid their workers well more blaming the owners from somebody who almost certainly never owned a business unemployment is lowest it s been in 40 years only the failed businesses are having trouble finding employees the strong survive my friends it s survival of the fittest and you ain t fit look around you there are help wanted signs everywhere there was a time more than a decade ago when economists considered an unemployment rate of five percent to be full employment the idea is that at five percent being unemployed was transitory people moved quickly from one job to the next it was temporary and the normal economic shuffling of the deck as businesses changed strategy closed for various reasons or people quit jobs just to have the time to find a better job also covid itself has taken a lot of people out of the workforce more than one million people in the u s have died and nearly half of them had not yet reached full retirement age and presumably a lot of them were or could be in the workforce this is a very very tight job market probably the tightest any of us have seen in our lifetimes so let s talk about the free market this makes me so sad i love sweet betty s but i get it no one wants to work anymore or if they do it s completely on their terms and hours businesses everywhere are impacted by this here s the thing in a free market people can choose where they want to work they want to work on their terms i want to work on my terms you want to work on your terms we all want that opportunity i own my own business so i can work on my own terms when i worked for other people i worked hard and improved my skills and knowledge so i could advance and make more money that s working on my own terms when there isn t a tight labor market employers have the leverage to say work on my terms or leave perhaps with more nuance than that in a tight labor market the power imbalance shifts to the workers but that s how free markets work should work and we want them to work if we want a thriving economy and an improving standard of living for everybody one reader asks legitimate questions how much were you paying how many hours did you guarantee was it a regular schedule or did it vary from one week to the next were your cooks treated with respect ot treated like they were disposable people work when they feel like they are valued if that s not the case they go elsewhere there are lots of jobs out there make yours the one everyone brags about those are all things that will impact the ability of a business to hire good and qualified people however there is only so far a business can stretch on pay and hours and benefits running a business is not as easy as this reader makes it sound as i ll address later another take on the people don t want to work theme to all who wonder why they can t get help people dont want to work today they want top pay for doinb little there are plenty of jobs all over it seems to me that if you really want a job or need a job then take one of the jobs money is money let s just say there are in fact people who don t want to work there are undoubtedly some people who don t want to work period there is no wage that will entice them to leave their bedroom but this poster seems to assume that just because there are jobs there are jobs that the people without jobs want to take those jobs there are a number of reasons that people not working won t take a job you think they should take they re not qualified it doesn t fit their career path the hours won t let them take care of their children or go to school the job won t help them advance their career and could even derail it or maybe the job you think they should take isn t just offering enough of an incentive to give up fishing to go to work money is as the poster says is money and yes sometimes it takes more money to entice a person to take a job in order for a worker and an employer to find each other the worker needs to be qualified to work the job that s open even if a worker who has spent the past few years pushing a broom is willing to take a job as a line cook that doesn t mean he s qualified to be a line cook employers don t like to hire unqualified people because they don t have the track record to ensure they can do the job or will stick with it unqualified workers cost money and can be a disaster a more nuanced take that deserves a response restaurants took the worse beating when that covid crap shut n y down the ridiculous cost of living made it so minimum wage skyrocketed instead of putting caps on rent increases and utilities the more pay made prices go up more small business owners suffer because with their overhead and insurance payments they cannot afford to hire as much workers everyone suffers and people complain about higher costs in restaurants they have to raise prices just to make ends meet restaurants got a lot of financial help during and because of the pandemic restrictions all of that money being pumped into the economy is part of the cause of current inflationary pressures it s basic economics increase the money supply and prices generally go up restaurants by and large stayed alive with delivery and curbside pickup while maintaining lower overhead with the dining rooms closed when the economy kick started again companies were scrambling to fill open positions a lot of former workers found new jobs retired started their own businesses went back to school decided to become stay at home spouses picked up a job with uber door dash or instacart or otherwise left the workforce and not just because they became lazy but in the human condition there is always some of that too with a shortage of workers restaurants and other businesses were forced to raise wages that started before the current inflation cycle and is one of the multiple causes of today s inflation the sad thing is the wage gains workers first realized after the end of the pandemic have been wiped out by inflation adrian fitzgerald harris has an informed view low birth rates massive boomer retirements and no one solving the immigration problem have caused some of this the decline in the stock market might coax some people out of their early retirement the low birth rate isn t going to change so long as we remain a first world economy so that leaves immigration want more workers let more workers into the country we need about one million working immigrants flowing into this country asap that would spur the kind of economic growth we need to stave off a recession and stem inflation the economy would boom terry paine left an intelligent comment you can tell the people that have never had a business with employees before maybe these business geniuses could offer some advice on what an employee s pay should look like since we know 14 to 17 is not enough then the employer can make a decision whether they can themselves take that big of pay cut or if raising the cost to the customer will reduce sales enough that the business has to close anyway tough balance i can say that their standards for hiring wait staff is pretty high since i have enjoyed every one i ve ever had wait on me that standard might be just as important of more important than the food so to sum up there are two main camps here blame the employers and blame the employees how about if we not blame either running a small business is hard especially a food services business you have government regulations to worry about employees stealing a big problem in a mostly cash business taxes insurance lots of overhead employees who have their own lives and own issues that you need to balance supply issues competition to worry about customers who complain and so on you pretty much have to be insane to run your own business it s a hard life thank god there are people who do it though because small business owners are the true backbone of america and our communities they offer more charitable support to their communities give communities a sense of cohesion and pride and the owners are often more involved and more often make fine mentors for the young people they meet and employees have their own wishes and desires they have aspirations dreams ambitions they might have families to care for or passions they wish to pursue away from work they are often not business owners themselves because of these other constraints or priorities but humans evolved to acquire resources to make their lives more stable and better for the vast majority of us we want more money and better things so naturally we want better pay and if we can t get better pay then we look for other tradeoffs such as more time to go fishing or play in a rock and roll band in our rush to make everything political these days we miss how complex our economy really is and how something as seemingly straightforward as a restaurant closing is really about a world of competing economic forces sweet betty s closing is sad it shouldn t be fodder for scoring political points

ssuaphoto despite strong oil prices in the last year and a half most oil companies are still carrying substantial amounts of debt however there are some exceptions like gear energy ltd tsx gxe ca otcqx gengf after a record breaking q2 22 the canadian company managed to achieve a net cash position and implemented a monthly dividend payment and a share buyback procedure although the spread between western canada select wcs and west texas intermediate wti has widened in the past few months a normalization is expected to follow soon meanwhile the depreciation of the canadian dollar against the usd is also beneficial for the company currently the shares are trading at above 9 gross dividend yield and i estimate that the company is trading around 4x projected earnings which looks like an attractive opportunity company overview gear energy is an energy company engaged in exploration and production of primarily oil and some gas with assets located in canada average daily production has fluctuated around 6kboe with the number for 2022 expected to be around 5 below that heavy oil which is generally traded at a discount amount to roughly half of the production while the rest is light and medium oil ngls and natural gas gear energy s assets gear energy the shareholder structure is simple comprised of around 258 5m shares as of september 2022 with insider ownership at 8 of the current share count or 11 diluted which is quite substantial in addition to that most of the management s members have been buying shares in the open market in q3 22 which i find as a positive sign there are no outstanding warrants and around 17 1m of outstanding options 2022 performance so far in the first six months of 2022 gear energy achieved a production rate of 5 739boe day 7 yoy with around half of it being heavy oil the average realized price of the latter was cad 105 73 barrel 85 yoy or us 83 25 barrel when converted using the average cad usd exchange rate for the period of 1 27 for reference wti average price for the period was us 101 35 barrel as a result h1 22 revenue surpassed cad 103m 91 5 yoy the outstanding performance was partially dragged by cad 7 7m of realized and cad 2 8m of unrealized losses from hedging as the realized price surpassed the upper band of the hedging corridor funds from operations for the first 6 months came at cad 52 6m or cad 50 59 boe 140 9 yoy the q2 22 numbers alone were even more impressive as the ffo barrel amounted to cad 64 24 160 2 yoy which was a lot higher than the vast majority of competitors q2 22 performance relative to peers gear energy due to the strong cash flow generation the company managed to completely turn its balance sheet and go from a net debt position of cad15 8m to a net cash position of cad9 8m this allowed for the implementation of a monthly dividend of cad 0 01 share also in q2 22 a total of 3 6m shares were bought back and subsequently cancelled reducing the share count forward guidance although the full q3 22 results are yet to be released the september monthly update offers a glimpse of how the business has been developing given the falling oil prices and the increase in the wcs heavy oil differential from around us 13 to approx us 20 i expect the results to deteriorate compared to the second quarter however on the positive side the depreciation of the cad to the usd should partially offset this as some of the expenses of the company are paid in cad 2022 capex and production guidance gear energy until the end of 2022 the company plans an aggressive capital spending as capex guidance was raised from cad 55m to cad 64m according to the september monthly update for the first nine months cad36 5m were spent with about half of them in july sept this implies that capex in q4 22 should amount to cad 27 5m while this could be challenging in the current price environment and given the expected dividend payments gear energy has on top of its net cash position up to cad 42m available in credit facilities only 4 6m of it utilized as of the end of q2 22 at current wti and wct prices i estimate around cad 25 5m cfo during q4 22 which assuming cad 27 5m capex outflows and cad 7 7m of dividends will turn the net cash position of cad 7m as of 30 september to a net debt position of around cad 2 7m however this looks manageable since the large capex outflow will likely not persist and decrease in the following quarters share price and valuation since the beginning of the year gear energy has yielded a total return of 51 5 to its shareholders compared to the 21 6 ytd return of the united states oil etf uso data by ycharts so could the outperformance continue there are a few key factors that could turn things upside down which i will discuss in the risks section below but for now let s stick with the current price environment the increased capex in h2 22 according to management s guidance is expected to lift production in q1 23 to 6 4kboe day which i apply to the full year assuming average realized price of us 70 boe and cad usd exchange rate of 1 33 i get revenue of about cad 218m after increasing a bit the opex guidance of cad 23 5 boe to cad 25 boe and g a expenses to cad 4 boe i expect the company to generate around cad 120m of cfo which to be used for capex and shareholder return policies note that if the current dividend rate is maintained the annual outflow related to it will be around cad 31m in terms of earnings i project around cad 80m for 2023 which will put the 2023 p e at around 4 at us 60 boe scenario the estimated cfo and 2023 p e would be around cad 94m and 6 respectively for reference the median fwd p e of the industry is around 8 i see gear energy s projected figures as a good opportunity especially for income oriented investors risks wcs spread risk since july 22 the wcs heavy oil differential has widened significantly from the us 12 us 14 range in the last four quarters to around us 20 in q3 22 and towards the high us 20s area in october wcs spread to wti pete evans cbc bloomberg for a company like gear energy which has heavy oil as 50 of total production this is definitely a challenge one of the reasons for the widening of the wcs spread most likely is the release of oil from the u s s spr as refineries in the u s could get the product from these releases the demand for canadian oil declines fortunately the releases are expected to stop in october november of this year what s more there are signals that if oil prices fall the u s government could start refilling the spr which could also contribute for tightening of the spread another reason that has negative impact of the spread likely is the lower levels of the mississippi river which makes it more challenging for refineries to ship products as barges are one of the ways for delivery i see the shipment challenges more as a temporary factor as well which should normalize in 2023 political risk with all of its assets located in canada gear energy has an advantage in terms of political risk compared to peers in latam or africa for example while it s true that canada has ambitious climate goals which could negatively impact the oil industry the country is currently skeptical to the idea of windfall taxes on oil and gas companies something that couldn t be said about other developed and presumably market oriented countries such as those in the eu conclusion gear energy offers investors a monthly dividend which seems sustainable at current oil prices at current stock prices the annual gross dividend yield is above 9 on top of that the company has shown willingness to reduce the share count through buybacks when extra cash is available the current net cash position makes gear energy resilient to short term market turmoil and gives management operational headroom the widening of the wcs spread is definitely challenging but i expect it to normalize in 2023

updated october 25 2022 at 4 06 pm et new hampshire is a must win state for democrats in their campaign to keep control of the senate sen maggie hassan narrowly won her last race in 2016 by 1 017 votes recent polls show her ahead in the contest against gop nominee don bolduc a retired army brigadier general yet hassan and her allies expect a tight race in the final two weeks hassan who also served as governor before becoming a senator in 2017 expects the contest to go down to the wire in this purple state where the current governor is a republican but its congressional delegation is comprised of democrats many voters across the political spectrum say rising costs on home heating groceries gas and housing are a top issue but access to abortion is animating the democratic base and a sizable chunk of independents over 40 of the state s electorate who warn that flipping a blue seat red in the midterms could lead to a republican controlled senate that decides to take up legislation to institute a federal abortion ban voters will be able to hear from the candidates this week in a debate hosted by local news outlets including new hampshire public radio republicans are linking hassan to biden bolduc is campaigning as an outsider arguing if he s sent to washington he s not going to be a career politician at a rally with supporters recently in rochester he homed in on a message that framed the race as a fight against president biden as much as it is against hassan he spoke about what he s heard from small businesses still recovering from the pandemic saying they are making their way back and then boom down comes the hammer from the biden hassan agenda which skyrockets inflation bolduc won the gop primary in september echoing former president donald trump s false claims that the 2020 election was rigged the day after that primary win he reversed himselfand said biden won but since then he has made conflicting public comments trying to pivot away from statements he made in a podcast associated with qanon conspiracies as reported by the new york times bolduc told reporters in rochester n h i do not believe the election was stolen he added about the reversal the simple thing is i changed my mind and i have the freedom to do that bolduc s recent disavowals of his previous hardline stances like proposing major cuts to social security and medicare aren t keeping more mainstream gop figures from backing him former secretary of state mike pompeo a possible 2024 presidential candidate endorsed bolduc last week nikki haley former u n ambassador and another potential candidate for the gop nomination in 2024 joined bolduc for a rally in rochester her second time on the campaign trail for him haley also tied hassan to biden on issues like the cost of home heating and the withdrawal of u s forces from afghanistan which haley blasted as a failure when you look at our foreign policy and the fact that america is weak you can thank maggie hassan haley said on voters minds abortion and inflation another issue that bolduc has shifted on is abortion he s said he would always default for a system that protects lives from beginning to end but on the campaign trail he emphasizes that the issue should be left to the states to decide asked if that means he d vote no on a federal abortion ban bolduc grew frustrated at the topic telling npr yes i ve said that i don t know how many times i need to say it i can put together a skit for you bolduc spoke briefly with npr after a campaign event but declined multiple requests for a longer interview meanwhile hassan is quick to point out bolduc s earlier statements on abortion saying this is one area that earns him the label of extreme she said her supporters believe the issue of abortion is no less important than inflation you know as i started to talk with women about inflation they all changed the subject to abortion she added for some people it is you know a concern about whether they re gonna be able to pay rent and put food on the table but they also said to me but if my fundamental rights are gone that s much harder to get back women are on both sides of the abortion issue and its ultimate impact on the november election barbara dunnington a bolduc supporter said the economy is a bigger factor for her than abortion i think obviously some people are going to put that at the top of their list but if you can t pay your bills if you can t buy food if you can t hang on to a job with the stock market going up and down and we re going into a recession as far as i m concerned abortion is not that crucial but kimberly valcin a first time new hampshire voter and democrat who greeted hassan at a campaign stop in hanover told npr top of mind issues for me are things like women s rights hassan campaigns on record bolduc zeroes in on inflation woes deirdre walsh npr npr democratic sen maggie hassan spoke to jarrett berke owner of lou s restaurant in hanover n h in her pitch to voters and in an interview with npr hassan pointed to her accomplishments and the fact many bills she passed were bipartisan i have a record delivering on a number of issues doing it across party lines and doing it the way granite staters expect me to she spoke about the infrastructure bill delivering money to road and rail projects as well as legislation boosting american manufacturing of semi conductors that will help small businesses in the state and resolve supply chain issues that many complain are still hurting their bottom lines hassan also touted the bill democrats passed without gop support that includes tax cuts for energy efficient improvements and lowers prescription drug prices hassan made a point to put some distance between herself and biden on the economy saying the administration was too slow to recognize the long term reality of inflation and they took too long to react to it she noted she was among those pressing the white house to tap additional oil from the strategic petroleum reserve a step announced last week and with the election just two weeks away first lady jill biden is planning to head to new hampshire to campaign for hassan according to hassan s campaign spokesman bolduc devoted much of his time at campaign stops arguing that hassan is out of touch with the reality of rising costs at a steel company in greenland bolduc lumped hassan in with career politicians and repeatedly described his opponent s senate term using one word deirdre walsh npr npr gop candidate don bolduc campaigns with former u n ambassador nikki haley last week in rochester n h she s failed six years of failure fail fail fail fail fail he said he d turn things around i ll go to washington d c to be your united states senator and work on the real problems that americans and granite staters are having right now he said he wanted to reverse some of the things that they have done that have created all this inflation bolduc also criticized democrats record on border security crime and education policies he promised that if elected he would work with members of congress across party lines and said that the first call he would make as senator would be to the state s other democratic senator jeanne shaheen to try to address economic issues and secure the border one steel company employee shelley hanson identified herself as a democrat but said she s still deciding which candidate to support she voted for biden in 2020 but is not a fan of the system in washington i think it needs to change course i think the whole thing needs to be shaken up she said both candidates and their allies are flooding the airwaves fighting for the state s independent voters in recent days the senate leadership fund the super pac with ties to senate minority leader mitch mcconnell withdrew resources it had earmarked for bolduc in the final stretch of the campaign a signal they believe hassan is positioned to prevail still bolduc s spokeswoman kate constantini said in a statement that the republican nominee has defied the naysayers from the beginning and that s the same approach he is going to take through the finish line to victory hassan warns that bolduc is extreme on a range of issues and says the resources already spent in the state can conceal an extremist from voters one hassan supporter jenn alford teaster says one thing is constant in the purple state i don t think there will ever be a race in the history of new hampshire that will never not be close republicans need to net just one seat to retake the

saudi blasts release of oil reserves to manipulate markets saudi arabia s minister of energy abdulaziz bin salman speaks during a press conference after the 45th joint ministerial monitoring committee and the 33rd opec and non opec ministerial meeting in vienna austria on october 5 2022 the opec oil cartel meets for the first time face to face since covid curbs were introduced in 2020 riyadh saudi arabia saudi arabia s energy minister on tuesday blasted the release of emergency oil stocks as an attempt to manipulate markets the latest apparent salvo in a spat with washington over oil production people are depleting their emergency stocks had depleted it used it as a mechanism to manipulate markets while its profound purpose was to mitigate shortage of supply prince abdulaziz bin salman told an investor conference in the saudi capital however it is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come prince abdulaziz did not single out the united states in his comments about emergency stocks but last week us president joe biden announced he was putting the final 15 million barrels on the market from a record release of us strategic reserves that tranche was to complete a 180 million barrel release authorised in the spring in response to price hikes linked to russia s invasion of ukraine it also came on the heels of a decision by the opec oil cartel which riyadh co leads with moscow to cut oil production by two million barrels a day from november the cartel s decision weeks ahead of us congressional elections has drawn intense criticism from the white house which has said it amounted to aligning with russia in the ukraine war prince abdulaziz pushed back against that assessment on tuesday i keep listening are you with us or against us is there any room for we are for saudi arabia and for the people of saudi arabia he said to applause asked about getting the decades old partnership between riyadh and washington back on track he said i think we as saudi arabia decided to be the maturer guys and let the dice fall in washington state department spokesman ned price said he would not respond directly to the prince but that the release from the strategic reserve was part of biden s effort to meet demand we re going to do everything we can to see to it that supply is adequate for demand price told reporters also speaking at the riyadh conference saudi investment minister khalid al falih described the dust up with the united states as unwarranted and temporary if you look at the relationship with the people side the corporate side the education system you look at our institutions working together we are very close and we will get over this recent spat that i think was unwarranted he said jpmorgan chief executive jamie dimon also said he was optimistic that bilateral ties would eventually improve saudi arabia and the us have been allies for the last 75 years they ll work it through he said these countries will remain allies going forward davos in the desert hundreds of ceos and finance moguls are in riyadh for the three day future investment initiative fii a davos style investment conference that analysts say will highlight saudi arabia s geopolitical muscle despite strained ties with washington the fii often referred to as davos in the desert was launched in 2017 as an economic coming out party for the world s largest crude exporter which is trying to diversify away from oil under crown prince mohammed bin salman the 37 year old who is first in line to the throne takes a very hands on approach to projects associated with his vision 2030 reform agenda said kristin diwan of the arab gulf states institute in washington ultimately those attending will know that they will need his approval or those of his confidants to work in the kingdom she said up to 400 american ceos are expected to participate in the conference though unlike in previous years there is no representation from the us government the event s organiser told afp last week that american officials had not been invited saudi arabia needs to attract american investment technology and popular interest to succeed diwan said it still remains to be seen if this broader engagement can be maintained if the political mood in the united states turns hostile toward saudi arabia
the social media debate on our story about sweet betty s closing has been um interesting opinions have been wide ranging from people don t want to work to restaurant owners don t pay enough a sampling and my thoughts yet you have the government saying that unemployment is at all time low but retail or restaurant has lack of employees well if unemployment is low that means there are fewer people looking for work that means it is harder for existing businesses to fill open positions more people working leads to a lack of employees looking for work that was a small business they should have been able to run themselves with little help i know because i did the same exact thing they either weren t willing to do what it takes to be successful or they weren t willing to pay someone what they were worth simple as that clearly a comment by somebody who has never owned a food service business running such a business means multiple jobs overlap taking orders cooking food washing dishes cashing out customers and then somebody has got to keep the books it s not a one or two person business they are getting money to stay home and not work stop the free hand outs and watch how many people look for work extended unemployment benefits ended a long long time ago and the economic evidence is the payments had little impact when still active on people s willingness to work there are currently 900 people drawing unemployment in genesee county according to the most recent labor department data that is not a number that screams people are mooching off unemployment insurance payments 3 unemployment rate yet why are there almost a million on welfare time for workfare for the lazy actually in the u s there are nearly 60 million people drawing some sort of assistance and nearly all of them who are of working age and not on full disability have jobs then there are the people who blamed the owners love how they say it s the workers why not blame the owners for not paying more for the work or putting on the work outfit and working themselves simple supply demand and people have a life simple you wanna pay minimum wage you get minimum result crazy how they re closing and many other family owned restaurants aren t time to stop blaming staff and look to themselves as to where the problem lie whether it be their management or their product and some readers did jump to their defense such as susan macomber the owners family and friends worked there 99 of the time they were very hard working and very friendly and the food was delicious the owners also closed for holidays and closed at times to give their workers some time off because they couldn t get enough help and they paid their workers well more blaming the owners from somebody who almost certainly never owned a business unemployment is lowest it s been in 40 years only the failed businesses are having trouble finding employees the strong survive my friends it s survival of the fittest and you ain t fit look around you there are help wanted signs everywhere there was a time more than a decade ago when economists considered an unemployment rate of five percent to be full employment the idea is that at five percent being unemployed was transitory people moved quickly from one job to the next it was temporary and the normal economic shuffling of the deck as businesses changed strategy closed for various reasons or people quit jobs just to have the time to find a better job also covid itself has taken a lot of people out of the workforce more than one million people in the u s have died and nearly half of them had not yet reached full retirement age and presumably a lot of them were or could be in the workforce this is a very very tight job market probably the tightest any of us have seen in our lifetimes so let s talk about the free market this makes me so sad i love sweet betty s but i get it no one wants to work anymore or if they do it s completely on their terms and hours businesses everywhere are impacted by this here s the thing in a free market people can choose where they want to work they want to work on their terms i want to work on my terms you want to work on your terms we all want that opportunity i own my own business so i can work on my own terms when i worked for other people i worked hard and improved my skills and knowledge so i could advance and make more money that s working on my own terms when there isn t a tight labor market employers have the leverage to say work on my terms or leave perhaps with more nuance than that in a tight labor market the power imbalance shifts to the workers but that s how free markets work should work and we want them to work if we want a thriving economy and an improving standard of living for everybody one reader asks legitimate questions how much were you paying how many hours did you guarantee was it a regular schedule or did it vary from one week to the next were your cooks treated with respect ot treated like they were disposable people work when they feel like they are valued if that s not the case they go elsewhere there are lots of jobs out there make yours the one everyone brags about those are all things that will impact the ability of a business to hire good and qualified people however there is only so far a business can stretch on pay and hours and benefits running a business is not as easy as this reader makes it sound as i ll address later another take on the people don t want to work theme to all who wonder why they can t get help people dont want to work today they want top pay for doinb little there are plenty of jobs all over it seems to me that if you really want a job or need a job then take one of the jobs money is money let s just say there are in fact people who don t want to work there are undoubtedly some people who don t want to work period there is no wage that will entice them to leave their bedroom but this poster seems to assume that just because there are jobs there are jobs that the people without jobs want to take those jobs there are a number of reasons that people not working won t take a job you think they should take they re not qualified it doesn t fit their career path the hours won t let them take care of their children or go to school the job won t help them advance their career and could even derail it or maybe the job you think they should take isn t just offering enough of an incentive to give up fishing to go to work money is as the poster says is money and yes sometimes it takes more money to entice a person to take a job in order for a worker and an employer to find each other the worker needs to be qualified to work the job that s open even if a worker who has spent the past few years pushing a broom is willing to take a job as a line cook that doesn t mean he s qualified to be a line cook employers don t like to hire unqualified people because they don t have the track record to ensure they can do the job or will stick with it unqualified workers cost money and can be a disaster a more nuanced take that deserves a response restaurants took the worse beating when that covid crap shut n y down the ridiculous cost of living made it so minimum wage skyrocketed instead of putting caps on rent increases and utilities the more pay made prices go up more small business owners suffer because with their overhead and insurance payments they cannot afford to hire as much workers everyone suffers and people complain about higher costs in restaurants they have to raise prices just to make ends meet restaurants got a lot of financial help during and because of the pandemic restrictions all of that money being pumped into the economy is part of the cause of current inflationary pressures it s basic economics increase the money supply and prices generally go up restaurants by and large stayed alive with delivery and curbside pickup while maintaining lower overhead with the dining rooms closed when the economy kick started again companies were scrambling to fill open positions a lot of former workers found new jobs retired started their own businesses went back to school decided to become stay at home spouses picked up a job with uber door dash or instacart or otherwise left the workforce and not just because they became lazy but in the human condition there is always some of that too with a shortage of workers restaurants and other businesses were forced to raise wages that started before the current inflation cycle and is one of the multiple causes of today s inflation the sad thing is the wage gains workers first realized after the end of the pandemic have been wiped out by inflation adrian fitzgerald harris has an informed view low birth rates massive boomer retirements and no one solving the immigration problem have caused some of this the decline in the stock market might coax some people out of their early retirement the low birth rate isn t going to change so long as we remain a first world economy so that leaves immigration want more workers let more workers into the country we need about one million working immigrants flowing into this country asap that would spur the kind of economic growth we need to stave off a recession and stem inflation the economy would boom terry paine left an intelligent comment you can tell the people that have never had a business with employees before maybe these business geniuses could offer some advice on what an employee s pay should look like since we know 14 to 17 is not enough then the employer can make a decision whether they can themselves take that big of pay cut or if raising the cost to the customer will reduce sales enough that the business has to close anyway tough balance i can say that their standards for hiring wait staff is pretty high since i have enjoyed every one i ve ever had wait on me that standard might be just as important of more important than the food so to sum up there are two main camps here blame the employers and blame the employees how about if we not blame either running a small business is hard especially a food services business you have government regulations to worry about employees stealing a big problem in a mostly cash business taxes insurance lots of overhead employees who have their own lives and own issues that you need to balance supply issues competition to worry about customers who complain and so on you pretty much have to be insane to run your own business it s a hard life thank god there are people who do it though because small business owners are the true backbone of america and our communities they offer more charitable support to their communities give communities a sense of cohesion and pride and the owners are often more involved and more often make fine mentors for the young people they meet and employees have their own wishes and desires they have aspirations dreams ambitions they might have families to care for or passions they wish to pursue away from work they are often not business owners themselves because of these other constraints or priorities but humans evolved to acquire resources to make their lives more stable and better for the vast majority of us we want more money and better things so naturally we want better pay and if we can t get better pay then we look for other tradeoffs such as more time to go fishing or play in a rock and roll band in our rush to make everything political these days we miss how complex our economy really is and how something as seemingly straightforward as a restaurant closing is really about a world of competing economic forces sweet betty s closing is sad it shouldn t be fodder for scoring political points
the focus should be on helping low and middle income nations use clean energy to power their growth said debra roberts co chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change s working group ii climate change experts were by turns optimistic and pessimistic at the harvard radcliffe institute on friday even as the cost of renewable energy plummets they said the slow pace of progress threatens irreversible damage to the planet existing commitments from international leaders would reduce 2010 emissions 7 5 percent by 2030 dramatically short of the 55 percent needed to limit warming to 1 5 degrees celsius by 2100 a level that scientists believe would head off climate change s most catastrophic effects the number is also well short of the 30 percent reduction that would keep warming at 2 degrees above preindustrial levels noted lis mullin bernhardt deputy head of the united nations environment program and one of the speakers at the institute s daylong mike and nina patterson science symposium we know we have to bend that curve extremely extremely fast bernhardt said we cannot give up on that quest as daunting as it obviously is at the moment because existing commitments will result in warming of 2 7 degrees by the end of the century bernhardt and other panelists pointed out that the effects of climate change are multiplying even with today s 1 1 degree warming stronger hurricanes more intense wildfires and droughts and longer and hotter heat waves even so she described herself as climate optimistic such an attitude is necessary if the u n and other organizations are to convince world leaders to ramp up their efforts against climate change she said if we don t believe in a better future for ourselves and our children how are we going to get countries to go toward that vision jim stock harvard s vice provost for climate and sustainability said that u s climate and energy policy has arrived at a fascinating moment prices for solar and wind energy have fallen to the point where the technologies are now viable options which wasn t true 15 years ago with hundreds of billions of dollars available from the inflation reduction act stock said that u s leaders should move to build out the clean energy grid and expand the nation s electric vehicle fleet they should also take steps to ensure that the transition doesn t leave disadvantaged communities behind he said if we don t believe in a better future for ourselves and our children how are we going to get countries to go toward that vision lis mullin bernhardt deputy head of the united nations environment program klaus lackner director of the center for negative climate emissions at arizona state university would like to see a renewables like technological leap in carbon removal efforts we have the ability to remove carbon and sequester it underground but the technology is too expensive to be deployed at scale and scale is essential he said carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for somewhere between 50 000 and 100 000 years meaning that even if emissions dropped to zero tomorrow the planet would absorb the effects of climate change for decades he estimated that the world will need to remove upward of 40 gigatons of carbon annually we really should start thinking of co 2 as a waste management problem lackner said these technologies are a generation behind because nobody wanted them as the summer s heat waves and historic flooding in pakistan have demonstrated the climate burden falls heavily on poorer people in places that have had little to do with the industrialization driving the crisis debra roberts co chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change working group ii said that the world s climate change calculus has to include the continued development of low and middle income nations the focus should be on helping these countries use clean energy to power their growth she said moving forward experts and government officials should heed lessons of the covid crisis in shaping climate policy according to james marshall shepherd director of the atmospheric sciences program at the university of georgia shepherd said the pandemic holds both positive and negative lessons on one hand as with climate both misinformation and inequality have been part of the covid narrative at the same time nations have come together over the past three years to meet a global challenge operation warp speed was an effort to rapidly develop for the sake of us all vaccines and that was a good thing shepherd said we marshalled all of our resources to that problem and i have argued for years that the climate crisis is an international and a national emergency that warrants the scale of a manhattan project of an apollo project of a panama canal project an operation warp speed

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net
