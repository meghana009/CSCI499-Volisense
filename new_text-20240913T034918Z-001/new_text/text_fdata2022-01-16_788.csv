new york jan 16 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc has updated its guidance on masks for the general public saying that people can choose to wear n95 and kn95 masks because they offer the best protection against covid 19 however the agency stopped short of saying that people should opt for certain masks instead of others noting that the cdc continues to recommend that you wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently previously the us health agency did not recommend that the general population wear n95 masks or kn95s fearing that a run on those higher quality masks would impact the supply in healthcare settings the cdc now says shortages are no longer a concern according to an nbc news report when worn consistently and properly the agency wrote on its website n95 respirators approved by the national institute for occupational safety and health provide the highest level of protection from particles including the virus that causes covid 19 americans will be able to request free rapid coronavirus tests from the federal government beginning on wednesday but the tests will take seven to 12 days to arrive senior joe biden administration officials have said the administration s website to process the requests covidtests gov was up and running on friday the latest sign of its efforts to ramp up access to testing since the fast spreading omicron variant sent coronavirus case counts soaring xinhua news agency reported but the delay in accepting orders and the lag in shipping mean that people are unlikely to receive the free tests until the end of january at the earliest reported the new york times in some parts of the country that may be after the peak of the current surge of cases us president joe biden said in december 2021 that his administration would purchase 500 million rapid at home coronavirus tests and distribute them to americans free of charge on thursday he announced plans to buy an additional 500 million tests bringing the total to one billion the nightmare cruises of spring 2020 are back as omicron sends passenger case rates soaring yet the cdc is poised to loosen the industry s covid 19 leash saying cruise lines are now positioned to police themselves reported major us news portal politico on saturday despite a 30 fold increase in on board covid 19 cases with cruise ships being turned away at ports and passengers getting sick the cdc plans to lift all of its covid 19 restrictions on the cruise industry just two weeks ago the agency was recommending against cruising even for vaccinated passengers and the agency s official guidance states even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading covid 19 variants it s the latest in a series of mixed messages from the cdc not only about how safe it is to cruise but on a host of other covid 19 restrictions as the agency copes with omicron s onslaught said the report it s also a stark example of the thorny decisions the biden administration and other officials must navigate almost two years into the pandemic as it tries to balance public health and a still fragile economy the past few weeks have been hellacious delta air lines ceo ed bastian told a thursday conference call with stock analysts and reporters adding that 8 000 of his employees have contracted covid 19 in the last four weeks alone about 10 per cent of the carrier s workforce a toll that contributed to more than 2 200 cancelled delta flights since december 24 although a precise count of the number of employees who are out sick or quarantining is hard to come by about 5 million americans could be isolating due to covid 19 at the peak of omicron andrew hunter senior us economist at capital economics was quoted as saying in a cbs news report that could reflect about 2 per cent of the nation s workforce forced to stay home due to illness he added stew leonard jr chief executive of supermarket chain stew leonard s said that about 8 per cent of his staff was out sick or quarantining last week that affects what shoppers find on store shelves that s the highest we ve ever had he was quoted as saying what we are doing is the same as every other business you have to limit your product line a record spike in covid 19 cases due to the omicron variant is causing a nationwide worker sickout disrupting businesses ranging from grocery stores to airlines reported the national broadcaster noting that the latest worker shortages are compounding earlier pandemic problems including supply chain disruptions and shortage of some services the pandemic could start moving into an endemic phase in 2022 though countries will need to stay vigilant as the omicron variant spreads according to moderna inc co founder noubar afeyan 2022 may be the year that the pandemic enters an endemic phase but it really depends on what happens and the decisions that are made across the world afeyan told bloomberg on friday although the omicron variant is highly transmissible on the other hand it s having a lesser effect in terms of seriousness of disease he said though adding that for now the world still remains in the pandemic s grasp while some countries slowly begin to consider treating covid 19 as an endemic disease like the flu world health organisation officials have said it s too early to make that call as cases surge latest updates on coronavirus covid 19

a trader works on the floor of the new york stock exchange on friday in new york afp photo london stock markets retreated on friday as us retail sales and bank earnings disappointed and investors worried the fed may hike interest rates aggressively a pledge by fed chief jerome powell earlier this week to rein in surging prices while also nurturing recovery in the world s top economy provided a much needed lift to investor sentiment and helped propel a rally across equities data showing us inflation appeared to be stabilising added to the positivity and tempered fears about the end of the ultra loose monetary policies which have been key to a near two year markets rally and global economic rebound but the mood darkened on thursday after the officials comments lael brainard in her senate hearing to become powell s deputy said rates could rise as early as march a move supported by fed bank of philadelphia chief patrick harker who also raised the possibility of another three before the end of the year the heads of the chicago and st louis feds saw a similar number of hikes while raphael bostic of atlanta was open to a march move minutes from the bank s december policy meeting showed officials were keen to act quickly to tame prices and speed up the taper of its massive bond buying programme then begin offloading its treasury holdings measures that have been used to keep rates at all time lows the possibility of four rate hikes this year is growing said oanda senior market analyst edward moya with four voters now expecting to hike in march financial markets can t rule out it is possible that they could deliver five rate hikes this year the comments helped lead to steep losses across wall street on thursday with the nasdaq dropping more than 2 per cent as tech firms are more susceptible to higher borrowing costs the selling continued on friday in asia and europe where official data showed germany s economy grew modestly last year and likely shrank in the final months wall street fell further on friday with a lacklustre set of bank earnings failing to help sentiment shares in jpmorgan chase were 5 3 per cent lower after the bank reported a 14 per cent drop in fourth quarter profits amid higher costs for employee compensation sentiment was also hit by data showing retail sales dropped 1 9 per cent month on month in december the key takeaway from the report is that total retail sales which are not adjusted for inflation contracted at their fastest pace since last february in the face of broadly higher prices said patrick o hare at briefing com this suggests that inflation is weighing down consumer spending he added meanwhile oil prices hit the highest levels for more than two months crude oil prices have continued to look resilient with concerns about geopolitical risk and a russian incursion into ukraine raising the stakes as well as keeping a floor under prices said michael hewson at cmc markets with some opec members already struggling to lift production to meet the new output targets concern over supply shortfalls has been growing he added
ts ilhqot in nation tribal chair joe alphonse is demanding a seat at the canada u s bilateral negotiations to address alaskan fishers intercepting salmon headed for b c rivers a b c first nation is calling on the canadian government to take action over reports alaskan fishers are intercepting b c bound salmon in a press release friday the ts ilhqot in nation said it was outraged over a recent report detailing alaskan catches of several salmon species before they returned to b c rivers to spawn it s calling on canada to create an independent review into the pacific salmon treaty and the failure by the department of fisheries and oceans to meaningfully represent first nation interests at the international table this is outrageous said tribal chair joe alphonse in a written statement our nation has made huge sacrifices to conserve salmon over the years the call comes a day after the release of a report commissioned by watershed watch salmon society and skeenawild conservation trust that says alaskan fishers caught 800 000 sockeye in 2021 along the u s canada border of those over half a million intercepted salmon were returning home to b c s skeena and nass rivers on the skeena river alone 486 000 sockeye heading home through alaska are thought to have been intercepted that represents at least 6 million for local fishers it would have been huge we re talking about a couple hundred gillnetters up there that have had zero income said greg taylor one of the report s authors and a longtime consultant with commercial and first nations fisheries these people are not wealthy people these are people sitting on the beach in the first nations communities in the north 6 million dollars of cash money we re talking the difference between having a reasonable life and a reasonable income and having nothing an untold number of other salmon are thought to have been intercepted on their way south to the fraser river and down the canadian and u s west coast b c salmon populations have plummeted to record lows in recent years in response the federal government closed 60 per cent of b c s commercial salmon harvest in june 2021 and announced a fishing licence buy back program under its 647 million pacific salmon strategy initiative alphonse said the ts ilhqot in nation has implemented closures and denied its citizens their aboriginal right to fish while hundreds of thousands of b c bound salmon are harvested by commercial fisheries in u s waters tŝilhqot in families have gone hungry and have been denied their aboriginal right to fish added a spokesperson for the nation this isn t the first time alaskan fishers are alleged to have intercepted salmon on their way to b c spawning grounds the ts ilhqot in nation says that in 2019 alaskan fishers caught 45 000 of its salmon in a year only 158 000 returned that represents 20 per cent of the entire run a spokesperson for the nation said the repeated over harvesting in alaskan waters is threatening the future existence of these stocks alphonse called for an immediate review over how the pacific salmon treaty is structured so first nations have a bigger role at the international negotiations we demand our own seat at the pacific salmon commission to represent our chilko fishery directly he said since 1985 the canada u s pacific salmon treaty has been in place to settle international imbalances in fisheries prevent overfishing and ensure both countries receive equal benefits from healthy salmon populations over the last three decades new agreements have been reached every 10 years but the last agreement was signed in 2019 and the pacific salmon treaty isn t up for renewal until 2028 in an email to glacier media the press secretary for the minister of fisheries oceans and the canadian coast guard said dfo officials are aware of the report and are reviewing it we know how important it is to protect and restore the pacific salmon population said dfo press secretary claire teichman a spokesperson for the b c ministry of agriculture food and fisheries said the ministry would review the report with their federal colleagues and continue to work with other governments to reduce bycatch in the alaskan salmon halibut and trawl fisheries part of the problem comes down to failed attempts at conservation the federal government s long term mismanagement of west coast salmon fisheries and poor forestry practices have both played a big role preventing the next generation of fish to spawn canada s pacific salmon populations have dropped to such low levels that those returning from alaskan waters are becoming more important every year at the same time climate change is making ocean and river water hotter and that creates a huge amount of variability in how many salmon survive when warm plumes of ocean water such as the blob bulge into the northern pacific salmon migrating back to their home rivers tend to follow the cold water as a result they often return from a more northwesterly direction hitting the rugged alaskan coast and bumping down toward canadian waters that is until a net gets in the way taylor says warming oceans are also leading salmon to arrive later so that the bilateral treaty provides fewer protections for canadian bound fish once they make landfall on the alaskan coast there are gaps in regulation between canada and u s fishers as well whereas in b c fishers are issued licences to harvest specific species in alaska broad licences mean fishers aren t required to report their bycatch of non target species and much of what gets thrown back lands in the water dead the impacts cascade across b c s natural environment many of the rivers where salmon go to spawn in b c s north rely on salmon as the base of the entire food chain they feed bears and birds and when they die the carcasses litter the forest and fill the rivers with nutrients at sea coho salmon are the main source of food for southern resident killer whales but according to kurt beardslee of the wild fish conservancy only three per cent of the chinook fished in southeast alaska are from alaskan rivers the other 97 per cent comes from b c washington and oregon where if they could make the journey they would help keep the endangered species alive according to beardslee the only way to solve the transboundary dispute is to tie fishing licences to the rivers where they spawn that way coastal communities will have more incentive to protect the river ecosystems when those coastal communities are doing everything we can to protect the habitats and the destiny of their fish populations is happening offshore or in another country it doesn t set up a very good scenario he said up and down the coast measures like this are going to need to be implemented in 2020 the washington based organization sued the national marine fisheries service for violations of the endangered species act in september a judge ruled the u s agency had breached the act when it authorized the commercial salmon harvest in southeast alaska the national oceanic and atmospheric administration breaches stemmed from the approval of massive new hatchery programs backed by federal dollars and relying on a poorly developed plan to ensure the health of future salmon stocks in southeast alaska the case is still winding through the u s court system as for alphonse and the ts ilhqot in nation ensuring the survival of their fish cuts to the heart of their rights and title all options including taking the matter to court he said are on the table we cannot wait to fix this it has too many consequences for indigenous peoples who rely on salmon for sustenance our economy and our ability to transmit our culture to future generations said the tribal chair
london last month i identified what i saw as the big issues of 2022 noting that i could not recall a time when there were so many sources of uncertainty both known and unknown the main issue was inflation and now that we are a few weeks into 2022 financial markets appear to be worrying about the same developments that concerned me in fact the problems we face are becoming more straightforward depressingly so to understand today s financial market behaviour we can turn to the five day rule a heuristic i first encountered during my time in finance when eager analysts would grab hold of anything they thought might help them understand the complicated world of markets the rule holds that if major us stock market indices rise during the first five trading days of the new calendar year markets will perform handsomely for the year overall according to an old stock market almanac this had been the case 85 per cent of the time since the 1950s moreover in cases when markets were down over the first five trading days the market went on to have a net negative year 50 per cent of the time given that markets were down over the first five days of this month should we worry about 2022 or can we take comfort in the fact that historically stock markets have tended to rise most years given that us markets had a strong year in 2021 after many previous years of growth had already left market valuations rather high my instinct is to follow the five day rule even though there is no theoretical or intellectual reason why it need apply that said it remains to be seen whether markets are more concerned about inflation or about policymakers efforts to control it or about something else entirely a survey of relative sectoral performance shows that cyclical stocks have been outperforming previously high flying tech stocks which is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that the omicron variant is less virulent than its predecessors if so many countries could soon start thinking of covid 19 as an endemic rather than a pandemic threat but in that case economic policymakers would need to consider whether many of their emergency monetary and fiscal policies are still necessary a prospect i raised last month for quite some time central banks were keeping policy rates low significantly negative in real terms even when the underlying economies were growing at rates above their potential but now they finally seem to be rethinking their positions owing to the persistence of inflation in this regard one interesting feature of financial market pricing so far this year is that both market based measures and ongoing longer term surveys indicate that inflation expectations have remained stable the sharp rise in market interest rates has led to only a modest rise in real interest rates which are still far below the levels that would be considered normal in historical terms one possibility then is that markets have woken up to the mounting evidence that both monetary and fiscal policy will be tightened in 2022 relative to 2021 regardless of whether inflation continues to rise to be fully consistent one would expect a period of weakening equity markets to coincide with flattening yield curves when short term bond yields are similar to or higher than longer term ones there have been some signs of this in the bond markets but for now it remains an interesting trend to watch do these issues and the five day rule mean that we are guaranteed to see a down year for equities in 2022 it is too early to say because much will depend on whether stocks continue to fall further if at all and whether the united states and other major economies can sustain their performance in addition to new evidence of ongoing inflation and policymakers stated intentions the key metrics that i will be watching are high frequency indicators such as south korean monthly trade data purchasing managers indices and other predictive business surveys equally important and underlying it all will be evidence of productivity performance which ultimately is the key to sustaining persistently strong equity markets after years of weakness could productivity growth finally be accelerating creating the conditions for a new roaring twenties if so the economic recovery could continue without the kind of inflationary pressures we have seen in the past year but if not we may find ourselves dwelling on these same issues again in january 2023 jim o neill a former chairman of goldman sachs asset management and a former uk treasury minister is a member of the pan european commission on health and sustainable development copyright project syndicate 2022 www project syndicate org
brewdog boss james watt who dropped stuffed pets on london in fat cat stunt reveals i m wooing city titans for float to take on big brewers craft brewer has appointed law firm to target stock market float it is famous for guerilla marketing campaigns including taxidermy cat bombs annual sales growth has averaged 57 over the past decade but pandemic hit brewdog hard and it has faced attacks on its company culture james watt once hurled stuffed cats from a helicopter over the city of london in a publicity stunt designed to lampoon fat cat corporate greed now he s preparing a charm offensive with the same pinstriped ranks of financiers as his craft beer business brewdog heads towards a float on the stock market the blockbuster listing rumoured to be worth more than 2billion is one of the most hotly anticipated ipos among city investors keen to buy into a premium brand following the successful float of shoe brand dr martens the brewer famous for its guerrilla marketing campaigns has appointed high powered lawyers at freshfields to help chart a course towards the stock exchange bolstering a reshaped top team that includes finance chief niall mccallum and former asda boss allan leighton who joined as its chairman and watt s mentor four months ago watt chief executive of the firm says a float will give longer term liquidity to its existing individual investors who currently have a single day each march to trade shares we re pretty much working towards ipo for them as much as anyone else they are the heart and soul of the business he says speaking over zoom from his office at brewdog s production hub in aberdeenshire dressed in a blue and white striped jumper with a white beanie hat covering his shaven head brewdog s knack for grabbing headlines including the taxidermy cat bombs have given it an international following other stunts included creating a brewdog viagra beer for prince william s 2012 wedding taglined arise prince willy and watt and co founder martin dickie dressing up as red light district sex workers for a crowdfunding ad it has loudly championed its initiatives to share profits with employees and cap salaries for bosses at 14 times the lowest paid worker annual sales growth has averaged 57 per cent over the past decade and it is on course to sell 400million cans this year but the past two years have delivered shocks for a company that had become accustomed to springing its own the pandemic at times left its pubs deserted and watt sleeping in the office as he was working so hard to cope with the financial battering outrageous james watt left and martin dickie prepare to drop fat cats over the city worse still he received a scathing public attack with accusations of a rotten culture levelled by his own former staff last summer an episode he says made him belatedly face up to his own responsibilities as company co founder and boss watt is therefore perhaps uncharacteristically coy on the timing of any ipo at least for the time being stock market conditions and the outlook for covid curbs on bars must be right to press the button he says the key thing is getting that certainty and stability back he adds cautioning that the final trigger point for an ipo could be this year or some point in the future we re working towards it the top 10 beer brands are all companies which are 100 years old in what other industry does that happen companies rarely signal when exactly they will float until they are ready to list access to fresh capital will also allow brewdog to pursue an aggressive international expansion strategy and continue taking on established labels the top 10 beer brands are all companies which are 100 years old in what other industry does that happen a float has also long been promised for the 200 000 equity punks brought on board through crowdfunding rounds since the brand s launch in 2007 since then the aberdeenshire based brand has led the march of craft brewing into the mainstream opening branded bars and hotels at home and overseas and selling in supermarkets several other craft brewers including meantime and camden town brewery have been snapped up by brewing giants in recent years but watt who counts a us private equity firm as a minority investor dismisses suggestions he might be caught up in the latest buyout frenzy which is being led by private equity firms we ve had loads and loads of inbound including two approaches last year we re very passionate about our independence he adds but institutional investors may still be nervous after last year s staff storm a group of 60 employees published an open letter accusing it of pursuing growth at all costs and watt personally of leaving staff burnt out afraid and miserable it appears brewdog s unconventional approach had spilled over into its workplace culture watt suitably contrite says the allegations were difficult to hear and the episode offered an opportunity to get better as a company covid he says triggered some tough people decisions it shut down its 100 bars and small collection of hotels through a string of lockdowns and played havoc with brewdog s plans he admits that even before that expansion was so rapid that maybe we didn t focus on the element of strategy that we should have but there is a limit to how much he s willing to grovel i think a quote i heard about leadership was if you want to keep everyone happy you should give away ice cream as opposed to run a company sometimes things we do are not popular and that s kind of part and parcel of running the company i suppose but some of the personal elements are tough to hear before this i was working on a north atlantic fishing boat i d never been a ceo before i take the responsibility very seriously a period of reflection on my own leadership followed the criticisms as well as an independent review into the company s culture by specialist wiser brewdog then conducted leadership training gave staff a pay rise and introduced a whistleblowing hotline so should prospective investors be concerned there may be more skeletons in the closet watt says we ve done a very thorough transparent response to those issues i think we re now in a very good place thirsty work the aberdeenshire based brewer is on course to sell 400million cans this year meanwhile watt says he doubled down on property investments during the pandemic swooping on bargain sites for its bars and hotels huge new venues will soon open in waterloo london and on the las vegas strip watt spent christmas isolating alone with covid in front of netflix seeing his two daughters later in the festive season that was followed by a trip to the maldives swimming with sharks he s planning to release a documentary this year to bemoan the routine killing of sharks around the world but despite what appears to have been a period in which he has matured watt insists the growing pains and the course towards a city listing will not mean the end of brewdog s rebellious image if i thought going into an ipo would change the essence of the business in any way then it wouldn t be part of the plan watt says we might be a slightly unconventional public company but we ll continue wearing our heart on our sleeve continue to take a stand for the things that we believe in he adds

washington jan 14 the scourge of rising prices now ranks among american business leaders top concerns according to a survey released thursday while federal reserve official indicated the central bank is ready to move against inflation advertisement official data shows signs the wave of increases may have peaked at the end of the year but with inflation at its highest level in nearly four decades more economists and some fed officials say the central bank might have to be more aggressive to stem the surge inflation is the number two worry among chief executives behind labor shortages and the price pressures could persist into 2023 according to a survey by the conference board released thursday i m very concerned about the high level of inflation fed governor lael brainard said at her nomination hearing before the senate banking committee advertisement brainard whom president joe biden nominated to serve as vice chair of the central bank said most forecasts show prices are likely to stay high for the first half of the year and come down later in 2022 but she warned to take these projections with a fair amount of caution brainard told lawmakers the fed will focus on bringing inflation back down to its two percent target but will do so consistent with a sustained and strong recovery advertisement the fed s key inflation fighting tool is the benchmark lending rate which was slashed to zero at the start of the covid 19 pandemic many economists expect three rate hikes this year but st louis federal bank president james bullard said wednesday policymakers might have to be more aggressive and raise four times another regional fed president raphael bostic of atlanta said he was open to hiking as early as march record inflation brainard however said the moves would be made in a well communicated way to ensure a measured response by financial markets and allow the economy to continue to recover jobs if confirmed brainard would replace richard clarida who in a paper released prior to his friday departure from the fed argued that the price increases were closer to the fed s target than they appear the unwelcome surge in inflation in 2021 once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged will in the end prove to be largely transitory under appropriate monetary policy he wrote the fed s hawkish shift comes after the consumer price index ended the year with a seven percent jump the highest since 1982 while the producer price index hit a record 9 7 percent but the data showed price pressures easing in the final month of the year with producer prices for energy and food declining producer prices ended the year on an encouraging note rising less than expectations as both the headline and core ppi moderated in december said mahir rasheed of oxford economics the covid 19 pandemic has created shortages of critical goods like computer chips for cars while transportation snags have further fanned the inflation flames all as new strains of the virus cause additional business disruptions persistent supply disruptions will pin producer prices near record levels in the near term especially given a rapidly spreading omicron variant that will fan inflation pressures rasheed said the price surge has battered biden s reputation even as the economy recovers from the damage inflicted by the pandemic and his white house welcomed signs the pressures might be abating monthly inflation results are always volatile and this report was driven in large part by a reduction in highly volatile energy and food prices but also reflects potential improvement in prices for supply chain related goods and services said cecilia rouse head of the white house council of economic advisors but she said the data underscores the need to continue to work to resolve the supply chain issues even as the economy has had a historic recovery we continue to face challenges with prices driven by supply chain disruptions around the world afp

copes with omicron s onslaught says politico it s also a stark example of the thorny decisions the biden administration and other officials must navigate almost two years into the pandemic as it tries to balance public health and a still fragile economy new york jan 15 xinhua the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc has updated its guidance on masks for the general public saying that people can choose to wear n95 and kn95 masks because they offer the best protection against covid 19 however the agency stopped short of saying that people should opt for certain masks instead of others noting that the cdc continues to recommend that you wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently previously the cdc did not recommend that the general population wear n95 masks or kn95s fearing that a run on those higher quality masks would impact the supply in health care settings the cdc now says shortages are no longer a concern according to an nbc news report when worn consistently and properly the agency wrote on its website n95 respirators approved by the national institute for occupational safety and health provide the highest

orders and the lag in shipping mean that people are unlikely to receive the free tests until the end of january at the earliest reported the new york times in some parts of the country that may be after the peak of the current surge of cases u s president joe biden said last month that his administration would purchase 500 million rapid at home coronavirus tests and distribute them to americans free of charge on thursday he announced plans to buy an additional 500 million tests bringing the total to one billion provided by xinhua cruise self policing the nightmare cruises of spring 2020 are

thursday conference call with stock analysts and reporters adding that 8 000 of his employees have contracted covid 19 in the last four weeks alone about 10 percent of the carrier s workforce a toll that contributed to more than 2 200 cancelled delta flights since dec 24 although a precise count of the number of employees who are out sick or quarantining is hard to come by about 5 million

variant is highly transmissible on the other hand it s having a lesser effect in terms of seriousness of disease he said though adding that for now the world still remains in the pandemic s grasp

states to keep global warming within 1 5 c for the chance to stay alive one of the biggest challenges will be to attract large investments across projects that involve many small players while the rise in esg themed investments is the global trend the acceleration and total quantum of funds has been highest in europe the sustainable finance community has been growing the volume and diversity of

record issuance of 1 1 trillion in 2020 the lac region represented a nascent 2 of this market at present williams caribbean capital of barbados is listed as the only caricom based company to have issued 18 8 million through seven published bonds on the idb s green bond transparency platform covering the lac region the total for the lac region listed on the platform is currently 21 7 billion the ifc estimates that given the threat that climate change and global warming pose for the region this number will rise exponentially in the next eight years and could reach 23 trillion by 2030 sponsored article continues below in june of 2021 the jamaican stock exchange launched its green bond project entitled facilitating and enabling environment for a caribbean green bond listing on the jamaican stock exchange the 24 month long project is funded through a grant by the south korean based green climate fund gcf and is a collaboration between the climate change division ministry of housing urban renewal environment climate change and the jse the project objective is to strengthen jamaica s commitment to climate action as outlined in its nationally determined contributions ndcs it has received strong endorsements from the project s partners the government of jamaica the government of dominica and private sector stakeholders green economy green bonds sustainable development goals sdgs and private public partnerships will be important themes in this years regional investments and capital markets conference from 25 27 january organized by the jamaican stock exchange scaling up with many small projects it is now clear that all countries of the region will experience massive transformations in the coming years and that will require huge investments by all sectors whenever we deal with the wellbeing of people the health of nature and sustainability in general collaboration is the basis for success collaboration requires trust transparency and accountability to achieve that we need to have a common terminology be able to define what we are trying to achieve and our goals need to be sufficiently ambitious and yet realistic our goals must be based on science so that we are moving verifiably towards sustainability because not every kind of movement even it is in the right direction but not at the required rate is actual progress and we have no time money or lives to waste sponsored article continues below all regions indeed the whole world are facing one core challenge with two components can we mobilize sufficient investments into the right projects when it comes to the amount of money we can say that money is beginning to scale up fast but we still need a lot more of it and we need all local financial institutions incumbents and challengers as well as crowd funding initiatives to innovate and play their part when it comes to the question of the right projects the challenge is even bigger consider the following two issues institutional investors who are making up the bulk of capital markets already have huge portfolios and facing an increasing dilemma they need to scale up while at the same time becoming more and more responsible ensuring they generate truly sustainable impacts they need to ensure that they are not duped by greenwashing and that they in turn are not duping their clients who are increasing the pressure sustainability related projects come in many different forms some like infrastructure require huge investments investors love that because relative transaction costs are low but many social and biodiversity related projects require a much greater quantity of smaller investments and these are associated with large transaction costs investors need to invest a lot of time and effort in many small projects technology for transaction costs the relative low liquidity of caribbean markets means that many large investors stay clear of this market because it is too small for them anthony miller head of the un sustainable stock exchanges initiative points out that relatively small investments require the same amount of due diligence work as large investments increasing the transaction costs for big institutional investors additionally what can be a small investment for a large investor can equal a large segment of a small company or small market thus for large investors they could end up with too large a segment of the market and the associated risks would be too high one countermeasure the caribbean can take is to lower transaction costs through facilitation e g caribbean climate smart accelerator innovation collaboration and pooled joint investment vehicles and indices that are cross listed on other markets anthony miller points out that a more fundamental transformation in this direction would be to either join mila mercado integrado latinoamericano or use it as a template for integrating caribbean markets mila took a collection of relatively small markets colombia peru chile and mexico and integrated them to create what is now the largest market in latin america sponsored article continues below technology and transparency are also part of the answer for example through distributed ledger technology and the green bond transparency platform we must be able to link and assure the impacts for huge amounts of money down to source records of many small individual projects particularly unavoidable in small island developing states assured standards for staying alive a second and equally necessary element of the approach must be to not shy away from setting sufficiently high standards for the impact that is to be generated and how that is to be assured at present caribbean stock exchanges are thinking about designing and drafting esg specific listing requirements caribbean issuers are not yet used to reporting on these dimensions at the same time issuers in other markets have gotten used to the run of the mill esg reporting and governments regulators and investors are starting to implement a different class of standard one that distinguishes between common esg and actual sustainability where the context ecological thresholds and actual sustainability targets are taken into account all the discussion about the issb and what will or will not be included in those standards the eu taxonomy the sustainable finance disclosure

thirty years on the residents of the individual republics are seen to be better off in some measures than they were at independence all 15 republics have seen life expectancy improve since 1991 by victor cherubim it has been 30 years ago since the soviet union dissolved in the wake of a bangled reform by soviet leaders on 26 december 1991 the soviet union was created by the bolshevik revolution of 1917 it did not happen overnight it was no surprise the collapse of the 15 republics which made up the soviet union faced both internal and external pressures back in the ussr they endeavoured to establish political structures and reform economic systems which failed they faced unresolved territorial questions socio economic crisis and particularly ambiguity about which direction to take in the future i don t want to discuss the causes of the breakup in a short write up other than to state there was an unwieldly empire a permanent food shortage the official exchange rate was 78 kopeks whilst the black market rate was 48 70 roubles to the us greenback unlike a revolution the outlying soviet empire was eager for reform brewing over a long time soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev stepped down and boris yeltsin became president of a newly independent russia the breakup of this colossus was already a question of time president putin s russia fast forward to president putin who has stated the breakup of historic russia imperial russia has lost 40 of its territory built over a millennium 1000 years and lost its largest production capacity he has had an ambition to build russia to its pristine days but his dream has been blocked not necessarily by alexei navalny russian opposition party called the future of russia he has been cornered by punitive economic sanctions by the west vladimir putin according to western reports is a ruthless dictator he however is known in russia for the salvation of russia from disintegration for the end of the war in chechnya and the destruction of isis and other terrorist groups in syria russia lost blood and sweat to accomplish all this including to get out of afghanistan my personal experience now only a memory looking back some 60 years ago feb march 1962 during khrushchev regime when i was foot loose and fancy free i visited the soviet union from my educational stay in united states enroute to ceylon sri lanka i was really fortunate in spending a full month travelling around the soviet union visiting some of the capital cities of its republics moscow including leningrad in russia kiev capital of ukraine and also odessa and sochi in ukraine erevan capital of armenia tbilisi in georgia baku in azerbaijan and tashkent in uzbekistan i learned a lot about the then soviet way of life the kolkhoz collective farm systems the soviet education i had read much about soviet space exploration while in president kennedy s usa i wrote three feature articles published in 1962 in the times of ceylon which readers can access including the one i recall russian students are paid to study i came to realise that both the russian and ukrainians were from the same stock of people speaking both russian which then was the official language and ukrainian which was the language of ukraine the ukrainians were naturally very proud of their zaporozhe cossack tradition of their history i was most welcome and treated with much courtesy because i came from mrs srimavo bandranaike s friendly country so much for my credentials which i am sure my readers will forgive me for it today ukraine is a separate and rightly free nation but both russian speaking brothers are at loggerheads thanks in large measure to nato and the stirring up of emotions because russia invaded crimea in 2014 and annexed it russia now states it has stationed near 100 000 border patrols on the eastern flank of ukraine this could well be in fear of ukraine becoming coerced as a nato member diplomacy or deterrence is russia s choice says united states us deputy secretary of state wendy r sherman a veteran diplomat recently states de escalation and diplomacy as opposed to deterrence and the very significant costs to russia if they choose invasion subversion or coercion she goes on i am not quite sure why russia feels so threatened by ukraine president putin will have to make a judgment about where he can get the kind of progress he wants why are they threatened by a much smaller country that s just a developing democracy it makes no sense are we witnessing a form of gun diplomacy nearly 8 hours of us russia bilateral talks in geneva a few days ago has yielded no progress nerves are on end of course nato and the west is nervously watching russian build up a formidable build up of forces alongside the ukrainian border it s eastern border with russia with an estimated alleged 600 000 russian troops including tanks for invasion but moscow has denied plans for an all out strike attack which could engulf in a world war will it be in moscow s interest to escalate is any body s guess president putin has not wanted to fall into the same mistake made after the collapse of the soviet union or by ukraine wanting to ever join nato a threat to the security of russia he has estonia and other baltic states within earshot of russian border he has the nordstrom oil pipeline to germany issue un resolved but 8 years later he still has held crimea president putin has put forward an eight point draft treaty laying out the requests his conditions for withdrawal including long term security guarantees including nato will halt its eastern expansion rule out membership for ukraine and roll back us and nato forces stationed in central and eastern europe is it a tall order united states wants to protect the borders and sovereignty of ukraine the us already is using sanctions to curtail russian intervention the biden administration and its allies are signalling to russia that they would face financial technological and military sanctions against russia they say they would go into effect within hours of an invasion of ukraine if russia sends troops across the border what has been achieved by the old soviet republics in these 30 years of freedom thirty years on the residents of the individual republics are seen to be better off in some measures than they were at independence all 15 republics have seen life expectancy improve since 1991 they have seen a decrease in poverty levels through reliable comparison data is difficult to ascertain there is however some nostalgic for soviet days understandably especially among the elderly citizens who knew how to in the old soviet union will putin use diplomacy rather than deterrence is the trillion dollar question

the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc has updated its guidance on masks for the general public saying that people can choose to wear n95 and kn95 masks because they offer the best protection against covid 19 however the agency stopped short of saying that people should opt for certain masks instead of others noting that the cdc continues to recommend that you wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently previously the us health agency did not recommend that the general population wear n95 masks or kn95s fearing that a run on those higher quality masks would impact the supply in healthcare settings the cdc now says shortages are no longer a concern according to an nbc news report when worn consistently and properly the agency wrote on its website n95 respirators approved by the national institute for occupational safety and health provide the highest level of protection from particles including the virus that causes covid 19 americans will be able to request free rapid coronavirus tests from the federal government beginning on wednesday but the tests will take seven to 12 days to arrive senior joe biden administration officials have said the administration s website to process the requests covidtests gov was up and running on friday the latest sign of its efforts to ramp up access to testing since the fast spreading omicron variant sent coronavirus case counts soaring xinhua news agency reported but the delay in accepting orders and the lag in shipping mean that people are unlikely to receive the free tests until the end of january at the earliest reported the new york times in some parts of the country that may be after the peak of the current surge of cases us president joe biden said in december 2021 that his administration would purchase 500 million rapid at home coronavirus tests and distribute them to americans free of charge on thursday he announced plans to buy an additional 500 million tests bringing the total to one billion the nightmare cruises of spring 2020 are back as omicron sends passenger case rates soaring yet the cdc is poised to loosen the industry s covid 19 leash saying cruise lines are now positioned to police themselves reported major us news portal politico on saturday despite a 30 fold increase in on board covid 19 cases with cruise ships being turned away at ports and passengers getting sick the cdc plans to lift all of its covid 19 restrictions on the cruise industry just two weeks ago the agency was recommending against cruising even for vaccinated passengers and the agency s official guidance states even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading covid 19 variants it s the latest in a series of mixed messages from the cdc not only about how safe it is to cruise but on a host of other covid 19 restrictions as the agency copes with omicron s onslaught said the report it s also a stark example of the thorny decisions the biden administration and other officials must navigate almost two years into the pandemic as it tries to balance public health and a still fragile economy the past few weeks have been hellacious delta air lines ceo ed bastian told a thursday conference call with stock analysts and reporters adding that 8 000 of his employees have contracted covid 19 in the last four weeks alone about 10 per cent of the carrier s workforce a toll that contributed to more than 2 200 cancelled delta flights since december 24 although a precise count of the number of employees who are out sick or quarantining is hard to come by about 5 million americans could be isolating due to covid 19 at the peak of omicron andrew hunter senior us economist at capital economics was quoted as saying in a cbs news report that could reflect about 2 per cent of the nation s workforce forced to stay home due to illness he added stew leonard jr chief executive of supermarket chain stew leonard s said that about 8 per cent of his staff was out sick or quarantining last week that affects what shoppers find on store shelves that s the highest we ve ever had he was quoted as saying what we are doing is the same as every other business you have to limit your product line a record spike in covid 19 cases due to the omicron variant is causing a nationwide worker sickout disrupting businesses ranging from grocery stores to airlines reported the national broadcaster noting that the latest worker shortages are compounding earlier pandemic problems including supply chain disruptions and shortage of some services the pandemic could start moving into an endemic phase in 2022 though countries will need to stay vigilant as the omicron variant spreads according to moderna inc co founder noubar afeyan 2022 may be the year that the pandemic enters an endemic phase but it really depends on what happens and the decisions that are made across the world afeyan told bloomberg on friday although the omicron variant is highly transmissible on the other hand it s having a lesser effect in terms of seriousness of disease he said though adding that for now the world still remains in the pandemic s grasp while some countries slowly begin to consider treating covid 19 as an endemic disease like the flu world health organisation officials have said it s too early to make that call as cases surge ians

wellington new zealand the tsunami threat around the pacific from a huge undersea volcanic eruption began to recede sunday while the extent of damage to tonga remained unclear satellite images showed the spectacular eruption that took place saturday evening with a plume of ash steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue pacific waters a sonic boom could be heard as far away as alaska in tonga it sent tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground the eruption cut the internet to tonga leaving friends and family members around the world anxiously trying to get in touch to figure out if there were any injuries and the extent of the damage even government websites and other official sources remained without updates on sunday afternoon new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said there had not yet been any official reports of injuries or deaths in tonga but cautioned that authorities hadn t yet made contact with some coastal areas and smaller islands communication with tonga remains very limited and i know that is causing a huge amount of anxiety for the tongan community here ardern said she said there had been significant damage to boats and shops along the tongan coastline the capital nuku alofa was covered in a thick film of volcanic dust ardern said contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need aid agencies said thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water ardern said new zealand was unable to send a military surveillance flight over tonga on sunday because the ash cloud was 63 000 feet 19 000 meters high but they hoped to send the flight on monday followed by supply planes and navy ships one complicating factor to any international aid effort is that tonga has so far managed to avoid any outbreaks of covid 19 ardern said new zealand s military staff were all fully vaccinated and willing to follow any protocols established by tonga dave snider the tsunami warning coordinator for the national tsunami warning center in palmer alaska said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin and the spectacle was both humbling and scary the tsunami waves caused damage to boats as far away as new zealand and santa cruz california but did not appear to cause any widespread damage snider said he anticipated the tsunami situation in the u s and elsewhere to continue improving tsunami advisories were earlier issued for japan hawaii alaska and the u s pacific coast the u s geological survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude 5 8 earthquake scientists said tsunamis generated by volcanoes rather than earthquakes are relatively rare the tonga meteorological services said a tsunami warning was declared for all of the archipelago and data from the pacific tsunami center said waves of 80 centimetres 2 7 feet were detected rachel afeaki taumoepeau who chairs the new zealand tonga business council said she hoped the relatively low level of the tsunami waves would have allowed most people to get to safety although she worried about those living on islands closest to the volcano she said she hadn t yet been able to contact her friends and family in tonga we are praying that the damage is just to infrastructure and people were able to get to higher land she said u s secretary of state antony blinken wrote on twitter he is deeply concerned for the people of tonga as they recover from the aftermath of a volcanic eruption and tsunami the united states stands prepared to provide support to our pacific neighbours tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from suva fiji all internet connectivity with tonga was lost at about 6 40 p m local time said doug madory director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm kentik on tonga which is home to about 105 000 people video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas and swirling around homes a church and other buildings a twitter user identified as dr faka iloatonga taumoefolau posted video showing waves crashing ashore can literally hear the volcano eruption sounds pretty violent he wrote adding in a later post raining ash and tiny pebbles darkness blanketing the sky the explosion of the hunga tonga hunga ha apai volcano was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions earth imaging company planet labs pbc had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent there began erupting in late december satellite images captured by the company show how drastically the volcano had shaped the area creating a growing island off tonga the surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45 due to ashfall planet labs said days before the latest activity following saturday s eruption residents in hawaii alaska and along the u s pacific coast were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground and to pay attention to instructions from their local emergency management officials said snider we don t issue an advisory for this length of coastline as we ve done i m not sure when the last time was but it really isn t an everyday experience snider said savannah peterson watched in shock as the water rose several feet in a matter of minutes in front of her oceanfront house in pacifica california just south of san francisco it came up so fast and a few minutes after that it was down again it was nuts to see that happen so quickly she said i ve never had water come all the way up to my front door and today it did police rescued a surfer whose surfboard broke in powerful waves off san francisco farther south in santa cruz california officials were taking stock of damage after a surge damaged boats and inundated low lying streets and parking lots sending cars afloat in southern california surging waters sunk at least one boat in ventura harbor northwest of los angeles new zealand s private forecaster weather watch tweeted that people as far away as southland the country s southernmost region reported hearing sonic booms from the eruption others reported that many boats were damaged by a tsunami that hit a marina in whangarei in the northland region earlier the matangi tonga news site reported that scientists observed massive explosions thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early friday satellite images showed a 5 kilometre 3 mile wide plume rising into the air to about 20 kilometres 12 miles the hunga tonga hunga ha apai volcano is located about 64 kilometres 40 miles north of nuku alofa in late 2014 and early 2015 a series of eruptions in the area created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the pacific archipelago for several days there is not a significant difference between volcanoes underwater and on land and underwater volcanoes become bigger as they erupt at some point usually breaching the surface said hans schwaiger a research geophysicist with the alaska volcano observatory with underwater volcanoes however the water can add to the explosivity of the eruption as it hits the lava schwaiger added before an explosion there is generally an increase in small local earthquakes at the volcano but depending on how far it is from land that may not be felt by residents along the shoreline schwaiger said in 2019 tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when a fiber optic cable was severed the director of the local cable company said at the time that a large ship may have cut the cable by dragging an anchor until limited satellite access was restored people couldn t even make international calls southern cross cable network s veverka said limited satellite connections exist between tonga and other parts of the world but he did not know if they might be affected by power outages

hard tackle on mali mali has for some while been a sore thumb in the west african sub region owing to an armed uprising since 2012 that has left swaths of the country outside government control the situation is compounded however by its restive military which periodically butts in to hijack power from civilian leadership mali s military has usurped power since 2020 and has shown an unwillingness to restore control to democratically elected leaders but the sub regional economic community of west african states ecowas has vehemently objected to this signposting a new paradigm in our clime regarding international engagement with internal affairs of member nations ecowas leaders rose from an extraordinary meeting in ghana last sunday slamming an unprecedented slew of sanctions on mali because of the reluctance of its military junta to steer the country back to civil rule army officers led by colonel assimi goita had in august 2020 toppled elected president ibrahim boubacar keita amid street protests against his unpopular rule under threat of sanctions goita installed an interim government led by civilians and promised holding presidential and legislative elections in february 2022 to restore full civil rule but he staged a de facto second coup in may 2021 by dismantling the interim government a move that disrupted the transition timetable and was met with diplomatic condemnation following the second coup ecowas insisted on mali holding elections this month but goita who declared himself interim president said he would only set a new date after a nationwide parley arguing that a peaceful vote was more important than speed at the end of the parley last december the junta said it envisaged a four year transition period beginning from january 1 2022 despite persuasions by ecowas mediator former nigerian president goodluck jonathan to the contrary it announced plans to hold elections in december 2025 instead of february 2022 as originally agreed read also mali condemns ecowas sanctions against military authorities ecowas didn t buy the dallying and unleashed sanctions with immediate effect against mali saying the plan simply means that an illegitimate military transition government will take the malian people hostage the new sanctions unveiled last sunday in accra include closure of member nations land and air borders with mali and recall of ambassadors from bamako suspension of non essential financial transactions among them ban on all exports except pharmaceuticals and other humanitarian items activation of the bloc s standby force to be ready for any eventuality and freezing of malian state assets in ecowas central and commercial banks in line with the sanctions regime the west african economic and monetary union uemoa instructed all financial institutions under its ambit to suspend mali with immediate effect severing the country s access to regional financial markets the 15 member bloc had following goita s first coup in 2020 shuttered mali s borders imposed trade restrictions and suspended the country from its decision making bodies but when the junta installed a civilian led interim government and pledged to hold elections february 2022 the economic sanctions were lifted although mali remained suspended from the bloc s main bodies the new slate of sanctions by ecowas marked the toughest ever by the regional body and signalled an unprecedented resolve to beat back military intervention in power which seemed to be festering in the sub region and beyond both the toughness and regional consensus behind the sanctions were as well unprecedented and punctured the notion of insular sovereignty of member states so as to regulate political behaviour mali being a landlocked country the sanctions are certain to bite hence the junta in bamako is rattled in response it condemned the sanctions as illegal and illegitimate and applied the principle of reciprocity to recall its own ambassadors as well as counter shutter its borders with all affected countries but while the sanctions may hurt ordinary malians they will also worsen the challenge of internal legitimacy for the junta given that malian opposition parties had rejected the timetable proposed by it the new sanctions would have received endorsement from the global community but for russia and china which on tuesday blocked a united nations security council unsc resolution drafted by france supporting ecowas france mali s former colonial power and the united states expressed support for the sanctions but china argued that mali is amidst a critical transition period and outside forces must refrain from exerting excess pressure while russia rejected the proposed unsc statement as unbalanced and expressed sympathy for the mali junta but it wasn t uhuru for mali as algeria with which it shares a long border has objected to the malian army perpetuating itself in power and urged negotiations with ecowas to reach a plan to end the crisis taking into account international demands and the legitimate demands of the malian people the courage of ecowas deserves commendation but the bloc should extend its swagger to leaders of member states who perpetuate themselves in power through sham elections and arbitrary review of existing constitutional provisions the aversion for illegitimacy in power must be comprehensive

paris a punishing mix of heat and humidity that makes outdoor labor difficult and dangerous is causing around 677 billion lost working hours a year around the world according to a new study thursday that warns climate change is making it worse researchers in the united states who estimated the current cost at 2 1 trillion every year said that the negative effects of stifling temperatures on people doing heavy work in agriculture and construction had been underestimated advertisement the new figures comes amid a growing focus on the severe health impacts of climate change not just as projections of future harm from heatwaves and other extreme events but also as consequences already playing out across a warming world the study published in the journal environmental research letters looked at data on humid heat particularly dangerous because the body is less able to cool down by sweating researchers estimated the number of workers exposed to unsafe levels over the 20 years to 2020 as well as the impact on labor compared to the period 1981 to 2000 researchers incorporated the findings from laboratory based research published last year that suggest productivity drops off at lower temperature and humidity levels than previously thought they found that between 2001 and 2020 exposure to high humidity and heat was linked to approximately 677 billion lost working hours a year in heavy outdoor labour it suggested almost three quarters of the global working age population are already living in locations where background climate conditions are associated with about a hundred hours of heat associated lost work per person per year if outdoor workers are losing productivity at these lower temperature and humidity levels then labour losses in the tropics could be as high as 500 to 600 hours per person per year which is over twice as high as previous estimates said lead researcher luke parsons of duke university advertisement the research found that india currently loses around 259 billion hours annually due to the impacts of humid heat on labor while china loses 72 billion hours and bangladesh loses 32 billion hours warming magnifies impacts over the last four decades as global temperatures have risen the study found heat related labor losses have increased by at least nine percent the authors estimate that climate change is to blame for an additional 25 billion working hours lost annually in india over the last 20 years compared to the previous 20 years and an extra four billion hours a year in china over the same period parsons said other hot and humid regions such as the southeastern united states could also be experiencing significant labour losses as well these results imply that we don t have to wait for 1 5 degrees celsius of global warming to experience impacts of climate change on labour and the economy he said the warming we ve already experienced may be associated with large scale background labour losses additional future warming magnifies these impacts the lancet s annual countdown on health and humanity report last year warned that overall some 295 billion hours of potential work were lost due to extreme heat exposure in 2020 with the average potential earnings lost in poorer countries equivalent to between four and eight percent of national gross domestic product gdp research published last year in the journal nature climate change suggested 100 000 heat related deaths per year were caused by climate change last year the un intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that global heating is virtually certain to pass the paris agreement threshold of a 1 5 degree celsius cap probably within a decade your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up the last seven years since the paris deal was signed in 2015 have been the hottest on record related stories

and on land and underwater volcanoes become bigger as they erupt at some point usually breaching the surface said hans schwaiger a research geophysicist with the alaska volcano observatory with underwater volcanoes however the water can add to the explosivity of the eruption as it hits the lava schwaiger added before an explosion there is generally an increase in small local earthquakes at the volcano but depending on how far it is from land that may not be felt by residents along the shoreline schwaiger said in 2019 tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when a fiber optic

the buoyant stock market has swelled the amount of money americans have in their retirement savings plans which is undoubtedly a welcome development for seniors who will need that money to live on but most of the more than 13 trillion in savings is stockpiled in tax deferred plans which means retirees will eventually have to pay taxes on it and depending on the size of the account that tax bill could be significant the irs requires owners of traditional iras and other tax deferred accounts to take minimum annual withdrawals starting at age 72 required minimum distributions are taxed as income so a large withdrawal could vault you into a higher tax bracket in addition more of your social security benefits could be taxed you could lose out on certain deductions and credits tied to your modified adjusted gross income and you could pay higher premiums for medicare parts b and d but here are some ways to reduce the size of your required withdrawals and consequently your tax bill tap your ira for charity if you re 70½ or older you can donate up to 100 000 a year from your iras to charity via a qualified charitable distribution and after you turn 72 it will count toward your required minimum distribution a qualified charitable distribution isn t deductible but will reduce your adjusted gross income which besides lowering your federal and state tax bill can also lower taxes on items tied to your agi such as social security benefits and medicare premiums make sure the donation is made directly from your ira to the charity otherwise it won t be considered a qualified charitable distribution you can t make a qualified charitable distribution to a donor advised fund or private foundation and the recipient must be a 501 3 charity registered with the irs says mari adam a certified financial planner in boca raton fla convert to a roth when you convert money in a traditional ira to a roth you must pay taxes on the amount you convert although part of the conversion won t be taxed if you ve made nondeductible contributions to your ira after conversion withdrawals are tax free as long as you re 59½ or older and have owned a roth for at least five years unlike traditional iras and other tax deferred accounts roths aren t subject to required minimum distributions so if you don t need the money you can let it continue to grow with no obligation to the irs you can keep the cost of a conversion down by converting during the period between the year you retire and the year you re required to take required minimum distributions

hosted modified racing there were fans here at 6 a m that day said david allison son of carl allison the track s owner cars were parked as far as four miles away we had people climbing trees to see daddy would crank up a chain saw and go over there he wouldn t actually cut the trees down but they would come out of them anyway racingone getty images master mechanic red vogt nascar founder bill france sr and driver red byron pose during the first nascar strictly stock season in 1949 byron went on to become the first champion of what is known today at the nascar cup series by race time more than 10 000 people some estimates put the crowd number at over 20 000 likely an exaggeration had jammed into the track they saw action that has been described as barely controlled mayhem as the heavy cars banged around a dusty surface pockmarked by holes and they saw drivers who would become stars of the fledgling sport lee petty tim flock fonty flock curtis turner buck baker jack smith and herb thomas the winner though would be chris jim roper he used jim as a racing name a man unknown to virtually everyone else at the track that day he led 47 laps in the second half of the race but north carolina driver glenn dunnaway charged to the front late and took the checkered flag first roper was a distant second the race was a dusty marathon only 11 of the 33 starters finished as overheating problems parked many entries and the roughness of the track caused some drivers to leave the race with broken wheels among the spectators that day was ned jarrett who would become a nascar star himself in the next decade i was standing next to the fence at the start finish line he said i thought that was the place to be all of a sudden a car came down through there and a fan blade flew off and stuck in the wooden post right where i was leaning i quickly figured out that was not the place to be racingone getty images if not for a postrace inspection fail and later court ruling glenn dunnaway would have gone done in history as the first winner in nascar cup history while dunnaway celebrated nascar officials began a post race check of his winning ford soon word came that he had been disqualified because the rear end of his car a converted moonshine hauler had been strengthened to support loads of illegal liquor roper was declared the winner but not before the engine in his lincoln was torn down for inspection fortunately for roper a local ford dealership gave him a new engine it was installed in the car and roper drove home in the cup series first winning vehicle it was a very controversial race roper remembered years later i think it was one of the things that helped make nascar due to the controversy it was more or less competitive too not surprisingly dunnaway and car owner hubert westmoreland were not pleased by nascar s decision westmoreland said nascar approved his car prior to the race he eventually sued but a court ruled that nascar controlled the rules of its races setting a key precedent for france a look back at occoneechee speedway a nascar field of dreams from the inaugural season it was the first major controversy for nascar s new series but it certainly would not be the last i think that was the worst injustice that i ever saw nascar do anybody said driver jack smith who finished 13th that day roper drove in only one other nascar race finishing 15th at occoneechee speedway in hillsborough n c later that season he eventually moved from halstead kansas to kaufman texas where he operated a horse farm roper died in 2000

low level of the tsunami waves would have allowed most people to get to safety although she worried about those living on islands closest to the volcano she said she hadn t yet been able to contact

new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said there had not yet been any official reports of injuries or deaths in tonga but cautioned that authorities hadn t yet made contact with some coastal areas and smaller islands communication with tonga remains very limited and i know that is causing a huge amount of anxiety for the tongan community here ardern said she said there had been significant damage to boats and shops along the tongan coastline the capital nuku alofa was covered in a thick film of volcanic dust ardern said contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need aid agencies said thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water ardern said new zealand was unable to send a military surveillance flight over tonga on sunday because the ash cloud was 63 000 feet 19 000 meters high but they hoped to send the flight on monday followed by supply planes and navy ships one complicating factor to any international aid

an australian born in 2019 can expect to live to about 83 some 34 years longer than people born in the 1880s in japan the average age expectancy is just over 84 today about one in seven australians are 65 or older by 2057 it ll be almost one in four australia has one of the highest life expectancies ranking ninth among oecd countries behind switzerland iceland italy norway japan sweden israel and spain ageing is universal but not uniform it s universal because it happens in all cells and all species but it s not uniform in that we don t all go through it in the same way professor byles says ageing is intrinsic to the living species on this planet but how we grow old and the factors that influence the process are complex and unpredictable being human and living our lives is all about change and that s what ageing is it s change over time says professor julie byles a social gerontologist and researcher at newcastle university it s a fact that many of us don t want to face with every tick of the clock every one of us is ageing it feels scary but it needn t add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time our cognitive processes peak about the time we re 20 in fact most of our body s systems are thought to peak when we are between 18 and 30 says leon flicker a professor of geriatric medicine at the university of western australia that seems to be when the ageing process starts kicking in and you have a progressive decline flicker says it s happening all your life it starts even before you re born from the very first cell division says byles that s because ageing comes down to a gradual accumulation of problems starting with tiny dna transcription errors from the very beginning while most people don t start feeling the effects until at least their 30s the seeds of ageing start when we do can we slow ageing how does it happen and how can ageism be a form of self sabotage we may feel more empowered to make those extra years as fulfilling and meaningful as possible if we understand how ageing happens that it s a lifelong process not just some switch that gets flicked in your 60s says peter lange a university of melbourne clinical associate professor in geriatrics there is a lot of nihilism about ageing and a lot of people think that disease is inevitable that they ll go into a nursing home or develop dementia that s not true but by believing it s going to be the case they end up failing to take action to prevent it he says as the world health organisation says with good health a longer life brings opportunities to pursue new activities a long neglected passion or even a fresh career there are certain hallmarks of ageing on a molecular and cellular level for example gregorevic says we collect damage in our dna one way is that each time our cells divide the little protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes called telomeres which are often likened to the plastic tips on shoelaces gradually shorten which affects our ability to copy dna properly the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same says dr kate gregorevic royal melbourne hospital geriatrician and author of staying alive the science of living healthier happier and longer the changes we experience as we age are neither linear nor consistent and there is an extraordinary level of variability among older people the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same but over time our physiological reserves drop so we re left accumulating damage that our body gradually can t keep up with fixing and this can manifest in all sorts of ways it s happening throughout every second of our existence says flicker ageing is not programmed though as we move through the world we suffer little bits of damage it could be from sunlight bacteria a sprained ankle a shonky dna copy bad food that the body then works to repair if you re frail says gregorevic your body is already working so hard at the best of times just to get through daily life so when you get a cold it takes all your energy the pile up of all these changes gradually increases our vulnerability to disease or insults such as a seemingly minor fall leading to bone fracture and eventually leads to frailty which is a loss of physical reserve that affects almost everybody by their 90s at the same time bone density drops while ligaments and joints stiffen becoming more at risk of injury and taking longer to heal also common are weakening lungs our cardiovascular system is impacted and there are certain hormonal changes with people exposed to a higher level of cortisol the stress hormone as they age muscle loss or sarcopenia is another typical part of ageing one study observed that muscle mass decreased between about 3 and 8 per cent each decade after age 30 and the rate of decline was higher after 60 we know that with age we can lose muscle strength gregorevic says particularly we lose fast twitch muscle fibres they re the ones you use when sprinting or when you catch your foot on the pavement and need to steady yourself fast then there are the changes we often notice from our 40s says lange skin loses elasticity hair turns grey as pigment cells in our follicles slowly die we become long sighted as the lenses of our eyes stiffen in some people hearing dulls when dna is damaged over time more cells can die or become cancerous more cells also become what s called senescent they stop dividing on the one hand this defends against cancer but these senescent cells also take up space without contributing causing inflammation and overstimulating the immune system which can t keep up with removing them still while everyone s reserves decrease with age we aren t all similarly susceptible to disease some of us lange says have higher baseline defences so even though someone may have pathologies such as hypertension and mini strokes both of which are linked to dementia they won t necessarily develop a form of the disease flicker says cancer is more common as people age partly because the body s surveillance system becomes less likely to spot and destroy bad cells we are more at risk of diabetes in part because our body becomes less efficient at converting glucose to energy and requires more insulin in 2014 15 almost three quarters of australians aged 65 and over reported they had good or very good health according to the australian institute of health and welfare but disease is more common in older people in 2015 cancer and cardiovascular disease were the most prevalent followed by dementia type 2 diabetes chronic lung disease and osteoarthritis many of these illnesses are also the biggest killers there s a lot of confusion between the implicit processes of ageing and diseases associated with getting old says lange a good example is our minds as brain tissue gradually decreases with age it s normal for our memory to shift to become slower and less efficient but forgetting entirely and suffering from significant impairment is not universal it s a symptom of dementia which is itself an umbrella term for many diseases what difference does the life you ve led make to ageing there s a cheeky saying in gerontology says byles if you want to age well pick your parents being born with as few dna errors as possible gives you a good headstart in life aspects such as a good education financial security and access to nutritious food in childhood add to your stocks you can be already on an un level playing field depending on what your early life is like byles says if you get to older age and you re big and strong with a healthy brain good education a strong immune system they all go into your reserve you can maybe cope with having not as strong muscles or a decline in condition because you have all these other things that support you a quarter of how we age is determined by genetics according to the world health organisation and the rest comes down to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors more than a third 38 per cent of the burden of disease in older australians was preventable in 2015 according to the australian institute of health and welfare smoking poor diet being overweight or obese and high blood pressure were key contributors covid 19 lockdowns which limited exercise and socialising have underlined just how important lifestyle is in ageing lange says the months in lockdown in victoria had devastating impacts on physical and cognitive function for older people there are other factors outside our control being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today aunty geraldine atkinson at the launch of the yoo rrook justice commission in 2021 credit simon schluter social disadvantage is a big one a 2020 study of 5000 britons found that lower socioeconomic status led to an accelerated decline in ageing the researchers pointed out that the rich tended to have for example better access to parks and fitness centres as well as mentally stimulating activities social clubs the arts which all helped bolster physical and mental function meanwhile those living in poverty usually experienced more life stresses which affected health and they could also be exposed to more environmental pollution loading this disparity in ageing is reflected in australian government policy subsidies for aged care services usually kick in at 65 but indigenous australians torres strait islanders and the homeless are at higher risk of health issues and financial inequality so are eligible at 50 or 45 if they are both indigenous and homeless the life expectancy of indigenous australians is about eight years less than for non indigenous australians aunty geraldine atkinson a bangerang woman and co chair of the first peoples assembly of victoria says more must be done to support healthy ageing in aboriginal communities being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today she says credit illustration dionne gain so can we delay ageing much research is being done to find a magic anti ageing pill but there is no strong evidence at the moment that supplements or medications work scientists are trying to find treatments that could lengthen telomeres for example or remove senescent cells via drugs or gene editing in the hope these could slow ageing the medical community is keeping a close eye on clinical trials underway to determine the effects of the drug metformin which is normally prescribed to manage blood sugar in diabetics but has shown broader age targeting potential research previously suggested diabetic people who took the drug outlived non diabetics who didn t and it has been found to delay ageing in mice although in high quantities it was toxic the american federation for aging research is examining whether it can also prevent heart disease cancer and dementia still any geriatrician will tell you a balanced diet and regular exercise are key to supporting healthy ageing and in turn a longer life stimulating your mind also helps minimise disease risk gregorevic says just like our muscles use it or lose it our brains are like that as well she says one of the best things you can do for healthy ageing is just to keep having a go at things not brain training but staying engaged in life socialising learning new skills learning a language it s never too early or too late to start byles encourages people to start planning for old age when young if you re not doing it by your 50s she says that s when you must ask yourself where do i go from here what do i want to protect in terms of bodily social and mental functions make changes that will maintain your wellbeing and keep you pushing your capacity to do things you enjoy the aptly named professor norman lazarus laid out why he considered exercise eating well and mental health a trinity in his book from 2020 the lazarus strategy how to age well and wisely the king s college london physician and researcher overhauled his lifestyle in his 50s to become a champion cyclist at 66 an age he said he expected to start having difficulty getting out of a chair or opening jars at 86 he still cycles trains at the gym walks with his wife watches his diet and works at the university at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality norman lazarus 86 kickstarted his healthy lifestyle when he was 50 credit liz seabrook lazarus encourages people to first accept they are going to get old and then change their lifestyle to truly enjoy the journey of ageing and retain their independence at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality he says the trick is to prioritise things you love so you stick to them he says while he and his wife now walk on flatter gentler trails instead of on multi day hikes for example they still relish the time together he even uses the term exercise deficiency diseases to emphasise how key physical activity is a comprehensive study in 2015 found 26 common illnesses could be positively affected by exercise including cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity dementia osteoarthritis osteoporosis and some cancers the most effective anti ageing option we have is exercise lange says it produces beneficial effects for pretty much everything we ve ever looked at exercise improves muscle strength balance bone density and the immune cardiovascular and respiratory systems it boosts mood and supports brain and spinal health too getting out and being active with people is important for cognitive stimulation and by stressing the body you re also getting it used to dealing with small perturbations lange says just a small amount of activity can make a meaningful difference and resistance training is particularly important he has seen this transform once bedbound patients in their 80s and 90s he encourages people to introduce incidental movement into their day carry your shopping bags instead of wheeling a trolley walk instead of drive or tend to your garden even if you have the healthiest exercise diet and social regimen in the world though you could still suffer from disease when older or younger for that matter the harsh reality is that no matter what you do you re going to die and you can live the perfect lifestyle and still get cancer nothing is certain gregorevic says it s why we must be careful not to judge people for the condition they re in when they re older byles points out that people with certain illnesses such as diabetes or lung disease often get blamed some of it is preventable but not all of it some of it is by virtue of the fact you ve been around a long time and have had a lot of chances to accumulate a problem she says why does ageism matter part of the reason people don t notice their own ageing is because the changes are far too subtle flicker says and people don t actually think they re changing with age their vision of self is deeply ingrained byles adds i have a theory that everyone thinks they re 30 you have a concept of yourself so we always think we re younger which is great but then we can get a shock she believes part of this is our own ageism where we value our youth as more relevant indeed we live in a culture that glorifies youth the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people in australia s 2021 royal commission into aged care quality and safety commissioner lynelle briggs found that ageism was systemic in australia the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people assumptions and stereotypes about older people and their capabilities and ageism towards them this must change she wrote and a world health organisation global survey of more than 83 000 people found that one in two had ageist attitudes one of the great tragedies of ageism is that people internalise it and develop a negative bias against their older selves gregorevic says one common example of self sabotage is that while young exercisers crave feeling out of breath many older people doubting their capabilities take it to mean they should avoid being active lange says that s exercise and it s getting you used to those challenging activities and the next time you get sick and need some extra heart and lung function it ll be there it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit the idea that older people are incapable of using technology is another misconception and professor linda rosenman board member of the australian association of gerontology says debates about retirement age generate another myth i think it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old rosenman says this is just the age that people become eligible for government pensions there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit not all australian communities suffer from ageism it seems not right foreign kind of says aunty geraldine explaining that indigenous communities focus not on what s lost with age but instead on the wisdom that s gained it s an approach she thinks the rest of the country could learn from loading in aboriginal culture an elder is someone recognised for their knowledge and ongoing contribution to their community and they are not neglected they are traditionally referred to as aunty or uncle we always respect and value our elders respect their cultural authority respect the stories they told us and that gets passed down aunty geraldine says you become an aunty not just to your bloodline but to other younger people as well it s different in other countries too when you re in beijing and you go for a walk to parks they re full of older people doing tai chi dancing there s no sense that i m too old to do that byles says byles who helped create the anti ageism every age counts campaign says people could be enjoying life more as they age ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it she says credit illustration dionne gain what do you gain as you age the fact is we do typically become happier as we age with research showing older people tend to have brighter moods and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than younger counterparts byles says it s possible this is because older people largely do things that bring them satisfaction you can t do all the things you used to do so you are actually focusing on things that are more important to you she says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom plus she says we often care less about what other people think which can be really liberating and there is a sense of contentedness that comes from understanding with time where you and the puzzle pieces of your life fit people keep improving their vocabulary well into their 60s and 70s and while brain speed and working memory peak in early life this doesn t make 20 year olds equipped mentally to run the country older people have what s termed crystalline intelligence flicker says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom reflecting on her own life rosenman considers herself to have become more patient and tolerant and she enjoys having more time you re not trying to climb the greasy pole yourself any more and you re much more ready to mentor and help other people she says in many ways life is a lot more enjoyable than when you were racing off to work and herding the kids grandchildren are a big bonus ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it professor julie byles says we should start planning for getting old at least by our 50s credit peter stoop how do you deal with the fear of nearing the end of your life there is of course an existential aspect to ageing that can be quite difficult lange says i ve met patients who have lived too long and have outlived their partners and friends and even sometimes their own children and they have increasing physical disability and sensory limitations but lange says most people reach a point where they no longer fear dying people usually accept it will come which is quite freeing lange encourages people to focus on ageing well rather than fixating on the idea that getting older means they re approaching death which is only one moment at the very end of a life journey flicker agrees i think people eventually realise that if you re not dead yet then maybe life is to be lived and really you should try to enjoy the living as much as you can no matter what is happening at the time loading and it s up to all of us to talk to each other to help reframe the way we view our older years as the aged care royal commission report outlined there are everyday things that all of us can do to enable older people to live their lives to the fullest extent possible older people should also be encouraged to think about what it is that would make them happy and to have some goals or objectives for each day or week that give purpose while many people worry they will end up in a nursing home the reality is most australians do not the same report says about 80 per cent of australians use an aged care program at some stage before their death but for most this means at home support nobody is saying the last years can t be difficult you can be faced with losing people you love while also dealing with your own debilitating health problems but the vast majority of people will be healthy enough to live independently for most of their life gregorevic says we need to remember that life is finite and in a way that that s a real gift like all of us lazarus feels taken aback when he sees his older face in the mirror but says there isn t any age that he wishes to be frozen in i m not sure where i put myself i see this old man and i see myself but do i wish i were 20 again not really he says i can t place myself in any decade because i ve really

people look at a damaged boat in a marina at tutukaka new zealand on jan 16 after waves from a volcano eruption swept into the marina northern advcate nzme via ap wellington new zealand the tsunami threat around the pacific from a huge undersea volcanic eruption began to recede sunday while the extent of damage to tonga remained unclear satellite images showed the spectacular eruption that took place saturday evening with a plume of ash steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue pacific waters a sonic boom could be heard as far away as alaska in nearby tonga it sent tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground the eruption cut the internet to tonga leaving friends and family members around the world still anxiously trying to get in touch to

affect tonga s air and water and that authorities were asking people to wear masks and drink bottled water dave snider the tsunami warning coordinator for the national tsunami warning center in palmer alaska said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin and the spectacle was both humbling and scary the tsunami waves caused damage to boats as far away as new

center said waves of 80 centimeters 2 7 feet were detected rachel afeaki taumoepeau who chairs the new zealand tonga business council said she hoped the relatively low level of the tsunami waves would have allowed most people to get to safety although she worried about those living on islands closest to the volcano she said she hadn t yet been able to contact her friends and family in tonga we are

minister jacinda ardern said there had not yet been any official reports of injuries or deaths in tonga but cautioned that authorities hadn t yet made contact with some coastal areas and smaller islands communication with tonga remains very limited and i know that is causing a huge amount of anxiety for the tongan community here ardern said she said there had been significant damage to boats and shops along the tongan coastline the capital nuku alofa was covered in a thick film of volcanic dust ardern said contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need aid agencies said thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water ardern said new zealand was unable to send a military surveillance flight over tonga on sunday because the ash cloud was 63 000 feet 19 000 meters high but they hoped to send the flight on monday followed by supply planes and navy ships one complicating factor to any international aid effort is that

after a remarkably fruitful year in which the stock market shook off rising inflation and coronavirus cases 2022 began with a decline it may be the first in a series of ups and downs as wall street anticipates moves by the federal reserve and copes with the lingering pandemic it will be hard for investors to know what to do as the delta variant gives way to omicron and whatever variants evolve next as for the fed the evolution of its policy is perplexing the markets too recent statements and past behavior by its chair jerome powell suggest it will ramp up the effort to fight inflation then change course if markets become unduly agitated the markets have come to believe that if there s a major correction in the equity market powell will help them out said komal sri kumar president of sri kumar global strategies the result is a seesaw motion in which the market corrects in anticipation of tightening then the fed eases and the market goes up after the s p 500 rose 10 6 in the fourth quarter giving it a 26 9 gain for 2021 the index made a marginal new high as 2022 began then lost ground one reason for the january decline is the release of minutes from the december fed meeting which showed growing discomfort about inflation and included discussion of accelerating the pace of interest rate increases the minutes led some investment banks to forecast four rate increases this year instead of three and an earlier start to the process of selling the trillions of dollars of assets bought in the quantitative easing program but if inflation stays high after a period of tightening sri kumar said the fed will have to maintain that tighter policy however sensitive the markets might be to it failure to do so could risk damaging the economy he said something the markets would be even more sensitive to some investment advisers expect the fed to become consistently hawkish bill hester senior research analyst at hussman strategic advisors said in a commentary on the firm s website that powell had made the case before the pandemic that forceful early action was required when inflation expectations threaten to get out of control the fed may be closer to making that determination than many realize hester said the unemployment rate 3 9 according to december data reported this month is lower than in 2015 at the start of a fed tightening cycle during which the labor market continued to strengthen moreover the labor force has been shrinking as fewer people are working or seeking work which might encourage the fed to think that full employment can be achieved with a higher unemployment rate there is also a benign possibility which rick rieder head of the global asset allocation team at blackrock adheres to in which inflation ebbs on its own some tangible changes will kick in in the second or third quarter he said inventory levels are in really good shape on many goods and we should see some alleviation of pressure on energy prices also helping is that consumer price comparisons with a year earlier will be more favorable simeon hyman global investment strategist at proshares an issuer of exchange traded funds is another inflation optimist he expects fed tightening to succeed and he highlighted snippets of data such as a recent steep drop in the baltic dry index which measures global shipping rates to back his case he anticipates inflation falling to 3 a number that stocks can digest and forecasts s p 500 earnings to rise 10 to 15 this year enough for stocks to do ok stocks did better than ok last year the average domestic stock fund tracked by morningstar rose 6 6 in the fourth quarter and 21 9 on the year although both results lagged the s p 500 considerably a handful of giant technology stocks accounted for much of the market s return but tech funds performed only in line with broad stock portfolios many of the best sector funds focused on financial services and natural resources international stock funds had an ordinary year rising 7 9 including 1 9 in the fourth quarter there were vast differences in results geographically with specialists in europe and india greatly outperforming and latin america and china funds showing losses much of how 2022 unfolds will depend on the coronavirus and the response to it if evidence continues to pile up that omicron is more transmissible than other variants but milder it could show the way out of the pandemic that could be great for society but potentially harmful for investors by removing the virus as a deus ex machina that has helped to make market conditions ideal in response to the coronavirus the fed created trillions of dollars out of thin air congress doled out trillions more and the pandemic provided a tacit guarantee that interest rates wouldn t rise if omicron means a return to regular order investors will have to contend with the highest inflation in a generation record fiscal debt and a fed lacking a reason not to tackle inflation forcefully at the same time stocks and bonds are very expensive limiting prudent investment options there s no place to hide melda mergen global head of equities at columbia threadneedle investments said during a presentation of the firm s 2022 outlook most of the markets are at the top of the bar in their current valuations she remains bullish toward stocks but emphasizes pockets that are less expensive such as smaller companies and value stocks she noted though that the valuation gap between growth and value stocks has narrowed so the pickings are slimmer other investment advisers also recommend looking for less overpriced market segments but they differ on where to find them sri kumar likes european stocks more than american ones and he would buy emerging markets such as india that do not depend on strong growth in china where he foresees growing risk in 2022 ian mortimer a co manager of the guinness atkinson global innovators fund suggests owning quality defensives stocks in industries that feature rising dividends some examples are british american tobacco imperial brands which also sells tobacco and insurance company aflac for hyman the view for stocks is a lot better than the view for bonds he said the financial energy and materials industries tend to do well when interest rates rise if stocks do better than bonds in 2022 it will mean more of the same for fund owners the average bond fund was flat in the fourth quarter and up 1 for all of 2021 the standout niches each returning about 5 on the year held bank loans and high yield bonds rieder favors such diverse assets as carmakers shares investment grade corporate bonds and stocks in indonesia and colombia although he broadly prefers american markets to foreign ones he predicts low double digit gains for the s p 500 but he tempers his optimism with concern that inflation might not abate and that the fed has instilled a sense of complacency in the markets that s going to make their job a lot harder from here he said adding if they waited too long and have to brake hard on the other side it will cause the markets to go down hard
an australian born in 2019 can expect to live to about 83 some 34 years longer than people born in the 1880s in japan the average age expectancy is just over 84 today about one in seven australians are 65 or older by 2057 it ll be almost one in four australia has one of the highest life expectancies ranking ninth among oecd countries behind switzerland iceland italy norway japan sweden israel and spain ageing is universal but not uniform it s universal because it happens in all cells and all species but it s not uniform in that we don t all go through it in the same way professor byles says ageing is intrinsic to the living species on this planet but how we grow old and the factors that influence the process are complex and unpredictable being human and living our lives is all about change and that s what ageing is it s change over time says professor julie byles a social gerontologist and researcher at newcastle university it s a fact that many of us don t want to face with every tick of the clock every one of us is ageing it feels scary but it needn t add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time our cognitive processes peak about the time we re 20 in fact most of our body s systems are thought to peak when we are between 18 and 30 says leon flicker a professor of geriatric medicine at the university of western australia that seems to be when the ageing process starts kicking in and you have a progressive decline flicker says it s happening all your life it starts even before you re born from the very first cell division says byles that s because ageing comes down to a gradual accumulation of problems starting with tiny dna transcription errors from the very beginning while most people don t start feeling the effects until at least their 30s the seeds of ageing start when we do can we slow ageing how does it happen and how can ageism be a form of self sabotage we may feel more empowered to make those extra years as fulfilling and meaningful as possible if we understand how ageing happens that it s a lifelong process not just some switch that gets flicked in your 60s says peter lange a university of melbourne clinical associate professor in geriatrics there is a lot of nihilism about ageing and a lot of people think that disease is inevitable that they ll go into a nursing home or develop dementia that s not true but by believing it s going to be the case they end up failing to take action to prevent it he says as the world health organisation says with good health a longer life brings opportunities to pursue new activities a long neglected passion or even a fresh career there are certain hallmarks of ageing on a molecular and cellular level for example gregorevic says we collect damage in our dna one way is that each time our cells divide the little protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes called telomeres which are often likened to the plastic tips on shoelaces gradually shorten which affects our ability to copy dna properly the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same says dr kate gregorevic royal melbourne hospital geriatrician and author of staying alive the science of living healthier happier and longer the changes we experience as we age are neither linear nor consistent and there is an extraordinary level of variability among older people the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same but over time our physiological reserves drop so we re left accumulating damage that our body gradually can t keep up with fixing and this can manifest in all sorts of ways it s happening throughout every second of our existence says flicker ageing is not programmed though as we move through the world we suffer little bits of damage it could be from sunlight bacteria a sprained ankle a shonky dna copy bad food that the body then works to repair if you re frail says gregorevic your body is already working so hard at the best of times just to get through daily life so when you get a cold it takes all your energy the pile up of all these changes gradually increases our vulnerability to disease or insults such as a seemingly minor fall leading to bone fracture and eventually leads to frailty which is a loss of physical reserve that affects almost everybody by their 90s at the same time bone density drops while ligaments and joints stiffen becoming more at risk of injury and taking longer to heal also common are weakening lungs our cardiovascular system is impacted and there are certain hormonal changes with people exposed to a higher level of cortisol the stress hormone as they age muscle loss or sarcopenia is another typical part of ageing one study observed that muscle mass decreased between about 3 and 8 per cent each decade after age 30 and the rate of decline was higher after 60 we know that with age we can lose muscle strength gregorevic says particularly we lose fast twitch muscle fibres they re the ones you use when sprinting or when you catch your foot on the pavement and need to steady yourself fast then there are the changes we often notice from our 40s says lange skin loses elasticity hair turns grey as pigment cells in our follicles slowly die we become long sighted as the lenses of our eyes stiffen in some people hearing dulls when dna is damaged over time more cells can die or become cancerous more cells also become what s called senescent they stop dividing on the one hand this defends against cancer but these senescent cells also take up space without contributing causing inflammation and overstimulating the immune system which can t keep up with removing them still while everyone s reserves decrease with age we aren t all similarly susceptible to disease some of us lange says have higher baseline defences so even though someone may have pathologies such as hypertension and mini strokes both of which are linked to dementia they won t necessarily develop a form of the disease flicker says cancer is more common as people age partly because the body s surveillance system becomes less likely to spot and destroy bad cells we are more at risk of diabetes in part because our body becomes less efficient at converting glucose to energy and requires more insulin in 2014 15 almost three quarters of australians aged 65 and over reported they had good or very good health according to the australian institute of health and welfare but disease is more common in older people in 2015 cancer and cardiovascular disease were the most prevalent followed by dementia type 2 diabetes chronic lung disease and osteoarthritis many of these illnesses are also the biggest killers there s a lot of confusion between the implicit processes of ageing and diseases associated with getting old says lange a good example is our minds as brain tissue gradually decreases with age it s normal for our memory to shift to become slower and less efficient but forgetting entirely and suffering from significant impairment is not universal it s a symptom of dementia which is itself an umbrella term for many diseases what difference does the life you ve led make to ageing there s a cheeky saying in gerontology says byles if you want to age well pick your parents being born with as few dna errors as possible gives you a good headstart in life aspects such as a good education financial security and access to nutritious food in childhood add to your stocks you can be already on an un level playing field depending on what your early life is like byles says if you get to older age and you re big and strong with a healthy brain good education a strong immune system they all go into your reserve you can maybe cope with having not as strong muscles or a decline in condition because you have all these other things that support you a quarter of how we age is determined by genetics according to the world health organisation and the rest comes down to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors more than a third 38 per cent of the burden of disease in older australians was preventable in 2015 according to the australian institute of health and welfare smoking poor diet being overweight or obese and high blood pressure were key contributors covid 19 lockdowns which limited exercise and socialising have underlined just how important lifestyle is in ageing lange says the months in lockdown in victoria had devastating impacts on physical and cognitive function for older people there are other factors outside our control being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today aunty geraldine atkinson at the launch of the yoo rrook justice commission in 2021 credit simon schluter social disadvantage is a big one a 2020 study of 5000 britons found that lower socioeconomic status led to an accelerated decline in ageing the researchers pointed out that the rich tended to have for example better access to parks and fitness centres as well as mentally stimulating activities social clubs the arts which all helped bolster physical and mental function meanwhile those living in poverty usually experienced more life stresses which affected health and they could also be exposed to more environmental pollution loading this disparity in ageing is reflected in australian government policy subsidies for aged care services usually kick in at 65 but indigenous australians torres strait islanders and the homeless are at higher risk of health issues and financial inequality so are eligible at 50 or 45 if they are both indigenous and homeless the life expectancy of indigenous australians is about eight years less than for non indigenous australians aunty geraldine atkinson a bangerang woman and co chair of the first peoples assembly of victoria says more must be done to support healthy ageing in aboriginal communities being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today she says credit illustration dionne gain so can we delay ageing much research is being done to find a magic anti ageing pill but there is no strong evidence at the moment that supplements or medications work scientists are trying to find treatments that could lengthen telomeres for example or remove senescent cells via drugs or gene editing in the hope these could slow ageing the medical community is keeping a close eye on clinical trials underway to determine the effects of the drug metformin which is normally prescribed to manage blood sugar in diabetics but has shown broader age targeting potential research previously suggested diabetic people who took the drug outlived non diabetics who didn t and it has been found to delay ageing in mice although in high quantities it was toxic the american federation for aging research is examining whether it can also prevent heart disease cancer and dementia still any geriatrician will tell you a balanced diet and regular exercise are key to supporting healthy ageing and in turn a longer life stimulating your mind also helps minimise disease risk gregorevic says just like our muscles use it or lose it our brains are like that as well she says one of the best things you can do for healthy ageing is just to keep having a go at things not brain training but staying engaged in life socialising learning new skills learning a language it s never too early or too late to start byles encourages people to start planning for old age when young if you re not doing it by your 50s she says that s when you must ask yourself where do i go from here what do i want to protect in terms of bodily social and mental functions make changes that will maintain your wellbeing and keep you pushing your capacity to do things you enjoy the aptly named professor norman lazarus laid out why he considered exercise eating well and mental health a trinity in his book from 2020 the lazarus strategy how to age well and wisely the king s college london physician and researcher overhauled his lifestyle in his 50s to become a champion cyclist at 66 an age he said he expected to start having difficulty getting out of a chair or opening jars at 86 he still cycles trains at the gym walks with his wife watches his diet and works at the university at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality norman lazarus 86 kickstarted his healthy lifestyle when he was 50 credit liz seabrook lazarus encourages people to first accept they are going to get old and then change their lifestyle to truly enjoy the journey of ageing and retain their independence at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality he says the trick is to prioritise things you love so you stick to them he says while he and his wife now walk on flatter gentler trails instead of on multi day hikes for example they still relish the time together he even uses the term exercise deficiency diseases to emphasise how key physical activity is a comprehensive study in 2015 found 26 common illnesses could be positively affected by exercise including cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity dementia osteoarthritis osteoporosis and some cancers the most effective anti ageing option we have is exercise lange says it produces beneficial effects for pretty much everything we ve ever looked at exercise improves muscle strength balance bone density and the immune cardiovascular and respiratory systems it boosts mood and supports brain and spinal health too getting out and being active with people is important for cognitive stimulation and by stressing the body you re also getting it used to dealing with small perturbations lange says just a small amount of activity can make a meaningful difference and resistance training is particularly important he has seen this transform once bedbound patients in their 80s and 90s he encourages people to introduce incidental movement into their day carry your shopping bags instead of wheeling a trolley walk instead of drive or tend to your garden even if you have the healthiest exercise diet and social regimen in the world though you could still suffer from disease when older or younger for that matter the harsh reality is that no matter what you do you re going to die and you can live the perfect lifestyle and still get cancer nothing is certain gregorevic says it s why we must be careful not to judge people for the condition they re in when they re older byles points out that people with certain illnesses such as diabetes or lung disease often get blamed some of it is preventable but not all of it some of it is by virtue of the fact you ve been around a long time and have had a lot of chances to accumulate a problem she says why does ageism matter part of the reason people don t notice their own ageing is because the changes are far too subtle flicker says and people don t actually think they re changing with age their vision of self is deeply ingrained byles adds i have a theory that everyone thinks they re 30 you have a concept of yourself so we always think we re younger which is great but then we can get a shock she believes part of this is our own ageism where we value our youth as more relevant indeed we live in a culture that glorifies youth the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people in australia s 2021 royal commission into aged care quality and safety commissioner lynelle briggs found that ageism was systemic in australia the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people assumptions and stereotypes about older people and their capabilities and ageism towards them this must change she wrote and a world health organisation global survey of more than 83 000 people found that one in two had ageist attitudes one of the great tragedies of ageism is that people internalise it and develop a negative bias against their older selves gregorevic says one common example of self sabotage is that while young exercisers crave feeling out of breath many older people doubting their capabilities take it to mean they should avoid being active lange says that s exercise and it s getting you used to those challenging activities and the next time you get sick and need some extra heart and lung function it ll be there it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit the idea that older people are incapable of using technology is another misconception and professor linda rosenman board member of the australian association of gerontology says debates about retirement age generate another myth i think it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old rosenman says this is just the age that people become eligible for government pensions there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit not all australian communities suffer from ageism it seems not right foreign kind of says aunty geraldine explaining that indigenous communities focus not on what s lost with age but instead on the wisdom that s gained it s an approach she thinks the rest of the country could learn from loading in aboriginal culture an elder is someone recognised for their knowledge and ongoing contribution to their community and they are not neglected they are traditionally referred to as aunty or uncle we always respect and value our elders respect their cultural authority respect the stories they told us and that gets passed down aunty geraldine says you become an aunty not just to your bloodline but to other younger people as well it s different in other countries too when you re in beijing and you go for a walk to parks they re full of older people doing tai chi dancing there s no sense that i m too old to do that byles says byles who helped create the anti ageism every age counts campaign says people could be enjoying life more as they age ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it she says credit illustration dionne gain what do you gain as you age the fact is we do typically become happier as we age with research showing older people tend to have brighter moods and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than younger counterparts byles says it s possible this is because older people largely do things that bring them satisfaction you can t do all the things you used to do so you are actually focusing on things that are more important to you she says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom plus she says we often care less about what other people think which can be really liberating and there is a sense of contentedness that comes from understanding with time where you and the puzzle pieces of your life fit people keep improving their vocabulary well into their 60s and 70s and while brain speed and working memory peak in early life this doesn t make 20 year olds equipped mentally to run the country older people have what s termed crystalline intelligence flicker says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom reflecting on her own life rosenman considers herself to have become more patient and tolerant and she enjoys having more time you re not trying to climb the greasy pole yourself any more and you re much more ready to mentor and help other people she says in many ways life is a lot more enjoyable than when you were racing off to work and herding the kids grandchildren are a big bonus ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it professor julie byles says we should start planning for getting old at least by our 50s credit peter stoop how do you deal with the fear of nearing the end of your life there is of course an existential aspect to ageing that can be quite difficult lange says i ve met patients who have lived too long and have outlived their partners and friends and even sometimes their own children and they have increasing physical disability and sensory limitations but lange says most people reach a point where they no longer fear dying people usually accept it will come which is quite freeing lange encourages people to focus on ageing well rather than fixating on the idea that getting older means they re approaching death which is only one moment at the very end of a life journey flicker agrees i think people eventually realise that if you re not dead yet then maybe life is to be lived and really you should try to enjoy the living as much as you can no matter what is happening at the time loading and it s up to all of us to talk to each other to help reframe the way we view our older years as the aged care royal commission report outlined there are everyday things that all of us can do to enable older people to live their lives to the fullest extent possible older people should also be encouraged to think about what it is that would make them happy and to have some goals or objectives for each day or week that give purpose while many people worry they will end up in a nursing home the reality is most australians do not the same report says about 80 per cent of australians use an aged care program at some stage before their death but for most this means at home support nobody is saying the last years can t be difficult you can be faced with losing people you love while also dealing with your own debilitating health problems but the vast majority of people will be healthy enough to live independently for most of their life gregorevic says we need to remember that life is finite and in a way that that s a real gift like all of us lazarus feels taken aback when he sees his older face in the mirror but says there isn t any age that he wishes to be frozen in i m not sure where i put myself i see this old man and i see myself but do i wish i were 20 again not really he says i can t place myself in any decade because i ve really

one year ago on thursday joe biden took the oath of office as the 46th president at the us capitol in an inauguration ceremony devoid of the usual crowds due to pandemic restrictions biden identified four crises facing america the coronavirus the climate the economy and racial justice he could have added a fifth a crisis of democracy in a divided nation where just two weeks earlier the capitol had been overrun by insurrectionists how has he fared on all five counts coronavirus biden took office pledging to lift the threat of the coronavirus pandemic which he called a raging virus that silently stalks the country and there was a period of his presidency when it appeared he had last summer vaccination rates soared as the virus receded and the economy rebounded touting the administration s progress at an independence day celebration biden declared that the us was closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus but then came the arrival of the delta variant followed by the extremely transmissible omicron variant biden rushed once again to restrict travel but it did little to slow the spread in recent weeks covid 19 cases have reached record levels deaths are rising nationally and the number of americans hospitalized with the disease is higher now than at any previous point during the pandemic long lines to obtain covid tests and low availability of at home tests have sparked criticism of the white house s preparedness while shifting guidelines and muddled messaging from federal public health officials left a disease weary public confused and frustrated public confidence in biden s handling of the pandemic has dropped significantly weighing down his overall approval ratings biden responded by ordering 1bn at home coronavirus tests and is requiring private insurance companies to cover the cost of up to eight of these tests a month biden also announced plans to make high quality masks available to americans free of charge and deployed military medical units to help hospitals overwhelmed by a shortage of staff and beds leveraging the defense production act the administration is working with pharmaceutical companies to increase the supply of antiviral pills view image in fullscreen a covid testing site in los angeles this week the omicron variant has set back progress made in tackling the coronavirus photograph joe kohen rex shutterstock more than 200 million americans are fully vaccinated with nearly 77 million receiving a booster shot efforts to improve vaccination rates continue to be undermined by partisanship and misinformation and a ruling by the supreme court this week blocked the biden administration from enforcing a vaccine or test mandate for large businesses though it allowed a vaccine mandate for most healthcare workers to take effect in response to the latest wave the biden administration has shifted its rhetoric and its expectations dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease specialist said the omicron variant would find just about everybody warning that the unvaccinated risk far worse outcomes climate in his inaugural address biden promised to heed the planet s cry for survival by marshalling an unprecedented response to the climate crisis but his ambitious plans have since collided with the reality of an evenly divided senate where a coal state senator s opposition has thwarted major pieces of the president s climate agenda with potentially dire consequences for the planet at the international talks in glasgow last year biden pledged the us would slash its greenhouse gas emissions in half compared with 2005 levels by the end of this decade but failure to enact the president s build back better legislation would make it nearly impossible for the us to meet that target the roughly 2tn proposal would amount to the nation s largest ever investment in combatting climate change and contains a suite of tax incentives grants and other policies that would grow the green energy sector and invest in sustainable vehicles and public transport services without it the biden administration would be forced to rely on a raft of environmental regulations and rules that could be overturned by future presidents throughout the first year of his presidency biden has made climate change a priority elevating climate advocates to key posts creating a white house office of domestic policy and appointing john kerry as the special presidential envoy for climate which he made a cabinet level position in april he convened a summit to pressure world leaders to make stronger commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reassert us leadership on the global stage view image in fullscreen a house is engulfed in flames in boulder county colorado last month as the wildfire season grows longer photograph boulder police department zuma press wire service rex shutterstock biden used his executive authority to quickly reverse many of former president donald trump s energy and environmental policies starting with his first day in office when he moved to rejoin the paris climate accords in november biden signed into law a 1tn bipartisan infrastructure bill that provides billions of dollars to make communities more resilient to climate fueled disasters but did little to reduce planet warming emissions at the international talks last year the us played a major role in negotiations over global efforts to fight climate change though the final agreement disappointed activists and some world leaders this is the challenge of our collective lifetimes an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases biden said in glasgow yet the coming weeks and months will be critical for biden s climate goals and his legacy the president s build back better legislation is doomed without senator joe manchin s support and it remains unclear if negotiations can be revived next month the supreme court will hear a case brought by republican led states and coal companies that could significantly restrict the administration s power to regulate carbon emissions driving climate change and if republicans gain control of congress in this year s midterm elections action on climate change could stall potentially for years economy it is the best of times and the worst of times the white house ended 2021 pointing to jobless claims at a 50 year low a stock market smashing records and an economy among the fastest growing in the world on the positive side 6 4m jobs have been added under biden the most of any first year president in history when he took office the unemployment rate was 6 3 today it is 3 9 the lowest yet of the pandemic consumer demand is strong helping the economy grow by an estimated 7 in the final quarter of 2021 although the omicron variant which has ravaged airlines and restaurants is likely to cause a slowdown wages are also up with a record wave of people quitting their jobs

of its pre pandemic level many employers are struggling to fill positions and many people are reluctant to return to the workforce most dauntingly inflation climbed to 7 in 2021 the biggest 12 month gain for 40 years while supply chain problems left some supermarket shelves bare this prompted a barrage of republican criticism and fed a feeling of economic malaise whatever the reality allan lichtman a distinguished professor of history at american university in washington said the economy is actually better than the perception unemployment is down to 3 9 many millions of jobs were created and you re going to get inflation under those circumstances but the message hasn t gotten out everybody thinks biden s done a poor job frank luntz a republican pollster and strategist instead argues that biden overpromised the entire economy is seizing up and people do blame biden because he was trumpeting how successful he had been he said don t do that racial justice president biden met with some of the civil rights leadership and we reminded him you said the night you won that black america had your back and that you were going to have black america s back activist al sharpton told a voting rights rally in august well mr president they re stabbing us in the back biden is yet to fulfil his promise but he has met some of his commitments to embed racial equity in policy the early 1 9tn coronavirus relief package included 5bn for black farmers the most important legislation for this group since the civil rights act of 1964 biden named a historically diverse administration that includes in interior secretary deb haaland the first native american to serve as a cabinet secretary kamala harris is the first woman of colour to serve as vice president though she has been handed intractable problems to solve and her approval rating is even lower than biden s but police reform efforts have stalled biden abandoned a campaign promise to create a national police oversight

banner he displayed during a march in support of racial justice last year as he poses for a photo in washington in may 2021 photograph andrew kelly reuters most dramatically the president s lobbying efforts have failed to deliver on protecting voting rights for people of colour national legislation aimed at blunting republican led state efforts to impose voter restrictions has stalled in the senate where a 50 50 split between democrats and republicans leaves no margin for error democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema have declared their opposition to reform of a procedural rule known as the filibuster a necessary step for passing the legislation biden is accused by critics of doing too little too late failing to use his bully pulpit to give the issue the same priority as his bipartisan infrastructure law in a sign of the disappointment and exasperation when biden travelled to atlanta this week to make his most aggressive case yet for filibuster reform some campaigners boycotted the event charles blow a columnist for the new york times wrote for a year activists have been screaming and pleading and begging and getting arrested trying to get the white house to put the full weight of the presidency behind protecting voting rights only to be met by silence or soft pedaling he added when biden fully entered the battle the other warriors were already bloody bruised and exhausted democracy in his inaugural address biden proclaimed we have learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile and at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed restoring the soul of the nation he added requires that most elusive of things in a democracy unity nearly a year later back at the us capitol biden struck a very different and more pugnacious tone i will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy he vowed signaling a belated realisation that instead of repairing the breach with republicans he must now stand in it and fight biden who had run for election as an apostle of bipartisanship and did get a win with republican support for a 1tn infrastructure law but the radicalised opposition party remains implacably opposed to legislation that would codify national protections for voting rights see above republicans remain in the iron grip of trump his big lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and the delusion that the january 6 insurrection was inconsequential or even a righteous cause trump acolytes and election deniers are now seeking office as secretaries of state and other positions that would put them

electoral process tony evers the democratic governor of wisconsin told the guardian last month at the state level we re raising hell about it but the democrats on the national level are talking about

the economic outlook has materially changed since this column advised readers to sell resources company bhp in april last year since then inflation has surged to a 40 year high in america and reached its highest level in britain since 2008 as a result resources stocks could now be of far greater value to investors because of the positive historical relationship between inflation and commodity prices america s central bank the federal reserve recently raised its inflation forecast for this year meanwhile the bank of england believes inflation will continue to rise before it peaks in april separately environmental social and governance investing has become increasingly popular among professional and private investors bhp s evolving strategy focuses to a greater extent on fulfilling likely future demand for the raw materials at the centre of the decarbonisation electrification and world population growth mega trends the firm is in the process of selling its petroleum assets to woodside bhp shareholders are expected to own 48pc of the merged business in questor s view the merger will allow bhp to concentrate on other commodities in order to strengthen its appeal among esg focused investors for example its core activities will include the production of iron ore which is used to make steel required in the construction of renewable energy assets copper and nickel which are essential raw materials for electric vehicles and potash which is used as fertiliser to improve crop yields since it last featured in this column the firm has also announced its intention to end its dual listed company structure for efficiency reasons while the firm s shares would drop out of the ftse 100 if a unification of its corporate structure went ahead they would continue to trade on the london stock exchange however some things about the company have not changed since our advice to sell notably it still enjoys a very strong financial position in fact its net debt declined from 8 8bn to 3bn during the 2021 financial year this means it now has a net debt to equity ratio of just 7pc while interest cover the ratio of profits to the interest bill of 20 suggests it enjoys considerable financial headroom should the world economy s growth rate deteriorate in addition the firm continues to offer a relatively attractive yield certainly its future dividends are closely linked to commodity prices which are always highly volatile however a yield of 9 3pc indicates that even if shareholder payouts were reduced the stock would remain an attractive income proposition compared with the wider market bhp s valuation is also appealing the shares trade on an adjusted price to earnings ratio of just 9 6 at a time when unearthing companies trading at a discount to their intrinsic value has become more challenging and with the global economy forecast to grow at an annualised rate of 3 7pc over the next five years according to the imf its long term prospects appear to be sound

wellington new zealand the tsunami threat around the pacific from a huge undersea volcanic eruption began to recede sunday while the extent of damage to tonga remained unclear satellite images showed the spectacular eruption that took place saturday evening with a plume of ash steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue pacific waters a sonic boom could be heard as far away as alaska in

thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water ardern said new zealand was unable to send a military surveillance flight over tonga on sunday because the ash cloud was 19 000 meters high but they hoped to send the flight on monday followed by supply planes and navy ships one complicating factor to any international aid effort is that tonga has so

the most successful u s network airline is poised for a sharp recovery once the omicron wave of the covid 19 pandemic passes on thursday delta air lines dal 0 45 reported a small adjusted profit for the final quarter of 2021 that said the company lost 395 million before tax under generally accepted accounting principles gaap mainly due to losses on its investments in various airline partners additionally delta projected that it will post another loss in the first quarter of 2022 notwithstanding this near term turbulence delta s management expressed confidence that the airline will earn a meaningful profit in 2022 indeed the earnings report included several bright spots that bode well for a strong recovery over the next few years the pandemic continues to take a toll six months ago delta air lines thought that it had put its pandemic related losses in the rearview mirror the company projected that it would be profitable throughout the second half of 2021 and beyond unfortunately the delta and omicron covid 19 variants have disrupted the airline s recovery trajectory while passenger volumes have continued to recover many large companies have postponed or reversed their return to office timelines that in turn has negatively impacted business travel demand and business travelers typically pay higher average fares than leisure travelers costs are rising too driven by surging fuel prices and other inflationary pressures delta still managed to post adjusted profits in the third and fourth quarters but profitability didn t recover as robustly as it might have hoped for q4 it reported adjusted pre tax income of 170 million adjusted revenue fell 26 from the fourth quarter of 2019 to 8 4 billion looking ahead to the first quarter though delta expects to fall back into the red the rapid spread of the omicron variant has caused the demand recovery to pause again in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter cost pressures from high fuel prices operational disruptions and lower asset utilization will also weigh on the bottom line plenty of reasons for optimism despite the downbeat first quarter outlook delta s management continues to expect a sharp recovery starting this spring part of that confidence rests on the belief that the current wave of the pandemic may be the last one before covid 19 transitions to a relatively stable endemic state but aside from that hope delta s earnings report contained several promising details first remuneration from credit card partner american express decisively surpassed pre pandemic levels last quarter reaching 1 2 billion up 11 from two years earlier that lends credence to the company s projection that the amex partnership will generate over 5 billion of high margin revenue in 2022 and 7 billion by 2024 compared to 4 billion in 2019 second demand for premium seats continues to recover faster than the main cabin for short haul routes this is particularly impressive given that business travel still remains depressed relative to leisure travel and it suggests that delta s efforts to differentiate its products and earn a sustainable revenue premium are succeeding third cargo revenue continues to accelerate jumping 63 in the fourth quarter relative to q4 2019 some of this increase may not be sustainable in the long run as supply chains recover from the pandemic but in the near term cargo is poised to provide meaningful incremental revenue compared to 2019 a bargain stock at its investor day last month delta air lines set a target of growing adjusted earnings per share eps to more than 7 by 2024 in line with its 2019 performance on over 50 billion of revenue the company also aims to restore its balance sheet to investment grade metrics and generate over 4 billion of annual free cash flow by then obviously hitting these numbers will depend on the pandemic ending and international borders fully reopening before 2024 still the return to revenue and cash flow growth from the amex partnership rising premium cabin demand and continued growth in cargo revenue all bode well for delta s ability to achieve or even exceed these targets delta shares currently trade for around 40 less than six times the company s 2024 eps estimate considering the airline s potential for further earnings growth beyond 2024 as it progresses toward its long term fleet simplification goals delta air lines stock could double if the company hits its targets that makes it a great bargain stock for long term value investors
