example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video just before nightfall entergy new orleans had not restored power to several neighborhoods the company promised would be back online by the end of the day new orleans finally able to take full stock of the damage caused by hurricane ida entergy louisiana s ceo called it one of the most devastating storms ever for the utility s ravaged infrastructure incredibly the number of poles damaged or destroyed is already more than we saw in louisiana from katrina zeta and delta combined by a large margin may said saturday the damage totals are staggering more than 22 000 power poles nearly 26 000 spans of wire and more than 5 000 transformers knocked over broken or destroyed places that took a direct hit from hurricane ida saw the biggest power system damage and entergy s restoration estimates for those areas called for weeks more without power in st john the baptist st james and tangipahoa parishes residents won t have power fully restored until sept 17 entergy said and in coastal jefferson lower plaquemines and throughout terrebonne lafourche and st charles parishes customers are likely must wait over three weeks until sept 29 some get power sooner than promised some later just before nightfall saturday entergy new orleans had not been able to restore power to several neighborhoods the company promised would be back online by the end of the day and although several new orleans neighborhoods were restored earlier than expected on wednesday thursday and friday frustration in the city was high after entergy provided shifting explanations for why it did not use a new gas fired power plant in new orleans east to generate electricity without waiting for power from the regional grid nops can generate 128 megawatts about 10 percent of the total needed to power the whole city moreno opposes paying for entergy repairs by raising rates city councilwoman helena moreno sent a letter to entergy new orleans ceo deanna rodriguez on saturday afternoon asking for reports on how the city can help the utility get federal and state aid to help cover its restoration costs but making it clear that the city council which regulates the monopoly power company would not support passing on those costs to customers moreno said a storm reserve fund set up after hurricane katrina has a balance of 39 million and is intended to help defray costs from a disaster on saturday afternoon entergy louisiana also released estimated restoration times for specific areas of jefferson parish the maps indicated crews would likely restore power on sunday to areas expanding out from hospitals and other critical infrastructure that were already restored by saturday morning outage map has issues but entergy s outage map was a source of more frustration it showed some areas getting power back even though residents there reported they still had no electricity may and rodriguez both acknowledged the map was not reliable and directed customers to a separate web page to track estimated restoration times or to text stat to 36778 for a status update for their specific address some customers also came home to find power back on their street but not in their house hawkins said customers will have to hire an electrician if the equipment on their house including the electric meter and weatherhead the metal tube that carries electric conduit up to the roof are damaged if entergy s service line from the pole to the house is broken that s entergy s responsibility but those kinds of single point repairs could take a while hawkins said about 300 000 of more than 900 000 entergy customers who lost power at the height of the storm did have their power back on saturday entergy said most of those with their lights back were in the heavily populated areas of baton rouge new orleans jefferson parish and st bernard parish we ve made great progress repairing transmission lines and the substations rodriguez said and this is the backbone for power delivery to customers this has to be in place for power delivery to the distribution system the key to that was repairing and restoring six of the eight high voltage transmission lines that feed outside grid power to southeast louisiana all of which failed during the storm one of those pathways included a 400 foot tall rusty tower in avondale that collapsed into a gnarled heap and caused a 3 800 foot high voltage line to drape into the mississippi river entergy had to hire a contractor to detonate charges to bring down those lines from the tower on the other side of the river in harahan to clear the wires and allow river traffic to pass safely again progress on restoring transmission lines entergy

surprise surprise on sept 4 2021 four days after the surface transportation board slammed the door shut on the cn kansas city southern voting trust effectively killing the proposed merger of the two class i s the kcs board of directors has unanimously determined after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that the unsolicited proposal received from canadian pacific on aug 31 2021 to acquire kcs in a cash and stock transaction valued by cp at 300 per kcs share could reasonably be expected to lead to a company superior proposal as defined in kcs s merger agreement with cn kcs said it now intends to provide cp with nonpublic information and to engage in discussions and negotiations with cp with respect to cp s proposal subject in each case to the requirements of the cn merger agreement kcs remains bound by the terms of the cn merger agreement and kcs s board has not determined that cp s proposal in fact constitutes a company superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement with cn in addition kcs notes that there can be no assurance that the discussions with cp will result in a transaction on the heels of a stinging rebuke of the cn transaction by the stb kcs s board took the steps necessary to reengage with cp comments cowen and company managing director and railway age wall street contributing editor jason seidl while kcs is still bound to cn the likelihood of that transaction closing appears slim we continue to believe that cp will be the ultimate merger partner for kcs recall that the cp offer at the time was valued at 300 and more important received voting trust approval from the stb while we await a potential rebuttal from cn we do see a scenario where they sweeten the offer we believe it is in cn s best interest to walk away from the deal given the clear messaging from the stb kcs has until sept 12 to make a decision on the cp offer and will then have its shareholder votes scheduled for sept 24 we believe it is in cn s best interest to walk away from the deal given the clear messaging from the stb jason seidl canadian pacific responded to kcs by saying it is ready to re engage with the kcs board of directors we look forward to re engaging with the kcs board of directors to advance this unique and achievable class i combination that provides compelling short and long term value said cp president and ceo and railway age 2021 railroader of the year keith creel cp kcs is the only truly end to end class i merger that preserves and enhances competition it is the perfect combination and we are ready to go to work to unlock this unique opportunity creating something special for the rail industry and for commerce in north america cp had reaffirmed its offer originally submitted aug 10 and resubmitted aug 31 to combine with kcs that recognizes the premium value of kcs while providing regulatory certainty cp believes it ought to be deemed a superior proposal and has placed a deadline of sept 12 on that offer the proposed transaction values kcs at 300 per share representing a 34 premium based on the cp closing price on august 9 2021 and kcs unaffected closing price on friday march 19 2021 the last business day prior to cp and kcs announcing their original deal on sunday march 21 2021 following the closing into a voting trust which the stb approved on common shareholders of kcs will receive 2 884 cp common shares and 90 in cash for each share of kcs common stock held the proposed transaction includes the assumption of 3 8 billion of outstanding kcs debt in addition to approving cp s use of a voting trust the stb has also affirmed cp kcs s waiver from the new rail merger rules it adopted in 2001 because a cp kcs combination is truly end to end and pro competitive the combined railroads would most likely revert to their original plan in terms of organizational structure including use of the canadian pacific kansas city cpkc name revisiting key elements canadian pacific took the opportunity to restate what it says are the merger s key benefits a cp kcs combination would create more competition not less in the freight rail industry and would be better for amtrak it brings more competition among railways and protects obligations to passenger service it offers all the same benefits and more to rail shippers and the supply chain with none of cn kcs harms or need to enforce promises through regulation creates single line routes to all the markets that a cn kcs network would reach brings new competition to and from upper midwest markets dominated by bnsf or union pacific that cn kcs cannot address creates new competition vs cn that cn kcs actually eliminates has a route network that does not funnel all of its traffic through the congested chicago area unlocks new capacity for amtrak passenger service rather than interfering with passenger service between baton rouge and new orleans and south of chicago cp kcs would enhance competition create new and stronger competitive single line options against existing single line routes while taking trucks off the highway cp kcs would maintain all existing freight rail gateways and maintain competition in the baton

salem back when linda swanson was a kid growing up in salem in the 1960s it was rare to see anyone drive by the house that she didn t recognize i think there might have been only eight or so that came by in a whole day she said now they just fly by the swansons were at the forefront of the population boom that spanned the 1960s to the early 2000s as new residents escaped more congested locales and made the town a regional leader in population growth swanson said the family moved to scott hill road from noank when she was 5 years old so her parents could tend the fields and her brothers could ride their own horse on the 8 acre farm data from the u s census bureau shows there were 925 residents who called salem home in 1960 by 2010 the 29 square miles of rolling hills and forests encompassed 4 151 inhabitants it s a trend that has slowed according to the most recent census numbers to a 1 increase in the past 10 years data also show salem s population has gotten significantly older and while home sales have remained relatively steady new home construction as evidenced by construction permit numbers has dropped considerably the boom nan winans was a single mother when she moved to town from mystic in 1975 she said she was looking for good schools and recreation when she settled on a house near gardner lake with well regarded norwich free academy as the designated high school she said she came to salem because she could not afford to purchase a comparable house in mystic i was told that the population was 1 800 and was not likely to increase much because the town was built on ledge and had a high water table she said so much for that in a 1985 report from the day then first selectman hugh c teel was surprised to find the small town had become the fastest growing town in new london county i knew we were growing fast but i didn t know it was that fast he said at the time officials through the years have attributed much of that growth to city dwellers who retreated here after tiring of the crowds it s in a good position geographically for workers who commute to major employment centers in hartford norwich and new london then town planner gerhard j amt said in 1993 there also are an awful lot of lots approved in subdivisions that are available there is still the potential for significant continued growth then there s route 11 it turns out the so called highway to nowhere might have helped make someplace out of salem after all current salem planning and zoning chairman vernon smith noted the late 20th century population boom might correlate with the completion of route 11 or at least route 11 ending in salem he corrected himself god knows route 11 is not completed the highway was proposed in the 1950s as a relocation of route 85 a former wagon trail to forge a quicker route between hartford and new london the 16 mile expressway was to connect route 2 in colchester to an area near the present day interstates 95 and 395 interchange in waterford but there was only enough money to build a 7 5 mile portion of the highway through the woods from colchester to salem it opened in 1972 dumping drivers unceremoniously onto route 82 among the weeds in a 1993 article in the day route 11 was identified as the town s link to the hartford labor market and a factor in the roughly 40 population increase from 10 years prior census data show population numbers over the past several decades went from a 17 increase in 2000 to 8 in 2010 to the current 1 increase yet salem remains one of only three towns in the county along with ledyard and preston that grew at all over the past decade overall the county s population dropped by 2 david bingham a former member of the planning and zoning commission for more than three decades and the founder of the salem land trust pointed to a lack of housing options as one factor slowing the town s growth he said developers hurt when the housing bubble burst in 2008 since have been hesitant to build the kind of large subdivisions that drove the population increase in the 1970s and 80s those houses tended to be purchased by young and growing families that expanded during the 90s and early 2000s he said now that population is aging bingham a retired obstetrician predicted a continuing decline in the baseline reproductive rate based on a larger proportion of women now past their childbearing years and younger families generally choosing to have fewer children land conservation is another factor familiar to bingham that he said affects population growth here he is the vice president of the hiram bingham development company which sold development rights to 490 acres of family land to keep the space open and protected in perpetuity he said the eightmile river latimer brook and deep river watersheds are all priorities for protection according to the conservationist much of salem is better suited to remain in its natural state than to be turned into housing salem s complex geology has made salem s development difficult and expensive for builders due to steep slopes high water tables and varied soil types with many rock outcrops he said fair and responsible growth both bingham and smith said affordable housing should be explored as part of a plan to grow the town in a way that takes into account its unique character according to smith the planning and zoning commission is very aware of the need for encouraging housing options that people can afford that s kind of a general consensus among the people you talk to although i know there s a cadre that would like to maintain the single family large lot kind of format that we have here and we favor that smith said the conversation comes as national state and local officials explore zoning policies to promote equality and affordability amid restrictive regulations that can keep minority and low income communities out of affluent areas the town s draft affordable housing plan which will be the subject of a public hearing on sept 21 includes several ideas for bolstering the availability of affordable living spaces in town one recommendation is to require a certain percentage of units in multifamily or senior housing developments to be sold or rented at or below so called affordable rates definitions are laid out in state statute with low income referring to those who make less than 80 of the area median income the median household income in the norwich new london metropolitan area is 91 800 according to the u s department of housing and urban development some recommendations in the draft affordable housing plan target multifamily housing like one that would change local regulations to allow duplexes in any zone that allows single family homes another would allow the rental of single family houses that include accessory apartments without requiring the owner to live there for bingham the most responsible way to promote housing equity while preserving the environment is to invest in parcels of land that already have been developed he described the transformation of one family houses into multi family houses as the likely pattern of future development of salem and its neighboring towns growing its population and economy in a controlled manner with less impact on the remarkable natural landscape we are privileged to share he contrasted the duplex model with the kind of large affordable housing developments that can result from a state law affecting municipalities where less than 10 of the housing stock is considered affordable the law since 1989 has given developers the right to sue the town if their plans are rejected and shifts the burden of proof to the municipality to show the risk to public health or safety outweighs the need for affordable housing smith who shares a driveway with a rental duplex unit said the two family home fits right into the neighborhood while providing more affordable housing options that s a very good model for that sort of thing he said so we re trying to help make zoning that will help make a little more of that happen more to offer lara briscoe in july purchased the condo she d been renting for the past year and a half on route 85 near the roundabout it had more charm and was much more affordable than your standard apartment complex she said raised in north stonington before moving to groton she works for a medical device company in mystic and as a substitute librarian she said she chose her current place based on ample parking quiet living and proximity to work but as it stands now she doesn t see salem as her forever home briscoe cited surrounding towns with more to offer in terms of shopping and restaurants while small town charm is nice and the quiet streets are why she and her boyfriend have stayed this long she said development done right can enhance the positives linda swanson the one who moved to salem when she was 5 years old at the beginning of its population boom said she left town for more than 30 years before coming back to care for her ailing father in 2011 will i stay no she said not because of salem but sadly because connecticut has become too expensive to retire in she reported she ll be moving to tennessee with her younger daughter and grandchildren still she remains fond of the town where she grew up amid so much open space and where neighbors continue to help neighbors like they always did luckily my oldest daughter wants my house she said so she ll be buying it next year e regan theday com

tonnes per hectare from 7 85 a year ago malaysian palm oil board data shows a drop in average crude palm oil yields to 1 41 tonnes per hectare from 1 56 tonnes over the same period last year many plantations were harvesting with two thirds or less of the required workforce after government coronavirus restrictions cut off the usual supply of migrant workers from indonesia and south asia more than half a dozen plantation owners interviewed by reuters said the lack of workers had forced them to extend their harvesting window from 14 days to as many as 40 days a change that compromises the quality of the fruit and risks the loss of some parts of the fruit bunches it is especially bad in sarawak some companies are seeing production falling by 50 because of the shortage of harvesters said a plantation manager who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media the slim river estate has delayed replanting and shut its nursery for the first time in 20 years to redeploy workers for harvesting another plantation manager named chew said he was forced to increase wages by 10 to retain workers less manpower to maintain the plantations also means more pests including rats moths and bagworms it has resulted in an environment that is good for rats to nest feed and breed and natural predators cannot catch up said andrew cheng mui fah a plantation official in sarawak at slim river ravi said around a quarter of the estate was facing a bagworm infestation that will skeletonise the leaves and cause small fruit bunch formation he was referring to the larvae of the bagworm moth that grow and feed on trees indonesian mills neighbouring indonesia the world s largest producer of palm oil does not have the same labour shortage issues and output is expected to rise this year as more area has been planted to palm however operations at palm oil mills where the palm fruit is converted into crude palm oil have been impacted by covid 19 restrictions said dorab mistry director of indian consumer goods company and major consumer godrej international shutting down of palm oil mills right across the length and breadth of malaysia and indonesia has

together account for roughly 90 of world palm oil was estimated at 66 2 million tonnes according to refinitiv commodities research published on aug 4 that is about flat compared with 2020 but analysts

content in canada s canola crop due to the drought he said the supply tightness in vegetable oil is expected to continue well into 2022 the pressure on stocks is already feeding through to consumer

in raw material costs and consumer price rises it imposed in the first half of the year had negatively impacted margins mewah group one of the largest refineries in the region said average sale prices for its bulk goods and consumer packs rose almost 54 and 24 respectively in the first half from a year ago everyone along the supply chain is absorbing some of the higher costs said oscar tjakra a senior analyst at food and agribusiness research at rabobank the cost push should continue next year with global consumers already facing general economic uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic further increases in edible oil prices will take a toll on many livelihoods due the inelastic nature of food demand several countries including nigeria egypt turkey and the philippines have all recorded big jumps in food inflation in recent months the price pressure may continue as higher edible oil costs are passed on by suppliers leaving consumers with little choice but to pay up for the staple graphic food inflation picks up around the world even in poorer regions such as sub saharan africa where consumers suffer greatly from high prices consumption has only declined very marginally

by doug french via mises the new york times recently published a piece entitled when kmart moved out churches and flea markets moved in the article penned by kevin williams provides an instructive subtitle the retailer s former stores are being used by tenants that might not typically get a crack at such a large haul of commercial space at an affordable price when it merged with sears in 2005 kmart had 2 085 locations with the abrupt closing of the astor place kmart in manhattan last month the number of open kmart stores is down to 17 williams writes sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 with the assets sold to hedge fund manager edward lambert s transformco but while bankruptcy has a negative connotation in the business world as jörg guido hülsmann wrote in the ethics of money production bankruptcy fulfills the crucially important social function of preserving the available stock of capital and it plays this role in all conceivable scenarios when it results from fraud when it results from insolvency and when it results from illiquidity the capital in kmart s case once featured blue light specials now people flock to some of the repurposed buildings to see the light for instance elevation church a baptist ministry with twenty locations was looking to expand further and now occupies a portion of a former kmart not needing all the space an unlikely neighbor is a bowling alley with the last unused thirty eight thousand square feet to possibly be a call center royal emerald pharmaceuticals found the perfect space in a closed kmart in desert hot springs california in 2019 we needed a lab and we needed it fast for government contracts royal emerald s chief executive mark crozier told the times it would have cost us millions of lost dollars in contracts to build a box like this from scratch the company was up and running in thirty days and has since made 30 million in improvements to the buildings while the bankruptcy is recent kmart s entrepreneurial errors began decades ago robert lang vp of real estate for kamin realty group in pittsburg explained that when the company expanded in the 1960s and 70s company executives ignored the impact of interstates and never changed course while competitors such as walmart located stores next to interstate interchanges focusing on growth areas beyond suburbs known as exurbs we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us while old kmarts are not for every tenant given the dated construction and potential asbestos issues a lot of these inner city locations are really good for last mile delivery for online products said professor strong of william and mary also all kmarts have loading docks which make for easy deliveries the kmart footprint has lots of alternative uses as opposed to a typical big box store he said the beauty of capitalism is the adjustments that entrepreneurs make to use existing capital stock as professor hülsmann wrote about bankruptcy it puts an end to wasteful and therefore socially undesirable firms and it forces their stakeholders laborers capitalists to invest their human and material resources in other firms where the rewards are lower but which produce more than they consume while in the following hülsmann writes about deflation the point applies to bankruptcy rom the aggregate social point of view it does not matter who controls the existing resources what matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically it merely diminishes their monetary value which is why their present owners go bankrupt thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners the net impact on production is likely to be zero williams writes approximately 230 million square feet of commercial footage from shuttered kmarts has gone on the market much of it in the past decade the equivalent of 100 metlife stadiums or 50 mall of americas a huge amount of capital stock is being put to good use author doug french douglas french is former president of the mises institute author of early speculative bubbles increases in the money supply and author of walk away the rise and fall of the home ownership myth he received his master s degree in economics from unlv studying under both professor murray rothbard and professor hans hermann hoppe

work and glad to be helping their community seventy six year old john hubble maintenance director at the white river valley middle school in bethel says he s been told the school has one of the oldest custodial staffs in the state of vermont the oldest member is edith winki royea 84 who lives in barnard while working at the school from may to october she spends her winters in florida and has worked at the school for 47 years royea managed food service for the school for 27 years and retired in 2001 but stayed on as a painter with the maintenance crew which she joined part time in 1982 it s relaxing to me it takes my mind off of all other things because i m concentrating on what i m doing she said i help out wherever i m needed if the guys need me for moving furniture or whatever i m there royea whose father was a judge in new jersey once had aspirations to be an architect but didn t have the opportunity back then as a woman she said money isn t a big factor for me she said i never thought about it my parents did they were very much into country club and that sort of thing and i wasn t she worked two jobs much of the time and raised four children by herself all of whom graduated from what was then whitcomb high school and is now the middle school now her oldest son is 67 he s kind of semi retired now that sounds funny to have a son semi retired but my second boy could retire next year isn t that crazy chris gray 47 who joined the staff eight years ago said i m the young kid here i ve learned a lot from these guys he said of the staff it s been really rewarding working around them winki she s done this for a long time and when i came in she showed us what to do gray said the custodial work was a good fit his favorite part of the job is meeting the people helping the people being a part of the community gray attended college and earned a business degree but he said that the degree itself and the effort he put forth to earn it was more important to him than building a career in business that effort he said helped him form his approach to life under hubble gray has studied a sense of craftsmanship and when the time comes for change he cautiously said he d like to fill hubble s shoes i think the next logical step in my career if i could be maybe the head custodian next gray also looks forward to a time when he can keep to a day shift to be able to have supper with my kids and my wife the object is to be somewhere and grow and learn and move up if you can i think gray said this is a good fit for now ever since ian ritterbush was 10 growing up in nebraska and a neighbor s house burned down he has wanted to be a firefighter he now lives in brownsville and has been working as a firefighter in windsor for seven months the 27 year old ritterbush who has a degree in fire science said he does the job because he likes helping people and interacting with them but also enjoys the rush it gives him i m an adrenaline junkie he

wasn t until she realized that the sight of blood made her woozy that she decided to change paths now the 21 year old tillotson spends her mornings turning simple ingredients into meticulously crafted pastries at umpleby s bakery cafe in hanover where she has worked for the past 2½ years croissants are tillotson s favorite pastry to make and she gets excited about the technical aspects of the laminated dough the process is so particular that you definitely have to have the skill for it she said before she started at the new england culinary institute in montpelier tillotson wasn t sure if she wanted to focus on culinary or baking but now she s all in on the sweet stuff she hopes to open her own bakery eventually and after baking at work for seven hours typically returns home to bake

walk out of here and i m totally exhausted and wish i didn t have to walk back on the floor yes but when you can be the person to hold that hand as the person takes their last breath or to congratulate new parents or explain something in a way that someone can connect to so that they know that they have control over their own health it s a calling she said duprey works the night shift and says the higher pay rate allows her to put food on the table and in the bowls of her two dogs and her 16 year old toothless cat it also helps keep her side photography business running gifford is an amazing hospital and it s a great community to work for duprey said kimberley wolk 44 of enfield has been working at hypertherm for nearly four years after starting at the production facility doing

new orleans louisiana childcare centers across the united states are struggling to hire qualified educators for the new school year an obstacle that forced some schools to reduce planned enrollment and cut hours typically more workers are quitting and fewer are applying for open positions according to owners of childcare centers rochelle wilcox owner of three centers in new orleans receives 10 to 15 phone calls per day for each school from parents seeking to enroll their children but she has to turn them away while her enrollment is still below pre pandemic levels she lacks the staff to take on more students the staffing issue is further limiting childcare options for parents wishing to return to work and has created additional obstacles for working mothers in research published on wednesday the federal reserve bank of atlanta found women with children under 6 years old made up 10 percent of the pre pandemic workforce but accounted for 22 percent of job losses during the crisis finding quality childcare is likely to be a determining factor for employment for women with young children researcher m melinda pitts reported according to a survey by the national association for the education of young children 80 percent of early childhood educators working at childcare centers said they were understaffed in late june and early july while over 33 percent are considering leaving or closing their centers this year due to low wages and the demanding work recruiting childcare workers has always been difficult according to the labor department such workers earn a median wage of 12 per hour however the renewed focus on early childhood educators started a national conversation about their conditions and the changes needed to offer them more opportunities and reduce turnover i think what we are going through right now is a revaluing of care work said mara bolis associate director of women s economic rights for oxfam america as reported by reuters according to labour department data the number of employed child daycare workers dropped by 36 percent at the start of the pandemic after many centers closed while more than the 15 percent drop in overall u s employment

by mei mei chu and naveen thukral perak malaysia singapore reuters in a sprawling oil palm plantation in the malaysian state of perak watermelon seedlings are sprouting from freshly ploughed earth between palm saplings while rented cows graze in overgrown areas of the estate a coronavirus pandemic induced labour crunch has forced managers of the 2 000 hectare estate in slim river to find creative ways to upkeep their fields even as prices of the world s most consumed edible oil are near record highs it is easier to pull out your own teeth than to get new workers now said estate manager ravi who gave his first name only i can t find the workers to maintain the fields malaysia the world s second largest producer of palm oil is facing a perfect storm of production headwinds that will likely drag global stocks to their lowest level in five years the southeast asian country is a microcosm of the difficulties facing producers of various edible oils across several continents from canadian canola farmers to ukranian sunflower growers as they struggle to meet strong demand global food prices have scaled 10 year highs this year the food and agriculture organization s fao price index is up more than a third since last summer due in large part to a surge in the price of vegoils that are vital for both food preparation and as fat in numerous daily staples the fao s global edible oils index is up 91 since last june and is expected to climb further as economies reopen following covid 19 lockdowns boosting food and fuel consumption of edible oils but producers have been battling a range of impediments including labour shortages heatwaves and vermin infestation that is driving collective stocks of the world s most consumed edible oils palm soybean canola rapeseed and sunflowerseed to their lowest levels in a decade malaysian woes in malaysia which accounts for around 33 of global palm oil exports the average yield of palm fruit bunches in jan june fell to 7 15 tonnes per hectare from 7 85 a year ago malaysian palm oil board data shows a drop in average crude palm oil yields to 1 41 tonnes per hectare from 1 56 tonnes over the same period last year many plantations were harvesting with two thirds or less of the required workforce after government coronavirus restrictions cut off the usual supply of migrant workers from indonesia and south asia more than half a dozen plantation owners interviewed by reuters said the lack of workers had forced them to extend their harvesting window from 14 days to as many as 40 days a change that compromises the quality of the fruit and risks the loss of some parts of the fruit bunches it is especially bad in sarawak some companies are seeing production falling by 50 because of the shortage of harvesters said a plantation manager who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media the slim river estate has delayed replanting and shut its nursery for the first time in 20 years to redeploy workers for harvesting another plantation manager named chew said he was forced to increase wages by 10 to retain workers less manpower to maintain the plantations also means more pests including rats moths and bagworms it has resulted in an environment that is good for rats to nest feed and breed and natural predators cannot catch up said andrew cheng mui fah a plantation official in sarawak at slim river ravi said around a quarter of the estate was facing a bagworm infestation that will skeletonise the leaves and cause small fruit bunch formation he was referring to the larvae of the bagworm moth that grow and feed on trees indonesian mills neighbouring indonesia the world s largest producer of palm oil does not have the same labour shortage issues and output is expected to rise this year as more area has been planted to palm however operations at palm oil mills where the palm fruit is converted into crude palm oil have been impacted by covid 19 restrictions said dorab mistry director of indian consumer goods company and major consumer godrej international shutting down of palm oil mills right across the length and breadth of malaysia and indonesia has been a huge dampener on the production side he said at the annual u s soy export council conference on aug 25 total 2021 output from indonesia and malaysia which together account for roughly 90 of world palm oil was estimated at 66 2 million tonnes according to refinitiv commodities research published on aug 4 that is about flat compared with 2020 but analysts said downward revisions are likely if labour shortages and pest infestations worsen north american dry spell meanwhile farmers in western canada planted canola into some of the driest soils in a century this spring sending canola futures to all time highs in early may a july heatwave then scorched crops throughout the canadian prairies leading the u s department of agriculture usda to slash its estimate of canola output by 4 2 million tonnes to 16 million tonnes the lowest since the 2012 13 season we haven t had much rain to speak of and the crop is withering said jack froese who has farmed canola near winkler manitoba for nearly 50 years froese expects a yield per acre of just a quarter of last year s level it s very disheartening u s soybeans have also been sapped by drought with the usda lowering its production forecast by 1 8 million tonnes in august from the month prior that is expected to cut u s soybean oil stocks to eight year lows and u s soyoil exports to decade lows we re looking at an average crop because we were lucky enough to have some subsoil moisture said jared hagert from his north dakota farm but you don t have to go too far west of here to get into some really rough crops in some good news for buyers brazil s soybean crop is expected to hit a record 144 06 million tonnes in the 2020 21 season driven by a 4 rise in the area planted to the crop agribusiness consultancy datagro estimated ukraine the top sunflower seed producer according to the usda is expected to lift output by 18 from a 2020 drought hit harvest and oil exports are forecast to rise to 6 35 million tonnes from 5 38 million last season according to its agriculture ministry worsening outlook still the outlook for edible oils production overall remains poor and stocks are likely to tighten further leaving the markets tight well into next year and adding to inflationary pressures according to some analysts in malaysia worsening covid 19 outbreaks will leave plantations starved of workers through the rest of the peak palm production window canadian farmers continue to face drought conditions leading official agency statscan to peg canola output down 24 3 and yields down 30 1 we have multiple issues with edible oil supplies worldwide palm oil in malaysia canola in canada and la nina curbing soybean output in south america mistry said we are expecting lower oil content in canada s canola crop due to the drought he said the supply tightness in vegetable oil is expected to continue well into 2022 the pressure on stocks is already feeding through to consumer prices and the upward trend is expected to continue especially as refiners lift prices to cover the surge in raw material costs singapore based wilmar international said a time lag between the surge in raw material costs and consumer price rises it imposed in the first half of the year had negatively impacted margins mewah group one of the largest refineries in the region said average sale prices for its bulk goods and consumer packs rose almost 54 and 24 respectively in the first half from a year ago everyone along the supply chain is absorbing some of the higher costs said oscar tjakra a senior analyst at food and agribusiness research at rabobank the cost push should continue next year with global consumers already facing general economic uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic further increases in edible oil prices will take a toll on many livelihoods due the inelastic nature of food demand several countries including nigeria egypt turkey and the philippines have all recorded big jumps in food inflation in recent months the price pressure may continue as higher edible oil costs are passed on by suppliers leaving consumers with little choice but to pay up for the staple even in poorer regions such as sub saharan africa where consumers suffer greatly from high prices consumption has only declined very marginally said julian mcgill head of south east asia at lmc international there

karachi brokerages expect an increase in foreign investment in equities should the msci a global index provider decide to downgrade pakistan from the emerging market em index to the frontier market fm index in its september 7 announcement foreign investment in pakistan should rise if it s reclassified to the frontier market said shahid ali habib ceo of arif habib ltd ahl while speaking to dawn global institutional investors often use indices like the ones provided by the msci to make passive investments in different countries these index tracking investors increase or decrease their exposure to a particular market in line with any changes in its weight or classification by the index provider a downgrade resulting in higher inflows may sound counter intuitive but most brokers insist that a higher weight in the fm index will attract increased foreign investment msci announcement due on sept 7 within the fm space there are very few markets that are viable for sizable allocations from foreign investors pakistan will be the third most liquid market in fm after vietnam and bangladesh said mr habib international passive funds have substantially reduced their exposure to the local share market in recent years they currently have approximately 70 million invested in pakistani equities he added at present only three stocks from the pakistan stock exchange psx are part of the em index and carry a negligible weight of 0 02 per cent even these stocks habib bank mcb bank and lucky cement are significantly below the prescribed free float and full market capitalisation thresholds the msci is retaining them on the index only because of its continuity rules next capital ceo najam ali also believes a downgrade to the fm index will increase the foreign fund flows more companies will join initial estimates indicate 50 60 companies may become eligible he told dawn the msci placed pakistan in the fm index in 2009 after keeping it in its standalone country index following the 2008 stock market crisis at the beginning of 2017 as many as 16 pakistani stocks were part of the msci fm index carrying a collective weight of 9pc there was much jubilation in the run up to the country s reclassification in the em index in may 2017 brokerages released research reports telling local investors that the upgrade would attract up to half a billion dollars of foreign investment expectations of higher inflows pushed the kse 100 index to more than 52 000 points in may 2017 but the kse 100 index dropped rapidly soon afterwards passive funds tracking the fm index sold their positions as soon as the reclassification took effect however a negligible weight of 0 14pc in the em index at the time resulted in little foreign buying foreigners sold shares worth as much as 193m on a net basis in just over a month since then foreign portfolio investment has consistently been either negative or extremely low according to mr ali the situation deteriorated economically and politically in pakistan and as a result more companies could not become part of the em index it seems the em investors then lost their interest as pakistan s weight became negligible he said pakistan s move to the em index in 2017 was a good opportunity to develop the market and served as an incentive for bigger companies to move up the ladder however the country wasted that opportunity due to unstable economic and political conditions since 2017 he noted mr habib of ahl said the economy imploded after the 2017 upgrade and the subsequent big devaluation gave foreign investors another reason to avoid pakistan right now pakistan is on a different economic footing we have a story that foreigners can buy into it trades at a significant discount with a forward price to earnings multiple of 6 5 as opposed to fm heavyweights with multiples of 11 23 he added however not all brokers foresee a rise in foreign investment in the likely case of a downgrade topline securities ceo mohammed sohail believes foreign portfolio investment will not increase because of the msci s upcoming announcement foreigners are making good returns in the united states and large emerging markets that s why they re not enthusiastic about investing in small frontier markets he said published in dawn september 5th 2021

taliban fighters gather along a street during a rally in kabul on tuesday as they celebrate after the us pulled all its troops out of the country afp photo taliban fighters gather along a street during a rally in kabul on tuesday as they celebrate after the us pulled all its troops out of the country afp photo menafn jordan times kabul the taliban hardliners celebrated their total return to power on tuesday with gunfire and diplomacy after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied airlift that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice aid crisis the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter the withdrawal came just before the august 31 deadline set by president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2 400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of daesh rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when a daesh suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6 000 more to conduct the airlift biden said he would address the nation on tuesday in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar airport uncertainty all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run kabul airport which german chancellor angela merkel warned on tuesday was of existential importance because it is a lifeline for aid the taliban have asked turkey to handle logistics while they maintain control of security but president recep tayyip erdogan has not yet accepted that offer
menafn valuewalk in late november the who warned the world about a possible third wave of the covid pandemic in early 2021 this warning sounded far fetched as the second wave was still ongoing and the peak had not been reached yet however a new more contagious strain of covid appeared in the united kingdom in december which can greatly increase the infection rate and essentially start a third wave

react and what they are saying now showwhat is the third wave and when can it start epidemics typically occur in waves when the number of new cases grows exponentially at first then reaches a peak or

fund letters conferences and more for the year to the end of august the fund returned 5 3 compared to a gain of 21 6 for the s p read more the waves can happen due to many factors that influence infection rates the percentage of people that recently had the disease if it is large enough the spread of the infection slows down the current season the probability of infection decreases in the summer for many diseases and the stringency of the quarantine measures for the covid 19 pandemic the first wave happened in the spring of 2020 in most countries in many countries such as the eu members the epidemic died down in the summer due to quarantines and warmer weather but regained strength in the fall in some countries the classic wave pattern did not play out while other countries such as israel are already talking about a third wave if we take the world as a whole the second wave according to the who s statement in october is closer to being a second peak rather than a second wave in the usual meaning of the term in this article for the sake of clarity we shall call the stage of the pandemic that started in october the second wave the who predicts that the third wave will take place during the first half of 2021 but the new highly contagious strain of the virus that has appeared in the uk can lead to an earlier start of the third wave the key question that can define the new strain s role in the pandemic is whether it can infect people who have already acquired an immunity to covid either from recovering from the disease or getting vaccinated if the new strain can infect them it can be seen as the start of the third wave with the loss of the immunity that was acquired during the second wave the role of the collective immunity and vaccination at the end of the first and second waves it is unlikely that the immunity acquired by the population played a significant role at the end of the first wave of covid the highest percentage of recoveries was found in smaller italian towns up to 60 and some districts of new york city up to 40 in most other places the percentage of people with the immunity rarely exceeded 25 vaccines did not exist yet the main restraining factors against the pandemic were quarantines and warm weather the second wave began in the fall in near perfect conditions the weather grew colder the people who had the disease in the spring had mostly lost their immunity and the people grew tired of being afraid and were strongly opposed to new quarantines whether it was due to natural selection among the strains or people acting more cautiously such as wearing masks more often decreasing the dose of the virus being received the percentage of severe cases decreased and the spring s panic was followed by indifference as a result the second wave turned out to be much stronger than the first one as it affected a large chunk of the population even if they only were asymptomatic carriers in december moscow s mayor sergey sobyanin said that it was possible that 50 of moscow s citizens had already had the disease according to some estimates the number of people who contracted covid is over 60 in some regions of russia the official number of cases is less by an order of magnitude but today people don t even regard it as deliberate misinformation as medicine in russia just like in other countries is under too much stress to test everyone in time often the patients are only tested when they have already recovered and are likely no longer contagious although many countries imposed new lockdowns in november and december these lockdowns may not be the only reason why they are currently at a plateau a significant number of people having acquired immunity may be another factor in addition a number of countries such as russia the us and the uk have already begun vaccination and others such as the eu countries are planning to start vaccination before the end of 2020 these vaccinations decrease the number of people susceptible to the disease even more every day in the us over a million people have already been vaccinated and around 20 million are expected to be vaccinated by the end of december according to jp morgan chase by april 50 of the population will be vaccinated which should stem the epidemic when a large percentage of the people have had the disease the immunity to covid lasts for 8 months after recovery for countries with a high percentage of people who had the disease vaccinating even 20 of the population around february has a good chance of stopping the second wave and drastically decreasing the number of new cases the main point of the new lockdowns is not so much in stopping the spread of the virus directly as reducing the percentage of the population that could catch the disease before being vaccinated all of this however assumes that the spread of the new british strain can be slowed by the immunity that is already present in the population and by the current vaccines let us therefore examine two scenarios where the new strain is either able or unable to bypass the current immunity optimistic scenario the third wave starts in the spring as predicted if the new covid strain is unable to infect people who have been vaccinated or have already had the disease and does not exacerbate the symptoms which is currently believed to be the most likely scenario then the new strain s main effect on the pandemic will be delaying the plateau and increasing the number of people who would catch the disease before being vaccinated in the uk the number of new cases rose by 40 during this week although this may also be due to the weather or the approaching weekend it is likely that the new strain has already appeared in many other countries and in some regions in russia the rt coefficient the number of people that an already infected person infects rose above 1 after a short lived drop however the vaccination rate is nearly unaffected by the disease s infection rate and is currently only limited by the pharmaceutical companies production capabilities pfizer and moderna planned to produce several tens of millions of vaccines and over 2 billion in 2021 it is likely that in the first months of 2021 the number of vaccines will be in the hundreds of millions vaccines from pfizer biontech and moderna are mostly being distributed in the us and the eu at the moment but they are not the only vaccines available in the world russia uses the sputnik v vaccine and it is also planning to start the production of another vaccine soon called epivaccorona the delivery of sputnik v to argentina has already started and negotiations with other countries are also underway the development of the azd1222 vaccine by the oxford university and astrazeneca is behind schedule but the vaccine is likely to be improved soon this means that by the end of january the number of people with immunity to covid is already going to be high enough for rt to drop significantly below 1 and the number of new cases will decline greatly paradoxically the high contagiousness of this strain may actually accelerate this decline since a higher percentage of people will get the disease in a shorter time in february and in the spring two competing factors will be at work on the one hand a higher percentage of people will get vaccinated and on the other hand the people who had the disease in the fall will gradually lose their immunity theoretically this can cause a third wave of covid however this wave is expected to be weaker both in terms of infection rate and in terms of economic consequences the most important factor that will make the third wave milder is vaccination which will cover a significant percentage of the population by that time by april half of the population may already be vaccinated not just in the us but in other developed countries as well if covid s rt is estimated at 2 5 3 when completely unchecked then when half of the population is vaccinated it is unlikely to get higher than 1 5 this would make even the most basic quarantine measures such as masks sufficient for keeping rt below 1 citizens who fear the most for their health or are especially at risk can get vaccinated more quickly in case of new lockdowns people who are known to be vaccinated or otherwise immune can go on with their lives as usual which would further mitigate the economic damage pessimistic scenario the new strain starts the third wave if the new strain from the uk turns out to be contagious for people who have already been vaccinated or have recovered from the disease it would mean that the third wave would start and render previously acquired immunity irrelevant most experts believe that the previously acquired immunity should provide at least partial protection from the new strain despite that improvements to the current vaccines may be needed improving vaccines for new strains is fairly routine work the vaccine against seasonal flu needs to be modified once every few years this is a much quicker process than developing a new vaccine from scratch however in the current situation even a one month delay and the need to vaccinate tens or hundreds of millions of people may mean serious trouble for the world the third wave will effectively begin in january in the countries without lockdowns the third wave will spread even more quickly than the second one and for the countries that do impose lockdowns this would mean even tighter restrictions than in the spring there is a real risk that the main defense against the virus in most of the world s leading countries will be an actual collective immunity of the 60 80 of the population that will get the disease once more rather than vaccines the number of deaths will increase greatly and the vaccines will primarily serve as protection against future waves the markets how they may react and what they are saying now when we talk about markets we must understand that the investors are tracking the situation with the new strain carefully they watch the news and sometimes even directly consult the experts the correction on the stock oil and cryptocurrency markets that took place after the news of the new strain turned out to be small the most likely explanation for this is that financiers do not see the new strain as a serious problem the opinion of the investor community in this situation can be trusted even more than the opinions of the experts in the media as investors risk losing their money if they make a mistake every day more people are getting infected with the new strain and if there are no new signs of danger based on these new cases there are unlikely to be more in the future current data show that the new strain may increase the chance of people who have long since recovered from covid getting the disease again but the vaccines will still counter it new market crashes like those in march are unlikely that crash was caused by the high level of uncertainty whether the virus could be stopped how strict the quarantines would be and what kind of stimulating and restraining measures the governments were willing to take it is uncertainty that frightens the investors the most but there is not as much reason for uncertainty today even if the pessimistic scenario plays out the world has already had a lot of experience with quarantine measures and can assess their effectiveness the vaccines will only need to be improved rather than recreated from scratch the situation will be difficult with an even greater increase of the world s money supply the devaluation of the leading currencies a decrease in oil prices and perhaps indices but not all assets prices dropping by several dozen percent by

infection rates the percentage of people that recently had the disease if it is large enough the spread of the infection slows down the current season the probability of infection decreases in the summer for many diseases and the stringency of the quarantine measures for the covid 19 pandemic the first wave happened in the spring of 2020 in most countries in many countries such as the eu members the epidemic died down in the summer due to quarantines and warmer weather but regained strength in the fall in some countries the classic wave pattern did not play out while other countries such as israel are already talking about a third wave if we take the world as a whole the second wave according to the who s statement in october is closer to being a second peak rather than a second wave in the usual meaning of the term in this article for the sake of clarity we shall call the stage of the pandemic that started in october the second wave the who predicts that the third wave will take place during the first half of 2021 but the new highly contagious strain of the virus that has appeared in the uk can lead to an earlier start of the third wave the key question that can define the new strain s role in the pandemic is whether it can infect people who have already acquired an immunity to covid either from recovering from the disease or getting vaccinated if the new strain can infect them it can be seen as the start of the third wave with the loss of the immunity that was acquired during the second wave the role of the collective immunity and vaccination at the end of the first and second waves it is unlikely that the immunity acquired by the population played a significant role at the end of the first wave of covid the highest percentage of recoveries was found in smaller italian towns up to 60 and some districts of new york city up to 40 in most other places the percentage of people with the immunity rarely exceeded 25 vaccines did not exist yet the main restraining factors against the pandemic were quarantines and warm weather the second wave began in the fall in near perfect conditions the weather grew colder the people who had the disease in the spring had mostly lost their immunity and the people grew tired of being afraid and were strongly opposed to new quarantines whether it was due to natural selection among the strains or people acting more cautiously such as wearing masks more often decreasing the dose of the virus being received the percentage of severe cases decreased and the spring s panic was followed by indifference as a result the second wave turned out to be much stronger than the first one as it affected a large chunk of the population even if they only were asymptomatic carriers in december moscow s mayor sergey sobyanin said that it was possible that 50 of moscow s citizens had already had the disease according to some estimates the number of people who contracted covid is over 60 in some regions of russia the official number of cases is less by an order of magnitude but today people don t even regard it as deliberate misinformation as medicine in russia just like in other countries is under too much stress to test everyone in time often the patients are only tested when they have already recovered and are likely no longer contagious although many countries imposed new lockdowns in november and december these lockdowns may not be the only reason why they are currently at a plateau a significant number of people having acquired immunity may be another factor in addition a number of countries such as russia the us and the uk have already begun vaccination and others such as the eu countries are planning to start vaccination before the end of 2020 these vaccinations decrease the number of people susceptible to the disease even more every day in the us over a million people have already been vaccinated and around 20 million are expected to be vaccinated by the end of december according to jp morgan chase by april 50 of the population will be vaccinated which should stem the epidemic when a large percentage of the people have had the disease the immunity to covid lasts for 8 months after recovery for countries with a high percentage of people who had the disease vaccinating even 20 of the population around february has a good chance of stopping the second wave and drastically decreasing the number of new cases the main point of the new lockdowns is not so much in stopping the spread of the virus directly as reducing the percentage of the population that could catch the disease before being vaccinated all of this however assumes that the spread of the new british strain can be slowed by the immunity that is already present in the population and by the current vaccines let us therefore examine two scenarios where the new strain is either able or unable to bypass the current immunity optimistic scenario the third wave starts in the spring as predicted if the new covid strain is unable to infect people who have been vaccinated or have already had the disease and does not exacerbate the symptoms which is currently believed to be the most likely scenario then the new strain s main effect on the pandemic will be delaying the plateau and increasing the number of people who would catch the disease before being vaccinated in the uk the number of new cases rose by 40 during this week although this may also be due to the weather or the approaching weekend it is likely that the new strain has already appeared in many other countries and in some regions in russia the rt coefficient the number of people that an already infected person infects rose above 1 after a short lived drop however the vaccination rate is nearly unaffected by the disease s infection rate and is currently only limited by the pharmaceutical companies production capabilities pfizer and moderna planned to produce several tens of millions of vaccines and over 2 billion in

by mei mei chu and naveen thukral perak malaysia singapore reuters in a sprawling oil palm plantation in the malaysian state of perak watermelon seedlings are sprouting from freshly ploughed earth between palm saplings while rented cows graze in overgrown areas of the estate a coronavirus pandemic induced labour crunch has forced managers of the 2 000 hectare estate in slim river to find creative ways to upkeep their fields even as prices of the world s most consumed edible oil are near record highs it is easier to pull out your own teeth than to get new workers now said estate manager ravi who gave his first name only i can t find the workers to maintain the fields malaysia the world s second largest producer of palm oil is facing a perfect storm of production headwinds that will likely drag global stocks to their lowest level in five years the southeast asian country is a microcosm of the difficulties facing producers of various edible oils across several continents from canadian canola farmers to ukranian sunflower growers as they struggle to meet strong demand global food prices have scaled 10 year highs this year the food and agriculture organization s fao price index is up more than a third since last summer due in large part to a surge in the price of vegoils that are vital for both food preparation and as fat in numerous daily staples the fao s global edible oils index is up 91 since last june and is expected to climb further as economies reopen following covid 19 lockdowns boosting food and fuel consumption of edible oils but producers have been battling a range of impediments including labour shortages heatwaves and vermin infestation that is driving collective stocks of the world s most consumed edible oils palm soybean canola rapeseed and sunflowerseed to their lowest levels in a decade malaysian woes in malaysia which accounts for around 33 of global palm oil exports the average yield of palm fruit bunches in jan june fell to 7 15 tonnes per hectare from 7 85 a year ago malaysian palm oil board data shows a drop in average crude palm oil yields to 1 41 tonnes per hectare from 1 56 tonnes over the same period last year many plantations were harvesting with two thirds or less of the required workforce after government coronavirus restrictions cut off the usual supply of migrant workers from indonesia and south asia more than half a dozen plantation owners interviewed by reuters said the lack of workers had forced them to extend their harvesting window from 14 days to as many as 40 days a change that compromises the quality of the fruit and risks the loss of some parts of the fruit bunches it is especially bad in sarawak some companies are seeing production falling by 50 because of the shortage of harvesters said a plantation manager who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media the slim river estate has delayed replanting and shut its nursery for the first time in 20 years to redeploy workers for harvesting another plantation manager named chew said he was forced to increase wages by 10 to retain workers less manpower to maintain the plantations also means more pests including rats moths and bagworms it has resulted in an environment that is good for rats to nest feed and breed and natural predators cannot catch up said andrew cheng mui fah a plantation official in sarawak at slim river ravi said around a quarter of the estate was facing a bagworm infestation that will skeletonise the leaves and cause small fruit bunch formation he was referring to the larvae of the bagworm moth that grow and feed on trees indonesian mills neighbouring indonesia the world s largest producer of palm oil does not have the same labour shortage issues and output is expected to rise this year as more area has been planted to palm however operations at palm oil mills where the palm fruit is converted into crude palm oil have been impacted by covid 19 restrictions said dorab mistry director of indian consumer goods company and major consumer godrej international shutting down of palm oil mills right across the length and breadth of malaysia and indonesia has been a huge dampener on the production side he said at the annual u s soy export council conference on aug 25 total 2021 output from indonesia and malaysia which together account for roughly 90 of world palm oil was estimated at 66 2 million tonnes according to refinitiv commodities research published on aug 4 that is about flat compared with 2020 but analysts said downward revisions are likely if labour shortages and pest infestations worsen north american dry spell meanwhile farmers in western canada planted canola into some of the driest soils in a century this spring sending canola futures to all time highs in early may a july heatwave then scorched crops throughout the canadian prairies leading the u s department of agriculture usda to slash its estimate of canola output by 4 2 million tonnes to 16 million tonnes the lowest since the 2012 13 season we haven t had much rain to speak of and the crop is withering said jack froese who has farmed canola near winkler manitoba for nearly 50 years froese expects a yield per acre of just a quarter of last year s level it s very disheartening u s soybeans have also been sapped by drought with the usda lowering its production forecast by 1 8 million tonnes in august from the month prior that is expected to cut u s soybean oil stocks to eight year lows and u s soyoil exports to decade lows we re looking at an average crop because we were lucky enough to have some subsoil moisture said jared hagert from his north dakota farm but you don t have to go too far west of here to get into some really rough crops in some good news for buyers brazil s soybean crop is expected to hit a record 144 06 million tonnes in the 2020 21 season driven by a 4 rise in the area planted to the crop agribusiness consultancy datagro estimated ukraine the top sunflower seed producer according to the usda is expected to lift output by 18 from a 2020 drought hit harvest and oil exports are forecast to rise to 6 35 million tonnes from 5 38 million last season according to its agriculture ministry worsening outlook still the outlook for edible oils production overall remains poor and stocks are likely to tighten further leaving the markets tight well into next year and adding to inflationary pressures according to some analysts in malaysia worsening covid 19 outbreaks will leave plantations starved of workers through the rest of the peak palm production window canadian farmers continue to face drought conditions leading official agency statscan to peg canola output down 24 3 and yields down 30 1 we have multiple issues with edible oil supplies worldwide palm oil in malaysia canola in canada and la nina curbing soybean output in south america mistry said we are expecting lower oil content in canada s canola crop due to the drought he said the supply tightness in vegetable oil is expected to continue well into 2022 the pressure on stocks is already feeding through to consumer prices and the upward trend is expected to continue especially as refiners lift prices to cover the surge in raw material costs singapore based wilmar international said a time lag between the surge in raw material costs and consumer price rises it imposed in the first half of the year had negatively impacted margins mewah group one of the largest refineries in the region said average sale prices for its bulk goods and consumer packs rose almost 54 and 24 respectively in the first half from a year ago everyone along the supply chain is absorbing some of the higher costs said oscar tjakra a senior analyst at food and agribusiness research at rabobank the cost push should continue next year with global consumers already facing general economic uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic further increases in edible oil prices will take a toll on many livelihoods due the inelastic nature of food demand several countries including nigeria egypt turkey and the philippines have all recorded big jumps in food inflation in recent months the price pressure may continue as higher edible oil costs are passed on by suppliers leaving consumers with little choice but to pay up for the staple even in poorer regions such as sub saharan africa where consumers suffer greatly from high prices consumption has only declined very marginally said julian mcgill head of south east asia at lmc international there

before combining coconut milk aloe vera mango butter hemp seed oil silk and goji berry extracts kadian created a whipped curling custard to moisturise kinks and curls and set them in place for twist outs braid outs or to wash and go she began giving them out as gifts to friends in 2015 and before she knew it they were coming back and asking her to create other trouble shooting products they said i have problems x y and z do you think you could make something for that said kadian who uses mainly vegan and vegetarian ingredients it all grew from there a friend asked me to create a hair balm for

have a unit at a business park that stores things for us and another room that s full of boxes and containers we re bursting out of our house now and getting to the point where it s hard to keep up with making it all ourselves we hope that by the start of next summer we ll have manufacturers in place kadian is proud to include a part of birmingham in her brand s name i knew i wanted the word beautiful in the brand and the whole ethos is about embracing the natural hair and skin you were born with she said i was born on an island in jamaica and water has always been important to me i always gravitate towards it it brings me a lot of peace and fulfilment so i liked the idea of water being in the name i live in bournville which is named after a body of water bourn brook so i thought it was a nice play on the words bourn and born when i was busy working three jobs being a kitchen chemist and creating my beauty products was my outlet from all my jobs it helped me to feel fulfilled helped my brain to work in a completely different way it was my saviour and my self care it made me happy and wanted that to be reflected in the product for other people for me yellow is joy happiness and sunshine it s the colour that gives me energy and i wanted people to feel that when they saw it and experienced the products she said i had always planned to be a university lecturer and i am doing that full time now that s why i need a manufacturer now kadian is combining her two loves lecturing and business by getting involved in black owned business research and exhibitions i love lecturing and so i m pursuing a combination of my two lives for research angles she said the number of black owned businesses in our area has really stepped up and they re becoming really successful we ve noticed it and now the rest of the world is noticing it s great because birmingham was always a base for manufacturing there s flora and curl and nila who got funding from dragons den and there are small brands as well we re somewhere in the middle it s pretty amazing long term my goal is to be able to live full time off my business i want to create a pet care brand with the same ethos and i

apple story i said that in the early 2000s i managed to snag a loaner ipod soon after they were released it was obviously a new digital version of the ubiquitous 1980s sony walkman at the time apple inc s shares were trading at 15 with 13 a share in cash on the balance sheet i did not see a lot of risk in the shares i pitched it to my firm s 800 or so brokers many of whom bought lots of shares but i was surprised when soon after and the shares shot up to 20 the brokers began to sell up big 33 per cent gotta ring the bell is what i was told i held on and finally sold when my stop loss order was triggered on a pullback after the shares reached 45 leaving me with a 300 per cent gain a triple i smugly declared in what was probably the worst sale i ever made in a career filled with other bad trades missed opportunities and judgment errors some decisions stand out not just for the lost money but for the lessons learned here are four examples i may have paid 15 a share but that was numerous splits ago which means that had i held onto that apple stock through last year my post split cost basis would have been 26 78 cents per share that was about 2 4 trillion dollars in apple s market capitalization ago from this i learned two lessons the first and obvious one was to avoid too tight stop losses i was raising my stop with each 10 gain a 13 stop on a 15 purchase became 23 once the price crossed 25 volatility guaranteed that such a tight stop would eventually get executed but the more important lesson was on how to think long term i was behaving like the former trader i was and not the investor i had become trade management is important but mine did not properly align with my time horizon or risk tolerances they eventually fell into sync but it expensively took time that is the dumbest investment idea i have ever heard that was what i told howard lindzon who runs a small successful venture fund and has been an early investor in too many tech winners to list but include facebook inc and twitter inc we were sitting outside the ferry building in san francisco and howard was pitching me on putting money into the seed round of robinhood markets inc a new app that allowed people to trade stocks for free i smugly told howard that the world was moving from active to passive investing from trading in individual stocks to exchange traded funds why would i want to own an app that gives trades away for free to young people with no capital in my defense robinhood was totally off brand from what i was writing for bloomberg opinion and how we were investing at my firm

in the venture space so i should have deferred to the pro 2 beware of recency bias an earlier startup howard and i invested in never found an exit that sample set of one colored my view 3 do not assume that any start up or even mature company will look the same in six months let alone five years later failing to recognize these truisms meant that i left a lot of money on the table when i was pitching apple to retail brokers to buy for clients i could not help but notice the certainty of some people s conclusions about the company s attempted turnaround even my mother a former real estate agent and stock dabbler sounded like everyone else when she said to me apple they are going out of business note my own smugness in the above examples i have taught myself to pay attention to any trading idea where my knee jerk reaction is disgust the reason is because the subject likely reflects all of the bad news that is likely already priced in not the good news that may come the lesson to be learned is in recognizing your emotional reaction as revealing a widespread and potentially wrong sentiment short sellers have become an endangered species on wall street and that is too bad my firm had a number of shorts heading into 2008 american international group inc lehman brothers holdings inc and cit group inc before those there was bear stearns cos but even getting those trades rights turned out to be missed opportunities first we got out too early because there was a constant threat of a short squeeze and our positions would be called away at any moment second we did not size the positions correctly the gains from these positions failed to offset the losses in dollar terms not percentages another portfolio manager had on that were money losing long positions these shorts were high conviction trades and we should have had much more of each the lesson is that you must have the courage of your conviction if you really believe in a trade it should be meaningful enough to affect your profits otherwise why bother

peak had not been reached yet however a new more contagious strain of covid appeared in the united kingdom in december which can greatly increase the infection rate and essentially start a third wave

react and what they are saying now showwhat is the third wave and when can it start epidemics typically occur in waves when the number of new cases grows exponentially at first then reaches a peak or a plateau then decreases then starts increasing again the spanish flu is the archetypal example which had three main waves with peaks in july and november 1918 and february 1919 kg investments

fund letters conferences and more for the year to the end of august the fund returned 5 3 compared to a gain of 21 6 for the s p read more the waves can happen due to many factors that influence infection rates the percentage of people that recently had the disease if it is large enough the spread of the infection slows down the current season the probability of infection decreases in the summer for many diseases and the stringency of the quarantine measures for the covid 19 pandemic the first wave happened in the spring of 2020 in most countries in many countries such as the eu members the epidemic died down in the summer due to quarantines and warmer weather but regained strength in the fall in some countries the classic wave pattern did not play out while other countries such as israel are already talking about a third wave if we take the world as a whole the second wave according to the who s statement in october is closer to being a second peak rather than a second wave in the usual meaning of the term in this article for the sake of clarity we shall call the stage of the pandemic that started in october the second wave the who predicts that the third wave will take place during the first half of 2021 but the new highly contagious strain of the virus that has appeared in the uk can lead to an earlier start of the third wave the key question that can define the new strain s role in the pandemic is whether it can infect people who have already acquired an immunity to covid either from recovering from the disease or getting vaccinated if the new strain can infect them it can be seen as the start of the third wave with the loss of the immunity that was acquired during the second wave the role of the collective immunity and vaccination at the end of the first and second waves it is unlikely that the immunity acquired by the population played a significant role at the end of the first wave of covid the highest percentage of recoveries was found in smaller italian towns up to 60 and some districts of new york city up to 40 in most other places the percentage of people with the immunity rarely exceeded 25 vaccines did not exist yet the main restraining factors against the pandemic were quarantines and warm weather the second wave began in the fall in near perfect conditions the weather grew colder the people who had the disease in the spring had mostly lost their immunity and the people grew tired of being afraid and were strongly opposed to new quarantines whether it was due to natural selection among the strains or people acting more cautiously such as wearing masks more often decreasing the dose of the virus being received the percentage of severe cases decreased and the spring s panic was followed by indifference as a result the second wave turned out to be much stronger than the first one as it affected a large chunk of the population even if they only were asymptomatic carriers in december moscow s mayor sergey sobyanin said that it was possible that 50 of moscow s citizens had already had the disease according to some estimates the number of people who contracted covid is over 60 in some regions of russia the official number of cases is less by an order of magnitude but today people don t even regard it as deliberate misinformation as medicine in russia just like in other countries is under too much stress to test everyone in time often the patients are only tested when they have already recovered and are likely no longer contagious although many countries imposed new lockdowns in november and december these lockdowns may not be the only reason why they are currently at a plateau a significant number of people having acquired immunity may be another factor in addition a number of countries such as russia the us and the uk have already begun vaccination and others such as the eu countries are planning to start vaccination before the end of 2020 these vaccinations decrease the number of people susceptible to the disease even more every day in the us over a million people have already been vaccinated and around 20 million are expected to be vaccinated by the end of december according to jp morgan chase by april 50 of the population will be vaccinated which should stem the epidemic when a large percentage of the people have had the disease the immunity to covid lasts for 8 months after recovery for countries with a high percentage of people who had the disease vaccinating even 20 of the population around february has a good chance of stopping the second wave and drastically decreasing the number of new cases the main point of the new lockdowns is not so much in stopping the spread of the virus directly as reducing the percentage of the population that could catch the disease before being vaccinated all of this however assumes that the spread of the new british strain can be slowed by the immunity that is already present in the population and by the current vaccines let us therefore examine two scenarios where the new strain is either able or unable to bypass the current immunity optimistic scenario the third wave starts in the spring as predicted if the new covid strain is unable to infect people who have been vaccinated or have already had the disease and does not exacerbate the symptoms which is currently believed to be the most likely scenario then the new strain s main effect on the pandemic will be delaying the plateau and increasing the number of people who would catch the disease before being vaccinated in the uk the number of new cases rose by 40 during this week although this may also be due to the weather or the approaching weekend it is likely that the new strain has already appeared in many other countries and in some regions in russia the rt coefficient the number of people that an already infected person infects rose above 1 after a short lived drop however the vaccination rate is nearly unaffected by the disease s infection rate and is currently only limited by the pharmaceutical companies production capabilities pfizer and moderna planned to produce several tens of millions of vaccines and over 2 billion in 2021 it is likely that in the first months of 2021 the number of vaccines will be in the hundreds of millions vaccines from pfizer biontech and moderna are mostly being distributed in the us and the eu at the moment but they are not the only vaccines available in the world russia uses the sputnik v vaccine and it is also planning to start the production of another vaccine soon called epivaccorona the delivery of sputnik v to argentina has already started and negotiations with other countries are also underway the development of the azd1222 vaccine by the oxford university and astrazeneca is behind schedule but the vaccine is likely to be improved soon this means that by the end of january the number of people with immunity to covid is already going to be high enough for rt to drop significantly below 1 and the number of new cases will decline greatly paradoxically the high contagiousness of this strain may actually accelerate this decline since a higher percentage of people will get the disease in a shorter time in february and in the spring two competing factors will be at work on the one hand a higher percentage of people will get vaccinated and on the other hand the people who had the disease in the fall will gradually lose their immunity theoretically this can cause a third wave of covid however this wave is expected to be weaker both in terms of infection rate and in terms of economic consequences the most important factor that will make the third wave milder is vaccination which will cover a significant percentage of the population by that time by april half of the population may already be vaccinated not just in the us but in other developed countries as well if covid s rt is estimated at 2 5 3 when completely unchecked then when half of the population is vaccinated it is unlikely to get higher than 1 5 this would make even the most basic quarantine measures such as masks sufficient for keeping rt below 1 citizens who fear the most for their health or are especially at risk can get vaccinated more quickly in case of new lockdowns people who are known to be vaccinated or otherwise immune can go on with their lives as usual which would further mitigate the economic damage pessimistic scenario the new strain starts the third wave if the new strain from the uk turns out to be contagious for people who have already been vaccinated or have recovered from the disease it would mean that the third wave would start and render previously acquired immunity irrelevant most experts believe that the previously acquired immunity should provide at least partial protection from the new strain despite that improvements to the current vaccines may be needed improving vaccines for new strains is fairly routine work the vaccine against seasonal flu needs to be modified once every few years this is a much quicker process than developing a new vaccine from scratch however in the current situation even a one month delay and the need to vaccinate tens or hundreds of millions of people may mean serious trouble for the world the third wave will effectively begin in january in the countries without lockdowns the third wave will spread even more quickly than the second one and for the countries that do impose lockdowns this would mean even tighter restrictions than in the spring there is a real risk that the main defense against the virus in most of the world s leading countries will be an actual collective immunity of the 60 80 of the population that will get the disease once more rather than vaccines the number of deaths will increase greatly and the vaccines will primarily serve as protection against future waves the markets how they may react and what they are saying now when we talk about markets we must understand that the investors are tracking the situation with the new strain carefully they watch the news and sometimes even directly consult the experts the correction on the stock oil and cryptocurrency markets that took place after the news of the new strain turned out to be small the most likely explanation for this is that financiers do not see the new strain as a serious problem the opinion of the investor community in this situation can be trusted even more than the opinions of the experts in the media as investors risk losing their money if they make a mistake every day more people are getting infected with the new strain and if there are no new signs of danger based on these new cases there are unlikely to be more in the future current data show that the new strain may increase the chance of people who have long since recovered from covid getting the disease again but the vaccines will still counter it new market crashes like those in march are unlikely that crash was caused by the high level of uncertainty whether the virus could be stopped how strict the quarantines would be and what kind of stimulating and restraining measures the governments were willing to take it is uncertainty that frightens the investors the most but there is not as much reason for uncertainty today even if the pessimistic scenario plays out the world has already had a lot of experience with quarantine measures and can assess their effectiveness the vaccines will only need to be improved rather than recreated from scratch the situation will be difficult with an even greater increase of the world s money supply the devaluation of the leading currencies a decrease in oil prices and perhaps indices but not all assets prices dropping by several dozen percent by

on august 27 1991 abia state was created there are many good things to celebrate about abia state e g abia has stayed constant in waec performance abia has always been among the top three states with waec pass rates enyimba of aba won nigeria s first and only champions league cup twice aba made goods i e sme manufacturing in abia nigeria have not died off instead they have been resilient and have survived even without government support abia was the first state in nigeria to have a privately owned independent gas fired ipp the geometric power in aba abia also has a vibrant non oil economy with palm oil cassava and cocoa yes cocoa abia is the fifth largest cocoa producer in nigeria all these achievements have come not because of direct government policy in abia state or the south east region abia is blessed to have aba perhaps the largest sme cluster in sub saharan africa which can generate enough internally generated revenue irrespective of crude oil price remittances yet how many government approved industrial estates are in aba aba is a residential town overtaken by manufacturers unplanned unsafe for sme manufacturing we have a few ideas for the state and region get a plan call in the technocrats agree and publish a 20 year plan to identify abia states critical competitive advantage and build on it abia state was part of the defunct eastern region that in 1964 was rated as the fastest growing in the third world by the undp the road map should have a clear target to make abia the most significant state economy in sub saharan africa by 2041 that s an apolitical goal and it is possible with vision action and responsibility the private sector base in abia already exists thus the government of abia must see itself as a business enabler via business friendly policies make it easier to do business in abia in the latest edition of the world bank ease of doing business in nigeria abia ranks 16th in starting a business in nigeria 34 in registering property and 32 in enforcing contracts not good enough making abia the num brand your success there is no abuja made in nigeria just aba made own that brand work it set standards drive it monetize it such a slogan should be accompanied by clear policies to attract smes to abia pass clear business friendly tax laws take infrastructure allow smes to pool together raise capital stock and invest in basic infrastructure they can claim it back in paye tax credits if an sme builds a solar farm and generates power to light up a street give that as a tax credit back to the sme if a state locates its manufacturing in abia from another state reduce their paye compete don t forget to go smart fix up aba from the simple widening of roads street numbering open space green areas and public sanitation to more ambitious goals of providing superfast broadband in aba abia state got approval for a 200 million afdb facility for rural access and mobility project ramp in abia in 2017 that s funds to link aba to rural areas and it should drive commerce build new modern industrial clusters in abia if cross river without oil could build tinapa why can t aba with 13 crude oil derivation fund earnings not build a modern industrial cluster with warehouses offices roads these infrastructure plans can be financed by the state issuing a diaspora bond to nigerians living offshore the state should provide the land and title as equity the cbn policy on foreign exchange transactions presents an opportunity to the state abia has an active diaspora draw up a remittance policy to enable that diaspora to send cash to relatives living in abia or in the southeast it should be possible for a citizen in austin texas to pay usd to say bank of america abia account in dallas and the abia government pays naira cash in nigeria the abia government can build up large usd deposits which it can deploy to importers at a profit to the state government the state foreign reserves can be used to import items on the cbn import restriction list the state wants to invest in an airport this is good but not urgent the state should focus on partnering with anambra state to build a railway from onitsha to aba julius berger has confirmed it can bring in any container from any port in the world to the warri port the anambra state shippers association has adopted warri port as its destination port of choice abia state should get investors to build bonded warehouses in onitsha with the rail link imports can come from china to warri then to aba similarly cassava exports can go from aba to onitsha to china abia s taxes from this port rail carriage and increased commerce will be bigger than 13 oil derivation bottomline abia and other states will do well to discover their competitive advantage and build local economies from that point while the post has used abia state these opportunities for regional synergies and taking advantage of the diaspora are open to all states in nigeria economic development has to start from the cottage industries in the states the states must prioritize local direct capital and enable commerce not just tax it

history books don t often report on the everyday workers who toiled to make a living cincinnati was a river town a frontier town a manufacturing town that was possible because of the blood sweat and hard labor of people who built this city doing many jobs that are long forgotten for the first few decades of cincinnati s existence workers were either artisans or laborers german immigrants had the money to purchase land and the skills to work in trades as butchers bakers and tailors irish immigrants who faced discrimination for being catholic were relegated to unskilled dangerous labor such as digging the trench for the miami erie canal and laying railroad tracks more why did cincinnati never finish its subway working along the river the arrival of steamboats to cincinnati s riverfront in 1811 brought a new trade shipbuilding the landing was also bustling with stevedores and longshoremen who hefted heavy parcels and crates up and down the gangways loading and unloading cargo when a boat arrived longshoremen were hired for the back breaking work which was non stop for 20 to 30 hours then they had to sit and wait for another boat and another job sometimes a week later this gave the wrong impression that they were loafing longshoremen were mostly irish laborers until slavery was abolished in 1865 and black workers took those jobs more floating palace circus boat built in cincinnati was the talk of the midwest in 1850s lafcadio hearn was one of the few journalists to write about the stevedores in his 1876 article levee life in the cincinnati commercial he wrote about how they lived and the songs they sang roustabout life in the truest sense is then the life of the black population of the rows and partly of bucktown and echoes of the old plantation life still live in their songs and their pastimes dirty jobs in the mid 19th century cincinnati was the world leader in pork packing earning the unflattering nickname of porkopolis filthy and odorous as it was gutters running red with offal and pig jawbones meatpacking was pivotal in developing the city s economy drivers herded pigs through the city streets to the abattoirs the largest of them in brighton the hogs were then processed through a suite of chambers where they were hung up killed bled and cleaned then cut up and the strips salted for preservation it was grueling messy work the mallet the knife the axe the boiling cauldron the remorseless scraping iron have each done their work charles fenno hoffman wrote in his 1835 travelogue a winter in the far west he described the beginnings of the assembly line or disassembly line at that time 120 000 hogs were slaughtered and processed in one year in cincinnati kathrine nero from controversial art to local brand flying pigs soared soap makers such as william procter and james gamble then purchased the hog fat from packers rendered it into lard and used large presses to squeeze out the liquid for lard oil the grease oil and fats were boiled then solidified into blocks of soap women in factories women often supplemented their families by serving as seamstresses but also found work in factories in the early 1800s because some men preferred to be their own bosses rather than work for another man many of the jobs were in garment factories where they slogged for extremely long hours in insufficient light and ventilation for meager wages ohio history central noted that women routinely worked 96 hours a week which amounts to 16 hours a day for six days a woman working in a shoe factory in cincinnati in 1850 earned 3 a week that figures to a smidge over three cents an hour despite the conditions the work was beneficial to women who were widowed or not married and empowered them to eventually fight for women s rights more dr elizabeth blackwell first woman doctor in the u s was inspired in cincinnati more in the way my father set forth family legacies are strong in cincinnati skilled labor back when the enquirer debuted in 1841 newspaper reporters publishers and printers were often the same person as newspapers grew in stature and page count the tasks became specialized typesetters were highly skilled workers who set by hand each individual letter of type upside down and backwards on a composing stick then placed them on the press the next day the typesetter picked up every letter and sorted them back into the appropriate boxes ready for the next edition as the steamboat industry faded in the late 19th century machinists who had built engines turned to manufacturing machine tools cincinnati milling machine co was founded in 1890 and became the largest machine building company in the world in the 1930s railroad engineers are still around but the engineers on cincinnati s five inclines have been gone since 1948 the main street incline was the first to open in the city in 1872 there were two platforms that carried streetcars up or down the hill pulled along steel cables cranked by steam engines the operating engineer worked the throttle and the brake from a cabin in the power house on the top of the hill communication with the attendant in the lower station was done with a system of bells although the engineer had a wonderful view of the city from his vantage point he was too busy concentrating on the two platforms moving simultaneously six times an hour 19 hours a day perks of the job after a hard day workers frequently sat down to unwind at one of the city s 2 091 saloons in the 1890s but in order for them to quaff a pint or two someone had to mash the hops pour the beer and roll the barrels from the hillside lagering cellars then load them onto horse drawn carts to deliver it brewery crews were not large but they worked long hours with the perk of free drinks gambrinus stock brewing co limited its employees to drinking 12 to 14 glasses of beer a day while on the job moerlein workers averaged 25 glasses daily that s a whole lot of beer more something to

by mei mei chu and naveen thukral perak malaysia singapore reuters in a sprawling oil palm plantation in the malaysian state of perak watermelon seedlings are sprouting from freshly ploughed earth between palm saplings while rented cows graze in overgrown areas of the estate a coronavirus pandemic induced labour crunch has forced managers of the 2 000 hectare estate in slim river to find creative ways to upkeep their fields even as prices of the world s most consumed edible oil are near record highs it is easier to pull out your own teeth than to get new workers now said estate manager ravi who gave his first name only i can t find the workers to maintain the fields malaysia the world s second largest producer of palm oil is facing a perfect storm of production headwinds that will likely drag global stocks to their lowest level in five years the southeast asian country is a microcosm of the difficulties facing producers of various edible oils across several continents from canadian canola farmers to ukranian sunflower growers as they struggle to meet strong demand global food prices have scaled 10 year highs this year the food and agriculture organization s fao price index is up more than a third since last summer due in large part to a surge in the price of vegoils that are vital for both food preparation and as fat in numerous daily staples the fao s global edible oils index is up 91 since last june and is expected to climb further as economies reopen following covid 19 lockdowns boosting food and fuel consumption of edible oils but producers have been battling a range of impediments including labour shortages heatwaves and vermin infestation that is driving collective stocks of the world s most consumed edible oils palm soybean canola rapeseed and sunflowerseed to their lowest levels in a decade malaysian woes in malaysia which accounts for around 33 of global palm oil exports the average yield of palm fruit bunches in jan june fell to 7 15 tonnes per hectare from 7 85 a year ago malaysian palm oil board data shows a drop in average crude palm oil yields to 1 41 tonnes per hectare from 1 56 tonnes over the same period last year many plantations were harvesting with two thirds or less of the required workforce after government coronavirus restrictions cut off the usual supply of migrant workers from indonesia and south asia more than half a dozen plantation owners interviewed by reuters said the lack of workers had forced them to extend their harvesting window from 14 days to as many as 40 days a change that compromises the quality of the fruit and risks the loss of some parts of the fruit bunches it is especially bad in sarawak some companies are seeing production falling by 50 because of the shortage of harvesters said a plantation manager who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media the slim river estate has delayed replanting and shut its nursery for the first time in 20 years to redeploy workers for harvesting another plantation manager named chew said he was forced to increase wages by 10 to retain workers less manpower to maintain the plantations also means more pests including rats moths and bagworms it has resulted in an environment that is good for rats to nest feed and breed and natural predators cannot catch up said andrew cheng mui fah a plantation official in sarawak at slim river ravi said around a quarter of the estate was facing a bagworm infestation that will skeletonise the leaves and cause small fruit bunch formation he was referring to the larvae of the bagworm moth that grow and feed on trees indonesian mills neighbouring indonesia the world s largest producer of palm oil does not have the same labour shortage issues and output is expected to rise this year as more area has been planted to palm however operations at palm oil mills where the palm fruit is converted into crude palm oil have been impacted by covid 19 restrictions said dorab mistry director of indian consumer goods company and major consumer godrej international shutting down of palm oil mills right across the length and breadth of malaysia and indonesia has been a huge dampener on the production side he said at the annual u s soy export council conference on aug 25 total 2021 output from indonesia and malaysia which together account for roughly 90 of world palm oil was estimated at 66 2 million tonnes according to refinitiv commodities research published on aug 4 that is about flat compared with 2020 but analysts said downward revisions are likely if labour shortages and pest infestations worsen north american dry spell meanwhile farmers in western canada planted canola into some of the driest soils in a century this spring sending canola futures to all time highs in early may a july heatwave then scorched crops throughout the canadian prairies leading the u s department of agriculture usda to slash its estimate of canola output by 4 2 million tonnes to 16 million tonnes the lowest since the 2012 13 season we haven t had much rain to speak of and the crop is withering said jack froese who has farmed canola near winkler manitoba for nearly 50 years froese expects a yield per acre of just a quarter of last year s level it s very disheartening u s soybeans have also been sapped by drought with the usda lowering its production forecast by 1 8 million tonnes in august from the month prior that is expected to cut u s soybean oil stocks to eight year lows and u s soyoil exports to decade lows we re looking at an average crop because we were lucky enough to have some subsoil moisture said jared hagert from his north dakota farm but you don t have to go too far west of here to get into some really rough crops in some good news for buyers brazil s soybean crop is expected to hit a record 144 06 million tonnes in the 2020 21 season driven by a 4 rise in the area planted to the crop agribusiness consultancy datagro estimated ukraine the top sunflower seed producer according to the usda is expected to lift output by 18 from a 2020 drought hit harvest and oil exports are forecast to rise to 6 35 million tonnes from 5 38 million last season according to its agriculture ministry worsening outlook still the outlook for edible oils production overall remains poor and stocks are likely to tighten further leaving the markets tight well into next year and adding to inflationary pressures according to some analysts in malaysia worsening covid 19 outbreaks will leave plantations starved of workers through the rest of the peak palm production window canadian farmers continue to face drought conditions leading official agency statscan to peg canola output down 24 3 and yields down 30 1 we have multiple issues with edible oil supplies worldwide palm oil in malaysia canola in canada and la nina curbing soybean output in south america mistry said we are expecting lower oil content in canada s canola crop due to the drought he said the supply tightness in vegetable oil is expected to continue well into 2022 the pressure on stocks is already feeding through to consumer prices and the upward trend is expected to continue especially as refiners lift prices to cover the surge in raw material costs singapore based wilmar international said a time lag between the surge in raw material costs and consumer price rises it imposed in the first half of the year had negatively impacted margins mewah group one of the largest refineries in the region said average sale prices for its bulk goods and consumer packs rose almost 54 and 24 respectively in the first half from a year ago everyone along the supply chain is absorbing some of the higher costs said oscar tjakra a senior analyst at food and agribusiness research at rabobank the cost push should continue next year with global consumers already facing general economic uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic further increases in edible oil prices will take a toll on many livelihoods due the inelastic nature of food demand several countries including nigeria egypt turkey and the philippines have all recorded big jumps in food inflation in recent months the price pressure may continue as higher edible oil costs are passed on by suppliers leaving consumers with little choice but to pay up for the staple even in poorer regions such as sub saharan africa where consumers suffer greatly from high prices consumption has only declined very marginally said julian mcgill head of south east asia at lmc international there

defence industry executives and analysts are starting to grow weary of interventions from across the atlantic meggitt ultra electronics and senior have all been subject to various degrees of bid interest last week another front opened as a large us investor signalled its belief that rolls royce the most blue blooded of british industrial champions is in need of fresh thinking on its board officials are already monitoring the takeover bids but the comments on rolls royce from california based investor causeway capital management suggest the government should show that it has a long term plan for uk industry jonathan eng a portfolio manager at causeway told the financial times that rolls royce needs more expertise on decarbonisation he also said it should explore selling the power systems business which has mainly built large diesel engines for yachts and trains causeway has been a shareholder in rolls royce since at least 2018 but it first hit the 5 hurdle for mandatory public notification in may last year when rolls royce shares were still gripped by lockdown panic since then it has built up a 9 stake which puts it ahead of another five us investors at the top of the share register the pandemic has made rolls royce vulnerable to pushy shareholders its jet engines business wilted as planes were grounded and its pay by the hour maintenance revenues disappeared forcing it to raise more than 7bn in equity and debt including from the government after raising the emergency cash rolls royce has tried to mollify investors even as it has had to delay expectations to slow its cash burn rate 2bn is forecast to flow out this year its 1 3bn costs savings programme still has 300m to go and another 1 000 of 9 000 job cuts and it is nearing the sale of itp aero to a consortium led by private equity investor bain capital this will all make for a tough first few months for anita frew the incoming chair the scot will take over from sir ian davis at the end of this month before embarking on an investor roadshow frew and chief executive warren east have no choice but to execute their plans for recovery as they wait for airlines to put long haul planes with rolls engines back in the skies it is hard to see too how some more board expertise in the technologies of decarbonisation could be a bad thing view image in fullscreen anita frew photograph rolls royce however frew east and the uk government must also prepare their longer term defence against further sell off pressure as rolls royce confronts the challenge of net zero carbon emissions the temptation to offload the power systems business to pay down debt is obvious but it should be resisted diesel generators are a mucky business that will be on its way out relatively soon but other technologies such as fuel cells hybrid power systems and micro electricity grids using various fuels could all play a part in the future of the global economy in ways that are difficult to predict now as well as potentially feeding technology back to lower aviation emissions at least there is no chance of an unsanctioned foreign takeover of rolls royce which is one of only two big defence companies in which the uk government still holds a golden share for obvious reasons it has a veto on a sale of any part of the business serving the navy s nuclear submarines but it must also be consulted if rolls royce wants to offload 25 or more of its other businesses rolls royce is already used to the longest of lead times in civil aerospace and in defence investments in technology at the frontiers of material science can take decades to pay off fully yet if ever there were a time to take an even longer view it is surely now and the government should be wary of anything that could damage the ability of rolls royce to drive forward lower carbon power beijing s new stock exchange will extend the state s control plans for a new stock market in china have heightened concerns that president xi jinping s nationalist agenda is taking flight the trading centre due to be hosted in beijing under xi s watchful eye turns the china first rhetoric into something more concrete according to the official news agency it will complement exchanges in shenzhen shanghai and hong kong with a focus on much smaller companies these make up the bulk of china s economic output and have struggled to access credit finance from reluctant banks during the pandemic once listed on the new exchange they can grow more quickly with funds borrowed directly from investors there is a logic to this narrative but few in china believe this interpretation when it ignores the broader clampdown on the activities of chinese companies at home and abroad not so long ago china was content for its largest companies to list in new york and other foreign jurisdictions and for rival overseas operators to dominate slugs of the domestic market not any more in the name of common prosperity xi has launched a crackdown on a broad range of industries leaving startups and decades old firms alike to follow a more tightly controlled set of rules reuters reports that officials want to have oversight of the algorithms used by chinese tech companies and prevent them from listing abroad if they hold data that poses potential security risks or contravenes ideological norms china is also building its own cloud system guo zi yun or state asset cloud in a direct threat to tech giants such as alibaba huawei and tencent holdings which are seen as following a western template in the way they operate businesses in china are in the grip of a populist agenda and the new beijing stock exchange will be a significant part of that the bank could have done better than an ex goldman pale male who s huw that was the first reaction of most commentators when the bank of england announced that huw pill formerly of goldman sachs and more recently a lecturer at harvard business school is to succeed andy haldane as chief economist at threadneedle street pill seems to have a solid enough cv but he had flown below the radar for most of his 30 year career to be brutally honest very few people had heard of him there s nothing intrinsically wrong with that haldane was not a household name when he became the bank s chief economist but he went on to use the platform to make a name for himself perhaps pill will do the same but his relative anonymity is not the only reason for concern for a start the last two chief economists haldane and spencer dale were plucked from the bank s own talent pool was there really no high flying internal candidate seen as up to the job it doesn t say much for threadneedle street s youth policy if there wasn t nor does the choice of pill square with the bank s stated aim of becoming a more diverse organisation here was an opportunity for the governor andrew bailey to make good on his pledge to make the central bank more inclusive and he spurned it of course it may well have been that bailey was keen to make a more diverse appointment but that no suitable candidate came forward those who think that pill is a good choice say the bank should not be in the business of virtue signalling this though is only a partial defence diversity is not just about gender or ethnicity it is also about avoiding groupthink with the state of the global and domestic economies so uncertain the bank s monetary policy committee has never been more in need of maverick thinkers it is questionable whether another alumnus of goldman sachs will provide that

taliban fighters gather along a street during a rally in kabul on tuesday as they celebrate after the us pulled all its troops out of the country afp photo taliban fighters gather along a street during a rally in kabul on tuesday as they celebrate after the us pulled all its troops out of the country afp photo menafn jordan times kabul the taliban hardliners celebrated their total return to power on tuesday with gunfire and diplomacy after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied airlift that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice aid crisis the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter the withdrawal came just before the august 31 deadline set by president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2 400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of daesh rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when a daesh suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6 000 more to conduct the airlift biden said he would address the nation on tuesday in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar airport uncertainty all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run
