anchovy you ll love these savoury parcels from helen goh yes you ll need to make the pastry from scratch but it s easier and quicker than it sounds and the result is definitely worth it the trick is using hot water to make the pastry that may sound counterintuitive we re so often told to keep hands and pastry cold but it helps keep the dough soft and pliable the wholemeal flour also gives a

earlier this month a thousand angry vignerons and their allies marched through the streets of downtown bordeaux calling for help to save their livelihood when they reached the doors of the bordeaux wine council civb the local trade organization they hung a dummy from a tree outside representing financially troubled grapegrowers at risk of suicide and piled dead vines on the doorstep the growers are demanding financial compensation in exchange for grubbing up their vines and no one on the place de bordeaux was surprised several officers of the civb took part in the march the region faces a crisis and grubbing up vines seemed the most direct and equitable solution trading for bulk bordeaux has skidded to a halt the vignerons are calling on the french government to subsidize pulling up vines in bordeaux s less prestigious areas they are asking for 10 000 per hectare but the government has said that european union rules prevent such funds and that is leading to a crisis and anger d√©j√† vu how did one of the world s most prestigious wine regions hit this point the problem today is not the price the problem is there are no transactions said christophe chateau spokesperson for the civb sales of bulk bordeaux are so scarce he said the civb hadn t published price quotations since october if you re getting a sense of d√©j√† vu you re not wrong for decades now bordeaux has been grappling with shrinking sales of value wines there are regularly similar crises every 10 to 15 year because exports are not sufficient for compensating for declining consumption in france said jean pierre rousseau ceo of n√©gociant diva in the years after world war ii the average french adult drank 150 liters of wine per year mainly red table wine that s nearly 17 cases per person annually or half a bottle per day today they consume 40 liters or four and a half cases per year spain italy and portugal have seen similar declines in france drinkers are not only drinking less they re drinking differently beer and cocktails are increasingly popular and when they drink wine they re showing a preference for better reds as well as white ros√© and sparkling wine back in 2010 following a similar price crisis bordeaux launched a strategy that meant structural changes they would eliminate the lowest category of wine and improve the quality and taste profile of the next category up as well as expand the production of ros√© and sparkling wines so far so good sales of bordeaux s sparkling wine or cr√©mant has multiplied by four in ten years we don t even know if we ll have enough stock to respond to the market demand said chateau at the same time n√©gociants have been tasked with finding export customers for the wine the french aren t drinking they ve done a pretty good job racking up record sales shipping to more than 100 countries from america to sweden to panama and demand for luxury wines is particularly dynamic but not value wines demand remains very strong for bordeaux s fine wines for export said rousseau much less for entry level and mid range wines at 20 starting price and below america is a lucrative market for bordeaux particularly mid range to premium cuv√©es it s the top export market in value but america isn t interested in the bottom of bordeaux s production a decade ago china solved bordeaux s crisis china first entered the market for bordeaux in force after the 2008 global financial crisis consumers there initially soaked up a flood of cheap wine that no one else wanted but not anymore for china the first eight months of 2022 we are down 27 percent in volume and down 12 percent in value said chateau it s not just the pandemic impacting sales china was indeed a huge buyer a decade ago but there has been a gradual reduction in consumption and a transfer to branded wines from other countries said rousseau chinese president xi jinping began a campaign against corruption and flamboyant spending after he took office the communist party quietly instituted rules on how much could be spent on alcohol at banquets average consumers began to reduce spending on wine consumption dropped very sharply dropping in 5 years from 1 9 billion liters to 1 billion local wine production itself has almost halved and that is the main competitor of inexpensive bordeaux rousseau told wine spectator for the lowest category of wine made in bordeaux the trouble in china leaves few other options bordeaux doesn t make money in this category we need to get out of it said chateau how much surplus wine are we talking about the calculation is fairly simple according to allan sichel president of the civb and a n√©gociant over the last five years the average annual crop for the region is about 480 million cases but they ve only been selling 440 million and of the amount sold 22 million cases are going at fire sale prices it s sold at very low prices just to turn wine into cash said sichel it s uneconomic to produce but they are completely desperate protesters piled dead vines in front of civb offices philippe lopez getty if you consider the wine sold at unsustainable prices plus the wine not being sold at all you re left with close to 60 million cases of excess wine per year or 500 000 hectoliters at 50 hectoliters per hectare on average that means pulling up 10 000 hectares said sichel local bank executives say about 500 local growers are in severe financial straits with no prospect of bouncing back then there are the growers nearing retirement who have no buyers for their vineyards or demand for leasing their vines meaning retirement isn t possible while the value of vineyards in prestigious appellations like st emilion or margaux has skyrocketed in the past few decades land prices in areas like fronsac and m√©doc have actually declined nor can the growers simply abandon their vines that s illegal abandoned vines are vectors for pests and disease which easily spread to other vineyards they must cultivate their vineyard or grub it up and the cost of grubbing up vines is 2 000 per hectare money they don t have which exit strategy what bordeaux needs for these growers was an exit strategy and after much discussion a plan was devised for funds from the french government but there s a problem we were hoping for a blanket measure of 10 000 per hectare for 10 000 hectares this was so we could engage in one big operation and over 12 to 18 months we would have solved the problem said sichel what is now becoming clear is that it s not going to happen the way we had hoped after calls with the french minister of agriculture and other government officials the answer was a firm non the european union previously funded such plans but current policy forbids its member states from using either eu or national funding to subsidize destruction of farming assets it s complicated said sichel instead officials are plotting a less straightforward more drawn out basket of modest alternative measures funds for the installation of a solar panel farm planting harvestable trees rezoning near urban areas growing alternative crops and for those needing help as they consider their future auditing and counseling services so they don t feel quite so alone there is also a social dimension these people have been farming their vineyards through generations now they re reaching the end of their professional career with no prospects completely stuck said sichel but the growers demand of 10 000 per hectare it is not possible and it s not fair to let people hope that it will happen said sichel which means as bordeaux continues to transition more pain and more protests are inevitable stay on top of important wine stories with wine spectator s free breaking news alerts
by david a lieb associated press jefferson city mo ap state governments emerging from the coronavirus pandemic built historic cash surpluses as inflation in prices and wages drove up sales and income tax collections now many states are reaping another reward banking millions of dollars off those surpluses as the federal reserve fights inflation with higher interest rates we re catching both ends of it said missouri treasurer scott fitzpatrick a republican first we received a lot of extra money he said now nominally we re benefiting from the increase in interest rates from the fed missouri is hardly alone states ranging from democratic led massachusetts to republican led texas as well as politically divided minnesota all are sitting on large surpluses that are swelling even further thanks to favorable interest rates on investments as legislatures prepare for their 2023 sessions governors and lawmakers are proposing to tap into those surpluses to cover tax cuts and greater spending on priorities such as infrastructure and education though most states can afford it financial experts are nonetheless urging caution because of concerns the u s could slip into a recession some of this is what i call a sugar high said phil dean chief economist and public finance researcher at the university of utah s gardner policy institute the growth rates are definitely not sustainable california could be a harbinger of economic trends after projecting an unprecedented 97 billion surplus just seven months ago state officials are now forecasting a roughly 25 billion deficit in the next budget california imposes higher taxes on the wealthy than most states leading to pendulum type swings in tax revenues as the stock market rises and falls state budgeters have labored through abnormally uncertain times since the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020 as governors ordered shutdowns to try to slow the spread of the virus layoffs skyrocketed and states braced for huge revenue losses but federal relief payments put spending money in people s pockets labor markets rebounded and the deep downturn was short lived state tax revenues surged well beyond expectations after back to back years of double digit percentage growth in revenues states ended their 2022 fiscal years with a record cash balance of nearly 343 billion according to the national association of state budget officers budgets are really strong historically strong tim storey ceo of the national conference of state legislatures said as he previewed the upcoming legislative sessions large surpluses put states in a position to benefit as the federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate seven times this past year making many loans more expensive in an attempt to slow spending and fight inflation texas had projected a 27 billion surplus for its current budget boosted by strong sales taxes and energy revenues that s likely to rise to more than 30 billion when a revised revenue estimate is released in january said tom currah associate deputy comptroller for fiscal matters that s a larger surplus than the annual general fund expenditures of 40 other states republican gov greg abbott promised during his reelection campaign that half the surplus would go toward property tax relief surging tax revenue in massachusetts this year triggered a seldom used state law requiring 2 9 billion to be returned to taxpayers large cash balances allowed the state to collect nearly 57 million of interest in october alone six times the amount earned during the entire 2021 fiscal year minnesota is projecting a record 17 6 billion surplus for the next budget a strong economy with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation pushed individual income sales and corporate tax revenues higher than originally projected political gridlock contributed to the swollen coffers as the republican controlled senate and democratic led house couldn t agree on how to use all the extra money thanks to higher interest rates on the huge surplus minnesota expects investment earnings of 428 million this fiscal year a whopping 1 427 increase over a prior estimate democrats who were victorious in the fall elections will hold full control of minnesota government in 2023 gov tim walz said the surplus could be used to provide tax rebates increase investments in education modernize infrastructure and add charging stations for electric vehicles we can do all of these things this isn t a choice of either or walz said virginia finance officials expect the nation to fall into a recession in 2023 depressing the state s tax revenues yet the state has so much extra money that republican gov glenn youngkin recently proposed an additional 1 billion in tax cuts and 2 6 billion in spending on education economic development public safety behavioral health and the environment our state government s financial condition has never been stronger youngkin said citing a large surplus missouri gov mike parson called lawmakers into a special fall session to pass what he described as the largest tax cut in the state s history the first rung of the eventual 760 million income tax cut takes effect in january yet missouri still expects to finish its 2023 fiscal year with a surplus leaving money to potentially spend on things such as teacher pay raises in the first five months of its fiscal year missouri already has earned 116 million on its investments nearly doubling the earnings of the entire previous year but fitzpatrick the treasurer advises caution for policymakers even though we re making a lot of money inflation is outpacing what we re able to make on our money said fitzpatrick who will take office as the elected state auditor on jan 9 he added we need to be careful not to commit the state to a lot of ongoing new expenditures pennsylvania s treasury is projected to rake in 275 million of interest this fiscal year 13 times the average amount over the past five years though comprising just a fraction of the state s overall budget the interest earnings would be large enough to run any of the state s cabinet agencies for a full year except for education human services and corrections republican treasurer stacy garrity recommended that budget writers put the extra cash into reserve pointing out that an independent fiscal agency projects a billion dollar plus deficit for the 2023 24 budget year we know that a fiscal cliff is looming and it s crucial that the commonwealth prepare as much as possible garrity s office said some other states also are forecasting leaner times under a recently revised revenue forecast oregon expects to reap 190 million of interest during the current budget cycle almost double the amount that had been projected just three months earlier the state expects a 4 billion surplus this year but state fiscal analysts also expect a mild recession in 2023 that could help flip the surplus into a 560 million budget deficit during the next two years the sharp rise in interest rates this year is akin to taking one s foot off the gas and slamming on the brakes the car will shake skid and even fishtail said a report by

hawkeye vodka rounded out the top five on the annual list of top sellers as they did in 2021 we ve turned a corner haven t we said karla zahradnik owner of westside spirits in cedar rapids the reason tito s sells is their branding is extraordinary zahradnik said either people go for cheap stuff or they go high end but it s interesting with tito s because it fits in everywhere it can fit in at a fancy restaurant or you can get it at a college party or college bar and people know it and love it or you can get it at a high end bar and people are putting tito s in their vodka drink it just kind

as restrictions covid concerns wane iowans set a record for liquor sales for the third consecutive fiscal year sales topped 431 million for the fiscal year that spanned july 2021 through june 2022 a 3 75 percent increase over last year s record of 415 8 million the alcoholic beverages division abd generated a significant return on investment to the citizens of iowa in fiscal year 2022 division administrator stephen larson wrote in the report the amount of sales and revenue generated to the state general fund was an all time record of 150 1 million an increase of 284 106 over the previous fiscal year the sales growth generated record liquor net profits of 120 6 million which will be used to support essential state programs and services income from liquor profits beer and wine taxes and revenue from licensing and regulatory efforts by the state agency translated into a transfer of 118 8 million to the state s general fund budget 30 3 million to the public health budget for the administration of substance abuse and prevention education programs and a new transfer of 1 million to the iowa economic development authority for promotion of tourism in conjunction with the wine and beer promotion board the report says local retailers attributed the increase in sales to an influx of customers venturing out including returning to bars and restaurants with the lifting of covid 19 restrictions and as concerns and hesitancy to be in large groups wane in person sales as well have increased and iowan s preferences have shifted preferring to trade up to higher end brands and branching out to try new things said michael ciemnoczolowski liquor department manager at john s grocery in iowa city it s a trend he attributed to higher wages and federal stimulus checks that fueled increased statewide spending last fiscal year ciemnoczolowski said the store saw a roughly 10 percent increase in sales from the previous year sales of gin and tequila in particular have exploded in popularity we ve expanded our tequila selection by about 30 percent over the past year or so he said tequila is probably the next big thing everybody wants the good stuff zahradnik of westside spirits has seen similar trends including an increase in bourbon sales particularly high end bourbons she said it s the store s no 1 seller followed by vodka and tequila everybody wants the good stuff zahradnik said people were staying home and saving their money and now they re getting out and they want to spend their money and i think a lot of people kind of educated themselves on liquor and alcohol and it has just become more of a thing to go to your liquor store and buy stuff than to go to a restaurant because so many people couldn t go to a restaurant or bar right as a result she said people learned to make cocktails at home i have so many people so many young guys especially during the pandemic collecting bottles of bourbon and now have like 30 bottles zahradnik said i really think the pandemic and forcing people to stay home really kind of elevated the sale of alcohol once covid 19 restrictions and concerns eased supply chain issues persist despite record sales supply chain and staffing issues persist within the alcohol beverages industry posing challenges that required flexibility from retailers according to the state division with the ongoing supply chain issues it was critical for abd to maintain a more diverse selection of products allowing substitutions to be readily available to the marketplace according to the state report ciemnoczolowski of john s grocery noted imports particularly scotch whisky can be touch and go there s still a lot of hiccups out there but not nearly as much as the previous couple of years he said there s a lot of stuff that s been out of stock for months or years on end that usually we didn t have much of a problem getting a hold of before 2020 zahradnik noted similar problems stocking product namely certain whiskeys through the sazerac company they re almost impossible to get and it s very frustrating for sure she said there s some vodkas that we ve had a hard time to get in stock but as far as the major ones like tito s we ve been able to manage ciemnoczolowski predicts sales will likely dial back a bit next year with the end of stimulus checks and ongoing inflation pinching family budgets people might be going back to their preferred brands from the before times he said the state s report can be seen at abd iowa gov annual reports comments 319 398 8499 tom barton thegazette com tito s handmade vodka

listen to this article listen to this article state governments emerging from the coronavirus pandemic built historic cash surpluses as inflation in prices and wages drove up sales and income tax collections now many states are reaping another reward banking millions of dollars off those surpluses as the federal reserve fights inflation with higher interest rates we re catching both ends of it said missouri treasurer scott fitzpatrick a republican first we received a lot of extra money he said now nominally we re benefiting from the increase in interest rates from the fed missouri is hardly alone states ranging from democratic led massachusetts to republican led texas as well as politically divided minnesota all are sitting on large surpluses that are swelling even further thanks to favorable interest rates on investments as legislatures prepare for their 2023 sessions governors and lawmakers are proposing to tap into those surpluses to cover tax cuts and greater spending on priorities such as infrastructure and education though most states can afford it financial experts are nonetheless urging caution because of concerns the u s could slip into a recession some of this is what i call a sugar high said phil dean chief economist and public finance researcher at the university of utah s gardner policy institute the growth rates are definitely not sustainable california could be a harbinger of economic trends after projecting an unprecedented 97 billion surplus just seven months ago state officials are now forecasting a roughly 25 billion deficit in the next budget california imposes higher taxes on the wealthy than most states leading to pendulum type swings in tax revenues as the stock market rises and falls state budgeters have labored through abnormally uncertain times since the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020 as governors ordered shutdowns to try to slow the spread of the virus layoffs skyrocketed and states braced for huge revenue losses but federal relief payments put spending money in people s pockets labor markets rebounded and the deep downturn was short lived state tax revenues surged well beyond expectations after back to back years of double digit percentage growth in revenues states ended their 2022 fiscal years with a record cash balance of nearly 343 billion according to the national association of state budget officers budgets are really strong historically strong tim storey ceo of the national conference of state legislatures said as he previewed the upcoming legislative sessions large surpluses put states in a position to benefit as the federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate seven times this past year making many loans more expensive in an attempt to slow spending and fight inflation texas had projected a 27 billion surplus for its current budget boosted by strong sales taxes and energy revenues that s likely to rise to more than 30 billion when a revised revenue estimate is released in january said tom currah associate deputy comptroller for fiscal matters that s a larger surplus than the annual general fund expenditures of 40 other states republican gov greg abbott promised during his reelection campaign that half the surplus would go toward property tax relief surging tax revenue in massachusetts this year triggered a seldom used state law requiring 2 9 billion to be returned to taxpayers large cash balances allowed the state to collect nearly 57 million of interest in october alone six times the amount earned during the entire 2021 fiscal year minnesota is projecting a record 17 6 billion surplus for the next budget a strong economy with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation pushed individual income sales and corporate tax revenues higher than originally projected political gridlock contributed to the swollen coffers as the republican controlled senate and democratic led house couldn t agree on how to use all the extra money thanks to higher interest rates on the huge surplus minnesota expects investment earnings of 428 million this fiscal year a whopping 1 427 increase over a prior estimate democrats who were victorious in the fall elections will hold full control of minnesota government in 2023 gov tim walz said the surplus could be used to provide tax rebates increase investments in education modernize infrastructure and add charging stations for electric vehicles we can do all of these things this isn t a choice of either or walz said virginia finance officials expect the nation to fall into a recession in 2023 depressing the state s tax revenues yet the state has so much extra money that republican gov glenn youngkin recently proposed an additional 1 billion in tax cuts and 2 6 billion in spending on education economic development public safety behavioral health and the environment our state government s financial condition has never been stronger youngkin said citing a large surplus missouri gov mike parson called lawmakers into a special fall session to pass what he described as the largest tax cut in the state s history the first rung of the eventual 760 million income tax cut takes effect in january yet missouri still expects to finish its 2023 fiscal year with a surplus leaving money to potentially spend on things such as teacher pay raises in the first five months of its fiscal year missouri already has earned 116 million on its investments nearly doubling the earnings of the entire previous year but fitzpatrick the treasurer advises caution for policymakers even though we re making a lot of money inflation is outpacing what we re able to make on our money said fitzpatrick who will take office as the elected state auditor on jan 9 he added we need to be careful not to commit the state to a lot of ongoing new expenditures pennsylvania s treasury is projected to rake in 275 million of interest this fiscal year 13 times the average amount over the past five years though comprising just a fraction of the state s overall budget the interest earnings would be large enough to run any of the state s cabinet agencies for a full year except for education human services and corrections republican treasurer stacy garrity recommended that budget writers put the extra cash into reserve pointing out that an independent fiscal agency projects a billion dollar plus deficit for the 2023 24 budget year we know that a fiscal cliff is looming and it s crucial that the commonwealth prepare as much as possible garrity s office said some other states also are forecasting leaner times under a recently revised revenue forecast oregon expects to reap 190 million of interest during the current budget cycle almost double the amount that had been projected just three months earlier the state expects a 4 billion surplus this year but state fiscal analysts also expect a mild recession in 2023 that could help flip the surplus into a 560 million budget deficit during the next two years the sharp rise in interest rates this year is akin to taking one s foot off the gas and slamming on the brakes the car will shake skid and even fishtail said a report by oregon s office of economic analysis the ultimate question is does it end up in the ditch or is the driver able to pull out of it

the pandemic and the war in ukraine has been a heightened concern for global supply chains major economies around the world are rushing to reduce their dependence on russian and chinese exports this has led to so called reshoring where countries seek to bring industries back to home soil rather than rely on potentially volatile imports reshoring is the biggest trend we are focusing on in 2023

meta and paypal we have recently invested in two north american railroad companies canadian national and union pacific says mr yiu the former is up 6 per cent this year and the latter is down 17 per cent both companies should benefit from increased industrial demand through freight haulage while blue whale has been hit hard by the tech slump its long term performance remains strong with a 52 per

funding are based on the 10 year treasury note rate plus a risk premium rate presently set at double historic norms in anticipation of a recessionary rise in defaults the result of all the pandemic related fiscal and monetary stimulus caused consumer inflation to exceed the fed s target of 2 to rein in and tamp down excess consumer inflation the fed bumped up their benchmark rate several times

prices going into the next year analysts have said brent crude the benchmark for two thirds of the world s oil has lost about 15 per cent of its value over the last month as concerns of a global economic slowdown weigh on the short term oil demand outlook bank of america bofa expects brent to average 100 a barrel in 2023 on a chinese oil demand recovery and a drop in russian crude supplies of about 1 million barrels per day amid eu sanctions this month the eu and the group of seven advanced economies agreed to place a price cap of 60 on global purchases of seaborne russian crude the ceiling aims to reduce moscow s oil and gas revenue while maintaining adequate supplies of crude on the global energy market preventing a surge in crude prices as a result of an eu ban on russian seaborne crude while the sanctions are intended to curtail the cash flows of russian energy their real impact in fact remains to be seen said ehsan khoman head of emerging markets research at mufg

a barrel in 2020 when covid related mobility restrictions wiped out fuel demand eu sanctions on russian crude including a ban on refined petroleum products that comes into effect on february 5 are expected to lead to a further reallocation of trade the international energy agency said russia s oil production could drop by 1 4 million bpd in 2023 after the sanctions come into effect the paris based agency estimated this is in part because both china and india the third largest crude importer are unlikely to increase their imports of discounted russian crude china s oil demand has lagged

petaling jaya the lukewarm response of investors on bursa malaysia to china s decision to allow inbound travel from jan 8 suggests a year end window dressing rally may not be on the cards analysts however do not discount the possibility the benchmark fbm klci inching higher to the 1 500 point forecast by some brokerages for the year end as thinly traded markets could trigger outsized moves click to enlarge the lack of exuberance from investors to china s decision to allow foreign travellers into china from january is a surprise and a sign that maybe a year end rally is not likely many fund managers are also on leave till the new year the decision by beijing is nevertheless very important as the relaxation of its zero covid policy has been rapid and outbound travel probably could be allowed a couple of months later said jason wong research manager at ifast capital while regional benchmarks closed in the green on china s covid policy move the local benchmark closed 0 01 point higher at 1 474 69 points but not before hitting a low of 1 468 points and a high of 1 477 points in intraday trade the local benchmark was edging to a lower close but last minute buying saw its close even for the day and a possible sign that local institutional buyers could be doing some window dressing to boost the value of their portfolios the extent of the window dressing varies stocks on bursa these past few days have been generally listless we anticipate some action on the last day of the year said former investment banker and high net worth investor ian yoong kah yin he added institutional funds are holding on to 10 20 cash or near money assets due to the general perception that there would be a global recession in 2023 fund managers are sitting on their hands in anticipation of this global recession which will impact malaysia too china s reopening has had little positive impact on our stock market most probably because of the high covid numbers in china he said news reports suggest the covid outbreak has spread rapidly in china since beijing moved to relax its zero covid policy following street protests and growing concern about its impact on the economy the spike in covid infection in china has however attracted fresh interest in rubber glove makers such as top glove corp bhd hartalega holdings bhd and supermax corp bhd on bursa malaysia yesterday top glove rose 12 8 or 10 5 sen to 92 5 sen while hartalega up 13 sen or 7 7 to rm1 82 and supermax 7 5 sen or 8 98 higher at 91 sen in active trade on expectations the bearish industry fundamentals may see some reprieve by the rising infection numbers in china and abroad the weak market indicated that many local investors could be in for another disappointing period in the local market which has been trading sideways since a brief rally post the 15th general election the improved political stability in malaysia seems to be undervalued by investors wong said the weaker economic growth forecast for the global and local economy in quarters ahead had not been fully priced in as local corporate earnings estimates remain relatively optimistic and have not seen any big earnings downgrades analyst reports on markets such as the united states also warn of the same problem with valuations yet to price in weaker earnings expectations moving into 2023 the federal reserve fed has warned that to get inflation in the us under control interest rates there would have to go above the 5 rate and remain longer which the market was by and large not expecting the narrative from the fed raised concerns about the impact that might have on the economy that is quite worrisome as bursa malaysia is currently trading at a valuation of 12 2 times price to earnings pe as compared with the three year average pe of 21 times signalling investors appear to be pessimistic and concerned on recession risks high inflation budget 2023 party and state level elections next year among other factors wong added local market price action was correlated to external developments going into 2023 but has reduced in the past few years as seen in the diverging performances between other major markets like the united states or china in 2022 he advised investors to be prepared when investing during an uncertain market one of the ways to navigate markets better would be to invest in a properly diversified portfolio that encompassed different asset classes regions markets sectors and individual securities with proper risk management strategies such as concentration risk limits in place

supported produced with financial support from an organization or individual yet not approved by the underwriter before or after publication news based on facts either observed and verified directly by the reporter or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources tired of waiting for the city to address housing justice baltimore s constellation of grassroots activists and institutions are charging forward to keep residents in their homes and increase availability of affordable housing sonia eaddy never lost faith that she would be able to save her home at 319 north carrollton ave in the poppleton neighborhood of west baltimore like they have done to many predominantly black neighborhoods developers have targeted poppleton for years over the past decade the city used eminent domain to evict residents and raze their houses resulting in the displacement of longtime residents but last year eaddy who is a third generation resident of poppleton was able to mobilize a citywide coalition that staged rallies packed public hearings and collected over 5 000 signatures to save homes like hers from destruction even after most of eaddy s neighbors were forced out of their homes after surrounding blocks were demolished and after she exhausted legal appeals she never stopped fighting in july 2022 her activism paid off when the city agreed to allow eaddy to stay in her home but she says it s hard to call that a victory until her neighbors who were displaced have an opportunity to return we are continually working to help bring back those who were displaced she says as part of the deal the city reached with stakeholders some residents may have the opportunity to return to their homes eleven historic alley houses which are small homes typically occupied by african americans or immigrant laborers on the 1100 block of sarah ann street located next to eaddy s will be renovated for homeownership in preparation for displaced former residents the group tasked with the renovation project is black women build a homeownership and wealth building initiative that trains black women in carpentry home restoration by rehabbing some of the 15 000 vacant and deteriorated houses in the city black women build is one part of a larger ecosystem of grassroots groups addressing the racial and economic disparities created and perpetuated by unjust housing policy in baltimore other efforts working in tandem to strive for justice in housing include housing associations the city s affordable housing trust fund a blight fighting social justice group and an equitable development company that restores abandoned homes to increase affordable housing stock why real estate tax breaks aren t working on a rainy mid october afternoon in baltimore maryland four dozen residents housing advocates and lawmakers rallied in the heart of the city s business district their demand to officials was to stop subsidizing wealthy developers at the expense of the city s long neglected black working class communities towering high rise office buildings swanky hotels high priced condos and the inner harbor a major tourist attraction served as a backdrop for the press conference that laid bare the city s economic and racial disparities the city is becoming unaffordable and unattainable to low and moderate income families said char mccready at the rally mccready is executive director of citizens planning and housing association cpha which trains tenant organizers to advocate for progressive housing policies like black women build cpha forms a critical part of the housing justice ecosystem officials have long sought to incentivize the creation of affordable housing by offering tax breaks to the real estate sector but developers are raking in millions of dollars in credits and subsidies while loopholes allow them to largely avoid building housing that is affordable for the city s majority black working people we feel these tax credits may be used to support segregation and encourage gentrification and displacement of bipoc communities said mccready developers in wealthy areas have received a disproportionate number of tax breaks compared with low income ones building 6 600 luxury apartments over the past 15 years only 37 of which were affordably priced investing in residents not developers at the rally in baltimore mccready stood in front of 414 light street a 44 story high rise luxury apartment building dubbed the tallest residential building in the state she called it an example of one of the luxury apartment buildings we speak of explaining it was why we chose this location questar the company that developed 414 light street received a 3 million tax credit from the city to build affordable housing but officials say the company has yet to market a single unit of housing at an affordable price speakers at the rally argued that if the city can provide subsidies to the wealthy it can do more to empower communities struggling to overcome poverty amid rising rents for substandard housing which remains in short supply a 2016 report found that more than half of baltimore renters live in housing they cannot afford city rents have increased 19 since the start of the pandemic at the time this article was written apartments at 414 light street were priced starting at 2 100 for a one bedroom a price baltimore city resident and housing activist tisha guthrie says is unaffordable for her neighbors and she surmised the company s employees would also not be able to afford living there guthrie also says that less than a mile away in her neighborhood of poppleton the community faces crumbling infrastructure a lack of basic services and deep poverty she s been a longtime supporter of residents like eaddy s fight to save their homes from demolition and she s advocated for the city to undertake community guided investment in those communities instead as a commissioner of baltimore s affordable housing trust fund guthrie helps oversee an annual city fund of 20 million to promote affordable housing through such projects as community land trusts as yes previously reported the commission was created and funded as a result of a decade of sustained activism and grassroots pressure guthrie has also been working to support her neighbors in poppleton like eaddy in their long standing fight against displacement beyond gentrification poppleton is situated between downtown baltimore and the infamous highway to nowhere an urban renewal program that tore a wide swath through the area and displaced 1 500 predominantly black residents before being abandoned in the 1970s the city has a long history of implementing such policies in 1910 baltimore mandated racial segregation over the following decades officials supported urban renewal and exploitative housing practices that destabilized neighborhoods decreased black homeownership rates fueled a massive racial wealth gap and concentrated working class black communities in slum like housing the harm caused by such policies is incalculable says guthrie it s not gentrification it s just a complete dismantling last year activists painted a mural viewable from the highway to nowhere that quotes sonia eaddy losing my home is like death to me it reads eminent domain law is violent as part of her longtime opposition to the development project eaddy helped create the poppleton plan an alternative vision for her neighborhood developed in collaboration with other longtime community members and a city planner it aimed to preserve the character of the neighborhood and prioritize the needs of the community but policymakers ignored it instead the city used eminent domain to relocate longtime residents and bulldoze several city blocks today the project remains unfinished and the neighborhood is littered with the remnants of the demolished buildings fighting blight and rebuilding neighborhoods the federal reserve estimates close to 4 in 10 baltimore residents are rent burdened meaning they spend more than 30 of their income on rent this is taken as an indicator that they may have trouble affording food clothing transportation and medical care a 2021 study found the median net worth for black households in baltimore was 0 compared with 59 430 for whites studies show the housing crisis across the u s has destabilized communities and furthered cycles of violence we found that at least 50 of the homicides that have occurred up until august occurred within 100 feet of a property with a vacant building notice says nneka n namdi of fight blight bmore yet the city s spending on its police department far outstrips its spending on housing and other social services just across the highway to nowhere parity homes an equitable development company is rehabbing three properties that will be available to purchase or rent for legacy residents at an affordable price in spring 2023 the organization works to address the concerns of the community by listening to their needs we really just try to think about all the ways in which people could inadvertently be pushed out of the neighborhood as it gets revitalized and we try to mitigate that as much as possible says parity homes founder bree jones jones has been a vocal supporter of poppleton s residents one key part of its work is supporting wealth creation through homeownership we integrate wealth through homeownership for black folks in particular who have been excluded from that for decades jones says jones and n namdi are part of a coalition working to end the practice of tax sales if property owners fall behind on their taxes the city auctions off the right to collect that debt for pennies on the dollar to debt collectors in 2020 over 1 000 residents lost their homes for what can amount to a few hundred dollars in unpaid property taxes the group raised money to purchase the debt of some of the homeowners jones explains we ve paid off the debts of close to 100 homeowners across the city who are at risk of losing their homes in the absence of a response from authorities on a scale that will address the problem jones remains optimistic that it will be possible with time to create and develop an adequate supply of housing that does not cause displacement we think that you can both revitalize the neighborhood and keep legacy residents in that

with a trunk full of paper stock charcoal and a giant easel in tow bessie mae kelley would travel the country for her vaudeville circuits in the 1920s kelley was an animation pioneer having hand drawn a mouse couple named milton and mary before there was ever a mickey or a minnie mouse she would apprise vaudeville audiences of the new world of moving cartoons in a budding industry called animation she even billed herself as the only woman animator on these tours yet much of kelley s story and work was lost to the pages of her own journals and left undocumented until now manitou productions manitou productions surviving materials from a collection featuring early animation walk cycles of avery and walt wallet two of the lead characters of the 1918 frank king comic strip series gasoline alley that kelley worked on earlier this year animation historian mindy johnson was on the hunt for female animators that may have been erased from history when she came across an illustration depicting pioneers of the industry in the corner of the image stood a lone woman that she suspected was kelley despite one of johnson s colleagues having written her off as a cleaning lady or a secretary women s roles have often been avoided or ignored or reduced down to a single logline of pretty girls who traced and colored johnson said but she had a theory that women in the vaudeville era were far more involved in the early days of animation than was previously known johnson followed her hunch and went down a rabbit hole historians only dream of manitou productions manitou productions kelley s vaudeville circular promotional photograph she began making cold calls flying across the country and knocking on the doors of kelley s relatives she eventually tracked down a great niece and great nephew who had held on to some of kelley s letters artwork and film reels some of it was damaged but johnson was able to piece together parts of her story and some of her film according to johnson kelley was studying art at new york s pratt institute when as a part of the first generation of cinema she fell in love with the medium she kind of made a nuisance of herself at the studios and they finally hired her on johnson said kelley began working in the industry doing menial jobs like washing film cells but she worked her way up and johnson said she was eventually working elbow to elbow with max fleischer paul terry and walter lantz animators who were household names manitou productions manitou productions a close up image of the opening titles from one of the surviving nitrate films by kelley kelley hand drew cartoons in collaboration with terry for his famed animated adaptation of aesop s fables including the mouse couple that came to be known as milton and mary even walt disney is on record as saying that when he began his studio in kansas city he wanted to make cartoons as good as aesop s fables johnson said kelley both animated and directed shorts that are thanks to johnson s research now considered the earliest known animated films that were hand drawn and directed by a woman this erasure johnson says is common in film it s common in life in general women s stories just are not told history is recorded preserved or written about in archives from a male perspective and particularly in the history of animation she said johnson s discovery of kelley s work set off a project that she plans to turn into a book and film about kelley and other previously unrecognized women in animation and earlier this week johnson presented her discoveriesat the academy museum of motion pictures in los angeles where she also premiered two restored short films by kelley manitou productions manitou productions the opening title card for flower fairies one of two surviving films which are the earliest hand drawn animated films that were animated and directed by a woman the first is a five minute film entitled flower fairies completed in 1921 it uses a technique called composite animation in which hand drawn animation is combined with live action footage the second three minute film from 1922 is called a merry christmas featuring stop motion animation in addition to composite animation johnson says animators spanning generations and several of kelley s family members attended the screening jerry beck jerry beck johnson presents her findings on monday december 19 it was a great delight to sit in the dark and look at the audience and see them take in something i ve been living with for years and to see it change their world johnson said johnson who teaches at california institute of the arts and drexel university says that discovering kelley s role in animation isn t just about filling in the gaps of history it also inspires a new generation of animators from underrepresented backgrounds in an industry that is still dominated by men for my students i can see them standing a little taller and more confident about their work and where they re headed when they know the pathway has been paved she said once they learn that women have always been there they ve always been in the room they can move forward copyright

a monday article from lena h sun at the washington post slamming vaccine hesitancy mentioned a few people of different demographics and throughout several different states when it comes to what may be to blame for chicken pox and measles coming back to the united states the images used in her piece however including the initial featured image focused on one demographic in particular orthodox jews in new york advertisement there are actually two photos of orthodox jews and none of the other many demographics residents of other states mentioned in this article further orthodox jews aren t mentioned until the 5th to last paragraph pic twitter com ywrlhutyik rebecca downs rebeccarosegold december 27 2022 sun begins by discussing a measles outbreak among eligible but not vaccinated children in ohio it is later pointed out much later that the somali population in the columbus area which is second in the united states only to the minneapolis area the following excerpt is mentioned in paragraphs 31 36 of the article which is 41 paragraphs long some of the cases occurred in columbus s large somali community the second largest somali population in the united states after the minneapolis area roberts said parents have said they intentionally delayed giving their children the measles vaccine because of their fear of autism she said despite considerable research disproving any relationship between vaccines and autism those fears echoed similar concerns of parents in minnesota s somali community during a 2017 measles outbreak that infected 75 children mostly unvaccinated preschool kids minnesota is also battling a new measles outbreak 22 cases as vaccine hesitancy around the mmr vaccine continues to be an issue said doug schultz spokesman for the minnesota health department officials are bracing for more cases in the coming weeks as families travel and gather indoors for the holidays at least 32 of the ohio children have been hospitalized some so sick they required intensive care most of the sickened children 78 percent are black 6 percent are asian 6 percent are white and 4 percent are hispanic according to columbus officials because the measles virus is so contagious an overall community vaccination rate of about 90 to 94 percent is needed to keep the virus from causing large outbreaks according to infectious disease experts in the united states nearly 91 percent of children have received at least one dose of the mmr vaccine by age 2 in the columbus area roberts said the measles vaccination rate is estimated at 80 to 90 percent but health care providers are not required to report data to ohio s vaccine registry even if overall coverage in a community is high measles can transmit easily in clusters of under vaccinated or unvaccinated people the columbus outbreak began when one or two unvaccinated people traveled to countries where measles is still common between june and october and infected others in the community roberts said somali is mentioned four times in sun s article but no photos are used of those in the community orthodox jewish is mentioned just once in the article text not counting the photo captions with two photos of those in the orthodox jewish community being included in the body of the article what was once included as the article s featured image with the caption of an orthodox jewish man walks with his children in brooklyn during large measles outbreaks in 2019 that spread rapidly among hundreds of unvaccinated people in these new york communities credited to johannes eisele afp getty images is now as of tuesday afternoon used after the article s 18th paragraph another photo is used after the 36th paragraph with a particularly eyebrow raising caption a sign warns people of measles in the ultra orthodox jewish community in new york s williamsburg neighborhood in 2019 it reads crediting spencer platt getty images it is not until the 37th paragraph that the orthodox jewish community is mentioned and even then it s a brief mention emphasis is added in recent years many of the measles cases reported to the cdc have occurred in underimmunized close knit communities where anti vaccine misinformation has gained a foothold in 2019 the united states reported the highest annual number of measles cases 1 294 in more than 25 years three fourths of those cases occurred among new york s orthodox jewish communities outbreaks have also occurred among the amish in ohio and eastern european groups in the pacific northwest advertisement as one can see from other excerpts somalis are discussed much more in depth and again there s no pictures of anyone in the somali community other than the two photos of orthodox jews and what is now a generic featured image of someone administering a vaccine in 2019 the only other additional material included in the article is an embedded tweet from the alaska department of health from december 1 2022 about the wellbee campaign reminding people to get the polio vaccine sun also discusses vaccine hesitancy by partisan breakdown and hones in on people who have not received vaccines including attributes as their names age profession and political leaning again there s no discussion of specific orthodox jewish individuals the cities included are detroit michigan albuquerque new mexico palmer alaska advice from officials in kentucky and south carolina are also mentioned as of tuesday afternoon the article shows that there was an update made at 12 14 p m on tuesday over 30 hours after original publication there is no direct mention or explanation however of the update the washington post once more tweeted out the article at 2 45 p m on tuesday with the new featured image growing vaccine hesitancy fuels measles chickenpox resurgence in u s the washington post washingtonpost december 27 2022 the tweet that was sent out a little after 10 00 a m on monday which now also includes the updated featured image has close to 700 replies calling the outlet out as well as 215 quoted retweets advertisement a wapo story about vaccine hesitancy in an ohio somali community has zero photos of somalis and two photos of hasidic jews from ny either there s a terrible shortage of appropriate stock photos or wapo has a disgusting antisemitic agenda that deserves condemnation pick one joel m petlin joelmpetlin december 26 2022 wapo reporter here s a story about a measles outbreak among somali immigrants in ohio wapo editor whoa wait a sec we can t use a pic of folks from a marginalized community that could subject them to unfair criticism or even persecution wait i have an idea jason bedrick jasonbedrick december 27 2022 imagine writing an article about prime rib and posting a picture of carrots that would never make it past the editors chef andrew gruel chefgruel december 27 2022 interesting choice of a photo about new york and a minority community used to illustrate a story about ohio does anyone think that if you stigmatize one minority that this will really make people more aware or just blame one group seth frantzman sfrantzman december 27 2022 the washington post on october 16 2020 published a perspective by staff writer valerie strauss on the problem with new york s ultra orthodox jewish schools during the pandemic then new york mayor bill de blasio also came under fire in late april 2020 for his targeting of the orthodox jewish community with regards to covid restrictions
a top figure in the marijuana reform effort effectively admits defeat for now what happened marijuana stocks both within and north of our borders took the wrong kind of hit on tuesday this followed the admission from a powerful and influential marijuana reform advocate that u s drug laws will not see a major change anytime soon few weed stocks escaped unscathed canadian company tilray brands tlry 2 81 saw its share price slump by nearly 6 while aurora cannabis acb 6 05 fared worse with a more than 7 decline american multistate operator mso curaleaf curlf 3 31 meanwhile fell in excess of 4 on the day so what the person throwing his hands up in defeat was senate majority leader charles schumer in a speech on the senate floor schumer promised to keep pushing forward with marijuana reform efforts in 2023 with this he effectively admitted that a recent last ditch lobbying effort by himself and a clutch of other members of congress had failed just before christmas schumer and 28 other federal lawmakers sent a letter to president biden asking to reschedule the drug a move that would de facto legalize it at one stroke that missive was clearly ignored as no action was taken that wasn t the first non success for pot reform in december earlier in the month many of those same legislators attempted to fold the safe banking act a measure allowing marijuana companies to access basic american financial services into the federal government s latest spending bill almost needless to say that effort also fell short now what so tilray aurora and curaleaf shareholders will have to find the patience for the renewed shots on goal that schumer promised for next year the good news is that marijuana reform has wide and broad support from the u s public it s only a matter of time then before politicians realize they can score easy points from this by flipping the legalization switch on the drug
by larry neumeister associated press new york ap a divided appeals court on tuesday rejected the insider trading convictions of four men including an ex government employee turned consultant prompting a sharp dissent from a judge who says the ruling may prompt insiders to sell confidential government information to the highest bidders the decision of the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals came in a case in which a washington consultant david blaszczak was charged with converting government secrets into hedge fund profits in 2018 a jury convicted blaszczak and three hedge fund employees in a scheme prosecutors said enabled the hedge fund workers to make over 3 5 million illegally for their company from 2012 through 2014 the securities and exchange commission said the profits reached 3 9 million before becoming a consultant blaszczak worked at the centers for medicare medicaid services part of the u s department of health and human services the sec and prosecutors said he boasted about access to government information about the timing and content of planned changes to reimbursement rules affecting publicly traded health care related companies in a 2 to 1 decision tuesday the 2nd circuit said it was reversing its prior affirmance of the convictions after the u s supreme court urged further consideration to consider its reversal of convictions of officials in the administration of former new jersey gov chris christie in that case the supreme court concluded that politically motivated conduct by the officials to cause significant traffic gridlock for several days at the new jersey entrance to the george washington bridge linking new jersey and manhattan was not a crime because they did not aim to deprive the bridge s owners of money or property in the blaszczak case defense lawyers argued that their client s information did not constitute property or a thing of value within the meaning of criminal laws pertaining to fraud and insider trading their argument as it related to most counts was supported by prosecutors in the most recent appeal the 2nd circuit agreed to reverse the majority of convictions and vacated convictions on two other counts leaving it to a lower court to decide whether a retrial on those counts will occur in a dissent circuit judge richard a sullivan blasted the ruling he wrote that it effectively permits sophisticated insiders to leverage their access to confidential government information and sell it to the highest bidders in this case hedge funds that used the confidential information to make millions shorting the stocks of public companies affected by cms s regulations he said the ruling also threatens to upend decades of settled precedent concerning frauds premised on the theft of intangible property and suggests in what amounts to dicta a curious and troubling rule of deference that would require federal courts to acquiesce whenever the government announces a new post conviction statutory interpretation sullivan said he disagreed with the majority s conclusion that confidential information held by a government agency is not property david patton a lawyer who defended blaszczak declined comment a prosecutor s spokesperson also declined comment copyright 2022 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed without permission
municipals were weaker tuesday outperforming a u s treasury sell off while equities were mixed municipals were cut up to six basis points depending on the scale while ust yields rose as much as 12 basis points muni ust ratios were steady tuesday the three year muni ust ratio was at 59 the five year at 64 the 10 year at 67 and the 30 year at 90 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the three at 62 the five at 65 the 10 at 71 and the 30 at 93 at a 3 p m read although late year volumes may be smaller the market tone is holding firm on the premise of no supply rollover demand somewhat typical for december but noteworthy for the level of volatility the market has endured said kim olsan senior vice president of municipal bond trading at fhn financial trade flows suggest buyers are quality and duration focused as outlooks for 2023 suggest a shift in policy at some point and with a modest increase in municipal supply she said the curve inversion is putting a pinch in the 2024 2026 range where bonds due in 2023 trade 10 20 basis points higher and with maturity options coinciding with an expected pause or easing in the tightening cycle she noted intermediate bonds with call dates of 2030 or longer are trading with tighter spreads to implied aaa spot levels while a haircut of 10 basis points or more is in play for comparable credits with call dates shorter than 2029 according to olsan the 3 yield to worst remains a strong play but with the caveat that it currently takes an extension of about two years into the 2035 range on the curve to reach that target from where yields closed in november she said a flattening theme mmd s 1 30 year slope is 68 basis points has forced full 30 year maturities into just 15 more yield capture from bonds due around 15 years she said olsan said that primary market activity represented the sharp rate selloff in 2022 every major category saw lower volume from 2021 total supply will register around 370 billion when december s tally is finalized which represents a drop of 16 from last year she said tax exempt supply fell about 10 while taxable issuance came in at less than half that of 2021 s total the contrast in average yields between this year and what 2021 brought is stark as it related to taxable munis providing issuers refunding conduits the 10 year aaa mmd spot average last year was 0 97 and the 30 year aaa mmd average yield was 1 54 olsan said a major yield pullback pushed those averages this year to 2 44 and 2 98 respectively new money volume held fairly steady from 2021 at 285 billion but refunding supply took a dive to just 45 billion through november as higher rates impacted activity she said the ratio of refundings to new money fell to just 15 from a 35 value n 2021 she noted while munis are outperforming ust for december the performance gap has been shrinking said jeff lipton managing director of credit research at oppenheimer inc he noted this can be partly explained by the observation that munis are catching up to the sell off in the treasury market if it were not for constructive technical conditions in the muni market treasury securities could very well be outperforming tax exempts month to date he said once again this year we are seeing a rare curve inversion for ultra short muni tenors as this part of the curve became quite rich relative to ust he said lipton said munis are well positioned moving into 2023 with rather enticing entry points and we continue to expect a break in the extended period of mutual fund outflows as technicals return to the performance driver s seat and monetary policy mayhem dissipates in a meaningful way he noted there will be the usual muni movement in lockstep with ust but expects to see some social distancing as conditions guide tax exempts to outperform in 2023 early in the year reinvestment needs and expectations for a moderate year over year advance in issuance will help to support the technical narrative according to lipton he said that a shift in flow patterns may not be present in the opening weeks of 2023 but anticipates to see more intermittent inflows with a more recurring string of positive flows later in the year deposits into muni exchanged traded funds have been the outlier in 2022 and we expect to see even stronger flows into this relatively young segment throughout 2023 he said high yield muni fund flows can also be expected to recover next year but security selection and structure will guide this premise lipton said secondary trading delaware 5s of

stage where traditionally expansion ends but looking at the unemployment rate the federal reserve bank of san francisco doesn t see recession as imminent the smoothed jobless unemployment rate exhibits a predictable pattern throughout the business cycle typically rising sharply in recessions and gradually declining during expansions noted thomas m mertens vice president of the economic research department at the bank its ability to predict a recession is on par with the yield curve he said the jobless unemployment rate is a reliable predictor of recessions almost always showing a turning point shortly before recessions but not at other times he wrote in an economic letter its success in predicting recessions is on par with the better known slope of the yield curve but at a shorter horizon hence it performs better for predicting recessions in the near term at this moment the unemployment rate doesn t predict that a recession is imminent although that may change in coming months mertens found the smoothed jobless unemployment rate bottomed out and turned before every recession except in 1982 while the estimated historical trend never turned at any other part of the business cycle the pattern he said resemble evidence from the treasury yield curve about recession the yield curve now suggests elevated probabilities of a recession mertens said for the jobless unemployment rate currently stand 16 percentage points below the threshold at a six month horizon and are thus still relatively low should the expectations in the federal open market committee s latest summary of economic projections hold he said and unemployment grows in 2023 it would trigger a recession prediction based on the unemployment rate since using this method low unemployment can lead to a heightened probability of recession when the unemployment rate is expected to rise

richfield and bloomington may soon allow more types of housing in traditionally single family areas with the goal of making homeownership accessible especially for lower income families and people of color who historically were blocked from owning homes richfield is considering allowing duplexes on lots now zoned for single family and low density housing while bloomington is tweaking its zoning code to decrease the minimum lot size for houses require fewer parking spaces and make it simpler to get permits to build duplexes council members in both cities will take public feedback and expect to vote on the new rules in january the larger goal is to increase the diversity of our housing stock and make homeownership more accessible said melissa poehlman richfield s community development director the efforts reflect a trend that s been growing in the last few years across the united states to make housing more affordable by easing density regulations and expanding housing stock minneapolis became a leader in the movement in 2019 when the city council approved its 2040 comprehensive plan allowing duplexes and triplexes in low density residential neighborhoods and eliminating single family zoning the plan which could triple housing capacity in some neighborhoods is being challenged in state court by environmental groups that argue it would increase polluted runoff and lead to more traffic congestion harming air quality bloomington and richfield are not alone among metro suburbs looking to make more housing affordable the roseville city council in 2021 voted to allow denser housing on some city lots a change that some residents said would hurt established neighborhoods other suburbs are adjusting development restrictions to encourage housing on oddly shaped or blighted lots outside the twin cities the rochester city council in september changed zoning codes to reduce lot sizes remove density limits and make it easier to develop multi family housing projects bloomington and richfield officials say their moves will mean only incremental changes in local housing markets but brenda lano wolke executive director of the nonprofit homes within reach said every little bit helps when it comes to making homeownership more affordable especially in those communities there are some very large lots that could easily accommodate a smaller footprint lano wolke said it can be easier for lower income people to get a mortgage on a duplex if they re receiving income from a tenant poehlman said and smaller building companies can better compete for smaller scale projects like a duplex than for a typical five story mixed use development the proposed changes to richfield s zoning code were inspired by the city s effort to help homeowners remove racially restrictive covenants from their house deeds through the just deeds project poehlman said participation in that really brought to the forefront how the deck was stacked against non whites in buying homes she said around the time state courts made those covenants illegal she said zoning ordinances on minimum lot size and bans on multifamily housing started popping up in various locations including richfield the median sale price for metro area single family houses in november was 392 500 according to the minneapolis area realtors with the median townhome selling for 285 900 nearly three quarters of residential property in the twin cities is governed by zoning ordinances that allow only single family detached houses according to a 2019 star tribune analysis of more than 100 metro communities regulations such as lot size or the number of garage stalls are common throughout the metro area on nearly two thirds of the land where only single family houses can be built a minimum lot size of a quarter acre or more is required at least twice the size of a typical lot in minneapolis or st paul those ordinances meant that richfield and many other suburban cities wound up with mostly single family houses and only a handful of duplexes poehlman said not everyone wants to or can own a traditional single family home and we need to create opportunities for those other types of families she said including families where multiple generations live together accessory dwelling units are allowed everywhere she said so why not duplexes bloomington has similar goals of building more affordable homes addressing the racial homeownership gap and encouraging more pedestrian friendly communities said glen markegard the city s planning manager when the city was first developed he said there were few restrictions on building homes many built in the 1940s and 1950s would not be legal under the minimum lot sizes and parking requirements enacted in the 1960s and 1970s now city planners are reevaluating those standards in light of the city s affordable housing goals markegard said bloomington s proposed ordinance makes 12 tweaks to the current zoning code including shrinking the minimum lot width from 80 to 60 feet and reducing the minimum lot size from 11 000 to 7 800 square feet requiring two parking spaces per unit instead of four and making it simpler to apply for a permit to divide lots and build two family homes the ordinance wouldn t magically bring down sky high housing prices markegard said but it could help around the margins bloomington is built out so any change at this point would have less impacts than if it had been made before the city was built out he said there probably won t be major new developments in the city s low density residential zones markegard said but the zoning code changes could help make financial sense for builders to build smaller homes for example a builder looking to tear down a house on a large lot and

about everything you could throw at the financial system has been thrown at it in the last 10 years these banks have not just survived but they ve actually thrived in a decade of public anger at the banks tougher rules geopolitical havoc the pandemic and some treacherous market swings banks were able to cope with all of that and not only cope with it but earn us1 trillion duke said loading analyst estimates show the six banks are quickly closing in on that feat us1 trillion in a 10 year period and that if they don t reach the milestone at the end of this month they will sometime in the first few weeks of 2023 it isn t just the scale of profit that s so startling though but the industry s ability to push through scandals and thrive anew ten years ago jpmorgan now the most profitable and valuable us bank by market capitalisation was in the doghouse after the london whale trading fiasco wells was on top of the big six the most valuable and the sole member of the group pulling in more than us20 billion though its earnings were later derailed over revelations of consumer abuses analysts see it nearing that level again in 2023 what didn t transform over those years is the broad outline of the business banks sell stocks and bonds trade financial instruments advise on corporate takeovers manage wealth handle payments and lend back in 2013 some traders were already mourning the casino style risk taking that dodd frank of 2010 threatened even if washington was still hammering out the exact rules paying for scandals to get out of the shadow of the global crisis the banks had to pay in 2014 bank of america agreed to a record breaking us16 7 billion settlement to end probes into shoddy mortgage practices passing jpmorgan s us13 billion by then some banks were mining new veins of profit that got them into trouble employees inside wells fargo under pressure to meet sales targets set up millions of accounts for customers who hadn t asked for them the most famous in a series of scandals that ultimately spanned most of its businesses and in malaysia goldman sachs finished raising billions of dollars in 2013 for a state owned investment fund known as 1mdb which was then pilfered by a group including the former prime minister my biggest regret in the last decade was not stopping the 1mdb transaction said former goldman partner robert mass a compliance executive each issue was vetted in some cases multiple times but in the end the answers that we received satisfied us mass who now teaches philosophy at hunter college in new york said the firm was misled by our own people who were in on the bribe in a way that we had no reason to doubt and could not disprove he wasn t sure if he learned any lessons other than to be less trusting the magnitude of profit makes those mistakes look like hiccups one person the industry can thank trump taunted banks on the campaign trail before putting two goldman alumni in charge of a tax overhaul that helped transform corporate profits banks that had gotten used to paying three in ten dollars to the government found themselves forking over less than one in five for 2018 their tax bills went down from there frothy time to be a banker jpmorgan boss jamie dimon credit ap new intensity that year marked a new intensity for wall street s growth banks that had made less than us70 billion in 2017 made us120 billion in 2018 thanks to tax cuts an uptick in interest rates and surges in retail banking and dealmaking their combined assets which hovered around us10 trillion for years began to shoot up the way top wall street lawyer rodgin cohen sees it all of this shouldn t be a surprise banks may be seen as always winning with a couple of exceptions because of their role in the economy said cohen who s now senior chair of sullivan cromwell they are intermediaries they re borrowing and they re lending the decade was a frothy time to be a banker personnel expenses for the six companies which had hovered around us148 billion at the beginning of the era before dropping for a few years jumped to us154 billion in 2019 never mind that their overall number of employees had actually fallen jamie dimon the jpmorgan boss who d already become a billionaire would eventually get such a big pay package that a proxy advisory firm told shareholders to vote against it loading one of the goals of a good society is that everyone including those people at the bottom have enough to survive and flourish said mass the former goldman partner who now studies ethics i am ok that people are paid well for producing products and services that increase the overall level of wealth in society but only when we combine that with appropriate taxation and sufficient social safety so that those at the bottom can flourish he added that he isn t enough of an expert to say if current taxes and safety nets are the right size lucrative volatility few things transformed the landscape of wall street as profoundly as the pandemic s arrival in 2020 to avoid economic cataclysm the us government rolled out relief programs for consumers and businesses and the fed bought trillions of dollars of assets the market mayhem brought back the volatility that trading floors crave corporations lined up to borrow raise capital or buy weakened competitors things were changing inside the banks too when police murdered george floyd that may diop found himself inundated with messages from classmates and colleagues it was from an actual good place and well meaning but at the same time you get 20 of those calls because you are the lone person that comes up he said it was exhausting to be everyone s black friend at that moment that september the news that jane fraser would become the first woman to run one of the big us banks was greeted by her colleagues with cheers but also frustration for how long it took i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it former banking executive anne clarke wolff i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it said anne clarke wolff a former executive at citigroup jpmorgan and bank of america who founded independence point advisors last year in 10 years at a big bank the ceo didn t spend 10 minutes with me and i was among the most senior women in early 2020 analysts were writing obituaries for wall street s run of record profits instead the banks helped spark the boom of blank cheque companies known as spacs later once regulators got jittery and prices soured investors were left holding the bag profits in 2021 also got help from an accounting move the banks felt good enough about the economy thanks to government intervention to release some of the reserves they had set aside in case loans soured the big six made more profit in 2021 than in 2013 and 2014 combined even when russia invaded ukraine this year the chaos helped traders defy expectations of hard times the tally of profits from the past 10 years eclipses the prior decade s even if you take into account inflation and big bank mergers during the financial crisis yet other corporate titans especially in silicon valley did too well for wall street to claim a monopoly on success apple alone made more than half a trillion dollars microsoft berkshire hathaway and google s parent company alphabet topped jpmorgan followed by exxon mobil edging out bank of america and wells fargo loading banks would attribute some of their gains to innovation after they invested in tech platforms and improved offerings including credit card rewards they ve also helped companies tap capital markets to grow the economy and they ve held on to some of the profit adding more than us200 billion to their capital buffers over the past decade to make a repeat of 2008 less likely critics would counter that the banks didn t do it alone many of them wouldn t have survived 2008 if it weren t for taxpayer aid and those buffers are the result of stiffer capital rules sometimes enacted over bankers strident objections moreover it was another government intervention that propped the economy up during the pandemic teeing up those record profits among other knocks some banks have focused on a narrower slice of clients limiting opportunities for many communities and have been slow to pass along rate hikes to savers betting that customers won t flee to smaller rivals ultimately banks fortunes depend on the health of their clients cohen said their epic profits will drop if the economy takes a downturn a real downturn he said diop s career shows the potential pitfalls two major mortgage companies he helped bring to the public markets during the pandemic are down more than 50 per cent battered by higher interest rates and economic concerns even when markets were ebullient diop worried about how things would look when the mood turned but you can t be on the sidelines for every deal he said this year he left morgan stanley to become an executive at hoorae the media company run by the actor and producer issa rae his sister i

street lawyer rodgin cohen sees it all of this shouldn t be a surprise banks may be seen as always winning with a couple of exceptions because of their role in the economy said cohen who s now senior chair of sullivan cromwell they are intermediaries they re borrowing and they re lending the decade was a frothy time to be a banker personnel expenses for the six companies which had hovered around us148 billion at the beginning of the era before dropping for a few years jumped to us154 billion in 2019 never mind that their overall number of employees had actually fallen jamie dimon the jpmorgan boss who d already become a billionaire would eventually get such a big pay package that a proxy advisory firm told shareholders to vote against it loading one of the goals of a good society is that everyone including those people at the bottom have enough to survive and flourish said mass the former goldman partner who now studies ethics i am ok that people are paid well for producing products and services that increase the overall level of wealth in society but only when we combine that with appropriate taxation and sufficient social safety so that those at the bottom can flourish he added that he isn t enough of an expert to say if current taxes and safety nets are the right size lucrative volatility few things transformed the landscape of wall street as profoundly as the pandemic s arrival in 2020 to avoid economic cataclysm the us government rolled out relief programs for consumers and businesses and the fed bought trillions of dollars of assets the market mayhem brought back the volatility that trading floors crave corporations lined up to borrow raise capital or buy weakened competitors things were changing inside the banks too when police murdered george floyd that may diop found himself inundated with messages from classmates and colleagues it was from an actual good place and well meaning but at the same time you get 20 of those calls because you are the lone person that comes up he said it was exhausting to be everyone s black friend at that moment that september the news that jane fraser would become the first woman to run one of the big us banks was greeted by her colleagues with cheers but also frustration for how long it took i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it former banking executive anne clarke wolff i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it said anne clarke wolff a former executive at citigroup jpmorgan and bank of america who founded independence point advisors last year in 10 years at a big bank the ceo didn t spend 10 minutes with me and i was among the most senior women in early 2020 analysts were writing obituaries for wall street s run of record profits instead the banks helped spark the boom of blank cheque companies known as spacs later once regulators got jittery and prices soured investors were left holding the bag profits in 2021 also got help from an accounting move the banks felt good enough about the economy thanks to government intervention to release some of the reserves they had set aside in case loans soured the big six made more profit in 2021 than in 2013 and 2014 combined even when russia invaded ukraine this year the chaos helped traders defy expectations of hard times the tally of profits from the past 10 years eclipses the prior decade s even if you take into account inflation and big bank mergers during the financial crisis yet other corporate titans especially in silicon valley did too well for wall street to claim a monopoly on success apple alone made more than half a trillion dollars microsoft berkshire hathaway and google s parent company alphabet topped jpmorgan followed by exxon mobil edging out bank of america and wells fargo loading banks would attribute some of their gains to innovation after they invested in tech platforms and improved offerings including credit card rewards they ve also helped companies tap capital markets to grow the economy and they ve held on to some of the profit adding more than us200 billion to their capital buffers over the past decade to make a repeat of 2008 less likely critics would counter that the banks didn t do it alone many of them wouldn t have survived 2008 if it weren t for taxpayer aid and those buffers are the result of stiffer capital rules sometimes enacted over bankers strident objections moreover it was another government intervention that propped the economy up during the pandemic teeing up those record profits among other knocks some banks have focused on a narrower slice of clients limiting opportunities for many communities and have been slow to pass along rate hikes to savers betting that customers won t flee to smaller rivals ultimately banks fortunes depend on the health of their clients cohen said their epic profits will drop if the economy takes a downturn a real downturn he said diop s career shows the potential pitfalls two major mortgage companies he helped bring to the public markets during the pandemic are down more than 50 per cent battered by higher interest rates and economic concerns even when markets were ebullient diop worried about how things would look when the mood turned but you can t be on the sidelines for every deal he said this year he left morgan stanley to become an executive at hoorae the media company run by the actor and producer issa rae his sister i actually already miss it a little bit he said i miss figuring out what s next bloomberg

values and show excellent signs of future growth soleno therapeutics trusts new gene therapy drug to boost value founded in 1999 and based in redwood city ca soleno therapeutics inc nasdaq slno is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company whose primary focus is the treatment of rare diseases they went public in 2014 and their life after the ipo has been rocky after all the company has an approximate market capitalization value of 35 million despite its shares trading below 2 that said the most recent numbers indicate slno stock is up as much as 294 62 on the year based on volume not closing value the current price 1 85 may not be too far up the 52 week range of 0 85 to 8 13 but the value is climbing rather quickly most importantly their price target is 8 00 representing an upside of 436 9 perhaps analysts are betting on soleno s successful launch of dccr which is effectively an abbreviation for diazoxide choline controlled release tablets this drug has been designed to treat the rare genetic disorder of prader willi syndrome this paternally inherited condition is characterized by partial deletion of chromosome 15 which results primarily in behavioral issues and some intellectual disabilities while the disease is rare it can affect as many as 1 in 13 500 people in the united states acelrx pharmaceuticals has the room and momentum to grow acelrx pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq acrx develops and commercializes innovative therapies specifically for medically supervised treatment arx stock has recently shot up to more than 348 ytd though its current market price of 2 20 indeed they are very near to a true penny stock their 52 week range is 1 76 to 13 so they have much room to grow if they want to reach their highest price this could be possible as they are trading nearly double their average trading volume 246 208 shares vs 137 755 avg shares while heightened trading activity can be a sign of strong interest it is important to note that the company is still negative in earnings fortunately a low price to earnings ratio of 0 33 could give them a bit of momentum to achieve projected earnings growth of 3 43 per share to 2 93 per share their most recent earnings report indicated that the current eps of 0 94 per share beat analyst estimates by 0 26 more importantly they beat last year s q4 eps by about 67 much like soleno acelrx also appears to be leaning heavily on their most recent project in this case the product is a healthcare provider administered pain management drug dsuvia sufentanil this is a sublingual tablet designed for acute pain management whose trial successes could have bold and momentous implications happiness development group is young but strong among those considered to be penny stocks in the healthcare sector in 2022 happiness development group ltd nasdaq happ may be the biggest surprise having fallen from nearly 100 per share in 2020 the stock finally started to level out at around 2 towards the end of this year with a current market price of around 4 the stock has certainly seen better days but has already doubled in value since its all time low last month the stock may not remain in nickel territory for long furthermore the stock is inching closer to the middle of its 52 week range 2 08 to 12 20 so if it does not grow quickly it could be a bit more stable than the others at least for now with that in mind the stock is very young having gone public just a little more than three years ago october 25 2019 so while they may appear less volatile than the traditional level of penny stocks though this would be more like a nickel stock they also have not had much time to waver still they could be a smart and affordable addition to a portfolio with some room for a small stock with a big promise happiness development group ltd conducts research develops manufactures and sells nutraceutical and dietary products while they are based in and market to the people s republic of china they also sell

as the fmcsa made clear its intention to issue some speed limiter regulation next year some 15 000 truckers and other industry participants commented on the federal register notice to mostly trash the idea and it s a fact that every owner operator i ve spoken to about speed limiters absolutely hates the notion of them being required equipment all but one that is new hampshire based robert ellis brings an interesting if rare perspective to the conversation ellis limits his 2016 kenworth w900 at just 58 miles per hour the truck gets 7 5 miles per gallon loaded he said and with another few aero touches he s hopeful he can push 9 it could happen recall that mpg guru steve kron an owner operator hauling in a heavily modified 2001international manages to pull 10 miles per gallon while averaging around 59 mph ellis should own his truck outright next year and until then i don t want to put much work into it he said of potential modifications ellis doesn t miss the speed i get everywhere on time he said also noting it s easy on the engine ellis pulls a reefer across the lower 48 for pdp trucking out of cedar hill texas and holds somewhat extreme views when it comes to speed limits i support a national speed limit of 60 mph he said and if anyone s blowing the speed limit the police should nail them as for speed limiters cutting down a driver s potential productivity ellis seemed to think that would be a problem for shippers to hash out not him indeed much of the driver outrage around speed limiters appears tied to the idea that regulators would go after professional truck drivers and not four wheelers who we all know it s easy to find routinely 15 mph and more above the posted speed limit in that regard ellis s opinion tracks more closely with the rest of the driving population partner insights information to advance your business from industry suppliers presented by eksatelecom introducing the eksatelecom s30 open ear air conduction true wireless headset overall his argument isn t extensive but boils down to two ironclad points the first is simple economics if you slowed right down you won t see the gas station as much he said the second has to do with safety speed kills if you have a wreck at 50 the damage is minimal compared to a wreck at 70 which is more likely killing someone you might get mad at me but you know damn well it s a fact that if anything happens it s less damage he said at his governed speed ellis recalled a particularly close call to illustrate his point a couple years ago driving with mary a guy spun right in front of me in the rain broadside in my lane he said i dropped the whole gear brought it to the left and just missed him the guy behind me tailgating he ended up t boning the spinning car by the time he got around my trailer he was too close to see what was happening i didn t touch anyone he said ellis also rejects the old school of thought that faster is better by recalling that in the old days like the 1970s loaded trucks didn t do much more than 55 mph anyway instead he chalks up the speeding to a me first screw you kind of attitude from some in trucking brought about by competitive natures and lest you think ellis just doesn t have the need for speed in his blood think again ellis credits his quick reflexes in the aforementioned close call to his days racing stock cars you make a decision and go with it there s no second chances he said of racing ellis hopes to get back out on his local monadnock speedway in keene new hampshire the site of the annual gear jammer truck show i told my kids to build me another stock car to race he said his goal is to complete a lap around the speedway on two wheels i wonder if they d count it as half a lap he joked

nurphoto via getty images like most years 2022 has been a mixed bag the war in ukraine rages on as does punishing inflation the stock market is well on its way to its worst performance since 2008 the height of the last financial crisis but after almost three years covid 19 seems relegated to the back burner according to tsa checkpoint numbers domestic travel is up over 2021 and is comparable to the last normal travel year 2019 what can we expect for 2023 the urge to dust off the crystal ball and take a look ahead is irresistible 1 international travel will eventually return full force in 2023 led by business and leisure travelers to and from china china is reopening to the world after three years of dealing with the covid 19 pandemic including the draconian zero covid policies of 2022 starting january 8 2023 travelers arriving in china will no longer have to quarantine this will be good news to thousands of chinese exhibitors and attendees of the 2023 consumer electronics show in las vegas which ends on the same date chinese citizens will also soon be able to travel overseas a development eagerly awaited by tourism officials from thailand australia the us and other countries in the u s overseas arrivals stubbornly remained 30 below 2019 levels in october something the arrival of chinese leisure and business travel groups will do a lot to fix 2 u s domestic leisure travel is back and business travel will soon follow the limitations of management by zoom or microsoft msft teams have become glaringly obvious even in a recession gotta get out there and sell your product your services your company yourself and there s no better way to do it than face to face the us travel associations says nearly eight in 10 current business travelers expect to attend a conference convention or trade show in the next six months getty 3 u s international travel is coming back too a recent poll says 31 of americans are more interested in international travel than domestic probably due to pent up demand united says it will add about 10 more capacity to europe and other destinations in 2023 delta says it will add 8 and jetblue will add paris to its london transatlantic service while inflation and high fuel prices have increased fares and most travel costs the dollar is strong against currencies like the euro and yen 4 airline stocks will come back as u s and international travelers do once the weather settles down and airlines fix broken systems of course this prediction has been made before when warren buffett dumped his airline stocks in april of 2020 american airlines one holding had fallen to just 11 57 a share on april 17 that june president trump said buffett had made a mistake selling too soon but almost three years later despite a huge government bailout that kept the airlines alive until traffic could return post covid american was still trading around 12 50 a share but as people book for what could be a record breaking spring and summer airline revenue and perhaps even profit will return 5 cruise lines too will come back an eye opening article in the street showed that royal caribbean and carnival have an interesting strategy to counter destinations like venice and key west banning the big boats instead the cruise lines are building their own private islands and ports as well as ever more luxurious ships that are destinations in themselves with such cruises americans will get off the couch or take the couch with them the cruise ship expansion mirrors the rv explosion of the pandemic years give people a couch a tv a bed and a toilet and they ll cruise the highways or the high seas of course this stock prediction could well be wrong while passenger numbers are up and so are prices for both flights and cruises that doesn t automatically translate into an out of the toilet stock price rise as economist john maynard keynes said markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent china news service via getty images 6 but not every destination will ban cruise ships or say tourist go home many destinations will mute their destructive hardball campaign against tourists a certain island state perhaps aware of the negative and contradictory messages it has been putting out about tourism recently reached out to journalists with a survey about their perceptions of the welcome being extended there seems to be more awareness that tourists frustrated by covid restrictions lack of rental cars and accommodations and accusations of unto wards activities might find a friendlier destination 7 virtual travel while an interesting concept will be a tough sell the idea is that groups will go on a live tour on zoom led by a local guide enjoy a guided live and interactive virtual experience exclusively for you and your group revisit a place you love or make new unforgettable memories somewhere else virtual travel does avoid real travel hassles and delays at a fraction of the cost 8 flying cars will not arrive again i look forward to seeing new flying car mock ups at ces 2023 and will try not to mock the movement too hard still many of us will want to think twice before these things fly over our freeways and houses 9 middle eastern travel will continue to grow with the success of the abraham accord and the opening of saudi arabia the internet buzzed with photos of the hotel abraj kudai in mecca which with 10 000 rooms and six helicopter pads has the potential to be the world s largest hotel despite the lingering effects of the pandemic the world cup in qatar was a travel success qatar airways operated some 14 000 flights during the competition emirates is dusting off its airbus a380 and other aircraft for renewed international travel long time runner up etihad is flexing its muscles with the return of the ultra luxury a380 three room residence first class suite and 28 upcoming flights a week from abu dhabi to the u s getty images 10 airline dreamers will keep dreaming impossible dreams a reasonably priced all business class airline la compagnie from the us to europe long distance nonstop flights to mouthwatering destinations like los angeles to the caribbean cayman air private jets for all who can afford to pay and everyone s favorite low cost long haul airlines like norse atlantic french bee level etc if half of these dreams promises and predictions come true 2023 could be a very good year to travel indeed

the year 2022 has seen the world economy limping on through the shockwaves of a barrage of unknowns and the year 2023 could be off to a fairly rough start due to the continued impact of such undesired events like the ukraine crisis the u s federal reserve rate hikes a worldwide inflation the energy and food crises as well as the lingering pandemic against the backdrop of such a volatile international landscape china has maintained sound fundamentals and pursued high quality development the resilience and potential of its economy have inspired hope among the international community world with more fragility ordinary people around the world have already been leading a difficult life in 2022 renting a house is too expensive the energy bill is too high to afford going to the supermarket often means snapping up vegetables in sales we may be entering a new era of great stagflationary instability nouriel roubini a professor emeritus of economics and international business at new york university s stern school of business wrote in a time magazine article in mid october devastating inflation has been felt in both developed and developing countries the annual inflation rate of the united states reached 9 1 percent in june the highest in almost 41 years and it remained as high as 7 1 percent in november eurozone s inflation has been in double digits for three consecutive months core consumer prices in japan jumped 3 7 percent in november the biggest since december 1981 t√£¬ºrkiye s annual inflation rate accelerated to 85 51 percent in october its highest level since 1997 inflation in argentina is expected to hit almost 100 percent by the end of the year the united states and its allies imposed rounds of sanctions on russia in hopes of choking the country s energy export channels and destroying its economy however those sanctions have backfired and hurt u s allies and have triggered a worldwide energy crisis the global economy is reeling from the largest energy crisis since the 1970s the energy shock has pushed up inflation to levels not seen for many decades and is lowering economic growth all around the world alvaro santos pereira chief economist ad interim of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd wrote in late november adding to those troubles is a united states continuously introducing destructive policies that weigh on the world economy by driving up global prices disturbing financial markets and undermining the global economic and trade order to bring down inflation the fed has raised interest rates seven times this year with a total increase of 425 basis points and signaled that it will continue to raise rates in early 2023 and will not begin to cut them until 2024 the rest of the world has felt the pain the international monetary fund imf forecasted that global economic growth will slow from 6 0 percent in 2021 to 3 2 percent this year many developing countries have seen their currencies weaken against the dollar while some low income countries are already at high risk of or in debt distress the global economy is dangerously close to a recession as inflation remains elevated interest rates rise and a growing debt burden hits the developing world world bank president david malpass said in october we are experiencing a fundamental shift in the world economy from one of relative predictability to a world with more fragility imf managing director kristalina georgieva said in early october a point of divergence the imf already lowered its global growth outlook for 2023 to 2 7 percent in october however georgieva reiterated in mid december that the likelihood of further downgrades in its projections will be high calling 2023 a very difficult year meanwhile many observers believed that 2023 could be a point of divergence with developed countries possibly sliding into a recession and emerging economies starting to recover an economic outlook note on the united states by oecd said real gdp is projected to grow by 0 5 percent in 2023 more pessimistically a recession probability model by bloomberg economists forecasted a 100 percent chance of a recession in the country by october 2023 the market has expected the fed to cling to its aggressive monetary policy economists surveyed by bloomberg see median estimate of the policy benchmark peaking at 4 9 percent in 2023 as the central bank will likely introduce two more rate hikes of 25 basis points next year inflation is eroding everything said jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer of jp morgan in early december when you re looking out forward those things may very well derail the economy and cause a mild or hard recession that people worry about things could be worse for europe the european central bank has raised interest rates four times since july with a total increase of 250 basis points in the meantime the eu s sanctions have largely reduced russia s energy exports to europe pushing energy prices higher and further exacerbating europe s pain
concerns as investors depositors dollarise their assets to beat double digit inflation the era of investors waiting for the central bank of nigeria cbn to squeeze inflation out of the economy to get better returns on investment is over after the cbn consistently missed six to nine per cent inflation target for seven years investors are now rethinking their investment strategies and divesting to dollar assets which posted over 32 per cent returns this year the 21 47 per cent inflation rate in november 17 year high and 11th straight month of acceleration has not only eroded interest income on savings but drastically cut treasury bills and bonds yields the inflation uptick also opened new investment route in alternative assets dominated by dollar funds assistant business editor collins nweze reports that although dollar funds offer higher protection against inflation induced capital erosion and accelerate foreign capital inflows to the economy allowing them to override naira assets will endanger exchange rate stability armstrong charles obi a nigerian resident in canada is one of the investors that have for decades prioritised diversified investment plan he knows the dangers of putting one s eggs in one basket which is one of the first lessons investment managers teach greenhorns but in january this year he took an unusual but decisive decision to elevate his returns on investment charles obi instructed his banks to liquidate his naira investments fixed deposits and convert the proceeds to dollars his investments in equities were also liquidated with the proceeds converted to dollars as a savvy investor charles obi had monitored with enthusiasm the 20 per cent return on investment recorded by dollar funds in 2021 and decided to explore that opportunity i noticed that many investors were scrambling for dollar assets which returned average of 20 per cent in 2021 as against seven per cent returns by equities and savings not wanting to be left behind of this year s largesse i decided to put all my eggs in one basket dollar assets he said return on dollar assets has risen to an average of 32 per cent in november 10 53 per cent premium above 21 47 per cent inflation rate while charles obi is counting his gains benson adigun a lagos based civil servant and equities investor had less returns on investment to celebrate nigerian equities had closed 2021 with average return of 6 07 per cent equivalent to net capital gains of n1 27 trillion as at november 30 average returns to investors at the nigerian stock market stood at 12 73 per cent equivalent to net capital gains of n2 84 trillion despite the uptick in equities market performance adigun s 12 73 per cent return is 8 74 per cent below 21 47 per cent inflation rate i know that my investments are not doing great when placed side by side the double digit inflation rate but i am better off than those that placed their funds in current account and absorbed the entire inflation heat still there are pockets of value in the equity market which are worth exploiting and there are number of listed companies whose long term internal returns on equity roe suggest positive long term total returns he added chief investment officer afrinvest asset management limited robert omotunde said although there are laws within the country that prevent dollarisation of the economy to avoid putting pressure on the local currency for investors with dollar inflows such investment is advisable it makes sense to take advantage of dollar investment opportunities for investors with dollar inflows there are portfolios or opportunities that you can take in different asset classes there is no over emphasising the point that investors that are going to beat inflation and get superlative return need to consider diversification by currency and united states dollar is a major currency diversification that we preach he said dollar assets in perspective despite the prospect of good yields by nigerian equities many investors are scrambling for dollar funds offered by many investment companies afrinvest asset management limited introduced to the investment market an open ended mutual dollar fund which pays as much as 7 5 per cent interest per annum the fund provides a significantly higher return compared to funds kept in a domiciliary account in nigeria or current bank account in europe or america the afrinvest dollar fund was created to help investors achieve income generation capital preservation and portfolio diversification in the short to medium term it was designed to deliver significantly higher returns and dividend will be paid twice a year nigerians will be able to invest in the fund with as little as 1 000 stanbic ibtc dollar fund was inaugurated by stanbic ibtc asset management to provide currency diversification income generation and stable growth in us dollar in emailed note to investors the investment company said it seeks to achieve this by investing a minimum of 70 per cent of the portfolio in high quality eurobonds maximum of 25 per cent in short term us dollar deposits and a maximum of 10 per cent in us dollar equities approved and registered by the securities and exchange commission of nigeria however there are operational issues that limit local investors from entering the dollar funds space for instance foreign assets investment policy set requires that only dollar inflows from offshore accounts and not locally sourced foreign currency can be invested in dollar asset head of research at coronation asset management limited guy czartoryski said review of deposits in top 10 banks showed that 40 per cent of customers total savings current and term deposits accounts are in dollars he said high net worth nigerians now prefer to save their cash in dollars many investment banks had floated dollar funds giving depositors and savers opportunity to hedge against naira depreciation high net worth customers of banks now prefer to save their funds in dollars with dollar deposits now 40 per cent of total banking sector deposits he stated he said the financial sector has also seen a rise in the number of customers liquidating their savings deposits and moving the funds to mutual funds where interest are now higher and risks lower the chief business officer optimus investment ayodeji ebo agreed with adigun on dangers of keeping idle funds while encouraging more people to invest instead of keeping idle funds ebo noted the reality of inflation spike is that it reduces purchasing power of the people even if interest or the return you are getting on your investment is below inflation rate doing nothing will make you worse off by investing in equities money market treasury bills or dollar funds you are likely to reduce the impact of inflation on your funds he stated ebo explained that although inflation is running far ahead of returns that should not deter investors commitment assuming you earn between 10 to 20 per cent returns it means you have been able to cut down your actual cost of living by at least 10 per cent in real terms your exposure to inflation is moderated by the extra income from investing which is better than just taking inflation 100 per cent he added he said the options available are equity investment treasury bills commercial papers federal government bonds corporate bonds federal government savings bond and dollar funds equity investment is the buying and selling of stocks listed on the nigerian exchange and nasd otc market treasury bills are issued by the central bank of nigeria cbn on behalf of the federal government commercial papers are issued by corporate bodies to meet short term obligations the federal government of nigeria bonds corporate bonds are issued by the federal government and corporate bodies respectively to meet capital projects he explained the debt management office dmo director general patience oniha said interest on fgn bonds is payable semi annually while the bullet payment is made on maturity she explained that the bonds qualify as securities in which trustees can invest under the trustee investment act they qualify as government securities within the meaning of company income tax act and personal income tax act and for tax exemption for pension funds administrators oniha said the fgn bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government and charged upon the general assets of the country treasury bills fgn bonds yields already market indicators showed that the nigerian treasury bills secondary market sustained bullish run as average yield contracted by 24 basis points bps to close at 8 23 per cent from 8 47 per cent recorded in the previous week buying interests were witnessed across all tenors as yields across the short and long tenured instruments contracted by 15bps and 72bps respectively however average yield on the medium term instruments expanded by 14 bps as the 25 may 23 bill rose by 75bps at the primary market auction last week the cbn offered a total of n13 58 billion across the 91 182 and 364 day instruments stop rates on the 91 days 182 days and 364 days contracted significantly by 99bps 70bps and 316bps respectively market report on rates movement showed the domestic bond secondary market sustained bullish streak as notable demands were seen across the curve despite 38bps rise in inflation to 21 47 per cent year on year hence the average fgn bond yield contracted 62bps week on week to settle at 13 47 per cent from 14 09 per cent recorded in the previous week a further breakdown showed that average yields on the short medium and long dated maturities 11 89 per cent 13 96 per cent and 14 34 per cent witnessed the most buying interest declining by 85bps 61bps and 43bps week on week respectively specifically the march 2025 the april 2037 and february 2028 instruments dipped 173bps 155bps and 117bps week on week respectively findings showed that nigeria has left behind in 2020 a 10 year period when yields on nigerian treasury bills t bills generally exceeded inflation allowing fund managers to invest clients money in risk free t bills with little need for sophisticated risk management banks benefited from this as the primary destination of savings as did pension funds however the fall in t bills rates in recent years combined with a surge in the value of fgn bonds demands a new level of risk management investment risk is rising as yields fall and fund managers and investors need to master risk management and learn the benefits of diversifying their investments across asset classes for instance during the period between 2010 and 2019 the average t bills yield was 14 7 per cent and this was on average 2 6 percentage points above the rate of inflation savers and investors had it easy during this period as all they had to do was to invest in t bills in order to beat inflation today at t bills yield is around 8 23 per cent and inflation rate is 21 47 per cent which represent 13 24 per cent gap that investors have to absorb hence investors have to be a lot more subtle about what they invest in take a degree of risk whether that means investing in fixed income funds credit solutions balanced funds or equity funds accordingly an investor s choice of investment is determined by different factors including if it is short or long term investment and the returns on investment available at each point of the plan while some investors are moving from termed deposits to dollars funds others are migrating from savings deposits to mutual funds the fixed tenured deposit is a tenured investment with a specific amount invested at an agreed interest rate and tenure at the end of the agreed period usually 30 to 180 days and based on investor s instructions the investment can either be re invested with or without interest earned however more savers are going for mutual funds where returns have remained higher in recent years managing director coronation asset management aigbovbioise aig imoukhuede said we are convinced that nigerian savers are making the long term transition from building savings with banks to a culture of saving with mutual funds at just 11 per cent of the size of the pension fund industry we believe that the mutual fund industry needs to support its momentum with confidence building measures first among them the adoption of market to market accounting and global investment performance standards gips aig imoukhuede said he said that after a 10 6 per cent decline in total assets under management aum in 2021 the industry is growing again with total aum up by 8 7 per to hit n1 52 trillion the compound annual growth rate for the mutual fund industry between 2015 and 2021 was 33 per cent or 14 per cent per annum in inflation adjusted terms inflation vs investors income in an emailed noted to investors stanbic ibtc asset management explained what rising inflation does to people s income and savings it said nigeria s inflation was at 21 47 per cent in november 2020 a 17 year high in practical terms the prices of goods and services increased by 21 47 per cent between november 2021 and november 2022 that means a bag of onions that cost n100 000 in november 2021 increased by n21 470 in november 2022 to cost n121 470 findings showed that when the demand for goods and services outweighs the supply buyers become willing to pay higher prices also when there is increase in supply of money without a corresponding increase in output or productivity in the an economy it will lead to rise in prices as inflation rises millions of nigerians that kept their funds in current accounts where there is zero interest yield got poorer and may not be able to meet their daily obligations because their funds are gradually losing value charles obi said i have learnt to invest in alternative assets instead of keeping idle funds in banks that is the best way to beat inflation and strengthen your purchasing power chief executive officer centre for the promotion of private enterprise cppe muda yusuf said that structural factors which constrain productivity across sectors especially the real sector decline in agricultural output exchange rate depreciation higher energy costs and security concerns in key food producing states were major inflation drivers these structural induced factors are beyond the control of monetary authorities and have made it increasingly difficult for the cbn to achieve its primary objective of price stabilization he said inflation tracks the rise in the price of goods and services which in turn shrinks the naira s purchasing power as inflation rises consumers can only purchase fewer goods with the naira input prices rise while earnings and profits drop leading to slow economic growth until stability returns pains risks of dollar based economy despite the benefits of dollar investments the international monetary fund imf warned that dollarising the economy could be difficult to reverse as a partially dollarised economy nigerian operates with dollar bias for international trade finance invoicing and of recent store of value in a report titled digital money and central banks balance sheet the imf said that once a country gets used to a bi monetary system the process is not easy to reverse even when the initial trigger such as high inflation exchange rate volatility subsides are addressed the optimal choice between domestic currency versus dollars will depend on the monetary framework and the benefits that each may offer as they co exist as two currencies the imf report added the imf explained that in a highly dollarised economy like nigeria there is extended use of the exchange rate for price indexation high real dollarisation and almost complete pass through from depreciation to inflation there is limited scope for fiat currency tax payments public expenditure non durable goods and low value transactions extended forex use for durable goods real estate capital goods and high value transactions also forex takes over the role of store of value as lending capacity in domestic currency becomes limited most loans become forex denominated when forex bank deposits are allowed it stated the imf said a bi monetary system embodies the failure to conduct monetary policy in an effective way such as secure price stability efficient payment systems and well functioning financial markets including long run financial contracts at comparatively low nominal interest rates it said that under high and persistent inflation as seen in nigeria market participants defend themselves by shifting to forex the most common type of dollarization is financial dollarisation or asset substitution caused by a poor performance of the local currency the local currency is used more for payment transactions but is replaced by the dollar as saving asset or store of value it said the imf said a bi monetary system limits the role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber as real dollarisation implies a high pass through from exchange rate depreciation to inflation financial dollarisation creates currency mismatches and liquidity risks for the financial system and the economy as a whole therefore the exchange rate amplifies negative external shocks rather than absorbing them the naira exchanges at n758 at the parallel market and n440 at the official market rate creating a premium of n318 the naira has lost over 20 per cent of its value this year due to persistent dollar scarcity and rising demand for the greenback cbn speaks on inflation spike the central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele lamented rising spate of inflation and the impact of foreign exchange shortage on achieving national development goals for emefiele nigeria s 21 47 per cent inflation rate in november was relatively high and at an unacceptable level he said higher inflation needs to be tackled with tools that can potentially constrain the economy s fragile output growth and cause stagflation emefiele explained that due to the resumed uptick of inflation rate in february 2022 the monetary policy committee has raised its policy rate four times from 11 5 per cent to 16 5 percent in november 2022 with the cumulative hike of 500 basis points so far in 2022 we expect period of sustained disinflation will soon begin the monetary policy tightening measures have led to subdued aggregate demand pressures expected to ease inflation he said emefiele explained that the combined efforts of the monetary and fiscal authorities to ramp up food supply and tackle age long structural challenges are also expected to moderate inflation expectations and drive down food and core prices in the medium term other stakeholders views the chief executive officer standard chartered bank nigeria lamin manjang said there was great uncertainty and volatility both globally and locally marked by rising inflation and slow growth we have seen a very aggressive tightening of monetary policy across almost all central banks in the world in nigeria we have seen the same phenomenon of high inflation but it s not all doom and gloom we have been through similar challenges in the past and we eventually came out of it he stated during the 2022 global research briefing in lagos standard chartered bank s regional head of research africa the middle east razia kahn highlighted the need for greater reassurance on forex and other policy reforms in order for nigeria to attract foreign investor participation in terms of the policy response nigeria has perhaps been more tested than many other economies a lot of the transmission of the different pressures into the great slowdown has been exacerbated by the policy decisions in nigeria still nigeria stands apart from many of its african counterparts simply because it is seen to be an economy that has scale she explained the group managing director afrinvest west africa ike chioke said investors should know when to enter into the market and most importantly when to exit the market with profit he attributed the shortfall in dollar supply to declining foreign direct investment foreign portfolio investment crude oil earnings and diaspora remittances inflows investors should be proactively defensive in managing their portfolios they should find high yielding instruments that will make them ride above the inflationary curve and get the desired protection for their investments he said yusuf predicted that headline inflation would remain elevated in 2023 because the causative agents remain dominant he said that a broad based harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies towards addressing the identified structural constraints will significantly help to moderate inflationary pressure in the medium term former executive director keystone bank richard obire said foreign investors understand the problems in developing nations like nigeria which require a premium for them to find their economy attractive foreign providers of short term capital usually require appropriate interest rate compensation or sufficient currency repricing to embark on investments in relatively risky climes these set of investors are likely to weigh the nigerian offerings in terms of interest rates currency and overall reforms vis a vis those of competing markets going forward all considered we expect foreign investors to remain mostly averse to nigerian risks next year he said according to him authorities should embrace more pro market paths to encourage foreigners to take on more naira risks there should also be policies that will attract longer term capital as opposed to fleeting hot monies promulgation and implementation of appropriate reforms improvements in ease of doing business provision of adequate infrastructure and tilt to a more liberal currency regime are some measures that could be adopted whether the investor choses to go for savings mutual funds t bills bonds equities or dollar funds is a function of diverse factors but whichever way the pendulum swings an investment in any asset is by far a better option than keeping idle funds and taking the inflation heat 100 per cent
