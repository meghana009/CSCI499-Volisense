example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video with voters focused on inflation and a possible recession the president is trying to convince the public that job gains mean better days are ahead washington president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our number one priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy the california congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries president biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when america needs to unite because he can t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living mccarthy tweeted this past week the american people aren t buying it still inflation is not solely a domestic issue after russia invaded ukraine energy and food costs rose and suddenly flipped the global dynamics as inflation rose faster in parts of the world with less aggressive coronavirus relief than the u s annual inflation in the euro zone is a record 10 7 much higher than the 8 2 in the u s meanwhile growth has slowed in china the pace of world trade is slipping and saudi arabia led opec has cut oil production in order to prop up prices and because the fed is raising rates to lower domestic inflation the dollar has increased in value and essentially exported higher prices to the rest of the world this has left u s voters in the curious position of not necessarily blaming the president for inflation even as they disapprove of his economic leadership
the write stuff mark billingham says writing his first work of fiction was the best financial move he has ever made best selling author mark billingham would hike up taxes paid by those profiting from the cost of living crisis if he were made chancellor the 61 year old crime writer who famously played dimwitted gary alongside tony robinson in the 1990s children s tv show maid marian and her merry men would increase taxes on energy companies private equity companies and anyone who has profited from shorting the pound in recent weeks he told donna ferguson that writing his first work of fiction about detective inspector tom thorne was the best financial move he has ever made his latest novel the murder book is published by little brown what did your parents teach you about money my mother taught me to work hard for it while my father showed me that money is just as easy to lose as it is to make he was a businessman who made and lost a lot of money they got divorced when i was six and my mother brought me and my brother up on her own she travelled around pubs emptying jukeboxes and fruit machines for the company that made them my father wasn t around he moved abroad money never felt like it was tight because my mum was extremely careful and worked hard we didn t want for anything have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes when i was in my early 20s although it didn t feel like a struggle at the time after i graduated from university where i d studied drama i helped set up a small scale socialist touring theatre company we d travel round schools and art centres and perform plays we had devised about the campaign for nuclear disarmament or sexism in the workplace we made no money at all so i signed on for benefits for about five years which paid my rent in a flatshare the food i ate wasn t particularly nice i remember buying eight beef burgers for 1 or if i couldn t afford that i d cook spaghetti in water flavoured with an oxo cube but i m sure there were people struggling far more than me have you ever been paid silly money yes in the late 1980s and 90s i was working as an actor and made crazy money appearing in commercials back then you could live comfortably on two or three commercials a year the silliest money i earned was for a series of adverts for a beer company for each day of filming i ended up being paid 10 000 including repeat fees all d to do was drink a pint and say it s a seriously good pint from an acting perspective it was not remotely satisfying but it paid the bills what was the best year of your financial life last year i deliver a book every year in 2021 i earned a good six figure sum because i signed a contract for three new books and got payments on signing for each of them the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was a limited edition elvis costello fender jazzmaster guitar for 3 500 i have far too many guitars than my limited talent justifies i have three or four that i play fairly regularly the rest are collectible guitars i take out and stroke i play an electro acoustic guitar for the band i m in the fun lovin crime writers it is made up of a bunch of crime writers including chris brookmyre and val mcdermid we play songs about murder such as folsom prison blues and psycho killer we played at glastonbury in 2019 and tour all over the world the fees are not enough to keep me in guitars but i have tremendous fun what is your biggest money mistake buying a moped the day i got it i drove in the pouring rain terrified thinking i could be in a car i took it back to the dealership the next day and sold it to them for 1 000 less than i had paid for it the best money decision you have made deciding to write a crime novel it took me just a month to write the first 30 000 words of my first book sleepyhead that turned out to be a smart move it has now sold more than 800 000 copies and has been published all over the world murdered that billingham with the fun lovin crime writers including chris brookmyre and val mcdermid do you save into a pension yes but not for my retirement i m 61 so i pay in lump sums and in three or four years time i m planning to take out the money and pay off my mortgage my accountant advised me to do that my backlist of books will be my pension by the time i stop writing i should have at least 30 books out which will hopefully generate enough royalties every year for me to get by do you invest directly in the stock market no i would rather stick needles in my eyes i m risk averse and i am not interested do you own any property yes my wife claire and i live with our kids katie 27 and jack 24 in a five bedroom house in north london which has probably doubled in value since we bought it in 2003 we ve also got two holiday homes a two bedroom bolthole in kent and a three bedroom house right on the water of the gulf coast of florida which just about survived the recent hurricane i get paid in dollars by my american publisher so i used that income to buy the property ten years ago rather than taking a hit each time i transferred the money into sterling it was one of my best financial decisions what is the one luxury you treat yourself to travelling first class i tell myself it s because i m tall and i ve got a bad back both of those things are true but actually it s just because i like the luxury of it if you were chancellor what would you do i would immediately hike up the taxes paid by those profiting from the cost of living crisis that anyone should be shamelessly profiteering while so many see their standard of living plummeting is disgusting so that s everybody from the energy bosses to the hedge fund investors and anyone with inside knowledge who made fortunes overnight from shorting the pound nobody should be getting rich as a result of this crisis it is as simple as that what is your number one financial priority to have enough money in the bank so that i don t have to worry about my mum who is in her 80s i want to be able to take care of her if she needs me to without it being a financial nightmare

a celeb deal with itv audun carlsen 43 is haunted by the 2007 ordeal that landed george 61 in jail he says i still see the monster that he is every time i see him it s hurtful that itv give him that platform the culture club singer was jailed in 2009 over the attack angry audun says george 61 should not be on celeb let alone be its highest paid star on a reported 500 000 branding george a monster audun 43 says had i been a woman and he did what he did he would never have been given the platform it s hurtful that big organisations like itv give him that platform i think giving him this sort of platform and a record fee sends the wrong message to survivors of violence and abuse and is plain wrong image julian hamilton sunday mirror boy george real name george o dowd has said he was high on cocaine and having a psychotic episode at the time of the attack he sought treatment afterwards and has been drug free since george pleaded not guilty to false imprisonment and has always denied a court claim that he beat audun with a chain but he was convicted of assault and false imprisonment and jailed for 15 months he made a comeback that included a stint on bbc show the voice and in 2017 he appeared on piers morgan s life stories and broke down talking of the event he said i sent myself to prison i told police why i did what i did i was having a psychotic episode i was a drug addict so i can t say my reasons for doing it were founded in any way but i told the truth i have always denied beating the guy image alamy stock photo image itv he also claimed he was beaten up in jail for being gay but audun has little sympathy he told us i still see the monster that he is every time i see him he hasn t changed i m not going to watch i m a celeb and i love that show i might watch him doing a bushtucker trial but i won t vote for him i won t participate being in there is too easy for him when it gets scary he can say i m a celebrity get me out of here i couldn t do that when i was chained to his wall audun and george met in january 2007 after the karma chameleon singer got in touch on a dating site asking if he could book him for a modelling job for his clothing range they met at george s flat in shoreditch east london drank wine and took cocaine but things turned sour when former escort audun said george made unwanted sexual advances audun left but the pair stayed in touch and agreed to meet up again three months later image julian hamilton sunday mirror he recalls he said he wanted to get milk i heard him talking i thought it was a neighbour then he asked me to come to the bedroom and there he was with another man they jumped on me kicked dragged me along the floor he handcuffed me to the wall and told the man to go saying he d deal with me from now on the guy was there for 20 minutes i was hooked to the wall for about half an hour i was s scared the other man was never identified judge david radford told the star at snaresbrook crown court that he acted with gratuitous violence adding whilst i accept mr carl sen s physical injuries were not serious or permanent there can be no doubt that your premeditated callous and humiliating handcuffing and detention of mr carlsen shocked degraded and traumatised him george denied punching audun or swinging a chain at him as he fled in his boxer shorts trainers and a pair of handcuffs audun has been in therapy for a decade and has been diagnosed with ptsd he says every time i see him i feel it all over again i have a permanent back injury two or three times a year i get a slipped disc i ve not used dating sites since i can t meet anyone because i get too anxious i get sceptical about people because i don t know what their intentions are george made a public apology in 2017 but audun who now works in hospitality didn t find it genuine and wants a personal apology he adds i can always forgive but it has to come from a truthful place the singer is joined on i m a celeb by dj chris moyles 48 rugby star and royal in law mike tindall 44 and loose women panellist charlene white 42 audun goes on i think he will be in control calculating he knows exactly what he is doing but there will be times when the mask slips when there s no food only cockroaches to eat i think a person with a kind personality will win he doesn t deserve to be a winner in court george claimed audun had stolen pictures and data from his laptop he admitted handcuffing him to a wall but said it was in order to trace the missing property george rose to fame in the 1980s with hits like do you really want to hurt me and it s a miracle his drug issues were widely reported and he slowly drifted away from the pop scene in 2006 he was given community service after pleading guilty to falsely reporting a burglary at his new york apartment tonight an itv source defended the channel s decision to hire george they said this is a historic spent conviction and george has appeared on major tv networks globally on numerous occasions since over the last decade a spokesman for the star said george went to jail for four months willingly after openly confessing to false imprisonment during a psychotic break 15 years ago whilst in the midst of a well documented drug problem not only has he been a pillar of society ever since but he also remains sober to this day he apologised publicly on piers morgan s life stories and we are very proud of him for his rehabilitation everyone is entitled to a second chance and george has certainly earned it i m a celeb is the latest primetime itv show to face controversy the broadcaster improved aftercare after the suicides of a guest on the jeremy kyle show and two love island contestants

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

by nathaniel meyersohn cnn business cnn chances are you ve been there you head to trader joe s to buy caramel popcorn churro bites and roasted gorgonzola crackers or to costco for its kirkland signature mini peanut butter cups and take and bake pizza but when you get to the store your favorite treats aren t on the shelf and to your horror you learn they re not coming back they ve been discontinued it s one of the most disappointing experiences as a grocery shopper why a beloved product has disappeared ranks as one of the most common questions customers ask stores fans run social media accounts dedicated to tracking discontinued products at trader joe s and others blog about long lost items at costco we understand that it can be disappointing devastating even trader joe s says on its discontinued product feedback contact page for customers there are several reasons trader joe s costco and other stores suddenly stop selling customer favorites sometimes products are seasonal or a manufacturer always planned to make them for a limited time also for stores like costco and trader joe s discontinuing items can reinforce the treasure hunt like appeal of these stores but more often other strategies are at play one major factor it s difficult to get shelf space inside trader joe s and costco and stay there these companies sell a limited number of items only the products in highest demand from customers that s quite a different strategy from supermarkets as well as the likes of walmart and amazon which offer a wide array of foods and brands costco for example sells around 4 000 different products at a given time traditional supermarkets typically sell 40 000 both companies ability to keep prices below most of their competitors hinges on turning over high volumes of top selling merchandise every minute every day if an item isn t selling fast enough on the shelf at trader joe s or is collecting dust at costco warehouses the companies need to switch to something else that customers will snap up if you don t have high volume or growing volume the costs of producing and handling a slow selling product are such that it doesn t make business sense trader joe s vice president of marketing matt sloan said in a company podcast earlier this year other times it s the product itself companies will pull items if suppliers raise the price too much or the quality drops costco would rather not sell an item than sell it at a price that s too high said chuck howard an assistant professor of marketing at texas a m s mays business school it would be off brand for them to be selling things that consumers think would be too expensive for example about five years ago costco replaced a 27 10 pound boneless skinless frozen chicken breast from perdue with a 21 99 wayne farms version said marcus walker an assistant buyer of frozen foods at costco from 2005 to 2020 items that are cheaper at other stores are also prime to eliminate costco wants its products to be the lowest priced option it pulled hot pockets because it wasn t able to match sam s club prices on the product walker said costco s teams buy their suppliers products at competitors stores and test them to compare the quality against costco s if they find an item tastes better somewhere else they ll ask the supplier to improve it for costco walker said and if that doesn t happen costco will look to replace it another issue which the pandemic underscored is the stability of product supply if a manufacturer can t produce enough of an item the companies will stop selling it and replace it with something they can consistently keep on shelves in 2020 and 2021 with demand sky high from customers stocking up on groceries during the pandemic manufacturers halted production of many secondary products to make only their highest demand items and even as demand eased this year and factories returned to running at more normal capacity manufacturers still aren t making as wide a variety of items as they did before the pandemic hormel foods the maker of skippy and spam and mondelez which owns brands like oreo are among the companies that have said recently they are reducing the number of products they re selling to focus on their top performing ones angela ackerman who runs the instagram account costcoguide with more than 230 000 followers said costco fans often ask her why they can t find costco s dried dark chocolate mangoes in particular they fall in love with something and want to see it again she said scarcity can fuel sales as ackerman knows when she sees a notice at costco that it will no longer sell a prized item she buys more before it runs out if i know it s going to be gone i stock up the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved

if road tripping and hill walking are among your ideal vacation pastimes you might want to stop reading right now if however a tropical paradise sounds good to you then continue because that s exactly what the maldives delivers the longest road in the country is only 14 kilometers and the highest peak is a mere five meters above sea level check out the view from up there when you re at the eighth tee on the villingili island golf course the entire nation is just twice the size of miami but with over 660 kilometers of beaches and 1 200 islands maldives must rank among the world s premier venues for luxury beach bumming malé home to a third of all maldivians is one of the most densely populated cities in asia on many of the rural islands however you can experience a more timeless side of island life among coconut groves and stands of banana papaya and drumstick trees malé home to a third of all maldivians photo adobe stock whether you arrive at one of its many resorts by traditional dhoni boat or seaplane you re likely to be greeted by boda beru big drums music this is the sort of peaceful welcome that was familiar to sailors back in the 12th century despite their hospitable attitude however the maldivian people had a somewhat fearsome reputation among early seafarers the indian pirates do not attack them and cause them no alarm noted ibn battuta the legendary moroccan explorer when he visited the sultanate in 1343 for they have found that whoever takes anything of theirs is struck with a sudden calamity in fact battuta reported that any crewmember of an indian ship would be beaten for the offense of harming or insulting an islander such was the fear of divine retribution many locals will tell you that it was battuta who brought islam now the official religion to these islands but in his memoirs he told the tale of a countryman of his a berber named abou ibérécót who had vanquished demons here and subsequently converted the people to islam walking on the beaches you re likely to notice the domed back and snaggle toothed undersides of the golden cowries once among the maldive islands most prized exports they were so sought after that local women would leave woven palm mats in the sea as floating gardens to attract the cowry mollusks in battuta s time these shells served as currency and they were exported as far afield as bengal and yemen a honeymooners favorite you might imagine that the maldivian reputation as the perfect honeymoon destination was a relatively new thing but even centuries ago there was apparently something irresistibly romantic about these islands i married in that country many wives battuta wrote of the 18 months he lived in maldives in his case it wasn t necessarily a happily ever after fairytale ending however when he left he abandoned all his wives and instead sent for a slave girl i was fond of recently maldives tourism has focused as much on diving as on honeymoons the upwelling currents of the chagos laccadive ridge make this one of the richest places on the planet for marine life these tropical waters boast 2 000 species of fish 12 kinds of whales and dolphins and 145 types of crabs you ll also find 200 types of coral about three times as many as there are in the entire caribbean sea most resorts offer diving courses but if you prefer simply to snorkel the good news is that the shallow lagoons and barrier reefs showcase spectacular marine life within just a couple of meters of the surface fishing is another favorite activity and surfing has come of age in recent years see sidebar all the best resorts now have dedicated surf teams who can advise and accompany you to outlying breaks if relaxation rather than action is what floats your boat during vacations note that stand up paddleboarding offers a more tranquil way to get out on the waters you might still get a jolt of energy as you watch one of the harmless but surprisingly plentiful white tipped reef sharks scything through the water below you photo adobe stock spas and seaplanes whether it s for unadulterated relaxation or to unwind knotted muscles after a bout in the waves be sure to check out one of the maldives world class spas the one at four seasons kuda huraa is said to be the only spa set on its own private island and part of the experience is in the short voyage over on a dhoni if you want to travel more widely and a lot faster and farther try a scenic flight in a seaplane which is almost certainly the most exclusive and most exciting maldivian vacation experience gourmet dining is widely available it s unusual for visitors to dine off property so if you are staying for more than a few days try to opt for a resort with a variety of options yellowfin and skipjack tuna are regional highlights and be sure to sample a maldivian barbecue apart from seafood and tropical fruit and vegetables almost everything is imported high level resorts offer specialties from all over the world so you won t need to do without french champagne and wagyu beef for example for family holidays there are beaches pools clubs for kids spas and a whole range of activities from adrenalin watersports to shark feeding to reef exploration to village visits getting bored is about the only thing that it s impossible to do in the maldives mark eveleigh traveled to the maldives on an expense paid press trip covering the four seasons surfing champions trophy a surfer s paradise it wasn t maldives s flat smooth water that brought me to these islands i still recall the first time i saw the country featured in a surfing magazine and assumed that it must have been an error it seemed impossible that an archipelago that was internationally renowned as a diver s daydream could also be a surfer s paradise since then surfing in the maldives has come of age and i arrived at the islands mainly to surf with some of the sport s finest athletes on crystal clear indian ocean breakers photo adobe stock it s my first time here said kelly slater who had become a household name as the greatest surfer of all time now it s one of those places that i want to come back to year after year slater had flown to the maldives with dreadlocked superstar rob machado to catch waves with a group of their old friends all legends in the world of surfing and with local pro hussain iboo areef high expectations make for poor traveling companions machado had said in the drifter the surf movie he d filmed in distant indonesia but few among the pros here had ever surfed in the maldives and they were clearly reserving judgment we were on a four seasons resort boat heading out to the reef break known as sultans where the full power of the indian ocean wraps like a patriarch s snowy beard around the deserted islet of thanburudhoo across the watery horizon an entire fleet of boats was shuttling surfers to spots with fearsome names like ninjas jailbreaks and tombstones dive boats puttered among the atolls heading for dive sites with names like colosseum shark point and less imaginative aquarium and sport fishermen were motoring for open water in search of yellowfin and skipjack tuna one of the maldive s national animals we paddled out into the waves at sultans with the reef slipping under our boards and the occasional seaplane flying low overhead shuttling visitors to outlying atolls and distant resorts it s just such a great location and the waves are beautiful slater enthused later they re playful but it s really high level and high performance surf traveler

a major un climate summit cop27 is starting in egypt today with representatives from countries around the world convening to negotiate pledges to fight the climate crisis as cop27 and climate change receive public attention in the coming weeks false information that tries to deny or detract from the seriousness of the climate crisis is likely to increase too the journal has identified five common myths linked to the climate crisis and climate action that the earth is not warming that it is warming but the impacts will be negligible that it is warming but humans aren t responsible that there is nothing humans can do to stop the climate crisis that ireland s emissions are too little to warrant taking climate action these are incorrect ideas that are often used to try to deny the reality of climate change or block efforts to take action that can help solve the crisis let s look at why each of them is wrong and what the facts are but first where do facts about climate change come from getting the facts the leading source of global climate information is a series of reports published by a united nations body called the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc its reports are written and checked by hundreds of scientists who compile and analyse the latest climate research from around the world the ipcc sets a very high bar before it will definitively declare something to be known for certain for every finding it includes it is explicitly transparent about the level of scientific confidence in the research and the probability of a predicted impact occurring its reports are much longer than an average person would be inclined to dedicate to reading but it publishes many of its important conclusions on its website in condensed formats and we draw on some of its key work in this article another example is the national academy of sciences in the united states which has carried out significant research projects into climate change within particular countries there are plenty of bodies research groups and academics also collecting studying and sharing data pertinent to the climate such as in ireland the environmental protection agency there are lots of resources that then try to bring factual and reliable information about climate to a wider audience one example of an up to date book that s useful is introduction to modern climate change by a climate scientist called andrew dessler which we also use as a source in this article however there are many places particularly on the internet that publish claims about the climate that are not accurate sometimes they contain clear errors or aggressive language that may signal to you that something is amiss sometimes scientific articles or often texts masquerading as scientific can have inaccurate information a key question asked in science to figure out if a finding is reliable is whether it is replicable if one scientist makes a surprising finding will additional studies find the same result or was there a mistake in the first finding or maybe the result was an outlier data is most trustworthy when it is backed up by multiple different sources and studies like the findings published by the ipcc now let s get into debunking those five common climate myths fact from fiction myth the earth is not warming fact the earth is warming not every single year was warmer than the one before it and some places have not warmed as much as others but on average the long term temperature trend for the last century and a half and especially since the 1980s has been an upwards one compared to 1850 the earth has warmed by around 1 1 degrees celsius which may sound like a small number but even a few degrees of change in average global temperature is significant in relation to how human life survives on earth the evidence for this comes from data taken from thermometers on the earth s surface and is backed up by additional data from sources like satellite measurements taken from space as well as data on the effects of warming on glaciers ice sheets ocean temperatures sea level and more on a global level 2021 was the sixth warmest year on record in recent history according to the temperature data collected by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the nine years from 2013 to 2021 take up nine of the 10 spots on the list of the 10 warmest years on record in ireland temperatures have been above their long term average for 11 years in a row according to met éireann since 2000 only one year 2010 recorded a temperature below the long term average advertisement myth temperatures may be warming but the impact will be negligible fact warmer temperatures create serious dangers for humans animals and plants the ipcc has warned that the impacts of climate change are already causing severe and widespread disruption to people s lives in multiple ways across various regions of the world co chair of the working group behind one of its reports hans otto pörtner said that the scientific evidence is unequivocal climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future pörtner said the ipcc has found that with 1 5 degrees of global warming the world faces unavoidable multiple climate hazards in the next 20 years exceeding a 1 5 degree rise even temporarily would lead to additional severe impacts some of which will be irreversible how far temperatures rise depends on how fast and significantly humans act but it is widely expected that they will surpass the 1 5 mark nasa s climate division has described how the effects of human caused global warming are happening now and will worsen in the decades to come the changing climate system affects features of the natural world that may seem distant but have crucial impacts for example the melting of glaciers and ice sheets in turn impacts sea level rise which threatens coastal areas and oceanic currents which are a factor in the increase of extreme weather events in ireland the epa expects that annual temperatures will have increased by between 1 1 2 degrees and 1 3 1 6 degrees depending on our emissions projections predict more frequent heatwaves less rainfall in spring and summer and more heavy rainfall events in winter and autumn which has knock on impacts for sectors like farming sea level rise with major economic social and environmental impacts and increased coastal erosion flooding and damage to property and infrastructure in europe the report this week by the wmo warned that the continent is a live picture of a warming world and that even relatively well prepared societies aren t safe from extreme weather events the report detailed impacts like a 30 metre loss in the ice thickness of the alpine glaciers between 1997 and 2021 the melting of the greenlane ice sheet contributing to sea level rise and droughts and high temperatures that have fuelled significant wildfires and heatwaves in many parts of the world the impacts of rising temperatures are not simply a prediction for the future but a threat that is increasingly impeding on everyday life heatwaves droughts and flooding have ravaged areas like the horn of africa and india and pakistan in the last year the 2022 global hunger index which described world hunger as being at catastrophic levels pointed to a toxic cocktail of conflict the climate crisis and covid 19 sometimes people trying to claim that climate change won t have a significant impact raise the fact that many years ago the earth experienced temperatures well above the ones we have today it s true that throughout millions of years of history global temperatures have been both higher and lower than they are at present the problem is that the conditions that make the planet a safe home for humans rely on a much narrower temperature range although the physical earth can withstand fluctuations in temperature human life along with many of the plants and animals that live alongside us is vulnerable as temperatures rise the kind of impacts discussed above start to become more and more of a reality myth humans aren t responsible for temperatures rising fact human activities have caused an excessive amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere causing temperatures to rise there is a large body of evidence that shows how rising temperatures correspond to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the correlation between the addition of greenhouse gases and human activities the primary way that humans emit greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is through the burning of fossil fuels fossil fuel combustion releases carbon that was stored in the ground for thousands of years and sends it to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide where it traps too much heat around the earth instead of it being able to escape back to space read next related reads human health at the mercy of fossil fuels report warns world hunger at catastrophic levels amid toxic cocktail of conflict climate change and covid other human activities that cause temperatures to rise relate to using our land in ways that release carbon stored in the ground or plants such as cutting down trees or excessive amounts of agriculture involving ruminant livestock like cows that release methane the ipcc states that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere ocean and land myth there s nothing humans can do to stop the climate crisis fact there are many actions that humans can take to stop the climate crisis according to the ipcc the world has the tools and knowledge it needs to combat the climate crisis it just needs to act on them rapidly it found that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 40 to 70 by 2050 if the right policies infrastructure and technology are implemented at the heart of hundreds of ways that humans can address the problem are fossil fuels switching to clean renewable energy sources instead of extracting fossil fuels from the ground and burning them is a major aspect as well as reducing energy consumption through cutting down how much energy we use and improving energy efficiency the ipcc s latest report pointed to a range of measures that it described as technically viable increasingly cost effective and generally supported by the public solar energy wind energy electrification of urban systems urban green infrastructure energy efficiency demand side management improved forest and crop grassland management and reduced food waste and loss myth ireland s emissions are too little to warrant taking climate action fact ireland s emissions per capita are one of the worst in europe and efforts on climate change matter for multiple reasons ireland s share of global emissions is around 0 1 but that does not mean that our emissions don t matter or that we can afford not to take action to cut emissions in 2020 ireland s emissions per capita were the third highest in europe according to data sourced by the european environment agency and published by eurostat behind only iceland and luxembourg the ranking was the same in 2019 indicating that the effects of the covid 19 pandemic were not the cause of ireland s performance in 2020 globally taking only co2 emissions into account we emitted more than 7 5 tonnes of co2 per capita in 2018 putting us in the top 30 globally if other greenhouse gases such as methane were included ireland s position on the list would likely have been higher sometimes the argument is made that a country like china considered to be one of the worst emitters should take action first before other countries are called upon to do so but the urgency of the climate crisis means that the world cannot afford to lose any time on top of that the logic that one country should wait until another takes action is flawed because if all or most countries were to adopt that attitude no progress could ever be achieved even the argument that china is the largest emitter depends on how emissions are counted and compared in terms of producing emissions china is the largest emitter but per capita per person north america oceania the middle east and europe all emit more than asia and more than south america and africa global carbon project global carbon project but in terms of consumption ie who uses the product of the emissions the usa has far higher consumption based emissions per capita than china with the eu s also slightly higher than china s that is not to suggest though that china does not have a gargantuan role to play in climate action it too needs to massively cut emissions but it is not the only place that does ireland can also play an important role by striving to be an example on climate action to other countries and by supporting vulnerable countries that are already facing the worst effects of the climate crisis finally even if our emissions reductions had no impact on the rest of the world there are benefits for ireland for reducing greenhouse gas emissions improving air quality protecting plants and animals and increasing energy security by removing reliance on fossil fuels are all ways that ireland s action on climate change matters

roasted gorgonzola crackers or to costco for its kirkland signature mini peanut butter cups and take and bake pizza but when you get to the store your favorite treats aren t on the shelf and to your horror you learn they re not coming back they ve been discontinued it s one of the most disappointing experiences as a grocery shopper why a beloved product has disappeared ranks as one of the most common questions customers ask stores fans run social media accounts dedicated to tracking discontinued products at trader joe s and others blog about long lost items at costco strategies at play we understand that it can be disappointing devastating even trader joe s says on its discontinued product feedback contact page for customers there are several reasons trader joe s costco and other stores suddenly stop selling customer favorites sometimes products are seasonal or a manufacturer always planned to make them for a limited time also for stores like costco and trader joe s discontinuing items can reinforce the treasure hunt like appeal of these stores but more often other strategies are at play one major factor it s difficult to get shelf space inside trader joe s and costco and stay there these companies sell a limited number of items only the products in highest demand from customers that s quite a different strategy from supermarkets as well as the likes of walmart and amazon which offer a wide array of foods and brands costco for example sells around 4 000 different products at a given time traditional supermarkets typically sell 40 000 supplier issues both companies ability to keep prices below most of their competitors hinges on turning over high volumes of top selling merchandise every minute every day if an item isn t selling fast enough on the shelf at trader joe s or is collecting dust at costco warehouses the companies need to switch to something else that customers will snap up if you don t have high volume or growing volume the costs of producing and handling a slow selling product are such that it doesn t make business sense trader joe s vice president of marketing matt sloan said in a company podcast earlier this year if i know it s going to be gone i stock up angela ackerman other times it s the product itself companies will pull items if suppliers raise the price too much or the quality drops costco would rather not sell an item than sell it at a price that s too high said chuck howard an assistant professor of marketing at texas a m s mays business school it would be off brand for them to be selling things that consumers think would be too expensive for example about five years ago costco replaced a 27 product a 10 pound boneless skinless frozen chicken breast from perdue with a 21 99 wayne farms version said marcus walker an assistant buyer of frozen foods at costco from 2005 to 2020 there are several reasons trader joe s pictured here in florida miami beach and other stores suddenly stop selling customer favorites photo jeff greenberg universal images group getty images price matching items that are cheaper at other stores are also prime to eliminate costco wants its products to be the lowest priced option it pulled hot pockets because it wasn t able to match sam s club prices on the product walker said costco s teams buy their suppliers products at competitors stores and test them to compare the quality against costco s if they find an item tastes better somewhere else they ll ask the supplier to improve it for costco walker said and if that doesn t happen costco will look to replace it another issue which the pandemic underscored is the stability of product supply if a manufacturer can t produce enough of an item the companies will stop selling it and replace it with something they can consistently keep on shelves in 2020 and 2021 with demand sky high from customers stocking up on groceries during the pandemic manufacturers halted production of many secondary products to make only their highest demand items and even as demand eased this year and factories returned to running at more normal capacity manufacturers still aren t making as wide a variety of items as they did before the pandemic hormel foods the maker of skippy and spam and mondelez which owns brands like oreo are among the companies that have said recently they are reducing the number of

jim o neill is not a man to mince his words the one time chief economist at goldman sachs and former adviser to two prime ministers says the tory party is running out of time to win the hearts of voters in the north of england those who switched from labour in the last election are still waiting for proof that levelling up the regions economically was not just an empty promise speaking just 11 days before chancellor jeremy hunt will make one of the most pivotal budget statements in decades he says this is the last chance saloon for the red wall vote if the conservatives get this wrong it will be too late and a gift to the labour party northern soul lord o neill s investment vehicle northern gritstone has 215million to invest in northern firms lord o neill is arguably better qualified to make that judgment than many the manchester united fanatic he once even tried to buy the club with a consortium of investors worked with david cameron and theresa may he was one of the main architects of the northern powerhouse a body set up by the tories to boost economic growth in the north more recently he has set up an investment fund to back firms that could boost commerce and create jobs in those very areas that have lagged behind london o neill concedes hunt s hands are tied as he looks to fill a 50billion hole in the nation s finances but he says the new chancellor must make some investment promises to boost hard pressed areas there has to be some ambition or we ll never get out of this low growth trap there needs to be more emphasis on skills and investment the investment allowances should stay while the government needs to make it easier for pension funds and insurers to invest in early stage funds and companies he says referring to schemes like the annual investment allowance which gives tax relief for businesses ploughing money into new plant and machinery levelling up was first used in the conservative party manifesto in 2019 and was a policy aimed at reducing the imbalances across the country but covid and a series of self inflicted tory disasters have pushed the policy down the agenda o neill is hopeful the tories can pull it out of the fire after the disaster that was former chancellor kwasi kwarteng s budget in september which left the uk s finances and the bond markets in the doldrums the adults are back in the room and i ve been impressed with hunt i hope he doesn t disappoint me never in my professional life have i ever seen anything like it he announced unfunded tax cuts without forecasts from the office for budget responsibility it was frightening naivety but the adults are back in the room and i ve been impressed with hunt i hope he doesn t disappoint me so far the signs are mixed from prime minister rishi sunak who has publicly backed levelling up but so far failed to voice his commitment to investment zones or the hs3 link between leeds and manchester this annoys o neill whose top priority these days is to solve the productivity gap between the north and the south the 65 year old believes one of the answers is to have the cities of manchester leeds sheffield and liverpool come together and become one economic zone liverpool o neill says that the city should come together as one economic zone with manchester leeds and sheffield in order to boost growth in all of their economies he wants the area to be like america s west coast in particular san francisco bay giving the uk much needed growth at a time when the nation so badly needs it o neill points out the unique geographical location of these four northern cities explaining that at their furthest point they are only 80 miles apart at the very least liverpool and manchester should be a dallas fort worth style metroplex if you look at the whole area radiating around that part of the north you ve got eight to nine million people he concedes there is a brain drain to london he himself a proud mancunian is typical of that but he says if you can create a single economic market in that zone it is another london if you could pull that off it would raise the national growth of the uk levelling up won t harm london born in gatley in the manchester suburbs o neill is a passionate northerner who had been advocating levelling up long before it became fashionable he is best known as king of the acronym having famously coined brics as chief economist at goldman sachs putting brazil russia india and china on the map he has no airs and graces is physically trim and his conversation is littered with references to manchester united he spectacularly fell out with theresa may in 2016 and resigned she liked the idea of doing more for tough places but was really against the northern powerhouse because it was george osborne s which was sort of stupid he is dismissive of how the tories are currently selling levelling up to the public slogans no real substance and depth because there has been so little progress in levelling up the country the policy has become increasingly fractious particularly for conservative voters in the south o neill knows this saying it is portrayed as all at london s expense and the mayor of london quite frequently publicises that fear but this is not going to harm london he is equally critical of northern politicians who fail to match his ambition and have the attitude of poor little me in the north what about me in the north fed up of the political classes and their inability to spur private investment to the north o neill has gone it alone his latest project called northern gritstone is an investment vehicle looking to support companies emerging from top northern universities which only attract a minuscule proportion of the money that otherwise goes to the golden triangle universities of cambridge oxford and london big name backing for northern gritstone northern gritstone is backed by a host of big name pension and investment funds including m g and columbia threadneedle it has 215million to invest and has already identified 140 possible opportunities the group has backed three companies so far one of its investments is a company called iceotope which cools computer servers by using liquid rather than fans we are at the company s headquarters in orgreave on the outskirts of sheffield the site where 40 years ago steel workers clashed violently with police at the height of margaret thatcher s crackdown on the miners strikes i took osborne here when he came to sheffield i said to him do you know where this is i told him he couldn t believe it his mouth dropped staring out the window at the vast open valley o neill says i took osborne here when he came to sheffield i said to him do you know where this is i told him he couldn t believe it his mouth dropped it is now a high tech business park housing iceotope as well as rolls royce and mclaren nearby in the presence of the company s board o neill is in full goldman sachs mode as an iceotope company director prepares to go through his 100 or so prepared slides o neill cuts in swiftly all he wants to know is how and when they are going to make any money and if he can see the product we are duly whisked down to the factory floor where the young engineers are hard at work o neill becomes genuinely animated and their enthusiasm has rubbed off justifying to him that his latest cause is not in vain i want to see iceotope employing hundreds of people in south yorkshire earning really good incomes that to me would be enormously gratifying and real vindication of what gritstone is all about
dublin business wire horizon therapeutics plc nasdaq hznp today announced new data that indicate krystexxa pegloticase injection with weekly oral methotrexate effectively treats uncontrolled gout without compromising kidney function these findings are presented as part of the american society of nephrology asn kidney week nov 3 6 2022 given that one in four adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease is impacted by gout addressing the underlying cause of disease without compromising kidney function is paramount said abdul abdellatif m d f a s n adjunct assistant professor baylor college of medicine nephrology division and kidney hypertension transplant clinic of cls health these data are encouraging and suggest that krystexxa with methotrexate effectively addressed the systemic burden of uncontrolled gout and did not lead to renal function decline in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease as part of the methotrexate to increase response rates in patients with uncontrolled gout receiving krystexxa trial baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr measurements an indication of kidney function were recorded in both the krystexxa with methotrexate and krystexxa with placebo arms prior to beginning treatment with methotrexate changes were recorded at defined timepoints based on the treatment group and baseline egfr status patients were divided into egfr at or over 60 ml min 1 73 m2 and egfr under 60 ml min 1 73 m2 with less than 60 ml min 1 73 m2 potentially indicating kidney disease patients with an egfr less than 40 ml min 1

new rules designed to ensure investors do not end up buying a green investment fund that is anything but eco friendly are nothing but a joke that is the considered and somewhat controversial view of some leading investment experts who have long believed that the investment fund management industry in the uk and the united states has hijacked the green agenda for its own purposes that is to generate premium fees from the sale of funds which it knows the public will almost buy blind because they are labelled green socially responsible esg friendly sustainable ethical or impact investing the term esg stands for environmental social and governance investing sinister joaquin phoenix as the joker in the 2019 film and an esg superhero often but not always these badged funds superhero funds in many investors eyes are full of stocks such as global mining giants gambling businesses oil and gas producers and tobacco companies that most green investors would otherwise run a mile from mislabelling of such investments is often referred to as greenwashing a more apt word is deceit tariq fancy the former global chief investment officer for sustainable investing at mega asset manager blackrock believes the green investment industry is underpinned by deceit last year he said the industry was selling the public a wheatgrass placebo as a solution to the onset of cancer sceptics argue that the changes proposed by the city regulator the financial conduct authority will actually give the country s fund management industry even greater licence to run green funds or sustainable funds as it labels them which hold investments that many investors would baulk at under the rules fund managers will be able to claim a fund is sustainable environmentally and or socially sustainable even if up to 30 per cent of its assets are in non sustainable assets for example companies manufacturing plastic bottles the rules are an absolute mess says alan miller co founder of wealth manager scm direct and one of the country s most respected asset managers over the past couple of years miller has led the way principally through the pages of the mail on sunday in highlighting the widespread mis selling and mis marketing of green funds miller says that until there is an overhaul of the way independent ratings agencies score companies on esg issues investment funds will continue to hold stocks that most people would think should be no part of a green orientated fund ethical according to one esg data provider s scoring system some companies operating in markets such as alcohol and tobacco outperform the ftse100 as a whole sin stocks score highly for esg the esg scores that agencies apply to companies are a key determinant in deciding which stocks a green fund will hold how crazy is it says miller that a tobacco company such as bat is the third highest esg rated company in the ftse100 index he analysed the ten largest sin stocks in the ftse100 index operating in the oil and gas alcohol tobacco mining defence and gambling sectors these stocks shell diageo bp rio tinto bat glencore anglo american bae systems imperial brands and flutter entertainment have a higher average esg score than the ftse100 as a whole according to one leading esg data provider refinitiv reform of esg ratings does not feature in the new fca rules although the regulator does say investment firms must ensure the data they rely on for making sustainable investment decisions is fit for purpose miller believes this will prove impossible to achieve the louder a company shouts about its esg credentials the more sceptical you should be as an investor carson block of muddy waters capital across the atlantic hedge fund manager carson block of muddy waters capital like miller a green fund sceptic believes a lot of investors are being misled greater regulation he says will change little last week he told the mos in my career as an investment analyst and investment manager i would say the more rules a regulator introduces the more those who are regulated try to find ways to get round them and succeed he also said that because esg friendly companies and investment funds claim they are doing their bit to help save the world from ecological destruction it is considered impolite to ask them hard questions as a result they are often able to escape close scrutiny that would reveal any wrongdoing block believes that the only way for investors to be true to their own beliefs on green issues is to avoid investment funds altogether and do their own stock picking albeit with a big dose of scepticism the louder a company shouts about its esg credentials he says the more sceptical you should be as an investor rules city regulator the fca is proposing changes to green fund labelling but some investment experts are sceptical about their contents miller says a simple but highly effective solution would be for all green investment funds to disclose all their holdings so that wannabe investors can decide whether they are comfortable with them the proposed fca rules on green investment fund labelling come as interest in such investments is steadily increasing the regulator s own research indicates that more than four fifths of all adults would like their investments to do some good as well as deliver them some profit according to data from the investment association more than 86billion is invested in responsible investment funds accounting for 6 5 per cent of all assets managed by the fund management industry in 2020 the equivalent percentage was 3 9 per cent in a 179 page document that alan miller says is mind boggling even for professionals the fca proposes three new labels for green funds to fall under sustainable focus improvers and impact a fund can categorise itself as being sustainable focus if at least 70 per cent of the underlying investments meet a credible standard of environmental and or social sustainability improvers will be funds which hold companies set on improving their sustainability credentials over time the third will be funds investing in companies which are doing things to improve the environment the fca intends to publish its final rules on green funds by next summer although they are unlikely to come into effect until a year later research published a few days ago from the association of investment companies indicates that just one per cent of financial advisers and wealth managers completely trust the sustainability claims made by green fund managers sacha sadan the fca s director of environment social and governance believes the rules will help build trust in green investment funds others though disagree with alan miller arguing that all the new rules will do is mire fund groups in yet more regulation and compliance with the costs passed on to investors as carson block told the mos last week most green investment funds are not a conscious marketing scam but a scam all the same buyer beware

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story washington president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our no 1 priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing president joe biden speaks about the chips and science act a measure intended to boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research at communications company viasat friday in carlsbad calif photo gregory bull associated press as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy the california congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news matthew incantalupo political scientist president biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when america needs to unite because he can t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living mccarthy tweeted this past week the american people aren t buying it still inflation is not solely a domestic issue after russia invaded ukraine energy and food costs rose and suddenly flipped the global dynamics as inflation rose faster in parts of the world with less aggressive coronavirus relief than the u s annual inflation in the euro zone is a record 10 7 much higher than the 8 2 in the u s meanwhile growth has slowed in china the pace of world trade is slipping and saudi arabia led opec has cut oil production in order to prop up prices and because the fed is raising rates to lower domestic inflation the dollar has increased in value and essentially exported higher prices to the rest of the world this has left u s voters in the curious position of not necessarily blaming the president for inflation even as they disapprove of his economic leadership an october poll by ap norc center for public affairs captured this split more than half of voters say that prices are higher because of factors beyond biden s control but just 36 approve of his economic leadership

new rules designed to ensure investors do not end up buying a green investment fund that is anything but eco friendly are nothing but a joke that is the considered and somewhat controversial view of some leading investment experts who have long believed that the investment fund management industry in the uk and the united states has hijacked the green agenda for its own purposes that is to generate premium fees from the sale of funds which it knows the public will almost buy blind because they are labelled green socially responsible esg friendly sustainable ethical or impact investing the term esg stands for environmental social and governance investing sinister joaquin phoenix as the joker in the 2019 film and an esg superhero often but not always these badged funds superhero funds in many investors eyes are full of stocks such as global mining giants gambling businesses oil and gas producers and tobacco companies that most green investors would otherwise run a mile from mislabelling of such investments is often referred to as greenwashing a more apt word is deceit tariq fancy the former global chief investment officer for sustainable investing at mega asset manager blackrock believes the green investment industry is underpinned by deceit last year he said the industry was selling the public a wheatgrass placebo as a solution to the onset of cancer sceptics argue that the changes proposed by the city regulator the financial conduct authority will actually give the country s fund management industry even greater licence to run green funds or sustainable funds as it labels them which hold investments that many investors would baulk at under the rules fund managers will be able to claim a fund is sustainable environmentally and or socially sustainable even if up to 30 per cent of its assets are in non sustainable assets for example companies manufacturing plastic bottles the rules are an absolute mess says alan miller co founder of wealth manager scm direct and one of the country s most respected asset managers over the past couple of years miller has led the way principally through the pages of the mail on sunday in highlighting the widespread mis selling and mis marketing of green funds miller says that until there is an overhaul of the way independent ratings agencies score companies on esg issues investment funds will continue to hold stocks that most people would think should be no part of a green orientated fund ethical according to one esg data provider s scoring system some companies operating in markets such as alcohol and tobacco outperform the ftse100 as a whole sin stocks score highly for esg the esg scores that agencies apply to companies are a key determinant in deciding which stocks a green fund will hold how crazy is it says miller that a tobacco company such as bat is the third highest esg rated company in the ftse100 index he analysed the ten largest sin stocks in the ftse100 index operating in the oil and gas alcohol tobacco mining defence and gambling sectors these stocks shell diageo bp rio tinto bat glencore anglo american bae systems imperial brands and flutter entertainment have a higher average esg score than the ftse100 as a whole according to one leading esg data provider refinitiv reform of esg ratings does not feature in the new fca rules although the regulator does say investment firms must ensure the data they rely on for making sustainable investment decisions is fit for purpose miller believes this will prove impossible to achieve the louder a company shouts about its esg credentials the more sceptical you should be as an investor carson block of muddy waters capital across the atlantic hedge fund manager carson block of muddy waters capital like miller a green fund sceptic believes a lot of investors are being misled greater regulation he says will change little last week he told the mos in my career as an investment analyst and investment manager i would say the more rules a regulator introduces the more those who are regulated try to find ways to get round them and succeed he also said that because esg friendly companies and investment funds claim they are doing their bit to help save the world from ecological destruction it is considered impolite to ask them hard questions as a result they are often able to escape close scrutiny that would reveal any wrongdoing block believes that the only way for investors to be true to their own beliefs on green issues is to avoid investment funds altogether and do their own stock picking albeit with a big dose of scepticism the louder a company shouts about its esg credentials he says the more sceptical you should be as an investor rules city regulator the fca is proposing changes to green fund labelling but some investment experts are sceptical about their contents miller says a simple but highly effective solution would be for all green investment funds to disclose all their holdings so that wannabe investors can decide whether they are comfortable with them the proposed fca rules on green investment fund labelling come as interest in such investments is steadily increasing the regulator s own research indicates that more than four fifths of all adults would like their investments to do some good as well as deliver them some profit according to data from the investment association more than 86billion is invested in responsible investment funds accounting for 6 5 per cent of all assets managed by the fund management industry in 2020 the equivalent percentage was 3 9 per cent in a 179 page document that alan miller says is mind boggling even for professionals the fca proposes three new labels for green funds to fall under sustainable focus improvers and impact a fund can categorise itself as being sustainable focus if at least 70 per cent of the underlying investments meet a credible standard of environmental and or social sustainability improvers will be funds which hold companies set on improving their sustainability credentials over time the third will be funds investing in companies which are doing things to improve the environment the fca intends to publish its final rules on green funds by next summer although they are unlikely to come into effect until a year later research published a few days ago from the association of investment companies indicates that just one per cent of financial advisers and wealth managers completely trust the sustainability claims made by green fund managers sacha sadan the fca s director of environment social and governance believes the rules will help build trust in green investment funds others though disagree with alan miller arguing that all the new rules will do is mire fund groups in yet more regulation and compliance with the costs passed on to investors as carson block told the mos last week most green investment funds are not a conscious marketing scam but a scam all the same buyer beware
crime writer mark billingham talks to me my money about power bosses and traders cashing in on cost of living crisis now that s true crime best selling author mark billingham would hike up taxes paid by those profiting from the cost of living crisis if he were made chancellor the 61 year old crime writer who famously played dimwitted gary alongside tony robinson in the 1990s children s tv show maid marian and her merry men would increase taxes on energy companies private equity companies and anyone who has profited from shorting the pound in recent weeks he told donna ferguson that writing his first work of fiction about detective inspector tom thorne was the best financial move he has ever made his latest novel the murder book is published by little brown what did your parents teach you about money my mother taught me to work hard for it while my father showed me that money is just as easy to lose as it is to make he was a businessman who made and lost a lot of money they got divorced when i was six and my mother brought me and my brother up on her own she travelled around pubs emptying jukeboxes and fruit machines for the company that made them my father wasn t around he moved abroad money never felt like it was tight because my mum was extremely careful and worked hard we didn t want for anything have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes when i was in my early 20s although it didn t feel like a struggle at the time after i graduated from university where i d studied drama i helped set up a small scale socialist touring theatre company we d travel round schools and art centres and perform plays we had devised about the campaign for nuclear disarmament or sexism in the workplace we made no money at all so i signed on for benefits for about five years which paid my rent in a flatshare the food i ate wasn t particularly nice i remember buying eight beef burgers for 1 or if i couldn t afford that i d cook spaghetti in water flavoured with an oxo cube but i m sure there were people struggling far more than me have you ever been paid silly money yes in the late 1980s and 90s i was working as an actor and made crazy money appearing in commercials back then you could live comfortably on two or three commercials a year the silliest money i earned was for a series of adverts for a beer company for each day of filming i ended up being paid 10 000 including repeat fees all d to do was drink a pint and say it s a seriously good pint from an acting perspective it was not remotely satisfying but it paid the bills what was the best year of your financial life last year i deliver a book every year in 2021 i earned a good six figure sum because i signed a contract for three new books and got payments on signing for each of them the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was a limited edition elvis costello fender jazzmaster guitar for 3 500 i have far too many guitars than my limited talent justifies i have three or four that i play fairly regularly the rest are collectible guitars i take out and stroke i play an electro acoustic guitar for the band i m in the fun lovin crime writers it is made up of a bunch of crime writers including chris brookmyre and val mcdermid we play songs about murder such as folsom prison blues and psycho killer we played at glastonbury in 2019 and tour all over the world the fees are not enough to keep me in guitars but i have tremendous fun what is your biggest money mistake buying a moped the day i got it i drove in the pouring rain terrified thinking i could be in a car i took it back to the dealership the next day and sold it to them for 1 000 less than i had paid for it the best money decision you have made deciding to write a crime novel it took me just a month to write the first 30 000 words of my first book sleepyhead that turned out to be a smart move it has now sold more than 800 000 copies and has been published all over the world murdered that billingham with the fun lovin crime writers including chris brookmyre and val mcdermid do you save into a pension yes but not for my retirement i m 61 so i pay in lump sums and in three or four years time i m planning to take out the money and pay off my mortgage my accountant advised me to do that my backlist of books will be my pension by the time i stop writing i should have at least 30 books out which will hopefully generate enough royalties every year for me to get by do you invest directly in the stock market no i would rather stick needles in my eyes i m risk averse and i am not interested do you own any property yes my wife claire and i live with our kids katie 27 and jack 24 in a five bedroom house in north london which has probably doubled in value since we bought it in 2003 we ve also got two holiday homes a two bedroom bolthole in kent and a three bedroom house right on the water of the gulf coast of florida which just about survived the recent hurricane i get paid in dollars by my american publisher so i used that income to buy the property ten years ago rather than taking a hit each time i transferred the money into sterling it was one of my best financial decisions what is the one luxury you treat yourself to travelling first class i tell myself it s because i m tall and i ve got a bad back both of those things are true but actually it s just because i like the luxury of it if you were chancellor what would you do i would immediately hike up the taxes paid by those profiting from the cost of living crisis that anyone should be shamelessly profiteering while so many see their standard of living plummeting is disgusting so that s everybody from the energy bosses to the hedge fund investors and anyone with inside knowledge who made fortunes overnight from shorting the pound nobody should be getting rich as a result of this crisis it is as simple as that what is your number one financial priority to have enough money in the bank so that i don t have to worry about my mum who is in her 80s i want to be able to take care of her if she needs me to without it being a financial nightmare

jim o neill is not a man to mince his words the one time chief economist at goldman sachs and former adviser to two prime ministers says the tory party is running out of time to win the hearts of voters in the north of england those who switched from labour in the last election are still waiting for proof that levelling up the regions economically was not just an empty promise speaking just 11 days before chancellor jeremy hunt will make one of the most pivotal budget statements in decades he says this is the last chance saloon for the red wall vote if the conservatives get this wrong it will be too late and a gift to the labour party northern soul lord o neill s investment vehicle northern gritstone has 215million to invest in northern firms lord o neill is arguably better qualified to make that judgment than many the manchester united fanatic he once even tried to buy the club with a consortium of investors worked with david cameron and theresa may he was one of the main architects of the northern powerhouse a body set up by the tories to boost economic growth in the north more recently he has set up an investment fund to back firms that could boost commerce and create jobs in those very areas that have lagged behind london o neill concedes hunt s hands are tied as he looks to fill a 50billion hole in the nation s finances but he says the new chancellor must make some investment promises to boost hard pressed areas there has to be some ambition or we ll never get out of this low growth trap there needs to be more emphasis on skills and investment the investment allowances should stay while the government needs to make it easier for pension funds and insurers to invest in early stage funds and companies he says referring to schemes like the annual investment allowance which gives tax relief for businesses ploughing money into new plant and machinery levelling up was first used in the conservative party manifesto in 2019 and was a policy aimed at reducing the imbalances across the country but covid and a series of self inflicted tory disasters have pushed the policy down the agenda o neill is hopeful the tories can pull it out of the fire after the disaster that was former chancellor kwasi kwarteng s budget in september which left the uk s finances and the bond markets in the doldrums the adults are back in the room and i ve been impressed with hunt i hope he doesn t disappoint me never in my professional life have i ever seen anything like it he announced unfunded tax cuts without forecasts from the office for budget responsibility it was frightening naivety but the adults are back in the room and i ve been impressed with hunt i hope he doesn t disappoint me so far the signs are mixed from prime minister rishi sunak who has publicly backed levelling up but so far failed to voice his commitment to investment zones or the hs3 link between leeds and manchester this annoys o neill whose top priority these days is to solve the productivity gap between the north and the south the 65 year old believes one of the answers is to have the cities of manchester leeds sheffield and liverpool come together and become one economic zone liverpool o neill says that the city should come together as one economic zone with manchester leeds and sheffield in order to boost growth in all of their economies he wants the area to be like america s west coast in particular san francisco bay giving the uk much needed growth at a time when the nation so badly needs it o neill points out the unique geographical location of these four northern cities explaining that at their furthest point they are only 80 miles apart at the very least liverpool and manchester should be a dallas fort worth style metroplex if you look at the whole area radiating around that part of the north you ve got eight to nine million people he concedes there is a brain drain to london he himself a proud mancunian is typical of that but he says if you can create a single economic market in that zone it is another london if you could pull that off it would raise the national growth of the uk levelling up won t harm london born in gatley in the manchester suburbs o neill is a passionate northerner who had been advocating levelling up long before it became fashionable he is best known as king of the acronym having famously coined brics as chief economist at goldman sachs putting brazil russia india and china on the map he has no airs and graces is physically trim and his conversation is littered with references to manchester united he spectacularly fell out with theresa may in 2016 and resigned she liked the idea of doing more for tough places but was really against the northern powerhouse because it was george osborne s which was sort of stupid he is dismissive of how the tories are currently selling levelling up to the public slogans no real substance and depth because there has been so little progress in levelling up the country the policy has become increasingly fractious particularly for conservative voters in the south o neill knows this saying it is portrayed as all at london s expense and the mayor of london quite frequently publicises that fear but this is not going to harm london he is equally critical of northern politicians who fail to match his ambition and have the attitude of poor little me in the north what about me in the north fed up of the political classes and their inability to spur private investment to the north o neill has gone it alone his latest project called northern gritstone is an investment vehicle looking to support companies emerging from top northern universities which only attract a minuscule proportion of the money that otherwise goes to the golden triangle universities of cambridge oxford and london big name backing for northern gritstone northern gritstone is backed by a host of big name pension and investment funds including m g and columbia threadneedle it has 215million to invest and has already identified 140 possible opportunities the group has backed three companies so far one of its investments is a company called iceotope which cools computer servers by using liquid rather than fans we are at the company s headquarters in orgreave on the outskirts of sheffield the site where 40 years ago steel workers clashed violently with police at the height of margaret thatcher s crackdown on the miners strikes i took osborne here when he came to sheffield i said to him do you know where this is i told him he couldn t believe it his mouth dropped staring out the window at the vast open valley o neill says i took osborne here when he came to sheffield i said to him do you know where this is i told him he couldn t believe it his mouth dropped it is now a high tech business park housing iceotope as well as rolls royce and mclaren nearby in the presence of the company s board o neill is in full goldman sachs mode as an iceotope company director prepares to go through his 100 or so prepared slides o neill cuts in swiftly all he wants to know is how and when they are going to make any money and if he can see the product we are duly whisked down to the factory floor where the young engineers are hard at work o neill becomes genuinely animated and their enthusiasm has rubbed off justifying to him that his latest cause is not in vain i want to see iceotope employing hundreds of people in south yorkshire earning really good incomes that to me would be enormously gratifying and real vindication of what gritstone is all about

how do we explain that half the australian community thinks we should go to war with china after twenty years of conflict in the middle east will our addiction to war and our insouciance about its consequences finally catch up with us in an american war over taiwan paddy the irishman was one of the stock characters who appeared in the cartoons in the sydney bulletin in the early c20th in one of the cartoons paddy addressed the readers but behind him was a sketch of what appeared to be a brawl he asked is this a private fight or can anyone join in i was reminded of the cartoon after reading two news items published last week by henry reynolds the first was a report of the results of a yougov survey into public opinion about attitudes to a possible future war over the fate of taiwan i found the results both surprising and troubling as the guardian reported almost half of australians 46 believe the country should send troops to help defend taiwan against china if required more surprising was that it was a much higher percentage than in the u s with 33 or japan with 35 two days later the government announced that it was setting aside 475 million for assistance to ukraine and dispatching 70 adf personnel to britain to help train their soldiers no matter how sympathetic we might be about the beleaguered nation australian involvement is quite strange ukraine has the strong support of the thirty members of nato many with much larger armies and defence budgets than australia are we just making a declaration that we wish to now tag along as nato s camp followers and if our department of defence has a lazy half billion dollars it would have been more appropriate to spend it as a gesture of reparation for the destruction and devastated families we left behind after twenty years of war in iraq and afghanistan we might then be able to convince observers all over the world that our empathy is not colour coded how do we explain that half the community thinks we should go to war with china we might well have thought that twenty years of conflict in the middle east with little to show for it had mollified our addiction to warfare what is outstanding here is the combination of belligerence and insouciance little thought seems to have been given to the possibility of landing troops on taiwan and of ever getting them back again the legal status of the island as a province of china is clearly little understood or that military involvement as far as international law is concerned would be an illegal invasion of china and would be seen in that way in many parts of the world but the government s slapdash preparation for war is far more consequential there are innumerable military exercises on land sea and in the air weapons and tactics are methodically tested we have an ongoing enquiry into strategic objectives but is anyone calculating the cost of war with china is there any serious assessment of the impact on the national economy which might well be devastated do we have any precedents for a country that decided to go to war with its major trading partner has anyone considered what would happen to large segments of the mining industry and what would happen to shipping to and from australia access to japan and south korea would be seriously inhibited and regardless of outcomes we would have to assume that we would have hostile relations with china for a generation and more then there is the question of our large chinese community do our war mongers give them any consideration would they just be treated with restless suspicion or would a government under pressure consider the detention which was imposed on germans and italians during the second world war all this and more for taiwan which many australians could not mark on a map how much suffering does our defence establishment estimate they will subject us to have they any idea do they actually want to know all of these questions remind us of outstanding features of australia s distinctive history of engagement in wars in far away places against enemies who presented no threat to the homeland the british inducted us into a tradition of engagement in imperial adventurism they were incessantly at war somewhere in the world for most of the c19th as the great liberal prime minister william gladstone observed the english piously believe themselves to be a peaceful people nobody else is of the same belief at the time of federation the australian colonies followed the british into conflict in both south africa and china it was the start of a long tradition the empire made it easy for the australians to go to war enemies were chosen for them the decisions about where when and how to fight were presented ready made debate about strategy legality or morality was left to britain loyalty to crown and empire was sufficient motivation for the majority and was used as a gag to smother dissent so going to war could proceed without serious debate about australia s obligations or responsibilities as a nascent nation state or the wider ramifications of its geographical location return from wars was also easy if things did not turn out as expected there was no need for introspection because australia had been there merely to lend a hand the australians showed themselves to be proficient and resourceful warriors and that was enough there was no need to give serious thought to warfare itself ultimate responsibility reassessment and soul searching could be left to the british this was graphically illustrated in the case of the south african war of 1899 1902 there was far more dissent in britain than in australia and there was almost nothing like the profound reassessment which resulted in the war being seen as disgraceful descent into methods of barbarism how the patterns are replicated our behaviour in our american wars in iraq and afghanistan is similar to that of earlier british ones going to war was easy using our legal inheritance from the common law which determined that war and treaty making are the preserve of the crown or more correctly the prime minister as many people now understand it can all be done without reference to the parliament our enemies were chosen for us the fact that we knew comparatively little about the location didn t matter the legality and morality of the conflict was defined in washington even the rhetoric was borrowed including repeated reference to the non existent weapons of mass destruction return from war was just as easy there was no public scrutiny about whether the wars were a good idea whether the cost in lives and billions of dollars was worth it war seems to be the only aspect of government which escapes any serious cost benefit analysis there was little of the soul searching which followed the iraq war in britain and america this brings us back to the question of war with china over the future of taiwan so many decisions and commitments have already been made in secret that going to war will be easy the only question left to us now is can involvement in a likely catastrophe be avoided or will our addiction to war and our insouciance about its consequences finally catch up with us read more a war with china would be like a million war in vietnam on aussie soil aussieland would become a wasteland in 5 minutes flat so if we don t really care about us humans please think of the animals they don t deserve this shit free julian assange now cartoon at top from the 1890s

elon musk s decision to pull twitter off the stock market allows him to make major changes quickly but it also takes the company more heavily into debt a risky choice for a money losing business it is a long established strategy with notable successes and failures from computer manufacturer dell a success to toy stores toys r us a failure but twitter is very different from a traditional buyout of a company that delists from the market said steven kaplan of the university of chicago booth school of business most such takeovers are of companies with positive cash flows kaplan said but the social network is losing money having posted losses in the first two quarters of 2022 the equation is further complicated by elon musk s 13 billion in loans which will have to be repaid by the san francisco company not by the entrepreneur personally according to a calculation made by afp twitter will have to disburse a little less than 1 billion from the first year as interest and principal a high amount for a group whose turnover reached only 5 billion in 2021 that debt is tricky when you re losing money so there ll be a lot of pressure to cut costs and increase revenue so that they can make debt payments said kaplan a finance professor otherwise musk will need to find funds to avoid bankruptcy the entrepreneur on friday laid off about half of twitter s employees and is seeking new sources of revenue including an optional subscription fee of 8 per month for those wanting a verified account further development of twitter may require an infusion of capital more difficult to raise in theory by a unlisted company i don t think you can raise any more debt said erik gordon an entrepreneurship expert at the university of michigan ross school of business but in this case there is a musk factor you tweet a few times and you know bring in the money another idiosyncratic element is that most such deals are initiated either by a financial logic or an industrial logic whereas elon musk didn t have one he said he just was unhappy with the way twitter was treating free speech and concluded that he could manage it better gordon said as a general rule an exit from the market is followed by radical changes at a company said sreedhar bharath professor of finance at arizona state university and those changes may not be readily apparent because the company no longer has an obligation to communicate publicly the company is shielded from the punishment meted out by financial markets if they do not like the changes he said some might say the markets have an excessive focus on the next quarter results and managers of newly privatized firms can pursue long term goals without fretting about the short term but with the high public profile of twitter key decisions are likely to become public noted jagadeesh sivadasan of the university of michigan s ross school of business this was evident for the post acquisition decisions regarding firing of key officers a study published in 2019 by two researchers at california state polytechnic university that looked at nearly 500 deals between 1980 and 2006 found that about 20 percent of large companies undergoing leveraged buyouts filed for bankruptcy within 10 years compared with two percent for a sample of other companies most of them have done better than public companies said gordon but they don t get a lot of publicity the big failures get a lot of attention and create this idea that the debt kills the company most of the time it works which is why people keep doing it gordon added musk is one of the most creative people on the planet able to build three totally different companies paypal tesla and spacex all of which have reached more than 100 billion in valuation kaplan said he s a talent magnet he s going to attract to twitter real talent that hasn t been there for a while i wouldn t bet against him

diabetes cases are expected to reach 643 million by 2030 with poor countries being the most affected in 24 low and middle income countries no insulin is registered by the authorities insulin producing pharmaceutical companies must urgently step up initiatives to tackle the gross inequity in access to life saving drugs for people with diabetes in low and middle income countries lmics according to a report insulin discovered more than 100 years ago is primarily prescribed to people diagnosed with early type 1 diabetes to help prevent complications and death but the drug is out of reach for many according to the report released oct 6 by access to medicine foundation a dutch organization that pushes for the accountability of pharmaceutical companies it comes at a time when diabetes cases are expected to rise globally to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045 according to the international diabetes federation the disease burden is highest in low and middle income countries where 80 of the 463 million adults with diabetes live the report which analyzes the data accessible to the public literature and reports on policies global health reports indicates that only a few drug makers dominate the insulin market while gaps persist in access to all forms of insulin it shows that only 29 out of 108 countries studied have all insulins classified as essential medicines by the world health organization and only one of these is a low income country in addition in 24 countries no insulin was registered strategies to make insulin affordable have focused on human insulin rather than analog insulin which controls blood sugar more effectively over a longer period of time but can cost up to six times as much the report says companies ongoing efforts to close access gaps are fragmented and often focused on a few countries patient populations and products the foundation says it names the american pharmaceutical company eli lilly the danish novo nordisk and the french company sanofi as the main manufacturers of insulin initiatives by these companies to improve access include programs targeting children price caps and fair pricing policies but these need to go further the report suggests access to other products such as delivery and monitoring tools should also be considered he says what we want to see as a first step from these businesses is to move away from dispersed initiatives and work towards models that guarantee more systematic access to patients says claudia martínez program manager of research on diabetes and generic drugs at theaccess to medicine foundation the latter tells scidev net that the report aims to catalyze investment by pharmaceutical companies in solutions such as product diversification so that people with diabetes can get the drug no matter where they live make diabetes a program the report highlights the need to increase the number and type of insulin on the market in low and middle income countries to increase its availability and accessibility it is also important for regulators to include in national drug formularies so that they can be incorporated into systems local health centres insists claudia martínez at the level of governments she says one thing can be to adopt national level targets to be able to tackle diabetes it is about taking action as governments and committing to do diabetes a program a novo nordisk spokesperson says the company is committed to providing easy access and innovation sustainable in particular by research and development address supply chain issues and support health systems strengthening increasing access is a complex and ongoing challenge which is reflected in the fact that this report is more demanding than ever said this source at sanofi it is said that the company welcomes this important report and will continue its efforts to improve access to diabetes care in low and middle income countries sanofi has initiatives across business social and philanthropic models to facilitate affordable access to comprehensive diabetes care in low and middle income countries and underserved communities this includes high quality analog insulin products as well as patient support initiatives and enhancement of the health system supported by digital tools and health data explains a spokesperson for the company she adds that sanofi is also working to help overcome multiple barriers to access beyond price including research and development manufacturing market registration and supply as well as the diagnosis and treatment shortage of insulin for people with diabetes life can be difficult in times of insulin shortage tanzanian detricia pamba 24 was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 13 years old lack of insulin can lead to a life threatening condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis i come from a supportive family and i have health insurance paying for insulin is not a problem explains this resident of dar es salaam the commercial capital of the country but there are times when you go to the hospital and there s a shortage of insulin and that doesn t affect me alone she says we end up being divided into groups and given a few weekly doses so that most of the other people in need don t run out completely continues detricia pamba when it happens that insulin is not available at the hospital i have to go to the pharmacy but there are times when pharmacies also run out of insulin we call that a seasonal stock shortage testifies the latter in an interview with scidev net so i think the issue here is how to increase access to insulin for everyone at all times concludes detricia pamba the conclusions of theaccess to medicine foundation show that governments in low and middle income countries buy insulin at varying prices which can lead to high costs natalia sánchez a researcher at this foundation suggests that countries could join pooled procurement mechanisms with other states it could give them more opportunities to negotiate and lower prices the other thing they can do is promote competition in insulin tenders she suggests kaushik ramaiya is a consultant physician at the shree hindu mandal hospital in dar es salaam and a board member of the world diabetes foundation he wants to see free access to insulin in countries like tanzania in addition to its inclusion in the list of essential medicines for children and young adults with type 1 diabetes where insulin is their lifeline it should be categorized as essential medicine and be free he pleads eli lilly had not responded to scidev net s request for a response at the time of this article s publication the original version of this article was produced by scidev net global edition

karachi whatsapp groups are abuzz with speculations about the possibility of a tax on share buybacks an increasingly popular practice that lets listed companies purchase their own shares on the stock exchange to improve their market value firms that carried out share buybacks recently or are currently conducting the exercise include netsol technologies ltd maple leaf cement factory ltd lucky cement ltd and jdw sugar mills ltd big companies in developed economies ramped up their share repurchases in recent years thanks to the excess cash on their balance sheets the exercise results in higher earnings per share as their total number of shares goes down and break up values improve businesses repurchase their shares to either cancel them altogether or hold them as treasury stocks which effectively reduce their free float or shareholding that s tradeable on an exchange the sustained increase in share buybacks in the united states recently prompted the biden administration to impose a one per cent excise tax through the inflation reduction act canada followed suit in the outgoing week with prime minister justin trudeau s government announcing a 2pc tax on companies repurchasing their shares from the stock exchange should the government also tax the share buybacks on the pakistan stock exchange after all companies burn their distributable profits to carry out such transactions the same accumulated cash would otherwise be used for either dividend payments or business expansion in the process the government loses the tax it would ve collected on dividend disbursement in the first case or compromises the future economic activity in the second instance speaking to dawn arif habib commodities ltd ceo ahsan mehanti said taxing share buybacks is mainly a developed world phenomenon where markets are overheated and dividends are usually small buybacks discourage share price discovery volumes shrink and reduce the number of shareholders in developing markets so taxing them can raise the government s revenue and help markets develop he said akd securities ltd ceo muhammad farid alam told dawn any tax on share buybacks should be discouraged as the transaction involves no immediate income generation of any kind these are rare transactions anyway valuations are already down a tax at this stage will only hurt the little activity that s finally gathering some pace he said in view of mohammed sohail ceo of topline securities ltd it s incorrect to say that share buybacks don t generate tax for the government a buyback leads to a share price rally and the seller ends up paying a tax on capital gains he said i m in favour of share buybacks in a market like pakistan where the price of the share is less than the price of the asset these are an effective tool to bridge the gap he said published in dawn november 6th 2022

most companies taken private have positive cash flows but twitter posted losses in the first two quarters of 2022 copyright afp hector retamal thomas urbain elon musk s decision to pull twitter off the stock market allows him to make major changes quickly but it also takes the company more heavily into debt a risky choice for a money losing business it is a long established strategy with notable successes and failures from computer manufacturer dell a success to toy stores toys r us a failure but twitter is very different from a traditional buyout of a company that delists from the market said steven kaplan of the university of chicago booth school of business most such takeovers are of companies with positive cash flows kaplan said but the social network is losing money having posted losses in the first two quarters of 2022 the equation is further complicated by elon musk s 13 billion in loans which will have to be repaid by the san francisco company not by the entrepreneur personally according to a calculation made by afp twitter will have to disburse a little less than 1 billion from the first year as interest and principal a high amount for a group whose turnover reached only 5 billion in 2021 that debt is tricky when you re losing money so there ll be a lot of pressure to cut costs and increase revenue so that they can make debt payments said kaplan a finance professor otherwise musk will need to find funds to avoid bankruptcy the entrepreneur on friday laid off about half of twitter s employees and is seeking new sources of revenue including an optional subscription fee of 8 per month for those wanting a verified account further development of twitter may require an infusion of capital more difficult to raise in theory by a unlisted company i don t think you can raise any more debt said erik gordon an entrepreneurship expert at the university of michigan ross school of business but in this case there is a musk factor you tweet a few times and you know bring in the money radical changes another idiosyncratic element is that most such deals are initiated either by a financial logic or an industrial logic whereas elon musk didn t have one he said he just was unhappy with the way twitter was treating free speech and concluded that he could manage it better gordon said as a general rule an exit from the market is followed by radical changes at a company said sreedhar bharath professor of finance at arizona state university and those changes may not be readily apparent because the company no longer has an obligation to communicate publicly the company is shielded from the punishment meted out by financial markets if they do not like the changes he said some might say the markets have an excessive focus on the next quarter results and managers of newly privatized firms can pursue long term goals without fretting about the short term but with the high public profile of twitter key decisions are likely to become public noted jagadeesh sivadasan of the university of michigan s ross school of business this was evident for the post acquisition decisions regarding firing of key officers a study published in 2019 by two researchers at california state polytechnic university that looked at nearly 500 deals between 1980 and 2006 found that about 20 percent of large companies undergoing leveraged buyouts filed for bankruptcy within 10 years compared with two percent for a sample of other companies most of them have done better than public companies said gordon but they don t get a lot of publicity the big failures get a lot of attention and create this idea that the debt kills the company most of the time it works which is why people keep doing it gordon added musk is one of the most creative people on the planet able to build three totally different companies paypal tesla and spacex all of which have reached more than 100 billion in valuation kaplan said he s a talent magnet he s going to attract to twitter real talent that hasn t been there for a while i wouldn t bet against him

the twitter headquarters in san francisco california afp hector retamal the innuendo about twitter continues informed or otherwise twitter pre musk was a regular target of criticism everything was criticized on a routine basis it managed more or less the constant stream of anything and everything that strangely enough is one of the reasons the return of blocked accounts and similar stuff flagged by musk is being met with disbelief keeping it semi civilized was the trade off for managing an onslaught of bots human and otherwise the business side of twitter was to put it mildly opaque i find it hard to believe that billions of dollars of revenue simply went into a stock buyback at the expense of profit and to nobody s benefit ok maybe some debatable brilliance or lack of it there that s not what s bothering twitter users now the accounts of whatever are to be restored the psychos hate campaigns pakistani american patriots et al are back yes or no the kids from telegram including isis etc are coming back the people who routinely broke terms of service are welcomed back with open arms those may exist may not exist vegetables with the same writing style that uses caps in all the wrong places are back this is not 2016 it s not even 2008 people who can read and even understand words in sentences don t want to go back after all this time a rerun of that is not an option nor should it be let s finally leave politics out of every subject on earth there are too many real things happening twitter as a free lunch for political bozos squeaking about politics could not possibly be more counterproductive just a few things to consider the entire northern hemisphere is in a murderous drought the food chain is on the line there s a very nasty war going on in ukraine people are being squeezed broke by ridiculous cost increases for everything unaffordable energy costs are quite likely to kill a lot of people starting next month there are also the daily disasters worldwide massive crime etc who needs paid screeching idiots twitter is an instant news feed it s a communications resource it s democratic news direct from source in a crisis you might get through on twitter when you can t get through on anything else twitter is a very useful thing in so many ways you don t have to like reality and it may not like you but facts are valuable endless supplies of propaganda and rhetoric are worthless for twitter users the question is whether twitter is about to become just another fox news yes or no well there s always reddit _______________________________________________________________ disclaimer the opinions expressed in this op ed are those of the author they do not purport to reflect the opinions or views of the digital journal or its members
atlanta ap trainers laid out the do s and don ts of being an election monitor on saturday at the carter center in atlanta do watch carefully and note things that are unusual and how poll workers handle them don t try to instruct or correct poll workers or otherwise intervene in how elections are run the training isn t unusual for the center co founded in 1982 by former president jimmy carter and rosalynn carter elections monitoring internationally has been part of the carter center s operations since 1989 observing 113 elections in 39 countries but what s new is doing it in the carter center s hometown we re really excited to be able to bring this experience to fulton county here in what is the first nonpartisan election observation effort like this certainly in georgia but we think probably in the country avery davis roberts the associate director of the center s democracy program told dozens of volunteers gathered at the center s headquarters near downtown atlanta fulton county which includes most of the city of atlanta is at the core of former president donald trump s false assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged election administration in the heavily democratic county has been engulfed in strife for years a prominent example of how elections are increasingly being questioned in america david carroll director of the center s democracy program said center leaders have become increasingly concerned that americans themselves are starting to have less faith in elections less public confidence we view nonpartisan observation as one step among many by different actors that we can do as election observers to try to bring more understanding and confidence to election processes carroll said after the 2020 election carter center officials monitored georgia s audit of the state s 5 million presidential ballots that affirmed democrat joe biden s victory over trump when republicans pushed through a new election law in 2021 that allows the state to potentially take over election administration in underperforming counties republican lawmakers triggered an investigation that could strip local control of fulton county elections republican state officials and the democratic controlled county election board jointly invited the center to monitor the 2022 elections the move could ease partisan tensions over how elections are conducted in the state and boost public confidence in the final tallies we were invited by both of them but we are acting on behalf of neither of them davis roberts said volunteers are drawn from carter center employees and supporters as well as members of its georgia democracy resilience network all signed a code of conduct and were given extensive checklists to monitor election procedures including instructions to draw diagrams of polling places they ve already been at work monitoring early voting and processing of absentee ballots they ll fan out beginning at 6 a m tuesday to many of fulton county s 250 plus polling places and then observers will also monitor the counting of the ballots after polling places close fulton county accounts for about 11 of georgia s electorate and of the 2 5 million early votes cast through friday more than 300 000 of them came from fulton biden won nearly 73 of the county s votes in november 2020 he won statewide by fewer than 12 000 votes out of about 5 million cast the county is about 45 5 white 44 5 black and about 7 6 people of asian descent according to u s census data the county again will be key in the high profile senate contest between sen raphael warnock a democrat and his republican challenger herschel walker and in the governor s race between republican incumbent brian kemp and democratic challenger stacey abrams the senate race will help determine which party controls the senate for the final two years of biden s term davis roberts said election monitors are not like poll watchers acting on behalf of parties or candidates we re looking at the system of election administration she told volunteers we re looking at whether policies procedures and rules for the election are followed and whether those rules allow for people to experience a safe secure accessible and fair election typically the carter center would issue preliminary findings days after an election but instead expects to make a full report to state and county officials around dec 15 the report could contribute to the state election board s decision of whether to take over fulton county the carter center has a long track record and we put a lot of stock into our reputation as a group that does this kind of work with a firm commitment to objectivity and a thorough data driven analysis carroll said so that s what we ll do here like in any election that we observe ___ follow jeff amy at ___ learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at and follow the ap s election coverage of the 2022 elections at copyright the associated press

as part of the collective effort to protect the oceans threatened fish stocks but in this case the chinese captains of several fishing boats did something unexpected three vessels sped away one turning aggressively 90 degrees toward the coast guard cutter james forcing the american vessel to take evasive action to avoid being rammed guardsmen from the cutter james seen at background right conduct a boarding of a fishing vessel in the eastern pacific ocean photo ap for the most part they wanted to avoid us said coast guard lt hunter stowes the highest ranking law enforcement officer on the james but we were able to manoeuvre effectively so that we were safe the entire time still the high seas confrontation represented a potentially dangerous breach of international maritime protocol one the us sees as a troubling precedent since it happened on the coast guard s first ever mission to counter illegal fishing in the eastern pacific the associated press reconstructed details of the never before reported incident from the coast guard and six us non military officials who spoke of the operation in greater detail but requested anonymity to avoid jeopardising a multilateral process seeking to force china to sanction the vessels while diplomats in china accused the americans of acting improperly they didn t provide their own detailed account the coast guard s unprecedented voyage was prompted by growing alarm from activists and governments in latin america over the activities of china s distant water fishing fleet the world s largest since 2009 the number of chinese flagged vessels spotted fishing in the south pacific sometimes for months at a time has surged eightfold to 476 last year meanwhile the size of its squid catch has grown from 70 000 tons to 422 000 a level of fishing that some scientists fear is unsustainable even for a resilient species as revealed in an ap univision investigation last year the chinese flotilla includes some of the seafood industry s worst offenders with long records of labour abuse illegal fishing and violations of maritime law but they re being drawn to the open ocean around the americas where the us has long dominated after depleting fish stocks closer to home and fuelled by an increasingly fierce race between the two superpowers to secure access to the world s dwindling natural resources guardsmen from the cutter james seen at background right conduct a boarding of a fishing vessel in the eastern pacific ocean photo ap the illegal fishing patrol which took place over 10 days in august was initially kept quiet the coast guard more than a month later released a brief statement celebrating the mission along with photos from two ships it did manage to successfully board but it made no mention of the three that ran away or gave any clue to the vessels nationality a posture the coast guard maintained in its conversations with the ap but the incident didn t go unnoticed in china within days beijing fired off a formal written protest according to the us officials additionally the issue was raised when us ambassador nicholas burns was summoned by china s foreign ministry for an emergency meeting over speaker pelosi s visit to taiwan one of the officials said china s foreign ministry told the ap that it has zero tolerance for illegal fishing and said it was the us that is flouting international norms by carrying out unauthorized inspections that don t follow covid protocols potentially putting seafarers lives at risk the behaviour of the united states is unsafe opaque and unprofessional the foreign ministry said in a statement to the ap we demand that the us side stop its dangerous and erroneous inspection activities the coast guard disputes that assertion saying all members of the boarding team in addition to being vaccinated were wearing masks gloves and long sleeves the biden administration also reported possible violations discovered on the two boats it did inspect to the south pacific regional fisheries management organization or sprfmo a group of 16 members including china and the us charged with ensuring sustainable fishing in 53 million sq km of ocean one of the most serious accusations is against the yong hang 3 a refrigerated cargo vessel used to transport fish back to china so that smaller vessels can stay on the water for longer periods the vessel was among those that ran from the coast guard patrol disobeying direct orders to co operate from maritime authorities in panama to which the vessel was flagged to obscure activities some vessels especially refrigerated cargo vessels often fly under other flags but are named managed and docked in china guardsmen from the cutter james seen at background right conduct a boarding of a fishing vessel in the eastern pacific ocean photo ap ultimately if history is any guide china s communist government is unlikely to punish a fleet of 3 000 distant water fishing vessels it views as an extension of its growing naval prowess and promotes with generous state loans and fuel subsidies the coast guard s patrol was meticulously planned according to stowes the united states warned fisheries officials more than a year ago that it intended to conduct boardings in the area and filed papers showing pictures of the badges the crew would be carrying as well as the blue and white checkered flag the cutter would be hoisting five other countries including chile and new zealand have filed similar paperwork under rules allowing members fishing in the south pacific to inspect each others vessels just our being out there and doing the boardings really makes a statement stowes said at sea inspections are considered a vital tool to verify that fishing vessels are following rules regarding the use of forced labour environmentally hazardous gear and the targeting of threatened species such as sharks china has repeatedly blocked efforts to strengthen inspection procedures in the south pacific the most recent stonewalling took place last year when china argued that fishermen would be at risk if at sea patrols were allowed to carry firearms rules adopted unanimously in 2011 are guided by a 1995 united nations treaty known as the fish stocks agreement that allows inspectors to use limited force to stay safe in a sign of how geopolitical rivalry may be escalating since the pacific incident one official told ap that the state department sent a sternly worded diplomatic note reminding beijing of its international obligations as well as the distant water fleet s long track record of labour abuses and violations the biden administration is also weighing whether it will seek to have the vessels blacklisted for illegal fishing and banned from returning to the south pacific at an upcoming meeting in ecuador of the fishing management organisation

the number is big but it might not be growing like it once was on oct 27 e commerce and cloud computing titan amazon amzn 0 16 reported financial results for the third quarter of 2022 the stock plummeted as a result studious investors undoubtedly read the official press release and noted slowing revenue growth a steep decrease in operating income and weak financial guidance however one of the biggest numbers for amazon 104 3 billion to be exact is found not in the official earnings press release but rather in its quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission sec and it s the most important number for amazon shareholders to be aware of in my opinion amazon web services has a massive backlog amazon web services aws is amazon s cloud computing platform helping companies like netflix in creating its video content verizon in building out its 5g infrastructure and even vertex pharmaceuticals in developing new drugs aws is so big that there s a good chance it s powering something you use today behind the scenes to access aws services companies sign contracts with amazon payments are then made to amazon over the life of the contract according to the company it has 104 3 billion in future contracted revenue the average time remaining on these contracts is 3 8 years on one hand this backlog for aws is massive consider that aws has recorded net sales of 58 7 billion through the first three quarters of 2022 at this run rate amazon s aws backlog represents 133 of aws net sales for an entire year on the other hand aws backlog growth slowed in q3 as the chart below illustrates quarter contracted obligations for aws yoy growth qoq growth q4 2021 80 4 billion 61 21 q1 2022 88 9 billion 68 11 q2 2022 100 1 billion 65 13 q3 2022 104 3 billion 57 4 in its conference call to discuss q3 results amazon s management tried to reassure analysts regarding this slowdown the company said that the new customer pipeline is healthy but they also admitted that companies right now seem to be more focused on looking for cost savings for their businesses they re not looking for new places to sign long term spending contracts why aws matters for investors through the first three quarters of 2022 aws has only accounted for 16 of amazon s total revenue however it s amazon s only profitable segment aws has a 30 operating profit margin so far this year generating a whopping 17 6 billion in operating income by contrast amazon s north american and international e commerce operations are responsible for operating losses of 2 6 billion and 5 5 billion respectively over the same time span this is why some investors have jokingly said that if you buy amazon stock you re buying aws and getting its e commerce operations for free indeed aws by itself has 21 2 billion in operating income over the past 12 months with a market capitalization of 910 billion as of this writing amazon stock trades at 43 times aws operating income while not necessarily cheap on an absolute basis that s not the worst valuation i ve seen in a stock over my career as an investor however the reality is that amazon s e commerce operations don t come free they are part of an amazon investment and these segments are unprofitable aws is the segment driving profits for the company therefore what happens to aws from here will largely determine what happens with amazon stock as we ve seen aws growth may be slowing as evidenced by its slowing backlog management believes q3 results were a fluke and the company will enjoy better growth in the near future management s commentary may be validated in coming quarters however i would approach an amazon investment cautiously right now it can t afford to have aws growth stall but fortunately this isn t a pressing concern for shareholders as already stated the weighted average for time remaining on aws contracts is 3 8 years therefore investors can calmly and patiently watch how this plays out for now a further deceleration in the upcoming fourth quarter would be more alarming my recommendation would be to hold amazon stock if you already own it continuing to monitor the growth trends for aws

management because they like the two class structure in principle they do it because they ve bought into the story that the entrenched founder or ceo is some kind of genius or they figure that the company is wired into a growth trend so powerful that not even an entrenched idiot could screw it up so fast that they wouldn t be able to sell off their stake in time at a profit for many years the financial trajectory of facebook now known as meta platforms validated investors faith in zuckerberg he seemed to have the golden touch the company s earnings per share soared from about 9 cents just before its ipo to us 3 87 at the end of 2020 its market capitalization rose from about us 56bil at the time of its ipo to more than us 1 trillion in the third quarter of 2021 not so much lately the stock reached its all time high closing price us 382 18 on sept 7 2021 a few weeks before zuckerberg announced he was renaming facebook as meta platforms signifying a vague redirection of the company into virtual space that zuckerberg himself couldn t describe intelligibly there s a lot of ambiguity around what the metaverse means zuckerberg acknowledged on ben thompson s stratechery podcast at that time but his specific ideas seemed less than compelling you re going to be able to have a message thread going on when you re in the middle of a meeting or doing something else and no one else is even going to notice he posited the shares staggered lower over the following months culminating in a record one day immolation of market value of us 251bil on feb 3 when the company announced disappointing results for the fourth quarter of 2021 the plunge was a record not merely for meta but in stock market history the stock took another header after meta reported third quarter earnings on oct 26 a 4 decline in earnings and 52 decline in profit for the quarter compared with the same period a year earlier the stock took a hit of nearly 25 the next day as of midday wednesday meta shares were trading on nasdaq at less than us 91 that s a haircut of more than 75 from its 2021 peak and a loss so far this year of about 71 meta is now trading about where it was in october 2015 for investors who stayed in the stock seven years is a long period of dead money the stock doesn t pay a dividend as has been the case for the last year the problem seems to be zuckerberg s inability to articulate where he s leading his company as it undergoes transitions on multiple fronts these include competition from alternative social media platforms such as tiktok and a decline in advertising revenues due to apple s tightening the anti tracking technology on its devices which interferes with targeted advertising bigger questions however arise from zuckerberg s pivoting of the company toward what he calls the metaverse which has something to do with virtual reality and other immersive versions of the internet some investment analysts on meta s earnings conference call oct 26 plainly didn t know what to make of this pivot that was especially so since meta executives warned that the company s spending on the new world will grow sharply in coming years before the changes yield higher profits summing up how investors are feeling right now brent thill of jefferies asked zuckerberg is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets everyone would love to hear why you think this pays off zuckerberg answered a lot of the things that we re working on are we re quite confident that they re going to work and be good he added obviously the metaverse work is a longer term set of efforts that we re working on but i don t know i think that that is going to end up working too this flailing around points to the limits of the great man concept of corporate leadership it s akin to the theory that the best form of government is benevolent despotism which emerged during the enlightenment of the 18th century the idea then was to put one s trust in an enlightened despot who could see the way clear to providing the greatest happiness for the greatest number and had the unchallenged power to turn intentions into action the flaw in the argument obviously was what might happen if the benevolent despot turned out to be not so benevolent or enlightened that s the question that emerges from not only meta but other technology companies with leaders impervious to removal or even collaborative decision making a looming case is that of twitter whose new owner elon musk promptly made himself the invincible man in charge by firing the platform s top management and board and reportedly tying the hands of its content moderating staff almost immediately upon taking over on oct 28 even before then musk s habit of striking back at his faultfinders online didn t adorn him with the air of someone you could approach with anything implying criticism for many users including myself the twitter experience has changed noticeably for the worse since then for all that musk railed about the proportion of bots and fake accounts on twitter during the months in which he was trying to extricate himself from the us 44bil deal my twitter feed has been inundated with obviously fake accounts for all that he has promised advertisers that he won t allow the platform to become a hellscape of racist antisemitic and other hate speech noxious tweets have proliferated according to researchers musk seems to be making twitter policy on the fly he reportedly contemplated charging users about us 20 a month to retain the blue checkmarks designating them as verified users a sort of certification that they are who they say they are i m one as a way to monetize users and supplement advertising revenue then he announced on twitter that the fee would be us 8 a month though that would cover not only verification but other mostly unspecified privileges or services be that as it may the general opinion of users seems to be that the blue mark is of such nebulous value that its proper price is closer to us 0 twitter began selling blue checks on nov 6 even if every one of the estimated 400 000 verified users paid us 8 monthly to keep their putative status that would only produce about us 38 million a year not a patch on the estimated us 1 billion in annual interest expense the company has incurred because of musk s takeover or the losses the company has recorded in recent years which came to us 272 million last year it s possible one supposes that opening a pay window for anyone seeking verification might expand the market but it might also devalue the checkmark by making it impossible to distinguish those who are really verified from those who merely paid for the badge if musk s policies continue to provoke a hemorrhaging of users as seems to have happened just in the last week things will only look worse for his us 44bil plaything that brings us back to meta the company s corporate personality has always been inextricable from zuckerberg but he hasn t always been a firm hand at the tiller among other things the company has taken fire from regulators and users for its crummy privacy protections in july 2019 the federal trade commission hit it with a us 5 billion penalty for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information that was the largest ftc penalty ever for a privacy violation and reflected the fact that the practices of then facebook violated an agreement the company had reached with the ftc on privacy issues in 2011 facebook was then so big however that zuckerberg and his investors could afford to shrug off the penalty after all us 5bil was what facebook collected in revenue in an average month that would still be the case now as it happens meta recorded revenue of us 118bil last year or almost twice as much per month as that 2019 penalty and its monthly profit has been almost 70 higher in the first nine months of this year than it was in the same period of 2019 other zuckerberg pivots have faded away or blown up in 2016 the company announced that it would be pivoting to video as its primary medium the best way to tell stories in this world where so much information is coming at us actually is video a facebook executive said it conveys so much more information in a much quicker period so actually the trend helps us to digest much more information this was of course exactly wrong the best and most efficient way of absorbing information was and is via print not video facebook was eventually accused of defrauding advertisers by feeding them fake estimates of the viewership of video ads in 2016 and 2017 and paid a us 40mil settlement in the aftermath of meta s dismal results in february zuckerberg again proposed a pivot to video which looked like a sign that he was running out of ideas for the company zuckerberg sometimes displays what might be described as a whim of iron a common malady among kings princes admirals and other individuals accustomed to issuing orders and having them obeyed without backtalk among other ventures the company s idea of creating a cryptocurrency named libra in 2019 was scrapped earlier this year meta currently faces daunting head winds those include a reinvigorated federal trade commission which earlier this year won permission to pursue an antitrust lawsuit against the company from a federal judge who found the ftc s allegations robust and detailed and rejected the company s attack on ftc chair lina khan another difficulty is public doubt about its social impact it s blamed for undermining the health and self image of teen girls through its instagram photo sharing app as whistleblower frances haugen told a congressional committee last year its role in spreading political disinformation was documented in the wake of the 2016 presidential election none of this means that meta s fortunes might not turn around again it s still a powerful social and financial force reaching 3 7 billion users monthly its us 118bil in 2021 revenue and us 39 4bil in profits last year place it in the highest echelon of american corporations ranked 27th by revenue among the fortune 500 the question is where meta would be if mark zuckerberg had to answer to shareholders or a board with the power to hire and fire a ceo or anybody meta would undoubtedly be a different company and maybe just maybe a better one los angeles times tribune news service michael hiltzik is a columnist for the los angeles times

foreign currency dealers have complained to the inspector general of police usman baba about their ordeals in the hands of operatives of the economic and financial crimes commission following the arrest of some of them the dealers will also send a copy of their petition to the senate even as members of the association of bureau de change operators in the federal capital territory on thursday and friday met with operatives of the anti graft agency the meeting was aimed at resolving the forex crisis occasioned by the rush for dollars following the announcement by the central bank of nigeria to redesign some naira notes this is happening as the anti graft agency intensified investigations into the financial transactions of the forex dealers in a bid to spot illicit activities such as money laundering the forensic probe of their bank accounts it was learnt would help detectives in tracking down the forex dealers sponsors and their high profile customers especially government officials and political officeholders a source told sunday punch that the essence of the efcc raids was to identify the big men behind the bdc operators their sources of funds transactions and customers and ultimately to frustrate moves by hoarders to offload their naira cash haul ahead of december 15 when the high denominations would be released to the public detectives have obtained some necessary information from the forex dealers who were arrested and a forensic analysis and probe of their financial transactions have commenced the source disclosed it was further learnt that the efcc had released all the forex dealers who were arrested during the two day raids after obtaining the necessary information from them including their personal and bank details and who they were working

economy confirming the meeting the assistant provost association of bureau de change operators zone 4 wuse abuja mallam muhammed nera said the group was also planning to meet with the efcc chairman abdulrasheed bawa he stated we had a meeting with the efcc on thursday and friday a meeting of understanding they didn t come to raid on thursday and friday but we told them that if they were looking for missing money they should start from the ministries they should start with the presidency ministers directors and others they are just beating around the bush they know those stealing money they were asking our members who gave them the naira used in their transactions if you think that money is missing follow the trail from the ministries and other places people are struggling to survive every bureau de change has about 200 persons under him they have parents children and people working for them nera advised the detectives to follow the money trail and bank accounts instead of chasing down forex dealers struggling to survive he contended that the commission had no authority to order people into its vehicles without presenting warrants of arrest he said the efcc had access to the bank accounts and financial transactions of every citizen wondering why the agency was not tracking boko haram fighters and their financiers and focusing on other urgent national issues according to him the association has cautioned its members not to run away the next time efcc operatives storm their offices insisting that they are ready to confront the commission we have told our people that nobody should run when we see them efcc operatives and nobody should follow them to their office unless we ask them to do so they are part of the government they have the law they know what to do but they have to do things in a proper manner we are ready for them we are ready to face them not by fighting or through argument but facing them with the law nera stated he also disclosed that the association had petitioned the ig and would also write to the senate and the cbn over the alleged harassment of its members by the efcc he explained that the dealers had sought to meet with the cbn leadership before the latest incidents but their request was not acknowledged adding we have written letters to them over 10 times but they didn t acknowledge them when asked why the anti graft agency was raiding the bdc offices the head media and publicity efcc wilson uwujaren pleaded for time to find out but he had yet to provide a response as of the time of filing this report different dollar rates the naira weakened to 885 to the united states dollar on saturday in parallel markets in lagos currency dealers who spoke to sunday punch using only their first names pegged the parallel market rates at n885 1 on saturday one of the bdc operators mallam bala said he was out of dollars but insisted on the n885 rate i do not have dollars now although the rate stands at n885 i don t have any to sell bala stated another dealer mustapha said he could only sell the dollar at n890 he had quoted n880 on friday evening the price of dollar changes every minute it can reach n950 on monday depending on the demand he said earlier on friday he had said we buy at n875 and sell for n880 but he was no longer ready to sell at that rate when one of our correspondents contacted him on saturday evening an operator at zone 4 wuse abuja who gave his name simply as umar said the parallel rate stood at n910 he had quoted n905 on friday the price is n910 today wallahi he swore earlier on friday he had said i sell at n905 but buy at n900 maybe by monday the rate will come down another operator within the fct magaji said the rates were between n890 and n910 if i am selling and n888 if i m buying at thei e forex window the naira hit a high of 447 before closing at 445 5 on friday with a total of 94 07m traded in the window meanwhile the cbn maintained n440 26 as the official rate on its website findings by sunday punch revealed that the cbn had been having meetings with the banks on the naira redesign many of the banks have been sending messages to their customers to deposit their cash the banks also disclosed that they had begun saturday operations strictly for the purpose of taking cash deposits to create more access analysts identify factors analysts have fingered the central bank of nigeria s recent move to redesign the naira as a major factor fuelling the rising dollar rate the president association of bureaux de change operators of nigeria alhaji aminu gwadabe said there were several illegal activities going on in the market and blamed unlicensed operators as the major culprits he stressed the need to sanitise the market to strengthen the bdc segment of the economy the licensed people are not allowed to operate in the market which is why this is going on it is wrong to support this kind of situation where many things are going wrong in the market we cannot see this and support it he said gwadabe noted that the naira was facing a war of attrition worsened by currency substitution speculation politics and exclusion of the bdcs from the fx market economists knock cbn an economist at the university of uyo prof akpan ekpo explained that the parallel market was driven by fear panic and uncertainty over the cbn s plan to redesign the currency i think it is very simple the cbn s plan to redesign the n200 n500 and n1000 is a major cause so many people have now bought dollars with their naira and are hoarding it so this has further weakened the naira and that s why we have seen a sharp rise in naira depreciation he stated ekpo said the depreciation of the currency was different from devaluation he explained it is either they have enough quantity of the dollar to back up the naira or they make the adjustment in the official rate as i mentioned earlier besides this is a demand and supply problem people are buying dollars out of the system and we don t have enough dollars also there is panic and uncertainty because it is a shock those who have kept naira in their houses for years are buying dollars illegally because whatever they buy at the bureau is better than the official rate so they are buying dollars and keeping it so that they can take it to the bank and buy the new naira he added that uncertainty would further drive the widening rates and this was worrisome as it might lead to more inflation it will affect prices because the inflation we are having is exchange rate pass through ekpo noted a professor of economics at nnamdi azikiwe university awka anambra state uche nwogwugwu stressed the need to restore confidence in the nigerian economy he agreed with akpan that there was a shock in the financial market as many people were not certain about so many things that fear or uncertainty is what you do not need at this point in time he said

elon musk s decision to take twitter out of the stock market should allow him to make major changes quickly but this has required the company to be heavily indebted a risky choice for a the practice is old and has had some famous precedents from computer maker dell a success to toys r us toy stores a failure but the example of twitter is very different from a classic takeover with delisting said steve kaplan professor at the university of chicago most of these takeovers relate to companies that make money explains the academic while the social network loses it twitter s activity was thus clearly in deficit during the first two quarters of 2022 the equation has been further complicated by the loans taken out by elon musk in the amount of 13 billion dollars which will have to be repaid not by the entrepreneur but by the san francisco company according to a calculation made by afp it will be necessary to disburse a little less than a billion dollars in the first year for interest and principal a very high amount for a group whose turnover has not reached than five billion dollars in 2021 there is going to be a lot of pressure to reduce costs and increase revenues so that they can meet debt maturities warns steve kaplan otherwise elon musk will have to hand over the wallet as the main shareholder to avoid bankruptcy on friday the entrepreneur got rid of about half of twitter s employees it is also looking for new sources of income in particular by soon offering users the possibility of subscribing to a paid subscription at eight dollars per month the development of the blue bird social network as imagined by the boss of tesla and spacex should require significant investment and probably new money more difficult to raise in theory by an unlisted company i don t think he can borrow more said erik gordon a professor at the university of michigan s ross school of business the only way is to raise capital ordinarily it would be very difficult but there is a musk factor you do a few tweets and the money rolls in protected from wall street another major difference in the acquisition of twitter most transactions of this type are initiated with financial or industrial reasoning while elon musk did not have any he argues he was just unhappy with the way twitter was handling the issue of freedom of expression and thought the company was mismanaged and he could do better says erik gordon delisting is usually followed by radical changes for the company concerned recalls sreedhar bharath a professor at arizona state university often out of sight as the company no longer has obligation to communicate publicly elon musk new leader of twitter plans to thank about 50 of the approximately 7 500 employees olivier douliery afp archives society is protected from punishment by financial markets if they don t like the changes he said wall street sometimes focuses excessively on quarterly results whereas with an unlisted company executives can prioritize long term objectives without short term fallout but with the visibility of twitter important decisions will filter and largely maintain the group in the public space tempers jagadeesh sivadasan professor at the university of michigan it has already been verified for the first decisions made after the acquisition according to a study published in 2019 by two researchers from california polytechnic university and which looked at nearly 500 transactions between 1980 and 2006 around 20 of large companies subject to a leveraged buyout lbo file for bankruptcy within 10 years against 2 for a sample of other companies most are doing better than listed companies says erik gordon but you don t hear much about them it s the big failures that get all the attention and create this idea that debt is killing businesses most often it works which is why people keep doing it he insists musk is one of the most creative people in the world capable of building three totally different companies paypal tesla and spacex all of which have reached over 100 billion in valuation says steve kaplan and he s going to attract to twitter real talent that there hasn t been for a while i wouldn t bet against him 2022 afp

the carbon market has reached a crossroads after more than two decades as a niche tool for addressing climate change mainstream interest and investments in voluntary carbon credits are on the rise but many would be investors remain wary due to the complexity of this nascent and often misunderstood market mechanism and regular accusations against participants of greenwashing written in collaboration with written in collaboration with greenwashing presenting an environmentally friendly public image while avoiding or delaying costly changes to one s own business model and operations is a real issue if companies see carbon credit purchases as an easy way out of the climate change dilemma but the reality is that offsetting the use of carbon credits to balance one s carbon emissions can play a legitimate crucial role in tackling the climate crisis by putting a price on emissions indirect effects and funding activities that help resolve it if stakeholders find ways to increase trust and participation in the voluntary carbon market charting a pragmatic path to scaling it up it can become one of the most powerful climate change solutions at our disposal more investments more challenges the voluntary carbon market s objective is to facilitate the flow of capital to projects that either avoid carbon emissions that would have occurred in their absence or remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere in 2021 the total market value exceeded 1 billion for the first time reaching a global volume of about 160 million retired carbon credits those represent 160 million tons of avoided or removed carbon emissions across the four largest voluntary carbon standards while this still pales in comparison to the size of traditional commodity markets current projections indicate the voluntary carbon market could reach between 30 billion and 50 billion in value by 2030 this sort of scale will be necessary to compensate for the world s combined annual emissions of about 46 billion tons of co 2 even when considering increased technological options to reduce emissions despite the growth of the carbon market and its potential to provide financial incentives for decarbonization the absence of a clear industry consensus on how to most effectively participate has left many businesses nervous about jumping in a primary concern is susceptibility to accusations of greenwashing while at the same time needing to demonstrate progress toward stated emissions reduction goals this has led to a recent pattern in which some companies increasingly shun avoidance credits from projects such as forest conservation in favor of removal credits from projects that physically take carbon from the atmosphere such as forest restoration the rationale for this is rooted in the 2018 intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc report on global warming of 1 5c this report s scientific guidance toward emissions removals has been translated into several standards for achieving corporate net zero emissions such as the science based target initiative s sbti net zero framework that initially prescribed the use of removal credits only it s important to note however that the ipcc and sbti are describing the net zero end state in which the world has reduced all but the hardest to avoid emissions and the remaining emissions are balanced with removals to reach an equilibrium in 2022 we re far away from this end state there are gigatons of annual carbon emissions to avoid before we can gradually switch to removing carbon from the atmosphere exclusively this is reflected in more recent guidance from sbti and its beyond value chain mitigation approach to reducing corporate emissions which incorporates avoidance credits as well furthermore the carbon removal market is still in its infancy and much smaller than many would be participants realize in 2021 only 6 of total carbon credits issued were classified as true removal credits by the berkeley carbon trading project the long lead time for forest growth availability of suitable land and technology constraints will result in an undersupplied carbon credits market for decades if avoidance credits don t remain a part of the equation while the higher demand and resulting high prices of removal credits will be beneficial for increased technology deployment especially for innovative solutions such as carbon capture and storage the market also needs to deliver on its objectives to finance ecosystem conservation as part of a comprehensive strategy against climate change scientists estimate that the forest and land use sector can contribute 30 of the mitigation needed to prevent a warming increase of more than 1 5 degrees celsius with reducing deforestation being a key component of this carbon credits remain one of the few mechanisms left to address deforestation at scale especially in jurisdictions where regulation has proven unsuccessful according to data from the world resources institute global loss of forest cover and resulting greenhouse gas emissions are near their all time high see figure 1 not only is nature loss a huge problem for ecosystems but halting this represents one of the most cost effective ways for corporate buyers and individuals to help mitigate climate change figure 1 carbon emissions from the loss of forest cover remain near an all time high significant cobenefits are also achieved by nature based avoidance projects which often have tangible and quantifiable effects beyond the co 2 avoided these can include increased biodiversity local education and employment opportunities access to clean water pollution mitigation and more buyers of these credits have a two fold opportunity to compensate for their currently unavoidable emissions at the most effective cost as well as align these investments with sustainable development goals or overarching corporate sustainability or strategy goals yet despite decades of commitments and the range of additional benefits the global community hasn t found a way to unlock the full scale of capital required for ecosystem conservation carbon markets could be the answer but participants must find the right balance between financing much needed development of carbon removal technologies and the immediate conservation of natural carbon stocks through avoidance credits all this is to say many buyers will have to adopt a more nuanced and blended approach to meet net zero compliance by 2050 backing away from the ambition to achieve net zero solely through removal credits a singular focus on removal risks making the carbon market accessible only to highly profitable businesses and those with a vested interest in certain technological solutions rather than a global mechanism through which stakeholders of all shapes and sizes can work toward achieving emission reduction goals and financing global decarbonization as buyers ramp up pragmatic investments in both avoidance and removal credits to build healthy carbon portfolios the market will be able to achieve the scale needed to assume its role as a major tool in mitigating climate change the trust factor now comes the hard part increasing participation in the carbon market this will fundamentally require building trust for many years only a few dozen companies have actively used voluntary carbon credits at scale and these organizations often deployed complex diligence processes that aren t practical for less sophisticated or smaller buyers at the same time varying claims about the use of carbon credits have confused consumers and customers making it difficult to refute accusations of greenwashing skeptics have suggested the voluntary carbon market could end up an unregulated wild west with minimal accountability and lowest common denominator credits as the prevailing commodity this scenario looks increasingly unlikely but we do see three areas in which the market needs to continue building trust the good news is there s cause for optimism for all three supply of carbon credits trust in the quality of carbon credits is critical for buyers to engage and increase the flow of capital to projects unfortunately faith in the market has been shaken at times by media reports on credits with low additionality the degree to which credit purchases directly finance carbon reductions that wouldn t have otherwise occurred inflated baselines overestimating the threat to a particular ecosystem resulting in unjustified rewards for its protection and insignificant payments to project developers on the ground the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market icvcm a multistakeholder initiative with expert members from all corners of the carbon and climate sphere is currently developing a global quality standard for carbon credits the core carbon principles these should help businesses set and perhaps most important understand common minimum requirements for the integrity of purchased credits third party organizations like sylvera bezero carbon and calyx global have also emerged to issue carbon reduction project ratings these can provide additional confidence to corporate buyers and serve as an important source for cross referencing quality similar to credit rating agencies in traditional markets we expect these initiatives to foster more nuanced perspectives and increasingly drive the mainstream market toward consensus on what constitutes a high quality carbon credit use of carbon credits to increase the mainstream public s trust companies have to do a better job communicating their use of credits in a clear transparent and standardized way differing conventions on the inclusion of various emissions scopes and types of credits plus a plethora of standards certifications and logos often make it difficult for consumers to look behind the marketing message consistent repeated messaging and gradual convergence on unified language across carbon projects will help everyone make more informed decisions several recent publications from the world resources institute the voluntary carbon markets integrity initiative vcmi and the nordic dialogue add to a growing body of guidance on how to use carbon credits in a standardized way as one element of a consistent corporate net zero strategy leading companies increasingly have an opportunity to develop clear science backed narratives on the topic that they can use to their competitive advantage while also encouraging continued growth of the market trading of carbon credits there s also work to do to increase trust in the carbon market s connective tissue in mature commodities markets the trading of spot futures and derivative contracts provide efficient liquidity and transparency in price discovery the carbon market is still developing similar functions with trading often historically constrained to bilateral agreements between the producer project developer and end customer corporate offsetter not only does that setup inhibit liquidity and price discovery but its highly manual nature increases transaction costs and limits the share of total market spending that actually reaches physical projects on the ground recent market infrastructure developments give room for optimism and are helping carbon mature as a commodity exchanges such as those operated by cme group aircarbon exchange acx and intercontinental exchange ice are standardizing carbon credit trading and price discovery by offering well defined tradable spot and futures contracts increased trading activity and liquidity in the market will allow for more flexible buying and financing structures such as linking carbon credit prices to an index this ensures fair value goes back to local communities and reduces delivery risk for buyers the road ahead corporate sustainability teams and other carbon buyers might wonder where to look for better ways to support pragmatic scaling of the carbon market and facilitate investments in projects that reduce global emissions in our work in this area we ve seen several emerging best practices first leading companies are making carbon offsetting part of a holistic climate change strategy the most effective ones follow a mitigation hierarchy which starts with avoiding and reducing the use of fossil fuels replacing polluting technologies and only then offsetting the remaining emissions leading companies define a plan for decarbonizing their own operations such as an sbti commitment with clear intermediate targets and spell out the initiatives that will reduce their emissions over time once carbon reduction initiatives are implemented the company s remaining unavoidable emissions should be offset the recently published provisional claims code of practice by vcmi provides a detailed guide for how to implement this hierarchy next recognizing that achieving net zero emissions is a marathon not a sprint the most effective companies are building a balanced portfolio of carbon credits decision makers should acknowledge that procuring credits has a critical function in the market not to purchase removal credits as fast as possible but rather to finance the comprehensive net zero transition starting with avoiding further emissions today by procuring credits from different regions methodologies standards and project types businesses can not only reduce their risk through diversification but also address climate change with an all of the above approach instead of a singular solution the illustrative portfolio below demonstrates the mix of carbon removal and avoidance credits as well as the shift over time as supply and emissions footprints change see figure 2 figure 2 a pragmatic climate strategy complements decarbonization with a carbon credits mix that gradually shifts toward removal credits buying methods are important too in lieu of repeated one off purchases from the spot market signing longer term offtake agreements from carbon projects ensures that finance continues flowing to critical conservation and removal activities as well as the ongoing community benefits the security of longer term commitments from buyers can further develop the market by sending strong signals for project development supply and therefore diversify high quality options available to fill demand over time lastly leading companies monitor the market closely and watch for critical signposts participants that keep an eye on emerging conventions new standards and public perceptions can not only get ahead of greenwashing accusations but also encourage healthier more realistic and financially sound narratives around carbon the carbon market offers an elegant tool to finance climate change solutions as it rapidly evolves businesses and other stakeholders would be wise not to lose sight of the ultimate objective to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through any means necessary a more positive framing and willingness to participate in this growing market in more diversified dynamic ways over time akin to the complexity of the overarching climate challenge itself will benefit us all

from one perspective the historical significance of this tuesday s us midterm elections should not be overstated anticipated republican gains and a consequent loss of democratic control of congress would if they materialise be nothing out of the ordinary the party in power usually performs poorly at the midpoint of the election cycle especially if the sitting president is unpopular and joe biden with a disapproval rating of 55 certainly is viewed another way however the immediate significance of the vote for an angry divided america that split roughly 51 47 between biden and donald trump in 2020 cannot be overestimated the backdrop is looming economic recession pessimism about the future deep schisms over race abortion rights crime guns and climate and rising political violence fuelled by disinformation far right pundits conspiracy theorists and paramilitary militias so febrile is the state of the union in 2022 that some ask can democracy endure the main concern is that the extremist maga republican faction continues to deny trump s 2020 defeat while many more moderate gop candidates supinely refuse to challenge them trump supporters in many states are fixing voting rules and intimidating opponents these elections are crucial because there may not be many more at least not free and fair ones underlying this sinister campaign within a campaign is the implicit or explicit use of political violence recorded examples include the hounding of election workers threats to judges armed demonstrations outside statehouses attacks on abortion clinics threats to hospitals caring for transgender children assaults on flight attendants in arguments over covid rules and harassment of librarians over which books to stock warning again of the dangers to democracy biden last week directly linked the recent shocking hammer attack on the husband of the democratic house speaker nancy pelosi to trump s big lie about the stolen election we re facing a defining moment biden declared we must with one overwhelming unified voice speak as a country and say there s no place for voter intimidation or political violence in america it is a foolish conceit that the us is somehow immune to global forces it may have been once it isn t now yet his assertion that democracy is on the ballot for all of us is flatly rejected by conservatives who argue that an out of touch president is scaremongering to win votes about 63 of likely democrat voters agree with biden that a functioning democracy is more important than a strong economy according to one survey but 70 of republicans say the opposite tellingly 79 of all voters said they felt things were out of control in america the extent to which americans on both sides of the divide seem to think the worst of each other or are misled or misinformed was revealed by a recent cbs yougov poll of 2 100 registered voters of all persuasions for example 53 said they believed that the democrats if they won would cut police funding and 59 that they would open the us mexico border to unlimited immigration neither proposal is democratic party policy conversely 63 said they believed republicans would try to impeach biden while 56 expected the gop to overturn democratic victories and impose a national abortion ban sadly that is entirely plausible yet despite this overall lack of confidence in the integrity of politicians and the electoral process a striking 89 said they would definitely or probably vote or had already voted on this evidence reports of democracy s death are greatly exaggerated so intense is america s introspection that many miss the bigger picture neither republicans nor democrats have magic answers to problems essentially global in nature recessionary pressures energy costs post pandemic supply issues climate impacts china s economic downturn war in europe like britain s brexiters it is a foolish conceit of american conservatives that the us is somehow immune to such global forces it may have been once it isn t now rising political violence while predominantly emanating from the far right also reflects a broader crisis facing all western democracies the frustration and anger felt by ordinary people that self serving political elites cannot be trusted that their votes are wasted in the us failure to reform constitutional anachronisms such as the electoral college and two per state distribution of senate seats regardless of population size is a self inflicted handicap in order to make our country successful and safe and glorious i will very very very probably do it again get ready donald trump and then as if these were not problems enough there s trump himself lowering over the electoral landscape like a thundercloud ready to burst the former president edges closer by the day to declaring his candidacy for 2024 here he is speaking in iowa last week in order to make our country successful and safe and glorious i will very very very probably do it again get ready that s all i m telling you very soon get ready it s plain that trump has learned nothing regrets nothing cares for nothing but his own endless self promotion it s amazing he is not in jail he faces accusations of insurrection and subversion over the 6 january 2021 capitol hill riots election rigging in georgia criminal theft of white house records fraudulent business dealings and a defamation suit by a writer who says he raped her yet not only is he still a free man he s favourite for the republican nomination given his record in office and his behaviour since it is difficult to imagine a more dangerous prospect for us democracy for global security and for common decency than a second trump presidency yet it is on the results of this week s midterm elections that his final decision to run may hinge for that if for no other reason we hope americans vote democrat

by elizabeth ayoola of nerdwallet employee benefits are one of the most attractive things about a prospective job and can determine whether you take an opportunity or leave it when you do decide to take the job do you maximize the benefits if not you may be leaving money on the table and in this time of high inflation you need all the cash you can get to offset rising prices in the spirit of focusing on what you can control let s talk about employee benefits and how you may be able to use them to your advantage during these uncertain times know your benefits before you can maximize your employee benefits you have to know what they are says samantha gorelick a certified financial planner at brunch and budget a financial consulting firm based in new york city a lot of people don t actually know how much their employer will match or what their employer even offers in terms of 401 k s contributions to a health savings account or a flexible spending account or even short term long term disability she says gorelick says knowing what you have access to can affect your financial situation fyi this also happens to be open enrollment season for some companies so it s a great time to understand your benefits better open enrollment provides a limited window for you to opt into the benefits you may not be receiving evaluate your plan and its costs and opt out of benefits you may no longer need it usually takes place between october and january depending on your company think about health savings accounts assessing your health care options isn t always the most glamorous task but it can have financial perks for instance if you realize you haven t used many health care services in the past year and you re relatively healthy contributing to a health care fsa or hsa may be more cost effective than paying a high monthly premium hsas and fsas mimic bank accounts that allow you to pay for your health care expenses out of pocket sometimes your employer will contribute to those accounts too to contribute to an hsa you must have a high deductible health care plan both accounts can present opportunities employees can take advantage of especially regarding tax benefits says john campbell a senior vice president and senior wealth strategist at u s bank when you look at their hsa or fsa accounts that is an opportunity for them to set money aside on a pre tax basis that they can tap into to cover qualified or eligible medical expenses and deductibles that might be there he says with hsas the money you contribute grows tax free and qualified health care withdrawals are tax free too note that fsas and hsas are different in that with the former you have to spend the money in the account by the end of the year however with hsas you can roll any money you don t spend to the following year you can also invest with your hsa as you would with a brokerage account campbell says so it s not just getting a money market kind of a rate but they may even be able to take some of those funds and have some of it allocated towards mutual fund type investments inside of the account itself he says campbell says hsas are a savings and investing vehicle people can use to keep pace with rising health care costs in the future if you decide to use hsas or fsas keep in mind that they have different contribution limits fsa limits are 2 850 for individuals and 5 700 for families in 2022 and can be used with many health plans individuals with a high deductible health plan can contribute up to 3 650 to hsas if you have a family high deductible health plan you can contribute 7 300 tap into education stipends there s no telling what could happen with the job market if inflation keeps rising one way to boost your resume so you re in a good position regardless of which way the job market swings is to use education benefits such as tuition reimbursements or learning stipends consider using that benefit to take a course or get a qualification that develops your skills and increases your earning potential if your employer offers tuition reimbursement this could help you by freeing up money you might have spent out of pocket for tuition allowing you to save or invest that money says campbell negotiate a pay raise or employee stocks consider negotiating for a pay raise or employee stocks to improve your financial situation as the end of the year approaches think about assessing your performance throughout the year and building a case to renegotiate your salary if you have salary reviews coming up even better a pay raise can help you offset some of the increases in cost of living due to inflation and maintain your purchasing power and your ability to save says campbell evaluate retirement account contributions everyone s risk tolerance is different when investing especially when the market is taking a nosedive if you can stomach it consider upping your contributions to retirement accounts beyond your employee match if you get one says gorelick if you ve maxed out your 401 k limits after tax 401 k contributions may be another investment strategy if your employer offers it you can contribute up to 61 000 post tax dollars into your 401 k in 2022 giving you more tax deferred growth on your investments on the other hand you may be too financially stressed to raise your contributions and that s understandable other options in that case are to replenish your cash reserves or scale back on your retirement account contributions we are in periods of inflation which means most people may opt to keep more money in their pocket instead of putting it away into an investment account says gorelick

by geographic definition ethiopia is located in east africa it is landlocked in the horn of africa and shares borders with eritrea djibouti and somalia with its long chequered history ethiopia is discussed from different and divergent perspectives including its geography politics economy and culture many politicians academic experts and researchers also look at ethiopia s role within the region and its external relations on the global stage ethiopia has been these several years in the news media in may 1998 a border dispute with eritrea led to the eritrean ethiopian war which lasted until june 2000 and cost both countries an estimated 1 million a day this had a negative effect on ethiopia s economy but strengthened the ruling coalition early november ethiopia and its ethnic the tigray are desperately looking for a peace deal that sent them to south africa for his efforts in ending the 20 year long war between ethiopia and eritrea abiy ahmed was awarded the nobel prize for peace in 2019 after taking office in april 2018 46 year old abiy released political prisoners promised fair elections for 2019 and announced sweeping economic reforms with approximately 115 million population majority is still impoverished despite its huge land and other natural resources within ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the great rift valley which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands steppes or semi desert there is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate soils natural vegetation and settlement patterns ethiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands including the nile it has the largest water reserves in africa as of 2012 hydroelectric plants represented around 88 2 of the total installed electricity generating capacity the grand ethiopian renaissance dam project when finally completed it will provide surplus energy in ethiopia which will be available for export to neighbouring countries ethiopia is often considered as the birthplace of coffee which it produces more than any other nation on the continent coffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million ethiopians 16 of the population and it generates 1 4 billion in revenues annually ethiopian airlines wholly owned by the government is the flagship of ethiopia it serves a network of 125 passenger destinations ethiopian is africa s largest airline in terms of passengers carried destinations served fleet size and revenue addis ababa the prestigious capital city of ethiopia hosts the african union headquarters and all foreign governments and international organizations are represented here that compared moscow as a capital has modern infrastructure but lacks foreign representative organizations moscow is not new york or washington and with the russia ukraine crisis most foreign organizations exited the city china is the largest developing country in the world and africa is the continent with the largest number of developing countries that however china is visible with its investment and financing infrastructure in africa six years ago in january 2012 the african union inaugurated its new headquarters in addis ababa ethiopia the 200 million building was funded and largely built by china even using building materials imported from china in addition the construction of the headquarters of the africa center for disease control and prevention africa cdc is a project assisted with 48 million by china ethiopia the poorest nation by classification and from russia s perspectives for instance ethiopia is one of the poorest in need of food security and urgent humanitarian assistance president vladimir putin reiterated free delivery of food to africa s poorest referring to ethiopia djibouti somalia and sudan russian security council deputy chairman dmitry medvedev and south africa s deputy president david mabuza discussed early november within the strict adherence to the istanbul package agreements to export ukrainian grain and advance russian foodstuffs and fertilizers to world markets including africa medvedev confirmed russia s readiness to provide its stock of agricultural products to african partners free of charge according to turkish president tayyip erdogan an agreement was reached with russia on the supply of grain to poor countries in africa first of all the corridor will function for deliveries to the poor countries of africa in particular to djibouti and sudan he said putin consistently makes passionate arguments for a shift from western hegemony while russia as an alternative that could support sustainable development especially in africa on the other hand african leaders have to think seriously how to use their huge untapped resources for improving agricultural sector raise agricultural production for impoverished millions andrew korybko an american moscow based political analyst specializing in the relationship between the us strategy in afro eurasia wrote in october article to one world as ethiopia attempts to reduce its dependence on foreign food aid it must first seriously consider switching suppliers in order to not remain as vulnerable to the west s possible weaponization of this aid during the interim russia has become an agricultural superpower in recent years ironically enough largely due to its response to western sanctions according to president putin during his remarks at the latest valdai club plenary session it should therefore have more than enough supply to meet ethiopia s needs according to korybko s analysis the eurasian great power is incomparably more politically reliable than the west as evidenced by its support of ethiopia during its ongoing anti terrorist campaign in tigray the two countries even signed a military agreement over the summer which aims to revive their soviet era strategic partnership from the ethiopian perspective it would be wise to rely more on russian wheat imports including through possible food aid than on western ones while it transitions towards sustainably ensuring its food security which will take time but in a sharp contrast to above why should african countries and leaders brace for grains imports and be struggling with rising food prices as a direct result of russia ukraine crisis in the national development context this to a large extent are not questions of neo colonialism imperialism or joe biden administration ethiopia djibouti somalia and sudan and many others have get back to learn the advantages of pragmatic import substitution policies in basic economics the way forward beyond food assistance that is commendable but if it is interested in sustainable food security then russia has to facilitate agricultural development in africa that compared china has always been sharing its agricultural development experience and technology with africa to support african countries in improving agricultural production and processing and to help them in building their agricultural value chains and trade since 2012 7 456 african trainees have received agricultural training in china through projects such as sending chinese agricultural experts to africa more than 50 000 africans have been trained and 23 agricultural demonstration centers have been built to date china has established agricultural cooperation mechanisms with 23 african countries and regional organizations and signed 72 bilateral and multilateral agricultural cooperation agreements since 2012 china has signed 31 agricultural cooperation agreements with 20 african countries and regional organizations in 2019 the first china africa agriculture cooperation forum was held which announced the establishment of the china au agriculture cooperation commission and the formulation of a program of action to promote china africa cooperation in agricultural modernization by the end of 2020 more than 200 chinese companies had an investment stock of 1 11 billion in agricultural sector in 35 african countries their investments cover areas such as planting breeding and processing more than 350 types of african agricultural products can be traded with china all this ensures steady growth in china africa agricultural trade significant to note that during business conference held at the atlantic council s africa center on april 22 african development bank group president dr akinwumi adesina speaking as a guest of the washington dc us based think tank called for an increased sense of urgency amid what he described as a once in a century convergence of global challenges for africa including a looming food crisis the continent s most vulnerable countries have been hit hardest by conflict climate change and the pandemic which upended economic and development progress in africa adesina suggested that africa must rapidly expand its production to meet food security challenges my basic principle is that africa should not be begging we must solve our own challenges ourselves without depending on others he said in a similar argument and direction the world bank has also expressed worry over sub saharan africa countries high expenditure on food imports that could be produced locally using their vast uncultivated lands and devastating impact on budgets due to rising external borrowing according to the bank it is crucial to increase the effectiveness of current resources to expanding and supporting local production especially in the sectors of agriculture and industry during this crucial period of russia ukraine crisis with the above facts african leaders have to demonstrate a higher level of commitment to tackling post pandemic challenges and the russia ukraine crisis that have created global economic instability and other related severe consequences and this requires collaborative action and much stronger pace of transformation to cater for the needs of the population over 1 3 billion in africa conclusion in a wider context as i have written multiple times about the food security especially in africa while a few outspoken african leaders shifted blames to russia ukraine crisis others focus on spending state budget to import food to calm rising discontent among the population it is necessary to to redirect focus on improving local agricultural production some experts and international organizations have also expressed the fact that african leaders have to adopt import substitution mechanisms and use their financial resources on strengthening agricultural production systems providing food assistance is commendable but will definitely offer the needed long term food security external investment in africa s agriculture is the best way to support africa china is doing its best so also some european union members african leaders have to continue building production capacity look for a more resilient agriculture and food systems as answers to national food requirements and needs some external states are readily assisting with long term solutions u s congress allocated 336 5 million to bilateral programs for sub saharan africa including burkina faso the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia ghana guinea kenya liberia madagascar malawi mali mozambique niger nigeria rwanda senegal sierra leone somalia south sudan tanzania uganda zambia and zimbabwe and regional programs in southern africa west africa and the sahel also of this 2 76 billion usaid is programming 2 billion in emergency food security assistance over the next three months last august the united states has provided nearly 1 billion specifically for countries in africa and further 2 billion commitment to central african republic the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia kenya mali mozambique nigeria somalia south sudan and uganda that compared russia s agro export federal center for development of agribusiness exports in close partnership collaboration with trust technologies and the business expert community plans to earn revenue 33 billion through massive export of grains meat poultry and other agricultural products to africa according to interfax news agency and tass reports the plan remotely aims at marginalizing local production cut out foreign contributions to support livelihoods through local production and make african leaders spend their hard earned revenue on food imports instead of supporting agricultural production the business concept report says eight african countries have been identified and chose as target markets for the delivery of the agricultural products these are angola cameroon ethiopia ghana kenya mauritius nigeria tunisia and south africa in a sharp contrast to food importing african countries zimbabwe has increased wheat production especially during this crucial time of the current russia ukraine crisis this achievement was attributed to efforts in mobilizing local scientists to improve the crop s production zimbabwe is an african country that has been under western sanctions for 25 years hindering imports of much needed machinery and other inputs to drive agriculture but now working towards food sufficiency in southern africa addressing food security in this changing geopolitical times should be the key in the 21st century for africa from the discussions above and various perspectives african leaders have to focus mobilize and redirect both human and financial resources toward increasing local production the surest approach to attain sustainable food security for over 1 3 billion population in africa and this falls directly within the agenda 2063 of the african union
