1 industrial output how much stuff an economy makes 2 employment too much employment leads to employers fighting over workers which leads to higher wages which leads to higher prices 3 the money supply more money when an economy is producing the same amount or less stuff equals higher prices 4 velocity of money if money is exchanging hands and if so how fast is it exchanging hands on january 1 2020 bitcoin was trading at 7 160 the dow jones was also trading at 28 634 on january 3 2020 before crashing to 19 173 on march 20 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic broke out in the united states states and the federal governments immediately shut down the economy and millions of people lost their jobs as part of its effort to stimulate the economy the u s government issued stimulus checks to millions of employed americans the government had to borrow by selling its debt in the form of u s treasury bonds and other types of securities the after the bonds are sold the federal reserve gets to work and starts printing money but money printing is not new what is so ironic about this number is that just two years ago federal reserve reported thataccording to a report from abc news the 2019 federal reserve survey finds that almost 40 of american adults wouldn t be able to cover a 400 emergency with cash savings or a credit card charge that they could quickly pay off the us government has been printing massive amounts of new money money is usually a medium of change to facilitate the sale purchase or trade of goods between buyers and sellers however since there is no productivity good and services to back up the trillions of dollars currently in circulation who cares you may ask too much money in circulation chasing the same amount of goods leads to inflation for example the impact of inflation can also be seen inremember the three stimulus checks issued to millions of struggling americans instead of spending the money on food savings or paying off debts some people invested their stimulus checks in stocks gamestop etc and cryptocurrencies like bitcoins further driving up their prices the other problem with the fed printing too much money is that it leads to thewhat the fed is doing now has been tried throughout history take for example germany between june 1921 and november 1923 in weimar germany the highest monthly inflation rate rose by over 30 000 zimbabwe is another country with hyperinflation in the video jake tran takes us on a journey throughonly to find themselves in deeper economic woes jake also added that the reason why we haven t seen inflation is because the amount of money being printed is only one of the factors that contribute to inflation to get inflation jake explains we need

spartanburg s c ap a former utility executive who lied to ratepayers and regulators costing billions of dollars after he found out a pair of nuclear reactors being built in south carolina were hopelessly behind schedule will soon be heading to prison for two years a state judge monday accepted the negotiated sentence of former scana ceo kevin marsh he is the first executive to go to prison over the project which lasted nine years and never generated a watt of power marsh has cooperated with investigators spending at least seven days talking to the fbi prosecutors said a ceo for a fortune 500 company is going to prison and is paying 5 million to the people of south carolina state attorney general alan wilson said outside the spartanburg county courtroom under the agreement marsh is to report in early december to a federal prison in butner north carolina which includes a large hospital rather than a state facility he will serve the entire federal two year federal sentence south carolina circuit judge mark hayes suspended a 10 year state sentence but told marsh he will have to serve it if he does not keep cooperating or fails to successfully serve three years of probation marsh isn t the only executive facing legal problems a second former scana executive and an official at westinghouse electric co the lead contractor to build two new reactors at the v c summer plant north of columbia have also pleaded guilty a second westinghouse executive has been indicted and is awaiting trial prosecutors now are expected to turn their attention to westinghouse while marsh lied about the lack of progress in the final years of construction of the reactors westinghouse knew of the problem long before and did not tell marsh or other scana executives u s assistant attorney brook andrews said at marsh s sentencing thursday in federal court marsh s lawyer asked the judge and by extension the public to remember that this should not be the end a project like this doesn t go down the tubes because one person was involved said defense attorney robert bolchoz who compared marsh to a captain of a ship who trusted a crew working against him marsh pleaded guilty in federal court in february to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and in state court to obtaining property by false pretenses the nuclear debacle was set up by a law passed in 2007 that allowed utilities to charge ratepayers to build power plants before they started generating power it divorced the risk from the people who were spending the money state assistant attorney general creighton waters said you won if you won and you won if you lost if the project was a failure and you abandoned it you still got to recoup that cost from customers that put a lot of responsibility on marsh as the leader of scana and he failed by keeping his mouth shut when problems mounted and collecting bonuses instead of risking his job waters said marsh made 5 million in 2017 the year the utility abandoned the hopelessly behind schedule project his plea agreement requires 5 million in restitution which has already been paid to a fund that provides help to pay electric bills of low income people the actions by marsh and other executives took more than 1 billion from the pockets of ratepayers and investors authorities said in an 87 page securities and exchange commission lawsuit filed against him and a second executive in 2020 scana and its subsidiary south carolina electric gas were destroyed by the debt and poor management and were bought out by dominion energy of virginia in 2019 state owned utility santee cooper which had a 45 stake in the project ended up saddled with 4 billion in debt even though scana controlled management of the project marsh read a brief statement in court monday similar to the one he read in federal court thursday he said not a day has gone by in the past four years where he did not regret that failure of the project i accept full responsibility marsh said i feel sorry for everything that occurred marsh s original plea deal said sentencing would wait until the investigation was over to assure his full cooperation but prosecutors relented after marsh s wife of 46 years was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer marsh never wavered from saying the two reactors being built at the v c summer site north of columbia would be finished by the end of 2020 a deadline that had to be met to receive the 1 4 billion in federal tax credits needed to keep the 10 billion project from overwhelming the utility prosecutors said marsh lied and presented rosy projections on the progress of the reactors that he knew were false in earning calls presentations and news releases to keep investors happy and pump up the company s stock price u s district judge mary geiger lewis reluctantly accepted the deal even though she felt prosecutors and marsh s lawyers made it sound like the executive made mistakes instead of intentionally misleading people for well over a year your crime was committed with a little more elegance and sophistication than many i see geiger told marsh on thursday but you don t get credit for that ___ follow jeffrey collins on twitter at

releases our plan was to produce and ship aggressively in the first six months of fiscal 2022 in preparation for the facility relocation and then reduce production levels and net sales in the last half of the fiscal year due to the facility relocation we surpassed our goals in the first half of the 2022 fiscal year we still expect sales in fiscal 2022 third quarter to be significantly lower as planned due to the planned facility relocation our current estimate is for net sales in the fiscal 2022 third quarter to be approximately 2 0 to 2 2 million production levels are expected to be above the 2 2 million quarterly level and we expect some inventory build up bookings were lighter than we hoped in the quarter as we continue to see delays in contract awards we expect our largest contract with raytheon to be awarded late in the fiscal third quarter or early in the fiscal fourth quarter during the quarter we began to see a significant increase in supply chain delays on certain items this is symptomatic of the electronics components shortages affecting the automotive and other industries we will continue to work with suppliers to attempt to mitigate these disruptions we believe our results over the first six months have shown the potential operating leverage the business has unfortunately the continued impact of the coronavirus has hurt bookings by limiting our ability to make site visits to our existing customers and potential new customers to show them solitron s capabilities to meet their needs once we are able to make visits it will be a slow process as site visits frequently lead to further engagement and bookings can be six to twelve months after the initial visit typically sales are then six to nine months after receipt of bookings in the interim we have focused on increasing our web based marketing and are pleased with the page views our newer products are getting we have also manufactured and delivered sample products to customers to review in the meantime our primary focus over the next six months will continue to be completing the new facility upgrades relocating to the new facility and adjusting our cost structure as our balance sheet has improved we have begun and will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we would consider everything from small tuck in acquisitions up to a significant acquisition that would involve the issuance of both debt and equity if we believe it will increase the intrinsic value of the company on a per share basis our preliminary analysis is that we believe we could issue up to one million shares in a transaction without impacting our tax benefits from historical net operating losses we make no guarantees that we will be able to find a suitable acquisition our annual meeting is scheduled for

laurel rosenhall calmatters the second year of the coronavirus pandemic in california was shaped by two political undercurrents at the state capitol a budget awash with cash thanks to a booming stock market and federal aid and a looming recall election asking voters to throw gov gavin newsom out of office the massive budget surplus allowed newsom and legislative democrats to go big on a progressive agenda they believe will help the state recover from covid hardships they passed a 262 6 billion budget that includes preschool for all 4 year olds health insurance for low income undocumented immigrants age 50 and older and 600 stimulus payments for most californians landing in bank accounts just weeks before the sept 14 recall election newsom found himself with so many dollars to spend that he gave away 115 million to encourage californians to get the covid 19 vaccine with a series of game show style lotteries but gobs of money and democrats supermajority didn t make everything possible tensions between moderate and liberal democrats stymied many proposals the recall threat also may have doomed some legislation that might have reflected unfavorably upon california and its governor bills that stalled included proposals to create single payer health care ban corporate donations to political candidates legalize psychedelic drugs sanction clinics where addicts can use illegal drugs under medical supervision and allow people to turn their bodies into garden compost after death progressive legislation to allow more offenders to have their records expunged and overhaul the bail system also stalled amid concerns over california s rising murder rate and an especially brutal killing in sacramento with epic wildfires burning in a state stricken by drought lawmakers approved 1 billion for wildfire prevention but rejected a bill that called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions beyond current mandates which officials have said california is already not on pace to meet amid the relative calm of 2021 lawmakers managed to send the governor hundreds of bills finishing up his decisions on oct 9 he said in a statement what we re doing here in california is unprecedented in both nature and scale we will come back from this pandemic stronger than ever before here are some of the most interesting or consequential bills approved this year gender neutral toy sections what the bill does ab1084 would require large department stores that sell kids products to maintain a gender neutral section of toys and child care items stores that do not comply would face a light penalty a fine of up to 250 for first offenses and a fine of up to 500 for second offenses it s carried by democratic assemblymembers evan low of san jose and cristina garcia of bell gardens who supports it the phluid project which partners with brands to distribute gender free clothing and accessories argues that the bill will increase freedom of expression for children and parents it s also backed by equality california and the consumer federation of california which says that products marketed to girls often have higher price tags who s opposed socially conservative groups including the capitol resource institute and california family council say it s not the state s role to mandate how stores market their products retailers objected to an earlier version of the bill that included children s clothing a provision since removed from the bill why it matters this bill might not radically alter californians shopping experiences some large stores already organize their toys by type of product rather than by gender but it s a foot in the door for advocates who could push for bigger change in the future governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 9 a free press at protests what the bill does sb98 would prevent police from blocking journalists covering protests and demonstrations the bill by healdsburg democratic sen mike mcguire would ensure reporters can be in protest areas without being arrested and prohibits police from intentionally assaulting interfering with or obstructing their newsgathering who supports it the california news publishers association american civil liberties union and first amendment coalition say the legislation is necessary after recent high profile incidents in which reporters were arrested and in some cases assaulted with less lethal munitions while covering demonstrations who s opposed the california police chiefs association wants to be able to control where the media goes during events and worries that costly litigation may result if their officers violate the proposed statutes why it matters police have cracked down sometimes violently on protests and demonstrations in recent years including instances in which journalists covering events were arrested and injured such tactics limit the ability of news organizations to bear witness an important function in a democracy and to provide oversight of officers whose use of force and crowd control tactics have led to civilian injuries and lawsuits governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 9 cost free covid testing what the bill does sb510 would put a stop to surprise billing for covid 19 tests and vaccinations ensuring patients face no out of pocket fees from health plans and insurers during the public health emergency regardless of whether they receive their services through in or out of network providers the bill by sacramento democratic sen richard pan would also require insurers to fully cover covid 19 screening tests like those increasingly required on a regular basis by employers and schools who supports it the california medical association which sponsored the bill and the california academy of family physicians argue federal guidance on cost sharing is unclear and this bill is necessary for patients to quickly receive testing and treatment another key supporter the california teachers association who s opposed health insurance groups such as the california association of health plans and the association of california life and health insurance companies oppose the bill provision that makes it retroactive to when the covid state of emergency was declared march 4 2020 they also don t want the bill to cover future disease related states of emergency the state finance department warns that could cause unknown impact to the state s general fund why it matters the two federal laws regulating covid 19 testing and treatment exempt insurers from covering tests conducted for public health surveillance or employment purposes however even with vaccines widely available public health experts have insisted that routine surveillance testing is crucial to slowing and stopping the spread of disease due to the highly infectious nature of covid 19 and its variants and the high number of asymptomatic carriers governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 8 in a signing message he said the bill will ensure uniformity in testing payment and access rules throughout the state he also said he is directing the department of managed health care to issue guidance to address concerns about how the prevailing market rate is determined this would help prevent price gouging ethnic studies to graduate what the bill does this is the third attempt by democratic assemblymember jose medina of riverside to require ethnic studies for all california public school students and this time he succeeded ab101 makes ethnic studies a graduation requirement the law will go into effect by the 2024 25 school year beginning with the class of 2030 school districts could either develop their own lessons or use the model curriculum developed by the state board of education who supports it pro equity advocacy groups teachers unions and a handful of larger school districts that already have ethnic studies courses many education researchers say students especially those of color perform better in school if they see themselves in what they re being taught experts also say that requiring teachers to engage with historic oppression and varied student backgrounds could prompt them to rethink the way they teach other subjects like literature science and math who s opposed the editorial board at the los angeles times opposed the bill because it provides too much flexibility for local districts to design their own curricula that could deviate from the state s own model curriculum thousands from california s jewish community signed a petition opposing the bill because it would allow districts to use a previous draft of the model curriculum that has been criticized for containing anti semitic content some parents across the state continue to fight against ethnic studies erroneously conflating the course with critical race theory while other parents have called the curriculum divisive fearing it could ratchet up racial tensions why it matters gov gavin newsom vetoed this idea last year saying the state needed to modify a much criticized model curriculum developed by the california department of education jewish groups for instance condemned previous versions for an alleged bias towards palestine the state board assuaged some critics by approving a significantly revised curriculum in march if the curriculum attains its goal it would create a more inclusive california school system governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 8 in a signing message he said ethnic studies courses enable students to learn their own stories and those of their classmates and a number of studies have shown that these courses boost student achievement over the long run especially among students of color i appreciate that the legislation provides a number of guardrails to ensure that courses will be free from bias or bigotry and appropriate for all students the bill also expresses the legislature s intent that courses should not include portions of the initial draft curriculum that had been rejected by the instructional quality commission due to concerns related to bias bigotry and discrimination on oct 6 he also launched a governor s council on holocaust and genocide education teaching mental health what the bill does sb224 would mandate mental health instruction in middle schools and high schools that have an existing health education course supporters hope that such instruction would eventually be required in all schools statewide content would cover a range of topics including habits that promote mental wellness signs and symptoms of common mental health conditions and ways to seek help the bill is carried by democratic sens anthony portantino of la can ada flintridge and susan rubio of baldwin park who supports it a coalition of nearly 50 organizations that advocate for mental health children s rights disability rights and civil rights along with the california hospital association and the american academy of pediatrics support the bill they say it s crucial to reduce stigma and normalize conversations about mental health in schools since that s where children and adolescents spend the majority of their time who s opposed no current opposition to address concerns raised by teachers unions the bill s scope was reduced to include only schools with current health education programs as opposed to all schools in the state why it matters over the past decade rates of hospitalization for mental health emergencies have been skyrocketing among children and adolescents between 2012 and 2019 california emergency rooms reported a 42 increase in the number of children they were treating for mental illness the pandemic has further exacerbated the trend governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 8 in a statement on this and a series of bills to increase support for k 12 students he said we re implementing the historic transformative measures needed to help support our students health and wellbeing ending secret settlements what the bill does sb331 would ban employers from using secret settlements to prevent workers from speaking out about all kinds of illegal harassment or discrimination with some limited exceptions carried by democratic sen connie leyva of chino it builds on a law passed in 2018 which limited the use of non disclosure agreements to settle cases of sexual discrimination harassment or assault who supports it a bevy of legal groups labor groups and women s advocacy groups support the bill it is co sponsored by california employment lawyers association equal rights advocates and ifeoma ozoma a former public policy official at pinterest who broke her non disclosure agreement to speak out about discrimination she says she faced at the company they say secret settlements perpetuate workplace discrimmination and harassment because they prevent survivors from speaking out who s opposed initially objectors included a group of businesses and trade associations helmed by the california chamber of commerce arguing that the bill would effectively end the use of severance agreements businesses that choose to use severance agreements often do so in part to safeguard against potential reputational harm in response to several amendments such as one that allowed employers to keep the size of severance payments confidential the chamber and other groups withdrew their formal opposition why it matters non disclosure agreements are used widely among the world s most powerful tech companies many of which are based in california other industries use them too by allowing workers to come forward with their allegations this bill could prevent repeat offenders from harassing others it would also allow workers to discuss their experiences with family and friends even if they decide not to go public something many of these agreements prohibit the flip side businesses concerned about protecting themselves against reputational harm would have one less tool in their toolkit if this bill becomes law governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 7 removing condoms without consent what the bill does ab453 would make it illegal to remove a condom without consent during sexual intercourse this bill by democratic assemblymember cristina garcia of downey would make it so that stealthing nonconsensual condom removal be considered sexual battery under the state s civil code allowing victims to sue their sexual partners for damages who supports it erotic service providers legal educational research project a legal advocacy group that argues this piece of legislation is of particular importance for sex workers who s opposed none known why it matters a 2017 yale university study that found nonconsensual condom removal is becoming a common practice among young sexually active people victims have expressed fears of pregnancy and disease this measure if signed would make california the first state in the country to outlaw stealthing governor s call newsom signed the bill on oct 7 other legislation signed into law a menstrual equity bill requires california s public universities community colleges and secondary schools to provide free menstrual products on campus requires california s public universities community colleges and secondary schools to provide free menstrual products on campus greater access to police records sb16 expands the public s access to police records allowing them to view sustained findings in which an officer used unreasonable force failed to intervene when another officer used excessive force engaged in racist or biased behavior or conducted unlawful arrests and searches sb16 expands the public s access to police records allowing them to view sustained findings in which an officer used unreasonable force failed to intervene

cities more authority to reduce their speed limits making it illegal to harass people entering vaccination clinics allowing restaurants to continue selling to go cocktails using parking lots for

at pedestrian tv we independently choose and write about stuff we love and think you ll froth too we have affiliate partnerships so we might get a bit of money from any purchase you make based on our recs cool cool fyi prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting ever felt like you could never properly get up to speed with some breaking news story that s captivating the nation like you ve missed the boat it s too far out of the harbour and you ll just make a fool of yourself if you attempted to swim out to it well that s exactly how i feel about the basics of beer in what i m sure would be to the disappointment of my froth loving father i didn t immediately gravitate towards the brown nectar when i ticked over the 18 mark and while i ve grown more of an appreciation for it nowadays the gaps in my knowledge force me to avoid getting around for fear of looking like a damn fool in this age obsessed with craft brews and such read more 7 types of people you should be wary of inviting to a session working on the assumption that i m not alone in this tell me i m not alone pls here s the 411 on the basics of beer so we can all rest a li l knowing we won t be verbally dressed down by an excitable hipster next time we re at the bottle store basics of beer ingredients aight to kick off your basics of beer lesson you ve gotta know what the hell beer is and what s usually in it beer in layman terms is an alcoholic drank made from cereal grain that s been malted given a flavoursome kick with hops and fermented slowly most beers are composed of grain hops yeast and water grain grains are transformed into sugar during the mashing process to get it all malt y it s soaked in water then germinated it s then kilned which means dried cured it s then milled mashed and brewed for your pleasure hops hops help to give your frothy its flavour and scent they re a big help with balancing out a beer s sugary malt with bitterness if your beer has been dry hopped that means hops have been added after fermentation s wrapped up to replace oils that ve been lost during brewing yeast yep it s more than just an infection it s a fungus that transforms things into grog via carbonation the process of fermentation it has a huge role in the final stages of making a beer and impacts taste a great deal water if you need an explanation for this then may god have mercy on us all basics of beer styles as you know there s an overwhelming amount of beers out there what are they what does it all mean surprisingly each and every one of em can be placed in just two categories as determined by how yeast was incorporated ales and lagers ale for ales yeast collects and ferments at the top of whatever it s being made in under high temps so it goes from zero to one hundred really damn quick they re what gourmet inclined humans would deem rich typically having a more yeasty flavour than their lager cousins pale ale pale was tacked onto this beer s name to help folks distinguish it from the porter type more on that later as a rule of thumb they re copper y gold y colour with a crisp flavour from its hops you can try little creatures pale ale or james squire pale ale to get acquainted india pale ale ipa ipas tend to pack more of a punch in terms of alcohol percentage think of it as a pale ale that s been hitting the gym seven days a week start off with balter hazy ipa brown ale brown ales are y know brown they herald from north england and are known to have nutty strong malty flavours really treat your tastebuds with the 4 pines ben jerry s choc chip cookie nitro ale stout stouts are thicc af extremely dark in colour black looking and get their flavour from roasted barley generally you won t sense any hop like notes in stouts but you ll defs notice the malt and caramel flavours may as well start your taste test with the famous guinness porter porters are similar to stouts but they re made from unroasted barely they re sweeter than a lot of strains and sometimes even contain notes of chocolate backed up with a sharp bitterness give pirate life eyre peninsula coffee bean porter a red hot go wheat beer wheat beer the beer of the germans they re deadly serious about it too by law you have to make it with top fermenting yeast and at least 50 wheat malt the proteins from wheat give it is cloudy appearance especially as most aren t filtered the yeast strains can often create notes of vanilla clove and even banana blue moon belgian white is a good start hefeweisen hefeweisen americans can t get enough of it with it being the most successfully selling strain in the country it s usually served with lemon to counter the hectic yeast flavours make your first taste an authentic one with blue moon belgian white lager yeast in lagers sinks to the bottom of whatever it s been made in and processed in cooler conditions than ale to slow the process down significantly the cool temps yeast fermenting at the bottom makes less esters a fancy way of saying flavour compounds this process makes a clean crisp beer amber red lager of the lager fam amber red lagers are a hell of a lot darker and malty than the rest if you ve picked up a bottle and it just says lager on it then generally is an amber strain you can try it for yourself with jack abbey amber lager pilsner pilsner is arguably the world s most popular beer style born in czechoslovakia they usually have a medium body and more hops than most lagers producing a gold colour and crisp clean smooth flavours you absolutely have to start with the og pilsner urquell bock another german creation bock is made in autumn to be downed in the colder months expect heavy malt and a dark amber brown coloured brew balmain brewing actually makes its own bock but generally you ll find this style in the imported section dopplebock doppelbock aka double bock is exactly what its name suggests a heavier hitting bock it s darker and stronger than bocks has a higher grog content and is heavier with its maltiness it s also much harder to find in australia tbh there you have it folks putting the above to memory should serve you well and best of all it gives you an excuse to widen your repertoire education is paramount these days isn t it
john deere and the united auto workers union continue to negotiate a new contract ahead of a wednesday night strike deadline after 90 of union workers voted no moline ill a labor expert at rutgers university said the current labor shortage helps give john deere union workers a little bit of leverage in contract negotiations representatives with john deere and the united auto workers union returned to the negotiating table monday oct 11 after 90 of union members voted against a proposed contract a strike deadline has been set for wednesday oct 13 at 11 59 p m we have the most severe labor shortage in american history with more than 10 9 million unfilled job openings and many of those lie in the manufacturing sector said mark grywacheski a financial advisor currently the manufacturing sector has over 889 000 unfilled jobs which is 121 higher than the number of unfilled job openings in manufacturing and in february of 2020 todd vachon the director of the rutgers labor education action research network said this gives employees a little bit of leverage not only do they employers need to keep their businesses running and keep the employees they have happy but they don t even have enough employees to keep the businesses just barely going as they are vachon said i think that it s kind of caught on among a lot of people that hey this is the time to try and make changes that we ve been wanting to make for decades it s not just workers at john deere around 1 400 workers at kellogg co s u s cereal plants and 420 workers at heaven hill distillery are currently striking over the summer 600 workers at a frito lay plant in topeka kansas and 1 000 workers at five nabisco plants in the u s went on strike smithfield food narrowly avoided a strike in june by thousands of workers in sioux falls south dakota we re actually seeing a pretty record number of strikes and labor unrest right now in the u s vachon said it s definitely been awhile since we ve seen this amount of unrest while he s not saying workers have the upper hand right now per se the balance between employers and employees is starting to shift he said this is a historical juncture what we re seeing now is really kind of the tables have turned a little bit vachon said i mean not entirely workers aren t entirely empowered but they re certainly getting a taste of what it s like to have some power and some leverage and to be able to make demands for things that really you know most people have wanted out of their jobs for decades he added the fact that 90 of john deere union workers voted down the proposed contract shows that they are feeling emboldened right now deere and company is on track to set a record for annual profits this year vachon said like many other companies that extra value is going straight to the top collectively the power of working people to bargain for better wages has been declining he said so that s why you see so much more of the income going to the top the ceos are making astronomical wages or salaries and stock benefits and the working people are just getting by check to check they have not been sharing in the fruits of their own labor really as for the specifics of the proposed john deere contract one of the things vachon noted was how the contract divided workers up by age pensions would go up for current employees hired between october 1997 and nov 1 2021 but those hired after that would be ineligible for pensions according to vachon this is a common bargaining tactic he said historically workers have been divided up by race gender and sexuality but age is another way to do so when you re bargaining with your workers the strength that the workers have in bargaining is their solidarity to all speak together in one voice vachon said you can actually find ways to push buttons where you say well the younger workers have a different incentive than the older workers and you start to split up that unity within the workforce and you hope that that will undermine the bargaining power of the union now whether this time period will be a turning point in how companies hire and maintain workers vachon doesn t know if what he refers to as a period of unrest continues then employers might make changes however if it s just a small period of time he doesn t know if it will have any long term impact these companies are as i said kind of always concerned with the bottom line he said employers are making their decisions based on the profit margins and they re only going to give to the workers what they feel that they have to grywacheski said as the negotiations continue it will be important to watch how the deere and company stock is doing john deere has done a very good job kind of weathering the economic storm so to speak this global pandemic and that success has been reflected in a record high stock price this year grywacheski said i think wall street would be heavily focused on any further disruptions to the manufacturing output and deliverables that any potential strike could bring

the world is entering indeed much of it has already entered a massive energy crunch coal natural gas oil and gasoline prices have all spiked in countries around the globe if this winter is severe prices could well rise much further very soon fossil fuel companies their investors and other political opportunists will be talking about why this crisis proves how economically painful the decarbonization transition will be how much political blowback it will cause and why we should double down on fossil fuels but the correct takeaway is exactly the opposite many factors have contributed to the current energy crunch including the covid 19 pandemic and recent economic rebound in 2020 while much of the global economy was effectively powered down energy prices plummeted as did energy extraction then seemingly everyone around the world flipped the switch back on simultaneously higher demand for goods caused factory production to ramp up increasing demand for energy as well advertisement layer onto this the unusually cold winter in europe which drew down stocks of natural gas storms in the gulf of mexico and india that disrupted supplies of oil and coal respectively and a diplomatic row between china and australia that led beijing to cut off australian coal imports follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow additionally slower winds blowing across northern europe led to less wind powered energy output scientists aren t sure what s behind the stall out but calmer wind conditions may be driven by the warming of the earth s poles in other words wind farms intended to help combat climate change may have become less effective precisely because of climate change this global energy crisis is poised to have excruciating economic and political consequences heating homes and filling gas tanks will get more expensive and because households cannot easily reduce their consumption of heat or gasoline these higher prices effectively act as a tax on incomes a drag on consumers ability to spend on other goods or services other parts of the supply chain are being disrupted by power shortages too particularly as china rations electricity across factories advertisement higher energy prices could filter through to more broad based inflation which is already a serious worry worldwide especially in the united states this is all happening as major economies appear thisclose to making necessary but politically fraught changes to their energy policies the united states appears on the verge of a huge investment in climate through democrats budget legislation and at a climate conference in glasgow this month global leaders will hopefully make more aggressive commitments to reducing emissions but the near term economic pain and potential political instability caused by high energy prices could cause leaders to lose their nerve there are already worrisome signs that they have the white house recently committed to looking at every means we have to lower gas prices the european union energy commissioner has recommended that member countries cut energy taxes russia is taking advantage putting pressure on germany to accelerate regulatory approval of the nordstream 2 pipeline that would supply more natural gas to europe advertisement hard to quit a habit if you keep asking for one more fix while it s reasonable to try to shield constituents from short term price spikes particularly if those people might otherwise you know freeze to death that does not mean that global leaders must also abandon long term efforts to reduce carbon emissions after all transitory short term shocks cause suffering but not enough to durably change consumers purchasing habits or businesses investment decisions long run policy commitments do that rather than prolonging reliance on dirty energy governments could make investments that accelerate transitions to clean energy for instance if british energy utilities want a bailout the government could provide one with strings attached specifically conditions that would speed along the decarbonization transition argues new york university climate economist gernot wagner a similar phenomenon happened when france recently rescued a national airline he notes advertisement or policymakers could use this moment as an opportunity to incentivize investment in battery and storage innovations as democrats budget proposal does in the united states it s already cheaper to build and operate an entirely new wind or solar plant than it is to continue operating an existing coal plant but as the recent european wind stall out experience illustrates getting the wind to blow or the sun to shine at specific times is difficult better storage technology is critical

iowa democrats are asking for an ethics investigation into republican u s rep mariannette miller meeks alleging she failed to comply with the rules governing financial disclosures by members of congress the complaint filed monday with the office of congressional ethics says miller meeks failed to disclose several sources of income in her 2020 annual financial report as a member of congress the disclosures are required by law iowans expect transparency and honesty as a bare minimum from their elected representatives iowa democratic party chair ross wilburn said in a statement mariannette miller meeks refusal to comply with basic transparency measures intended to root out corruption and ensure good government which are required of every member of congress is yet another reminder that she cannot be trusted by southeastern iowans eric woolson a spokesperson for miller meeks campaign said wilburn is focused on partisan attacks instead of issues that are hurting working americans the congresswoman s office is working with the house ethics committee and house clerk s office on several substantive questions to resolve the discrepancies of her most recent personal financial report woolson said in a statement this will ensure that her upcoming amended report covers all the necessary bases we anticipate that the amended report will be filed as soon as her staff receives the answers to those questions what the complaint alleges and how miller meeks is responding the democrats complaint alleges miller meeks wrongly reported her earned income in her disclosures miller meeks failed to disclose 34 646 in income from a state pension and great river health systems on her latest disclosure despite including that income on a previous disclosure form while a candidate for congress miller meeks failed to disclose her 25 000 annual salary as a state senator on her candidate reports and congressional disclosure report she also would have received per diem expenses in that role where she served from january 2019 until being sworn into congress in january 2021 miller meeks 2020 congressional disclosure report states that her only income in 2020 was her congressional salary but she did not begin receiving that salary until she was sworn into office in 2021 the complaint says miller meeks disclosed a deferred compensation payout from great river health systems where she used to work on the wrong section of her disclosure the law and guidance are clear that only fees generated by individuals with an ownership interest in their employer should be included on schedule j the complaint states if rep miller meeks has an ownership interest in great river health systems she must disclose that interest immediately the complaint says miller meeks report as a member of congress failed to disclose three assets that were included in her 2020 report as a congressional candidate if she still owned those assets at the end of 2020 they should have been disclosed the complaint states and miller meeks did not disclose the specific stocks or mutual funds held in her retirement accounts according to the complaint without identifying the actual assets held in these accounts the public has no knowledge of her actual holdings and no ability to assess any potential conflicts of interest the complaint states kollin crompton a spokesperson for the republican party of iowa said miller meeks is working to amend her report what happened with cindy axne s disclosure lapses crompton criticized democratic u s rep cindy axne for her own disclosure lapses last month the campaign legal center a nonpartisan watchdog group accused axne of failing to file periodic transaction reports related to stock trades the group is asking the office of congressional ethics to investigate axne the group found axne appears to have made more than 40 total stock transactions in 2019 and 2020 that weren t disclosed within the required 45 days with a total value of between about 43 000 and 645 000 axne filed a set of updated periodic transaction reports on friday her spokesperson ian mariani said friday that axne became aware of clerical issues related to her transactions two weeks ago and has taken steps to ensure these issues don t happen again as soon as she learned of these issues she took steps to properly address them including hiring an outside counsel to audit her reports and confirming with the third party money manager who oversees the related retirement accounts that she did not personally direct or execute any of these trades he said in a statement friday read the complaint against miller meeks stephen gruber miller covers the iowa statehouse and politics for the register he can be reached by email at sgrubermil registermedia com or by phone at 515 284 8169 follow him on twitter at sgrubermiller

by simon black when i was about five years old in the early 1980s my dad brought home our first computer i ll never forget it it was an clunky ibm with a tiny orange monochromatic monitor and dual floppy disks it had 640 kilobytes of ram and no hard disk i loved it with that computer i learned how to program how to navigate a command line interface how to design algorithms and how to solve constant problems because it was ridiculously buggy and would break down all the time it was also painfully slow the boot up process could easily take an hour from the time i flipped on the power switch to the time i saw the dos prompt sometimes i think that computer is a great metaphor for the global economy turning it off is nothing you flip the switch and the power goes off but starting it back up again takes a long time and the process isn t so smooth sometimes it crashes during bootup last march when the great plague was upon us nearly every industry in nearly every country in the world practically shut down and many businesses went bust never to return eighteen months later businesses have largely reopened but like my old computer the reboot process has been riddled with critical errors and system failures for example right now there are countless businesses in industries from retail to manufacturing that are experiencing severe labor shortages supply chains around the world are breaking down resulting in product shortages and major transportation bottlenecks the end result of this dumpster fire is that prices are soaring and i wanted to spend some time today connecting the dots to help explain some of these important trends let s go back to last march again when everything shut down you probably recall that dozens of large companies declared bankruptcy like nieman marcus gnc jc penny etc but there were other companies that went bust which most people have probably never heard of they were in more mundane less sexy industries like corrugated paper and wood pulp yet while their demise was hardly noticed it turns out they would have a significant impact on the global economy global shipping demand surged last year in ways that had never been seen before suddenly instead of efficient supply chains shipping goods to large marketplaces like retail and grocery stores consumers wanted everything delivered to them while the total volume of shipping was largely the same or even less than previous years the number of individual shipments increased dramatically in other words instead of a single large shipment to a store or supermarket companies were making thousands of tiny shipments to individual consumers this meant more trips and more packaging more cardboard boxes more plastic wrap more plastic containers more styrofoam and the prices for all of these materials has spiked the price for polyethylene for example which is used extensively in shipping has increased from 820 per ton to 1 850 per ton polypropylene prices are also up from 1 100 per ton to 1 770 per ton it s a similar trend with cardboard and corrugated paper and these price increases aren t simply due to high demand either supply has fallen last march when a number of wood pulp producers went out of business no one noticed and no one cared but it turned out that more than 10 of all north american paper capacity vanished practically overnight just before demand started to surge and this capacity cannot be simply turned on again with a flip of a switch it takes a lot of effort to resurrect a bankrupt factory to re hire and re train workers we ll get to the worker issue in a moment it s a similar trend around the world foreign factories have closed and those that remain open are struggling to retain workers and operate under strict covid protocols manufacturing efficiency is way down as a result so they re not producing enough supply to keep up with demand then there are the actual shipping problems the crazy delays especially on the west coast of the united states that prevent container ships from delivering their cargo it s not that there aren t enough ships in the world in fact the total global capacity in terms of teus or 20 foot equivalent units is slightly higher than pre pandemic but a range of factors including covid rules and union regulations means there s a shortage of maritime crew to operate the vessels there s also a shortage of dockworkers truck drivers forklift operators etc at the ports this is especially true in california whose regulatory environment makes port operations extremely difficult and inefficient yet sadly for the united states california s ports are the busiest and most important in the country most of the seafreight from china is offloaded at the port of long beach or port of los angeles so bottlenecks there cause a major ripple effect across the country right now there is a backlog of literally hundreds of thousands of ships waiting to unload their cargo in southern california we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this makes the covid policies of california especially important for the rest of the united states whatever gavin newsome decides has a huge impact on the national economy labor is obviously another major issue in this messy economic reboot thanks to a steady digest of mass media covid hysteria there are still plenty of people who are terrified to leave their homes and go to work moreover there are so many people who got used to being home over the past 18 months that now they only want a job where they can work from home this is a major problem for businesses and why it s so hard for restaurant companies fast food joints retail shops factories etc to find workers people would rather stay home the government hasn t exactly been helpful in this department when they were paying outsized unemployment benefits to encourage everyone to stay home that effect is lingering there s another trend at work here though for the last several years politicians have been fighting hard to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states it turns out that no one really wanted those jobs to begin with younger people in particular don t have as much interest in those sorts of traditional jobs they d rather be influencers and make their money posting butt selfies and snapshots of their contrived lifestyle this was already becoming an issue prior to covid large companies especially those in industries that were considered unappealing to gen z were complaining how difficult it was to hire train and retain young workers now it s borderline impossible businesses also have to compete with the government for labor which has gobbled up workers and put them to work as contact tracers and retail companies that are lucky enough to find employees are forced to misallocate those scarce resources to do unproductive tasks like checking everyone s papers when customers walk through the door and then of course if a business has been able to navigate all of those crazy obstacles hunter biden s dad is now forcing you to fire any worker who hasn t been on top of all of the above is the federal reserve s monetary blowout they ve printed trillions of dollars over the past 18 months to support the economy yet even though the unemployment rate is down to 4 8 they re still printing at least 120 billion per month in new money all that new money has helped fuel giant asset bubbles in stocks bonds property and commodities energy prices in particular have risen sharply and this tends to cause all other prices to rise the result of all of this insanity is inflation lots of it the problem is that most of these trends are not going away anytime soon the fed may start to taper its money printing but they have very little room to raise interest rates meaningfully to combat inflation plus the labor issues government policy shipping manufacturing shortages etc are going to last for a while in fact you d think the correct government policy right now would be to create incentives for people to work to create new businesses and to invest in new technology that could automate and clean up the bottlenecks at a minimum you d think they d stay the hell away and let capitalism do its job after all free market competition is one of the greatest tools to fix any economic woes especially inefficiencies and resource misallocation yet all of the policies they re proposing are anti competitive and anti market they want to create disincentives to form businesses and make investments it s the exact opposite of what they should be doing this is what happens when you put a socialist in charge of writing the budget so the next time one of these politicians or central bankers say that inflation is transitory you can be certain they re completely clueless about what s happening in the real world
by lance roberts the fact we have the lowest interest rates in 5000 years is indicative of the economic challenges we face such was a note brought to my attention by my colleague jeffrey marcus of tpa analytics bofa wants you to know that interest rates haven t been this low in 5 000 years that s right 5000 years in the next 5 000 years rates will rise but no fear on wall street this happens anytime soon said david jones director of global investment strategy at bank of america this should not come as a shock to anyone who has been watching given that the fed s balance sheet is now an astonishing 8 5 trillion and that fiscal spending has caused the u s debt to balloon to over 28 trillion for reference the u s gdp is 22 trillion all of this really means that the fed and the u s are in a tough spot they need a lot of growth to dig out from mountains of debt but they cannot afford for rates to move too high or debt service will become an issue yes rates will probably rise at some point in the next 5000 years however currently the primary argument is that rates must increase because they are so low that argument fails in understanding that low rates are emblematic of weak economic growth rates deflationary pressures and demographic trends short term rate rise can t last in recent weeks interest rates rose sharply over concerns of a debt ceiling default and inflationary fears but asmish shedlock noted five factors are spooking the bond market debt ceiling battle short term low impact supply chain disruptions medium term medium impact trade deficit long term low to medium impact biden s build back better spending plans long term high impact wage spiral long term high impact i said early on that if progressives get their way on spending plans especially their demands to have 80 clean energy by 2030 it would set off a bout of stagflation the rise in bond yields and a slowing economy are now linked mish shedlock he is correct the problem however between today and the 1970s is the massive debt and leverage levels in the u s economy thus any significant rise in rates almost immediately leads to recessionary spats in the economy a long history of rates economic growth the chart below shows a very long view of interest rates in the u s equivalent rates to the federal funds rate and 10 year treasury since 1854 interest rates are a function of the general trend of economic growth and inflation more robust rates of growth and inflation allow for higher borrowing costs to be charged within the economy such is why bonds can t be overvalued to wit unlike stocks bonds have a finite value at maturity the principal gets returned to the lender along with the final interest payment therefore bond buyers are very aware of the price they pay today for the return they will get tomorrow as opposed to an equity buyer taking on investment risk a bond buyer is loaning money to another entity for a specific period therefore the interest rate takes into account several substantial risks default risk rate risk inflation risk opportunity risk economic growth risk since the future return of any bond on the date of purchase is calculable to the 1 100th of a cent a bond buyer will not pay a price that yields a negative return in the future this assumes a holding period until maturity one might purchase a negative yield on a trading basis if expectations are benchmark rates will decline further what caused rates to rise previously interest rates rose during three previous periods in history during the economic inflationary spike in the early 1860s and again during the golden age from 1900 1929 the most recent period was during the prolonged manufacturing cycle in the 1950s and 60s that cycle followed the end of wwii where the u s was the global manufacturing epicenter however notice that while interest rates fell during the depression era economic growth and inflationary pressures remained robust such was due to the very lopsided nature of the economy at that time much like the current economic cycle the wealthy prospered while the middle class suffered therefore money did not flow through the system leading to a decline in monetary velocity currently the economy once again is bifurcated the upper 10 of the economy is doing well while the lower 90 remain affected by high joblessness stagnant wage growth and low demand for credit moreover for only the second time in history short term rates are at zero and monetary velocity is non existent the difference is that during the great depression economic growth and inflationary pressures were at some of the highest levels in history today the economy struggles at a 2 growth rate with inflationary pressures detracting from consumptive spending low rates can last a long time interest rates are ultimately a reflection of economic growth inflation and monetary velocity therefore given the globe is awash in deflation caused by weak economic output and exceedingly low levels of monetary velocity there is no pressure to push rates sustainably higher the dashed black line is the median interest rate during the entire period we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us note notice that a period of sustained low interest rates below the long term median averaged roughly 40 years during both previous periods we are only currently 10 years into the current secular period of sub median interest rates the following chart overlays the 10 year average economic growth rate as you will notice and as discussed above rates rise in conjunction with more substantial levels of economic growth such is because more substantial growth leads to higher wages and inflation causing rates to rise accordingly today the u s is no longer the manufacturing epicenter of the world labor and capital flow to the lowest cost providers to effectively export inflation from the u s and deflation gets imported technology and productivity gains ultimately suppress labor and wage growth rates over time the chart below shows this dynamic change which began in 1980 a surge in debt was the offset between lower economic growth rates and incomes to maintain the american lifestyle a demographic challenge the chart below shows both the long view of real inflation adjusted annual gdp growth and on a per capita basis i have also included the annual growth rates of the u s population there are some interesting differences between the great depression and the great recession during the depression the economy grew at 13 and 18 on an annualized basis today the current economic cycle of 2 5 and 2 7 what plagued the economic system during the depression was the actual loss of wealth following the crash of 1929 as a rash of banks went bankrupt leaving depositors penniless unemployment soaring and consumption drained while the government tried to assist it was too little too late the real depression however was not a statistical economic event but rather an absolute disaster for main street during the current period real economic growth remains lackluster in addition real unemployment remains high with millions of individuals simply no longer counted or resorting to part time work to make ends meet finally with more than 100 million americans on some form of government assistance the pressure on main street remains one crucial difference is the rate of population growth which as opposed to the depression era has been on a steady and consistent decline since the 1950s this decline in population growth and fertility rates will potentially lead to further economic complications as the baby boomer generation migrates into retirement and becomes a net drag on financial infrastructure today despite trillions of dollars of interventions zero interest rates and numerous bailouts the economy has yet to gain any real traction particularly on main street the end of the bond bubble the problem with most forecasts for the end of the bond bubble is the assumption that we are only talking about the isolated case of a shifting of asset classes between stocks and bonds however the issue of rising borrowing costs spreads through the entire financial ecosystem like a virus the rise and fall of stock prices have very little to do with the average american s participation in the domestic economy interest rates however are an entirely different matter while there is not much downside left for interest rates to fall in the current environment there is not a tremendous amount of room for increases moreover since interest rates affect payments increases in rates quickly negatively impact consumption housing and investment will the bond bull market eventually come to an end yes eventually however the catalysts needed to create the economic growth required to drive interest rates substantially higher as we saw previous to 1980 are not available today such will be the case for decades to come the fed has yet to conclude we are caught in a liquidity trap along with the bulk of developed countries over the following 5000 years rates will eventually rise but for now i am long bonds and continue to buy more whenever someone claims the great bond bull market is dead

the new raptor factory is now rising out of the ground at spacex s rocket development and test facility in mcgregor texas tasked with supplying raptor 2 engines to the starship program spacex is laying the foundations for its rapidly reusable rocket with the launch tower in the process of gaining its mechazilla stacking and catching arms a key part of recovering super heavy and starships along with their engines numerous future vehicles are being staged at the production site ahead of a busy 2022 the immediate focus is on ship 20 with its static fire test currently scheduled for this week ship 20 and booster 4 following a successful proof testing campaign for ship 20 the next milestone will be loading lox liquid oxygen and ch4 liquid methane for a static fire test the fine details of ship 20 s testing have not been revealed with this vehicle being the first to sport three raptor vacuum rvac engines to date rvacs have only been fired up individually at mcgregor the upcoming test currently set for no earlier than net wednesday and still subject to change will likely involve the three sea level raptors ship 20 s full engine set involves rc69 rc73 and rc78 with rc standing for raptor center rv4 rv5 and rv6 are the rvacs assigned to ship 20 rvac installation was taking place on monday rvac being installed under ship 20 nasaspaceflight pic twitter com dbvwugo0pi nic ansuini nicansuini october 11 2021 during the initial static fire test one key test objective will focus on the thermal protection system tps which suffered a minor liberation caused by the header tank venting the vibrations of the engine s firing will provide additional data points on how well the tps has been applied and secured to the vehicle booster 4 is waiting in line for its own proof testing and static fires although this is not likely to occur until november with its 29 engines booster 4 s static fire campaign will likely involve several ignitions with an increasing number of engines the super heavy was removed from its orbital launch site ols mount to allow for the installation of mechazilla hardware to the launch tower mechazilla progress towards giving the launch tower its arms has been made over recent days with the carriage system moved over to a new staging point at the orbital launch site ols this set the scene for the lift and move of the first chopstick arm for installation onto the carriage the second arm was also moved over on monday once both arms are secured to the carriage the entire system will be hoisted onto the tower this event will set the stage for its first operation likely to involve booster 4 being lifted onto the mount should the system require additional work the lr 11350 crane nicknamed frankencrane by spacex employees could still be used while booster 4 and ship 20 s return points will be into the ocean elon musk hopes for the first catch to occur during booster 5 s return to the launch site future vehicles booster 5 is already being stacked inside the high bay following the usual starbase path of having the next vehicle ready to head to the launch site soon after the previous has launched its grid fins have already arrived and are being prepared for installation this process took place after the booster completed stacking operations during booster 4 s high bay processing flow ship 21 is making good progress around the production area with sections being prepared for stacking a process that will take place inside the since vacated mid bay the rollout of gse 8 to the tank farm has created room for ship 21 s stacking to occur with numerous sections sporting a full coat of tps the nosecone for ship 21 is already following that same path with tiles being applied inside one of the big tents sections for ship 22 have also been observed with the common dome section spotted inside tent 1 meanwhile the thrust pucks for boosters down the pecking order have also been arriving into starbase including the first to host the expanded capability of 33 raptors they are like works of art i would not be opposed to having that on my wall pic twitter com jrs7fzriey chris bergin nsf nasaspaceflight october 6 2021 mcgregor factory all these raptor engines arrive at starbase after having been processed at spacex s mcgregor test site currently the engines are assembled at spacex hq in hawthorne california before taking a road trip to texas for hot fire testing on one of five available test stands elon musk had already noted that raptor production would increase aided by a new factory at the mcgregor facility allowing hawthorne to focus on rvacs and new design evolutions for the methalox powerhouse this allows mcgregor to produce the main stock of raptor 2 engines to cater for a large number of boosters and starships each requiring 36 raptor 2s in total based on the 33 on the booster and three on the starship along with three rvacs with groundwork observed by gary blair over recent weeks via his plane passes for nsf l2 the latest pass noted the framework of the factory is now being assembled while this factory will still be some time away from assembling raptor 2s hawthorne is already building the streamlined version of the raptor with the mcgregor test stands being worked on in preparation for test firings centralizing raptor production and testing at mcgregor will also streamline the flow of raptors to starbase removing the california to texas leg for all engines except for the rvacs also this production increase provided a fascinating scenario of how many raptors spacex will require in circulation given the full reusability of the starship system a large stock of raptors points to a huge fleet of vehicles as musk has always envisioned photos and videos provided by nic ansuini

by john klar vermont s rino governor has been hailed as having saved the state from the scourge of covid by leading the nation in high vaccination rates but now the boondoggle of bunk covid science is home to roost in the green mountains the state has the highest rate of infection nationally the layers of covid fog are starting to clear as reality eclipses the fantastic lies of the government and medical establishment initially americans were told that natural immunity from covid 19 was unlikely for those already infected now it turns out it is the vaccines that wane 76 of vermont covid 19 fatalities from breakthrough infections are among the first vaccinated it appears the shots don t last ntibody levels generated by two shots of the pfizer biontech vaccine can undergo up to a 10 fold decrease seven months following the second vaccination research suggests but meanwhile he immune systems of the vast majority of people who have been infected with the ccp virus will continue to carry antibodies against the virus for at least 12 months according to a peer reviewed study accepted by the european journal of immunology on sept 24 dr joseph mercola and ronnie cummins published a remarkable book warning americans about various covid lies titled the truth about covid 19 many months before the current epidemic of the vaccinated this book explained that the touted effectiveness of these vaccines was a sham vaccine effectiveness vastly overstated in early november 2020 pfizer sent the stock market soaring when it announced that analysis of clinical trial data showed the efficacy of its vaccine was more than 90 percent soon after an efficacy rate of 95 was announced moderna boasted similar success with a 94 5 percent efficacy rating in its clinical trials however the definition of efficacy is not being discussed p 129 the authors then explain that while pfizer claims its vaccine has a 95 percent efficacy rate this is the relative risk reduction the absolute risk reduction is actually less than 1 percent urrent trials are not designed to tell us whether the vaccines will actually save lives and if they don t are they really worth the risks that might be involved nor do the trials tell us anything about the vaccine s ability to prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission pp 130 131 the breakout cases in vermont and around the world appear to prove this book s claims yet americans were told by dr fauci that 99 of those dying from covid 19 and 97 of hospitalizations were of the unvaccinated if that were ever true it is clearly not the case now the unvaccinated are being discriminated against for a disease spread easily by the vaccinated who walk around with less than 1 protection while falsely believing they are 95 protected writes one histrionic bunk science post covid 19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe disease hospitalization and death from covid 19 and also reduce the likelihood of mild or asymptomatic infection as a result of lagging vaccinations and the more infectious delta variant covid 19 cases hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise again instead of seeking corrective science those worshipping vaccines seek to silence those sharing the truth elizabeth warren and adam schiff have publicly pressured amazon to reduce sales of the truth about covid 19 in vermont a rabid attack by a supposed media outlet named seven days against the publisher of the book chelsea green publishing has been especially vicious as if discrediting publisher margo baldwin for personality issues alleged by a disgruntled former employee negate this important book s clear warnings seven days seeks to silence scientific discourse and perpetuate the vaccination of vermonters with ineffective vaccines the cdc continues to report to americans that the vaccines are hunky dory based on evidence from clinical trials in people 16 years and older the pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccine was 95 effective at preventing laboratory confirmed infection with the virus that causes covid 19 in people who received two doses and had no evidence of being previously infected all fda approved or authorized covid 19 vaccines provide substantial protection against covid 19 hospitalization vermont s current explosion in covid infections despite being the most vaccinated population in america reveals scientifically that bunk science has been used to lie to citizens the associated press reported nearly all covid deaths in the u s now are in people who weren t vaccinated a staggering demonstration of how effective the shots have been and an indication that deaths per day now down to under 300 could be practically zero if everyone eligible got the vaccine vermont s current experience proves this narrative is grotesquely false scientific truth is prevailing against lies and unscientific chicanery the great threat to america is not the covid 19 virus but those manipulating facts to control others john klar

taxpayers money but seemingly solve few problems that aside living in rural southern quebec means living in one of the best places in the world people care about their neighbours guns are used to kill deer and moose which are eaten during the winter violent crime is relatively low poverty exists but nowhere near the desperation levels of other areas terrorist activity is near non existent and while the weather is often extremely hot or extremely cold there are few typhoons tornados or earthquakes while i m both grateful and thankful and full of turkey i am not complacent i am fully aware that this tranquil area and the rest of the country will be collateral damage should the geopolitical and economic machinations of united states china or any other wannabee superpower get out of hand my personal rationale for being a champion of planning is to feel that i can survive a world of upset without too much trauma my rationale for being a critic is that things can always be better all this to say that it s important to be aware of the ebb and flow of international economics and politics take china china is the world s fastest growing major economy the u s is a major importer of chinese goods yet the u s is trying hard to knee cap china s ability to become integrated into the world s telecommunications networks by maintaining tariffs against it china has major internal problems one of which is the impending collapse of its real estate sector a bigger problem is that many chinese are losing confidence in their ability to become middle class the communist party of china s attack on its own billionaires and tech entrepreneurs serves a couple of purposes it calms the masses when the wealthy are brought down and it confounds the rest of the world many us companies are at high valuations because investors think they will keep growing in markets like china any lasting drop in chinese construction energy production or technology will affect businesses worldwide and slow global growth china s sheer size means its problems affect everyone take climate change it s at the top of everyone s priority list president joe biden banned new oil and gas drilling on american public lands and offshore waters as soon as he could less drilling means less oil and less oil with the same level of demand can only push the price in one direction up it s not all biden s doing in 2020 global oil and gas upstream investments had dropped 57 from their 2014 peak the price of oil has moved from 48 to 80 per barrel this year meanwhile 80 of the world s energy supply still comes from oil gas and coal that number has barely budged in over a decade according to the international energy agency it s going to take another decade before our gas guzzling ways impact the demand for oil ask alberta about being collateral damage and what steps it has taken to diversify its economy take saving and investing stocks are volatile with dire warnings of market crashes especially in october bonds pay about 1 per cent in a world where inflation is more than 3 per cent this doesn t mean you should not invest in either market in fact you must put your money somewhere where it has a chance of earning money otherwise you are doomed to get poorer since 1960 the canadian and american stock markets have an average growth rate of more than 9 per cent a year including all the ups and downs inflation over that period has averaged 3 per cent residential real estate has grown an average of 6 per cent over the past 50 years however the last decade has seen growth of more than 12 per cent a year it will be a plausible investment alternative when growth reverts to its long term average if you re looking for investible real estate the segment of the market known as reits is where to look the point is that not knowing how to invest or where to put your savings makes you even more vulnerable to the whims of strangers and you can t start investing until you have an emergency fund that represents six months worth of what you spend that s not for investing it s for emergencies it s cash in the bank next you must pay off your high interest rate debts if you have credit card debt you have to ask yourself where can i make a guaranteed return of 20 the answer is by paying it off if you know of another investment that makes a certain 20 please write now you re ready to invest under your mattress or in the bank is not investing it s dooming you to losing net assets each year no wonder so many canadians worry about their retirement steve martin once said before you criticize

closed above us 80 bbl our futures are down 0 4 this morning earnings nerves wall street was encouraged that a bottom had been put in last week following the september swoon and october blues but friday s jobs report stopped it in its tracks the report needed more analysis digging down there are three reasons that stand out as to why americans are not rushing back to work as expected 1 given the variation across states of back to school policies many women remain stuck at home to look after the kids 2 covid has driven increased growth in the number of older workers choosing to retire and 3 new migrants are not entering the workforce in typical numbers because there aren t any at least two of those issues could be seen as transitory but labour force issues are only half the problem wall street tried to kick on from the open last night but slowly sentiment faded before selling picked up towards the close the us september quarter result season kicks off on wednesday night starting with the big banks and picks up pace quickly into the peak that is the third week financials aside it is expected that virtually no company will not have been impacted in the quarter by supply side delays and soaring freight costs earlier out of cycle earnings results have driven this home analysts have been madly bringing down their earnings forecasts as a result but is the market still underestimating the impact it s a question that can only be answered when the numbers start to drop and that has wall street nervous playing into the same theme will be wednesday night s september cpi numbers and thursday s ppi followed by retail sales on friday night one aside is that retail analysts suggest there may be no discounting going on this year in the usual thanksgiving spree given pressure on margins meeting pent up demand and warnings continue that if you haven t ordered your christmas presents by now you may not get them in time us earnings seasons are lengthy but the bulk of the s p500 reports this month while october is historically the most volatile month if there isn t a crash on the 29th then typically the back half is when the seasonally positive run into the end of the year begins but typically earnings seasons bring about more beats than misses it may still prove to be the case this year but wall street is not confident enough to back that hope at this stage

in a recent update laureola director of investor relations john swallow said the low and even negative interest rate environment brought about by a combination of the residual effects of the global financial crisis and the current covid 19 pandemic has resulted in smsfs seeking alternative investment opportunities to maintain their target returns need help signing up visit the help centre you need javascript for captcha verification to submit this form by becoming a member i agree to receive information and promotional messages from smsf adviser i can opt out of these communications at any time for more information please visit our privacy statement you need javascript for captcha verification to submit this form keep me signed in on this device to continue reading the rest of this article please log in historically smsfs gravitate towards either cash and term deposits or listed australian shares and ignore other asset classes according to mr swallow in our view the australian share market might be close to full valuation and continues to be susceptible to pandemic and geopolitical risks most smsf portfolios might be seeking alternatives to equities risk he said with interest rates close to zero cash and term deposits might be limited in compensating for potential losses in listed australian shares mr swallow noted that uncorrelated investments could be crucial for smsfs looking to spread the investment as it can improve their portfolio returns by investing part of their portfolios in assets that are uncorrelated with the rest of the portfolio an uncorrelated asset is one that responds differently to market forces compared to the rest of the portfolio for an smsf an uncorrelated asset would generate returns in its own way and does not react to the market forces impacting on say australian equities traditionally this role has been played by instruments such as bonds he noted however bonds have been shown to be more correlated with equities over short periods especially where interest rates are at record lows moreover investors in longer dated bonds might also be subject to capital losses should interest rates rise life settlements are non correlated to markets one candidate for the uncorrelated asset might be life settlements as the life settlement asset is structurally non correlated to the share market the bond market or property price movements according to mr swallow a well managed exposure to life settlements can provide potential returns comparable to that of equities over longer time periods but with less volatility and with no correlation to equities or other investible assets he explained to obtain exposure smsfs can consider investing in life settlement funds which invest in resold life insurance policies in the united states mr swallow noted the asset class has been gaining attention worldwide as investors seek uncorrelated returns in a low interest rate environment the result is an investment that has no correlation with or dependence upon the usual crisis triggers declines in share prices interest rate hikes economic instability or geopolitical surprises
on september 10 house majority leader steny hoyer d md shared with house democrats leaders plan to keep the federal government funded past the end of the current fiscal year on september 30 2021 the house will return the week of september 20 to pass a short term continuing resolution cr to hold current funding levels in place through december senate democrats will meet on september 14 where they will likely plan to consider the house passed cr in short order however the plan could derail if democrats fail to secure enough support for a funding extension each year congress must pass twelve separate appropriations laws to fund normal operations in federal government by the start of the new fiscal year on october 1 if they fail to pass those laws a partial or full government shutdown can happen under a shutdown only emergency services continue while day to day activities like federal law enforcement investigations security inspections at airports tax claim processing national park operations and other daily federal operations all stop while a cr is less disruptive than a full shutdown a cr simply extends current federal funding levels for a few months meaning agencies must wait longer to get anticipated funding changes as well as delay new starts on projects and contracts for more than a decade congress has consistently failed to meet this october 1 funding deadline sustaining federal operations with crs this year is no different congress has not yet passed any of the 12 annual federal funding bills into law with congress distracted this year with coronavirus relief and now a massive infrastructure package leader hoyer announced that congress democratic leadership will again avoid a shutdown by passing a cr that will move the october 1 shutdown deadline until around mid december potentially december 10 the white house anticipated a cr and this week sent congress a list of anomalies requesting that congress add extra spending to what is meant to be a simple extension of current funding levels priorities on this list include a requested 6 4 billion to resettle around 65 000 afghans expected to arrive in the u s in september plus another 30 000 arriving after october 1 another priority for the cr 14 billion for disaster relief plus around 10 billion for response to hurricane ida another point to watch democrats will likely attach a debt ceiling suspension to the must pass cr the debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt the federal government can accrue while many may think of the federal debt as a remote financial concept it also sustains the federal government s ability to pay daily obligations like social security payments veterans benefits federal employees and active duty servicemembers pay payments on federal contracts and more congress last suspended the debt ceiling in 2019 but the limit came back into effect in august at about 28 4 trillion after congress failed to pass another suspension secretary of the treasury janet yellen has warned repeatedly that congress should pass another suspension as soon as possible to avoid the u s default which would cause irreparable damage to the u s economy and global financial markets because the economic consequences of the fiscal cliff in a shutdown and debt default are so dire congress and the stock market have been relatively sanguine in assuming that congressional leaders will deal with it in time as they always have however congress must negotiate a growing partisan divide to avoid the cliff in the senate for example democrats must convince at least ten republicans to vote with them on a package to pass the cr and raise the debt ceiling but minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky and 46 of the 50 republicans in the senate have already signed a letter opposing a debt limit increase republicans and some moderate democrats will demand federal spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling which will clash with democratic leaders plans to inject trillions into the national economy through president biden s build back better plan time will tell how the current fiscal cliff may resolve but observers should not underestimate the potential consequences in 2011 a similar standoff over the debt ceiling triggered the biggest stock market crisis since the 2008 crash and led congress to eventually pass the budget control act which ordered escalating spending cuts or sequestration that many economists blamed for slowing the economy to stay informed on the fiscal cliff please stay tuned to michael best strategies alerts and reach out to your michael best strategies team the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances
at the time forbes estimated that trump was worth 3 1 billion in other words despite all of the speculation to the contrary he had apparently outperformed the market index by about 1 billion as of 2018 that accomplishment didn t get anywhere near as much coverage as the previous suggestions that trump had underperformed the market advertisement trump continued to stay comfortably ahead of the s p 500 until last year when covid turned the world upside down the stock market tanked and trump personally lost an estimated 1 billion in a matter of weeks after the initial shock the overall market began to recover but trump s fortune languished with his hotels storefronts and office buildings hollowed out the s p 500 started to catch up to trump eventually in early 2021 the market overtook the mogul for good by september when forbes locked in its estimates for its annual list america s richest people trump s net worth stood at an estimated 2 5 billion which for the first time in 25 years left him short of the cutoff for the forbes 400 if trump had instead lived a simple life and invested in the s p 500 for decades he would have been worth an estimated 3 billion enough to rank no 377 instead he had decided to go his own way providing him with years as a high stakes businessman decades as a famous name and one term as the president of the united states but eventually costing him hundreds of millions

ellijay ga looking at record setting festivals like 2016 a single weekend reaching about 26 000 people visiting the apple festival according to the gilmer chamber may not seem like a record setting weekend but the record comes from spending according to vendor reports that chamber president and ceo jennifer grimmer shared with fyn friday saw the apple festival parade kick off the grand return to the annual event with its golden year theme to celebrate this being the 50th annual georgia apple festival a somewhat shorter parade than usual was held in downtown ellijay at 6 00 p m as the parade followed its usual path up river street around the square and down north main street however grimmer said the quality of many of the floats have hit a high point this year making the decisions for awards even harder those winners included the girl scouts in first place artful provisions in second place and the gilmer animal shelter in third place grimmer also said that the chamber may look to changing the day and time of the parade again next year but will be looking for input from citizens and vendors on what day and time they feel would be better the festival commenced the day after the parade as vendors opened up to a very foggy morning on saturday to officially open the gate for the return to festival days with many other surrounding county s festivals like the marble festival in pickens county cancelled again this year thoughts were that attendance could increase this year but within the first two days of the festival the chambers records report roughly 26 000 attendees came through the festivals fairgrounds while many of these also visited downtown many more attend the festival s extension and secondary location called apple arts with no gate or counter there isn t an estimate for how many attended apple arts that did not attend the festival on the fairgrounds grimmer noted that the chamber is happy with the 26 000 attendees though it is not a record setting attendance weekend we had an absolutely amazing weekend said grimmer as she shared the attendance numbers she explained her excitement as she also shared a report from the festival vendors many vendors reported sales not only increased over recent years but exploded into unforeseen numbers many vendors sold out of their entire stock of merchandise in just two days or less what they brought with them to last for two weekends did not even survive two days of this year s festival even the local apple houses were feeling the demand as grimmer reported one of the apple houses had to go mid day to resupply and bring more apples to the fairground when asked grimmer said that yes a few vendors said they would be unable to return next weekend because they simply don t have or cannot get enough stock by then many others reported that they would be spending five days in full production mode and searching for supplies to return this saturday to continue providing for demand many vendors reported this has been either their best or among their best weekends ever the fairgrounds were not exclusive to this either as apple arts in downtown shared similar stories from all of its vendors grimmer surveyed as many vendors as she could to garner the response and experiences of this return to the event sharing the report of one vendor who has been at the festival for 20 years grimmer said he usually doesn t make a sale until after lunch and he had people at his booth at 9 02 buying grimmer also explained how this translates to locals in addition to sales for vendors many of which are local artisans local organizations and non profits are feeling the increase with donations and things like parking lots and exposure through the festival from the lion s club to boys and girls club and boy scouts all are benefitting from the return of the festival of course the businesses are benefitting from the overflow through restaurants and local merchants grimmer shared a report from misty hollow experiencing the third highest day ever so much business was being done that the chamber experienced its own issues from trying to maintain the atms and refilling the machines and even had a short time when they ran out of 20 bills from most of the machines surveying the vast majority of the vendors she said that not one single vendor said they were disappointed or experiencing a down time grimmer said their was some overwhelming feelings but said that thanks to the staff helping out volunteers running smoothly and the return of former president paige hutto returning as a consultant the festival has run smoothly and addressed issues to allow the success that it has seen she even noted and said she s been very thankful to how the community is working together vendors willingness to spread out in aid of social distancing and volunteers stepping to fill needs were just some of the things grimmer also said she has been really thankful that a couple vendors called ahead and though they had to cancel last minute she said she was very proud of vendors saying they could have had a positive exposure and probably shouldn t attend but local community is a part of the efforts too some locals are still staying at home to avoid the traffic and crowds but many have been seen at both the fairgrounds and downtown attending the parades signing up to volunteer signing up for the car show participating in the 5k dealing with the traffic and continuing to support the chamber and the annual event in all of its forms and outside programs the chamber isn t sitting on the success though grimmer noted that most of the chamber staff don t have a single day off between october 4 and october 22 what may seem strange is that while most of the time is spent continuing to deal with and prepare for the second weekend some of this time is already preparing for next year taking notes and sharing ideas grimmer said that the chamber is already looking at things that could be better done and are looking for public input like the parade times and working alongside the school system the county and its people

not a single structure burned down in the city of south lake tahoe and yet the threat of the fast approaching caldor fire cost surrounding el dorado county tens of millions of dollars if not more in south lake tahoe domi chavarria co owner of verde mexican rotisserie felt the devastation of the caldor fire even before the city was evacuated in august smoke had blanketed the city and the tourists had mostly left when the evacuation orders came down verde was stocked with food almost all of which went bad during the more than two weeks the restaurant ultimately remained closed produce wilted proteins went bad prepared sauces couldn t be used all that stuff none of that s made to last weeks it s all made last days says chavarria he estimates the lost inventory was worth between 10 000 and 13 000 none of it was covered by his insurance losses like chavarria s add up to at least 50 3 million in lost economic activity for el dorado county according to an initial estimate shared with calmatters knowing the true cost of wildfires could spur more ambitious action from both government and the private sector experts say for instance tracking the costs systematically over several years could help policymakers figure out which fire prevention and mitigation strategies are most cost effective but right now california has an incomplete understanding of how much wildfires cost the state each year photo courtesy of domi chavarria food inventory from the verde mexican rotisserie restaurant had to be discarded after a 2 week evacuation order due to the caldor fire in south lake tahoe domi chavarria the owner of verde mexican rotisserie lost about 10k worth of inventory when they shut down for two weeks due to the caldor fire evacuation the costs of business disruption the cost of damage to uninsured homes the cost of ecosystem damage and the cost of secondary health impacts such as those caused by wildfire smoke aren t being tracked right now we don t have a comprehensive picture of the economic harm wildfires cause each year according to teresa feo senior science officer at the california council on science and technology and lead author of a 2020 report from the council on the cost of wildfires in california there isn t a statewide systematic tracking effort to figure out these costs says feo she said it took only about a month of digging into the question to realize oh no you can t come up with a number this is actually impossible with the existing data the state does not track or estimate the cost of wildfires in a way that accounts for public health costs or ecological damage on a regular basis confirmed heather williams communications director for california natural resources agency those would always be a moving target since health impacts can occur years later but with more research being funded this may be more feasible to help the state better understand the economic and ecological impacts so we can continue to make science based informed policy decisions williams wrote in an email the different costs of wildfires the initial analysis of the caldor fire s economic impact was prepared by tom harris an economist at the university of nevada reno for the tahoe prosperity center an economic development organization for the lake tahoe basin it estimates the combined losses of el dorado and nevada s douglas county at 93 million and says harris that preliminary estimate is low it doesn t include the losses in sectors like rental homes or recreation businesses nor does it include the lost economic activity caused by residents evacuating and it doesn t take into account the healthcare costs associated with wildfire smoke exposure some costs are more immediate the cost of chavarria s rotted food for instance and the fact that the fire took place over labor day weekend salgu wissmath calmatters domi chavarria poses for a portrait at his restaurant verde mexican rotisserie in south lake tahoe on oct 6 2021 that s not a slow weekend in tahoe says chavarria tourism is about 63 percent of the tahoe basin s economy according to a 2018 report from tahoe prosperity center between the slowdown in business due to smoke and the evacuation verde lost several weeks of revenue chavarria says that a month of sales for the restaurant is more than 100 000 verde s employees also went without paychecks for the two weeks the restaurant was shut down nicole smith co founder and taproom manager of south lake brewing company said her business fared better than many partially because none of the beer went bad but between the loss of sales in the company s own taproom and the beer it sells to other local businesses the brewery lost somewhere between 30 000 and 50 000 of revenue during the evacuation estimates smith in addition to lost business some figures are easier to pin down like the amount cal fire spends on fire suppression but the state for example does not systematically track deaths and health conditions linked to wildfire smoke exposure the costs associated with smoke may be the largest costs we re missing says feo one study produced by public health department researchers and academics tracked the use of medi cal services during san diego s 2007 fall fire season it found that during the peak fire period emergency room visits for respiratory conditions increased by 34 and visits for asthma increased by 113 especially concerning was a 136 increase in er visits for children four and younger for asthma that finding the authors wrote is cause for particular concern because of the potential for long term harm to children s lung development a systematic effort to track wildfire smoke effects would be especially profound says feo because it reaches so far beyond the location of the fire in 2018 for example smoke from the camp fire clogged san francisco a city more than a 100 miles away if you can put figures on the impact of smoke across the whole state who s impacted by the fire suddenly changes very dramatically and therefore who benefits from the prevention and mitigation changes she said different approaches to wildfire data the current approach to assessing the aftermath of wildfires is a hodgepodge of research looking into different aspects that is not led by any one agency a smattering of data collection efforts includes the california air resources board is funding a study of the health impact of wildfire smoke statewide for 2017 2018 and 2020 which will be ready in three or four years the board is also funding a study of lost work days due to wildfire smoke which will be ready in a couple of years cal fire is also increasing funding for research into forest health the department of insurance tabulates the damage to insured homes for some major wildfires but does not track damage from all wildfires each year and a variety of academic studies academic research on the cost of wildfires tends to come out several years later and different studies focus on different fires using different methodologies that makes it difficult to compare the findings or track the costs over time these studies are also conducted based on the interests of the particular researcher says louise comfort a professor at the university of pittsburgh and a faculty affiliate at uc berkeley s center for information technology research in the interest of society policy lab that doesn t give us a comprehensive view comfort says she credits an uc system wide effort tostudy the impacts of wildfires as a step in the right direction but says the results are still not coming in in a standardized way the state may be in the best position to lead the effort on tracking the economic impact of wildfires the only thing that would give us a comprehensive view is if the state really said we want this kind of information says comfort but the state agencies shouldn t go it alone she says they should engage experts in the university system salgu wissmath calmatters cook isaura martinez preps food in the kitchen at verde mexican rotisserie in south lake tahoe on oct 6 2021 without statewide systematically published numbers it s more difficult to compare how different regions are suffering from wildfires or to assess the cost effectiveness of different wildfire prevention strategies and it may be more challenging to justify spending on expensive but nonetheless cost effective mitigation or prevention programs that s a question that comes up when talking about spending taxpayer dollars feo said while wildfire costs aren t tracked there are some academic studies that attempt to estimate those costs and produce mind boggling figures in 2020 for example a team of researchers studied the nationwide impact of california s 2018 wildfire season and estimated that its economic damage totaled 148 5 billion the study published in nature sustainability captured direct capital costs such as buildings burning down health costs including those related to air pollution exposure and indirect losses such as the economic disruption of lost hours working as well as disruption to regional and national supply chains the costs identified in that study exceed that of any disaster in the u s between the 9 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the ongoing covid 19 pandemic other than hurricane katrina says adam rose a research professor at university of southern california and an expert in energy and environmental economics rose said that a standardized methodology for assessing the total cost of wildfires should be established and applied on a regular basis and it needs to be one that can be implemented relatively rapidly as opposed to several years after a fire that would allow a whole field of researchers to help track these costs and would make their findings comparable in addition to helping make the political case for government led fire prevention efforts those numbers might spur private sector action on fire prevention efforts but not all experts said that measuring the costs associated with each wildfire season is important william siembieda a professor emeritus at cal poly in san luis obispo and senior member of a cal poly team that prepared several of the state s hazard mitigation plans says he doesn t know how policymakers would make use of those numbers what would be useful siembieda says is for cities to model the economic impact of different levels of fire damage what would be the cost if 5 of the city burned what if 10 or 20 burned with those estimates local officials could decide whether they re prepared to eat that loss insure against the risk or pursue other strategies what s next for victims for a couple weeks now south lake tahoe residents and business owners have been reopening their restaurants shops and adventure outfits taking stock of what happened when lisa schafer co owner of wildwood makers market returned to the city and drove to her shop for the first time she felt waves of different emotions there was the fear she d been holding on to that her hometown her house and her business would all burn to a crisp there was the gratitude she felt for the fact that they had all been spared i cried the whole drive she said her shop which sells jewelry wall decor embroidery kits and other gifts smelled smoky for her first few days back it wasn t a pleasant campfire smell it smelled like beef jerky business didn t return to normal immediately tourists didn t rush back to the area all told shafer lost about 60 of sales in september her insurance won t cover that loss of business it s clear she says that these fires are not going away she said she wishes there were some sort of automatic aid for businesses and individuals impacted by the fire ultimately wildwood makers market will bounce back from loss of business schafer said but if something happens in the winter that disrupts the holiday shopping season that could be catastrophic she says one more hit would not be good for

jeffrey collins associated press columbia s c ap a former utility executive who lied to ratepayers and regulators costing billions of dollars after he found out a pair of nuclear reactors being built in south carolina were hopelessly behind schedule will soon be heading to prison for two years a state judge monday accepted the negotiated sentence of former scana ceo kevin marsh he is the first executive to go to prison over the project which lasted nine years and never generated a watt of power marsh has cooperated with investigators spending at least seven days talking to the fbi prosecutors said a ceo for a fortune 500 company is going to prison and is paying 5 million to the people of south carolina state attorney general alan wilson said outside the spartanburg county courtroom under the agreement marsh is to report in early december to a federal prison in butner north carolina which includes a large hospital rather than a state facility he will serve the entire federal two year federal sentence south carolina circuit judge mark hayes suspended a 10 year state sentence but told marsh he will have to serve it if he does not keep cooperating or fails to successfully serve three years of probation marsh isn t the only executive facing legal problems a second former scana executive and an official at westinghouse electric co the lead contractor to build two new reactors at the v c summer plant north of columbia have also pleaded guilty a second westinghouse executive has been indicted and is awaiting trial prosecutors now are expected to turn their attention to westinghouse while marsh lied about the lack of progress in the final years of construction of the reactors westinghouse knew of the problem long before and did not tell marsh or other scana executives u s assistant attorney brook andrews said at marsh s sentencing thursday in federal court marsh s lawyer asked the judge and by extension the public to remember that this should not be the end a project like this doesn t go down the tubes because one person was involved said defense attorney robert bolchoz who compared marsh to a captain of a ship who trusted a crew working against him marsh pleaded guilty in federal court in february to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and in state court to obtaining property by false pretenses the nuclear debacle was set up by a law passed in 2007 that allowed utilities to charge ratepayers to build power plants before they started generating power it divorced the risk from the people who were spending the money state assistant attorney general creighton waters said you won if you won and you won if you lost if the project was a failure and you abandoned it you still got to recoup that cost from customers that put a lot of responsibility on marsh as the leader of scana and he failed by keeping his mouth shut when problems mounted and collecting bonuses instead of risking his job waters said marsh made 5 million in 2017 the year the utility abandoned the hopelessly behind schedule project his plea agreement requires 5 million in restitution which has already been paid to a fund that provides help to pay electric bills of low income people the actions by marsh and other executives took more than 1 billion from the pockets of ratepayers and investors authorities said in an 87 page securities and exchange commission lawsuit filed against him and a second executive in 2020 scana and its subsidiary south carolina electric gas were destroyed by the debt and poor management and were bought out by dominion energy of virginia in 2019 state owned utility santee cooper which had a 45 stake in the project ended up saddled with 4 billion in debt even though scana controlled management of the project marsh read a brief statement in court monday similar to the one he read in federal court thursday he said not a day has gone by in the past four years where he did not regret that failure of the project i accept full responsibility marsh said i feel sorry for everything that occurred marsh s original plea deal said sentencing would wait until the investigation was over to assure his full cooperation but prosecutors relented after marsh s wife of 46 years was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer marsh never wavered from saying the two reactors being built at the v c summer site north of columbia would be finished by the end of 2020 a deadline that had to be met to receive the 1 4 billion in federal tax credits needed to keep the 10 billion project from overwhelming the utility prosecutors said marsh lied and presented rosy projections on the progress of the reactors that he knew were false in earning calls presentations and news releases to keep investors happy and pump up the company s stock price u s district judge mary geiger lewis reluctantly accepted the deal even though she felt prosecutors and marsh s lawyers made it sound like the executive made mistakes instead of intentionally misleading people for well over a year your crime was committed with a little more elegance and sophistication than many i see geiger told marsh on thursday but you don t get credit

student workers at harvard university members of the harvard graduate students union united auto workers hgsu uaw voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike in a vote that ended september 30 with 91 7 percent 1 860 members voting in favor the union says that 386 new student workers joined the union during the vote which was only available to members the last strike of harvard graduate students lasted most of december 2019 but did not achieve strikers demands in fact since the union began negotiating with the administration in october 2018 harvard has not made any significant concession to key demands from student workers regarding wages benefits and working conditions the hgsu uaw is calling for salary increases of 5 75 percent 4 5 percent and 3 percent in the three years of an agreement retroactive to july 1 2021 it is also calling for a 21 an hour minimum wage for hourly student workers with 0 50 increases in following years harvard university is proposing raises of 2 5 3 and 3 percent with a 19 minimum wage for hourly workers followed by 0 50 increases in the following two years neither proposal meets the needs of student workers even if the union s proposal were adopted in full which is highly unlikely with inflation currently running at 5 percent annually workers would be treading water and then experience falling wages in real terms the union does not mention once the covid 19 pandemic and the dangers it poses to those working in person the demands related to health and safety only reiterate health and safety laws already in place they write sws will be provided with a safe university workspace and will not be required to work in conditions that pose an unnecessary threat to their health and safety towards that end the university has policies in place to provide such a safe workplace will maintain such policies during the life of this agreement and may improve such policies at its discretion in other words the contract allows for what is safe to be up to the discretion of the university and the policies of the ruling class as a whole not what is actually safe for workers while sending student workers back into classrooms during a deadly pandemic as of yet the union bargaining committee is not calling for a strike instead ostensibly using the threat of a strike at an unspecified future point as leverage according to their recent halloween inspired post to spook harvard and win the contract we deserve a similar tactic was utilized in june when the union sent a letter of intent to strike signed by over 500 grad student workers yet only four days after the letter was received the bargaining committee began a membership vote to extend the contract after a 5 5 deadlock on the question of a strike the context of the two month extension of the now expired contract is important for student workers to consider during the contract extension vote a strike by roughly 2 900 volvo trucks autoworkers in southwestern virginia was reaching a decisive turning point after the workers had voted down three uaw backed sellout contracts volvo trucks workers took matters into their own hands by building the volvo workers rank and file committee which raised workers demands against the opposition of the corporatist uaw just as the uaw blacked out coverage of the strike at other auto factories the hgsu uaw leadership made no mention of the struggles taking place by their class brothers and sisters and gave no perspective or strategy of linking their struggles in conjunction with a no vote in the extension of the no strike contract the fact that only 61 5 percent of members supported a contract extension even though the hgsu provided no alternative and that students turned out to vote overwhelmingly to authorize a strike signifies the growing militancy of student workers and their opposition to the conditions sanctioned by the previous contract in this struggle graduate workers must recognize their allies and their enemies harvard university the oldest in the united states is tied inextricably to its 41 9 billion endowment the largest university endowment on the planet the endowment which has skyrocketed along with the stock market during the pandemic even as millions have died provides about twice as much revenue as student enrollment fees for the university the process underlying these developments is an education system more and more dependent on and influenced by financing from ever increasing market gains and wealthy donors themselves enriched by financial parasitism yet these gains for the financial aristocracy are themselves dependent upon the further intensification of the exploitation of the working class and cuts in social spending infrastructure and the living standards of working people workers face not only the university and the financial aristocracy that funds it but the uaw a corporatist apparatus of highly paid executives 450 earn six figure salaries whose top officials have recently been convicted of taking bribes from auto companies or embezzling workers dues like harvard the uaw is also deeply tied to the financial markets despite losing more than a million members over the last four decades the uaw saw its assets grow to over 1 1 billion 725 million of which is in investments just as the harvard endowment cannot be touched for the living wage of student workers so too the uaw strike fund is barely utilized paying out only 250 a week to striking general motors workers in 2019 for example while uaw executives use it as a multimillion dollar piggy bank for themselves the uaw s efforts in recent years to unionize academic workers is driven by the desire to offset the loss of membership among industrial workers by opening up a new source of dues income from academic workers a demand of the hgsu uaw in the latest contract is that those who choose not to join the union should nevertheless have a service fee equivalent to union dues deducted from their pay for the financial managers of harvard and the labor managers of the uaw the maintenance of their luxurious existence means the maintenance of the continued exploitation of the working class the deepening social crisis which the covid 19 pandemic is accelerating is driving workers into struggle against the capitalist system and its defenders including in the unions in this struggle harvard workers have powerful allies there are 6 000 unionized harvard employees most of whom have contracts expiring this year but the unions have made no attempt to unite these struggles less than an hour away in worcester massachusetts hundreds of nurses have been on strike for months the longest such strike in state history graduate workers at columbia university in new york city also uaw members have voted to authorize a strike while thousands of workers in the auto industry are demanding strike action against sellout deals negotiated by the uaw workers internationally are also on strike from sri lankan educators to south african metalworkers to german health care workers harvard student workers can and must link up their struggles with other student workers and other sections of workers internationally through forming a rank and file committee as part of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc to take the struggle out of the hands of the uaw the world socialist web site and the international youth and students for social equality are prepared to offer every assistance we urge those interested to contact us today

2021 newcrest mining limited asx ncm tsx ncm pngx ncm is pleased to announce that the newcrest board has endorsed the red chris block cave pre feasibility study the study and approved its progression to the feasibility stage the study confirms newcrest s original investment thesis of unlocking the underground portion of this tier 1 deposit by leveraging newcrest s industry leading block caving expertise and developing the asset to become a mainstay of newcrest s portfolio for decades to come the study is the first technical report issued by newcrest on red chris since its acquisition of a 70 interest and operatorship in august 2019 newcrest intends to release a national instrument 43 101 ni 43 101 technical report on red chris within 45 days of this release newcrest managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said the red chris block cave pre feasibility study confirms red chris s potential to be a long life low cost mine capable of producing a total of 5 3moz of gold and 1 7mt of copper at very attractive cash margins the study highlights the quality of the deposit with a c 2 3 billion npv and 17 irr but we believe captures only part of the longer term opportunity at red chris since acquiring our 70 interest in red chris in august 2019 we have been focused on unlocking its future potential which we have always believed to be significant and which is confirmed by the study to date we have had considerable exploration success at red chris including our exciting east ridge discovery and the existence of multiple high grade pods in the east zone both of which are outside the scope of this study east ridge is a new zone of higher grade mineralisation located outside the initial mineral resource estimate with intercepts to date highlighting the potential for resource growth over time we are currently evaluating early mining options for the high grade pods in the east zone with the aim of generating additional cash flows prior to the completion of block cave construction red chris is already in a tier 1 mining jurisdiction we believe that we can transform the asset into a tier 1 operation through the application of our proven industry leading block caving technologies and in doing so provide attractive financial returns to shareholders as well as multi generational employment and other opportunities in tahltan territory

to expand the known mineralisation supporting the potential for further mineral resource growth and additional mining fronts pipeline of early stage targets within the surrounding exploration tenements the study builds on newcrest s experience and success with block cave developments in australia with the block cave mining method particularly well suited to the porphyry deposits found at red chris and throughout the golden triangle region of british columbia the study underpins an initial ore reserve estimate of 8 1moz au and 2 2mt cu5 the study and ongoing drilling results indicate significant orebody optionality which will be further tested during the feasibility stage parallel studies to assess further upside are underway to consider the early mining of high grade pods located in the east zone with the aim of generating additional cashflows prior to the completion of block cave construction and accommodating the potential development of the new east ridge discovery and further resource upside newcrest s experience at cadia shows that orebodies of this type are unique and carry significant embedded optionality providing opportunities for further value creation for shareholders over the mine life the availability of hydro generated grid power combined with the efficient low cost block cave mining method is expected to reduce the project s carbon footprint

consolidation of all costs and schedules into a feasibility study financial estimate project description1 newcrest is the operator of the red chris mine the mine which is owned 70 by newcrest and 30 by imperial metals corporation through an unincorporated joint venture the mine is currently an open pit operation that produces approximately 10 to 11mt of ore per annum newcrest completed an internal concept study in cy20 that identified the potential to transition to block cave underground mining and informed the need for an early works program focusing on the construction of an exploration decline the study commenced in june 2020 and has recommended transitioning the existing open pit to an underground mine using the block cave mining method from the exploration decline the access decline will be developed to provide personnel and material access to the mining blocks a conveyor within an independent decline fed by a jaw gyratory crusher would provide ore handling facilities as well as a second egress three macro mining blocks mb1 2 and 3 would be mined sequentially using load haul dump machines directly into the underground crusher in mb1 and mb2 while a truck loop would be added in time to haul ore from mb3 to the crusher in mb1 while the mine has been costed using a diesel fleet the designs also allow for the electrification of the mining fleet as well as the use of automated equipment further studies on these applications are being progressed as part of the feasibility study the study includes upgrades to the existing processing plant to treat underground ore at a throughput rate of 13 6mtpa which would require an additional coarse ore stockpile new sag mill additional rougher flotation capacity using stackcell technology an upgraded regrind circuit a new cleaner scalping jameson cell and duplication of existing concentrate thickening and filtration equipment the study also investigated an upside case to 15mtpa which would require sag mill configurations to allow increased throughput at a coarser grind hydrofloat coarse particle flotation technology will be installed on the rougher tailings to maintain copper and gold recovery as the grind is coarsened two key considerations of the study have been the handling of tailings produced from mining as well as water stewardship studies to accommodate tailings storage have confirmed that tailings from mb1 can be accommodated within the already permitted tia for mb2 and mb3 a design has been undertaken to further raise the north and south tia dams using centreline raises replace reclaim dams and construct the northeast dam this would provide an ultimate capacity of 550mt tailings plans for the management of the tailings dam volume which will minimise the need for additional makeup water have also been developed infrastructure to support the underground mine would include an operational accommodation complex and services such as roads water sewage and communications power would be supplied through the existing transmission line with expansions to on site facilities the tahltan nation is the first nation on whose territory the red chris mine is situated newcrest has developed a strong working relationship with the tahltan nation and operates under an impact benefit co management agreement ibca with the tahltan nation the agreement includes provisions for royalties education training employment and contracting opportunities as well as how the two parties will work together on social environmental and cultural heritage matters a range of engagement and consultation occurs regularly with tahltan central government tahltan leadership local communities and the larger nation recently engagement has been focused on upcoming permitting processes and related assessments newcrest has identified a pathway to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the project and is actively engaged with the tahltan central government and government agencies in relation to the approvals required to enable execution of the project in a phased manner this underground mine is envisioned to start production from mb1 in fy27 and have a mine life of approximately 30 years providing employment revenue and other opportunities to tahltan british columbia and canada6 newcrest s initial mineral resource estimate was released in march 2021 and was used to support the study the study has defined an initial probable ore reserve of 480mt 0 52 g t gold and 0 45 copper for 8 1moz contained gold and 2 2mt contained copper including an open pit

considered a production rate scenario of 15mtpa which provides an option to increase the production rate of the block cave above the rate detailed in this document this option will be further explored and refined during the feasibility study underground mine development and sequence1 the red chris underground resource extends to a depth of 1 200m below the surface with economic mineralisation typically being low grade and vertical in nature given the depth and nature of the mineralisation the extraction of the resource is best suited to a bulk underground mining method block cave mining was selected due to its low operating cost productivity and suitability to the geometry and conditions of the resource the underground mine will be accessed via both an access decline and a conveyor decline the construction of the exploration decline is currently in progress which is expected to provide exploration information for the near mine area as well as provide the opportunity to collect more geological and geotechnical information for the planned caves mine access is expected to be completed in fy246 the mine will consist of three adjoining macro blocks mb1 mb2 mb3 seen in figure 4 each mined with a block cave strategy the extraction level for all macro blocks will be at 500mrl 1 000m below surface and the macro blocks are based on the el teniente layout with 32m by 20m drawbell spacing the ore mined during caving of mb1 and mb2 will be moved to a central 5 tipple crusher with large underground loaders the crusher is located at the northeast corner of the footprint to facilitate mining of mb1 and mb2 ore mined during caving of mb3 will be loaded onto 40t trucks and hauled to the crusher the crusher will then feed the inclined conveyor that will bring the ore to the surface coarse ore stockpile the sequence of the extraction will be the numerical order of the three macro blocks this sequence is based on grade and geotechnical considerations first production from mb1 is expected in fy27 and production is expected to be completed in fy576 the underground mine ventilation network will consist of three surface connecting raises and the two declines the conveyor decline access decline and vr1 5 5m diameter will be intakes and vr2 5 5m diameter and vr3 4 5m diameter will be exhaust the ventilation network is a pull system that has the fans located on the

open pit to underground mining of the east zone resource at depth the ore reserves are supported by the study the project is progressing to the feasibility stage if required any adjustments to the ore reserves statements will be made at the completion of the feasibility study ore reserve classification the probable ore reserve is based on indicated mineral resources and diluting material diluting material is either low grade indicated mineral resource or material carrying no grade no measured mineral resources are stated for this deposit the resource classification is based on an assessment of geological confidence as a function of geological and mineralisation continuity mining method various mining methods have been considered for the extraction of the east zone resources based on the depth size grade and existing site production rate block caving has been deemed the most appropriate mining method by the study and supported via independent reviews ongoing data collection and geotechnical and mining studies will provide ongoing design parameters for the project ore processing processing of the red chris underground ore stream will be through the red chris concentrator which will be upgraded to accommodate a combination of larger throughput increased hardness and higher gold and copper head grades the upgraded plant will utilise grinding and flotation to produce a copper gold concentrate using similar unit operations to the current plant a parallel single stage sag ssag grinding circuit will be installed with a dedicated coarse ore stockpile underground ore will be divided between the existing grinding circuit and the new ssag circuit at a ratio of approximately 60 40 the combined throughput of the upgraded plant will be 13 6 mtpa additional rougher and cleaner flotation capacity a new regrind circuit and expanded concentrate dewatering equipment and concentrate load out facility are also included in the plant upgrade the application of coarse particle flotation has also been considered for moderate future throughput expansion and the selection of a ssag enables further expansion through addition of a ball mill in the future metallurgical testwork plant design and capital and operating cost estimation were completed to pre feasibility level of accuracy metallurgical testing on a range of underground samples provided data to size the single stage sag mill and estimate copper and gold recoveries attributable to underground ore the anticipated recoveries for underground ore are 81 to 86 for copper and 60 to 75 for gold across the life of the project test samples focused mostly on the first 15 years of underground production but included some material from the remainder of the anticipated mine life the mineralogy of underground

pcbc software is used for cave production scheduling and estimation of grade for material drawn from the block caves the resource estimate includes internal dilution and external dilution is included as part of the draw model with no mining recovery factors applied to the ore reserve estimate red chris has no block cave operational data supporting the assumptions within the pcbc the parameters are based on deposits and operations of similar properties providing confidence in the applicability these parameters have been independently reviewed and found to be suitable to support the ore reserves other modifying factors management of water resources was a primary focus of the study and involved the creation of a water balance model for study decision making and to support environmental studies the results of the water balance indicate that the demands for water for the block cave project which result from the increase in production rates over current practice can be achieved by applying water management processes largely aimed at improving reclaim and recycling of water the permitting plan proposes a staged approach to permitting appropriate to the long term nature of the project the energy mines low carbon innovation environmental assessment office and tahltan central government through its representatives have been consulted by newcrest on the permit applications submitted by newcrest to date newcrest will continue to engage and consult with the tahltan central government and government agencies on the development of the permitting plan and applications for the project the timing of obtaining the authorisations remains a risk to the project and is being actively managed through engagement with the relevant parties the permitting process has been informed by engagement of independent experts in british columbian permitting obtaining permits to extract the reserves using the block cave mining method has sufficient confidence to support the reserves statement the

in the gully zone both historical and recent newcrest drilling intersects the mineralisation at various angles the data spacing and distribution of drill holes is considered sufficient to define both the geological and grade continuity for the porphyry style mineralisation and to support the mineral resource estimate geological and grade continuity has been demonstrated during the 5 years of production from the current open pit operations orientation of data in relation to geological structure newcrest drilling is oriented perpendicular to the intrusive complex the intrusive complex has an east northeast orientation with drilling established on a north northwest orientation historical drilling is oriented predominantly north south along grid or are vertical drill holes exploring the

electronically loaded into acquire and the database is replicated in newcrest s centralised database system in melbourne regular reviews of data quality are conducted by site and corporate teams prior to resource estimation site visits the competent person for the mineral resource estimate is an employee of newcrest mining limited and is based in melbourne the competent person has remained closely linked with the project and completed multiple site inspections during 2019 the competent person has reviewed the open pit mining and processing operations historical core storage and sampling systems and has monitored drilling sampling sample security drill logging and data management and is satisfied with the quality of the measures undertaken geological interpretation the geology model for the red chris deposit comprises a cover bowser lake group of siltstone sandstones and conglomerates and the upper triassic clastic sedimentary and mafic volcanic rocks of the stuhini group that was intruded by the late triassic to early jurassic redstock monzonite to quartz monzodiorite intrusions broadly three phases of intrusive have been recognised as part of the redstock that typically hosts the mineralisation and have been used as estimation domains the confidence in the geological volumes used that were used to define the estimation domains is reflected in the resource classification dimension the mineralised zone defined by the drilling to date occupies an area with dimension around 0 3 km in width x 3 4 km in length and 1 3 km in a vertical extent currently three zone of mineralisation have been identified to date that includes the gully main and east zones estimation and modelling techniques geostatistical testing of the copper and gold grade distributions showed that the redstock domain is highly diffusive in nature and satisfies the bi gaussianity assumption of the data additionally the grade distribution for sulphur iron calcium and magnesium are also diffusive in nature therefore gaussian based estimation is considered appropriate to be implemented for copper gold sulphur iron calcium and magnesium within the redstock domain all drillhole samples were composited to 12 metre intervals downhole and honouring the domain boundary in the redstock domain localised uniform conditioning of copper gold sulphur iron calcium and magnesium are undertaken into a panel size of 80 m x 80 m x 12 m blocks and localised into the selective mining unit smu of 20 m x 20 m x 12 m blocks in a single pass run using a discretisation of 4x4x1 search radii for copper and gold were typically around 300 400 m major 400 600 m intermediate and 140 150 m minor the minimum and maximum number of informing composites were 12 and 16 20 respectively depending on the domain and variable being estimated due to weak to moderate skewed nature of the grade distribution no grade capping has been applied however to make sure that the potential smearing of the outliers grade is reduced when necessary a grade and distance restriction is applied for some variables additionally ordinary kriging ok estimation of silver mercury antimony arsenic and carbon was undertaken within the redstock domain directly into the smu blocks respectively the estimation for other domains including the sediment volcanic and bowser domain has utilised ok estimation for copper gold sulphur iron calcium magnesium silver mercury antimony arsenic and carbon directly into the smu blocks respectively due to the very limited number of carbon data within the bowser domain a nearest neighbour estimation was used the block model used for interpolation was populated with local rotations for the redstock domain based on the local orientation of the redstock mineralisation and the orientation of the main structures a soft boundary was applied between the redstock domains and a hard boundary with all other domains the model has been validated using visual statistical and geostatistical methods including statistical comparison metal at risk analysis swath plots global change of support comparison metal at panel and smu comparison and visual comparison of the drillholes and the blocks by sections and plan views a ground truth model gtm within the current open pit area has also been estimated utilising the existing copper and gold blasthole data where the comparison of the gtm and the resource estimate is considered acceptable moisture all tonnages are calculated and reported on a dry tonnes basis cut off parameters a value algorithm is used to calculate the nsr for each block using revenue and cost assumptions as at december 2020 the nsr calculation takes into account the mineral resource revenue factors metallurgical recovery assumptions transport costs refining charges and royalty charges with a gold price of us 1400 oz copper price of us 3 40 lb and a cad usd exchange rate of 0 80 the cut off value for reporting within the open pit mining area is based on an nsr value above c 12 2 t that takes into consideration actual processing and general administration costs the cut off value for reporting within the proposed underground mining area is based on an nsr value above c 21 0 t that takes into consideration proposed mining processing and general administration costs based on studies completed to date mining factors or assumptions red chris open pit is a surface bulk mining operation so smu mining assumptions are based on the current site parameters that are used in the open pit truck and shovel operation an open pit optimisation footprint constraint is used which is based on a maximum undiscounted cashflow at revenue factor 1 0 but with a relative level restriction of 1 112mrl to define the open pit to underground interface at approximately 50 metres below the current life of mine open pit design for the proposed underground the geometry grade indicative geotechnical properties and size of the resource suggest an amenability to a mass underground mining method such as block caving based on the defined smu with no internal selectivity the underground footprint is based on a contiguous area with nsr value above c 21 0 t with a nominal minimum footprint of 160 x 160 m with assumed vertical walls and variable height of draw these two contiguous footprints for open pit and underground are deemed appropriate to be used for the base of the reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction test at red chris metallurgical factors or assumptions metallurgical amenability is derived from current operating red chris jv plant performance for the open pit areas and additional composite test work samples derived from recent drilling for proposed underground areas metallurgical factors for gold and copper have been incorporated into the nsr value algorithm which defines the resource footprint domain specific metallurgical recoveries can range on average from 50 61 for au and 81 83 for cu environmental factors or assumptions conventional waste management of potentially acid forming and non acid forming rock and tailings is currently undertaken at the red chris jv operations in accordance with permit requirements relevant variables are estimated to determine both acid and neutralising potential to determine waste material types bulk density all bulk density measurements are carried out in accordance with site standard procedure intervals for bulk density determination are selected according to lithology alteration mineralisation type to best represent certain intervals as defined by the geologist historically the measurement were undertaken at acme laboratory using the archimedes method since the red chris jv commenced the measurements are performed on site by geologists or geological assistants as part of the logging process using the archimedes method both historical and recent measurements are generally taken at 100 metre intervals down hole bulk density from several thousand measurements has been interpolated using an inverse distance method within the relevant geological domains classification the resource classification is based on drillhole spacing and geological and grade continuity including the assessment of average weighted distance of informing samples and the quality of estimation additionally the mining method mining selectivity mining rate and the cut off value are also taken into consideration generally indicated resources are classified within the average weighted distance of informing data less than 100 metres and a slope of regression sor greater than 0 7 while inferred resources are classified outside of the indicated classification with an average weighted distance less than 175 metres and a sor greater than 0 4 the indicated and inferred mineral resource classification appropriately reflects the view of the competent person referred to below audits or reviews derisk geomining consultants has conducted an independent review of the red chris mineral resource estimate and concluded that the estimate has been prepared using accepted industry practice has been completed in accordance with the jorc code guidelines is suitable for preparing a public report documenting the mineral resource estimate and as a basis for developing ore reserves discussion of relative accuracy confidence for the open pit and underground indicated resources are considered reasonable for the relative uncertainty to be 15 in tonnage grade and metal exclusive of each other i e each variable has to satisfy the criteria for an annual production volume at a 90 confidence level geostatistical evaluations indicate that based on the annual processing throughput these criteria are satisfied relative uncertainties and confidence level estimates are considered for both copper and gold for the open pit detailed monthly mine reconciliations have been maintained since production commenced in 2015 the mine reconciliations confirm that the in situ tonnage grade and metal variances are well within the indicated resource relative uncertainty band section 4 estimation and reporting of ore reserves for the red chris block cave study criteria commentary mineral resource estimate for conversion to ore reserves the red chris project is located in the stikine terrane of north western british columbia 80 km

the main mineralisation event is associated with biotite and potassium feldspar magnetite wall rock alteration the mineralised zone defined by the drilling to date occupies an area with dimension around 0 3 km in width x 3 4 km in length and 1 3 km in a vertical extent currently three zones of mineralisation have been identified to date that includes the gully main and east zones the underground reserves are derived from the east zone resource directly below the east zone pit the mineral resource grades were estimated using localised uniform conditioning of 12 m composites within the redstock domain for six elements gold copper sulphur iron calcium and magnesium the grades were estimated into a panel size of 80 m x 80 m x 12 m blocks and localised into the selective mining unit of 20 m x 20 m x 12m blocks the mineral resource consists of both indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources classification is based on an assessment of geological confidence as a function of geological and mineralisation continuity with reported resources constrained within a value shell representing the limit for a reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction the reported red chris mineral resources are inclusive of ore reserves mineral resources that are not ore reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability site visits the competent person for the ore reserve estimate is an employee of newcrest mining limited based in melbourne and completed multiple site visits during 2019 study status the red chris block cave pre feasibility study completed in 2021 and is the supporting basis for the red chris underground ore reserve estimate the pre feasibility study shows that the mine plan is technically achievable and economically viable taking into consideration all material modifying factors cut off parameters the red chris ore reserve employs a value based cut off determined from the net smelter return nsr value equal to the site operating cost derived from the pre feasibility study the nsr calculation takes into account ore reserve revenue factors metallurgical recovery assumptions transport costs refining charges and royalty charges

financial modelling factors and assumptions have been based on newcrest s block cave operating experience and the red chris site conditions determined through geotechnical data collection programmes completed in 2020 and 2021 the basis of the analysis is considered at pre feasibility study level newcrest s block cave operating and construction experience in conjunction with the pre feasibility

and recovery applied to accurately represent the expected mined tonnes and pcbc software is used for estimation of material grades as material is progressively drawn from the block caves the parameters used for material mixing within the software is based on operations of similar characteristics to that of the red chris resource and mining layout and dimensions no additional mining

infrastructure that has been included within the cost estimate declines accesses to the footprints ventilation raises and other underground excavations material handling system including underground crushing facilities and conveyor system to surface underground workshop and refuelling facilities ventilation fans regulators and heating equipment and dewatering electrical and other service equipment metallurgical factors or assumptions the anticipated recoveries for underground ore are 81 to 86 for copper and 60 to 75 for gold across the life of the project test samples focused mostly on the first 15 years of underground production but included some material from the remainder of the anticipated mine life the mineralogy of underground samples was found to be more favourable for gold recovery than for current red chris open pit operations underground ore mineralogy was shown to have some upside for producing high copper concentrate grades due to the presence of enriched copper minerals such as bornite in certain zones in the orebody the currently approved tia has sufficient volume to accommodate tailings generated when mining the remaining open pit and mb1 ore the pfs design provides increased capacity to the facility to accommodate up to 550 mt of life of mine tailings including since the start of red chris operations in 2015 through centre line dam raises environmental studies in the pfs identified potential areas of impact for the proposed block cave project including the wildlife soil vegetation and terrestrial ecosystems due to the limited incremental increase in the footprint of the mine potential impacts identified in the pfs were primarily associated with hydrogeology and hydrology surrounding the block cave and to the aquatic receiving environment in the footprint of the proposed tia expansion work will be carried out as part of the feasibility study to further develop our understanding of these impacts and potential management strategies findings of the water balance model indicate that the demands for water for operation of the block cave project can be met under specific water management conditions aimed at improving reclaim during operations and recycling of water a conceptual closure plan was developed for the block cave project this plan currently requires long term water treatment of pit and block cave water with limited duration treatment of tia effluent seepage treatment forward works have been developed to address these risks and challenges in the feasibility study infrastructure red chris is an operating open pit mine producing 10mtpa of ore there are existing facilities that support this operation with the transition to underground mining and increased processing rate upgrades to existing site infrastructure are required the major infrastructure upgrade is the processing facility the upgrade includes additional coarse ore stockpile additional rougher flotation capacity an upgraded regrind circuit a new cleaner scalping systems and duplication of existing concentrate thickening and filtration equipment other site infrastructure upgrades or inclusions to support the underground project are operational accommodations complex new mine dry site office and control centre expansion of the tia tailing impoundment area upgrade to the on site power facilities provision for upgrade of services such as onsite roads water sewage and communications these items have all been included within the capital cost estimate costs capital and operating costs have been determined as part of the study and support the ore reserve capital cost estimates are based on multiple market prices across all technical disciplines and include processing upgrade and mine development costs along with associated infrastructure project establishment and sustaining capital costs these provisions have been allowed for during the life of the mine based on most recent pre feasibility plan estimates contingency has also been factored into the project capital cost estimate consistent with the level of accuracy of the study the operating cost estimate includes mining processing transportation and site general and administration costs the existing open pit operation provides a strong basis for site general and administration and processing and transportation with the study assessing these costs and updating them with the revised mining plan the ore reserve cost estimates have been reviewed as part of the study execution are reviewed annually and are considered to be to a pre feasibility study level transport and refining charges have been developed from first principles consistent with the application and input assumptions for these costs used by the current operation these included charges for deleterious elements where applicable royalties are calculated as 1 nsr royalty payable to royal gold revenue factors the financial assessment of the ore reserve estimate is based on long term metal prices and exchange rate assumptions of us 1 300 oz for gold us 3 00 lb for copper at a cad usd exchange rate of 0 80 these ore reserve revenue factors are consistent with newcrest metal price guideline for the december 2020 ore reserve reporting the nsr calculation considers the ore reserve revenue factors metallurgical recovery assumptions transport costs and refining charges and royalty charges market assessment newcrest is a price taker the copper gold and silver prices are determined by international markets and the sales revenue is based on these prices these are open markets and subject to price fluctuations projected supply and demand for copper and gold suggests strong market interest for concentrate from the red chris open pit operation it is not a constraint in the estimation of the ore reserve red chris has sold copper concentrate for its operational life to the world concentrate markets this will continue with the expanded tonnage resulting in a broader smelter customer base the focus of the marketing team will continue to be the use of its skills experience and resources to ensure successful placement of concentrate at maximum prices while mitigating and reducing identified risks concentrate volume forecasts were sourced from the study production schedule economic the ore reserve has been evaluated through a financial model all operating and capital costs as well as ore reserve revenue factors stated in this document were included in the financial model a discount factor of 4 5 real was applied this process demonstrated the red chris ore reserve to have a positive npv sensitivities were conducted on the key input parameters including commodity prices capital and operating costs ore grade discount rate exchange rate and recovery which confirmed the estimate to be robust the npv range has not been provided as it is commercially sensitive social the proposed red chris block cave project requires an approach that generates support from the tahltan nation and leadership as well as the provincial government this approach includes open and transparent consultation and communication in describing the project s activities and assessment of alternatives working partnerships with tahltan and government recognizing and respecting tahltan rights and interests compliance with statutory and regulatory obligations other the permitting plan proposes a staged approach to permitting appropriate to the long term nature of the project the energy mines low carbon innovation environmental assessment office and tahltan central government through its representatives have been consulted by newcrest on the permit applications submitted by newcrest to date newcrest will continue to engage and consult with the tahltan central government and government agencies on the development of the permitting plan for the project findings of the water balance model indicate that the demands for water for operation of the block cave project can be met under specific water management conditions aimed at improving reclaim during operations and recycling of water a conceptual closure plan was developed for the block cave project this plan currently requires long term water treatment of pit and block cave water with limited duration treatment of tia effluent seepage treatment forward works have been developed to address these risks and challenges in the feasibility study the currently approved tia has sufficient volume to accommodate tailings generated when mining the remaining open pit and mb1 ore the pfs design provides increased capacity to the facility to accommodate up to 550mt of life of mine tailings including since the start of red chris operations in 2015 through centre line dam raises newcrest has identified a pathway to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the project and is actively engaging with the tahltan central government and government agencies to obtain the regulatory approvals required to enable execution of the project in a phased manner classification the probable ore reserve is based on indicated mineral resources no measured mineral resources are stated for this deposit the resource classification is based on an assessment of geological confidence as a function of geological and mineralisation continuity with reported resources constrained within a value shell representing the limit for a reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction it is the competent persons view that the classifications used for the ore reserves are appropriate audits or reviews golder associates pty ltd golder was commissioned to conduct an independent review of the ore reserve estimation processes and results golder concluded that the ore reserve had been prepared using accepted industry practice and is considered suitable and reported in accordance with the jorc code 2012 edition discussion of relative accuracy confidence the accuracy of the estimates within this ore reserve is mostly determined by the order of accuracy associated with the mineral resource model the geotechnical input and the cost factors used the competent person views the red chris ore reserve as a reasonable assessment of the global estimate some risks and opportunities are associated with the ore reserve process due to the underground greenfield nature of the project transitioning from open pit mining remaining areas of uncertainty at this stage are associated with cost base assumptions rely on current technology and macroeconomic factors changes to these assumptions will have an impact on the ore reserve estimate definitive flow parameters for the red chris ore body the modifying factors key inputs for ore reserve estimation rely upon the geology and geotechnical data inherent to the orebody this data such as geological structures and rock mass properties is to the appropriate definition and has been applied within the study however further orebody data is required to confirm the geological and geotechnical information and is planned as part of the forward works programme due to the red chris block cave being a greenfields underground project reconciled data for underground production is not available section 4 estimation and reporting of open pit and stockpile ore reserves criteria commentary mineral resource estimate for conversion to ore reserves a technical description of the mineral resource estimate that provided the basis for the red chris open pit ore reserve estimate is presented in the preceding sections the red chris orebody is located in the province of british columbia canada and is 18km southeast of the town of iskut and 80km south of dease lake the conversion of resource to reserve is driven by modifying factors assigning practical and value drivers to available resource inventories pit optimisation pit design and cut off grades are the primary tool for the conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources into probable ore reserves inferred mineral resources and unclassified material are treated as waste and given zero grade the red chris mine is an operating mine and has recently completed newcrest life of province plan and updated mine production schedules and pit designs per quarterly forecasts ore reserves are reported on a 100 basis rather than the 70 30 ownership condition between newcrest mining limited 70 and imperial metals corporation 30 the nominated and company approved competent qualified person qp cp for reserves is brett c swanson be min mmsaqp

chris commenced in 2012 and it is now a mature and stable operation with well established mining and processing performance inputs for the ore reserve estimate have been determined as part of the life of province planning cycle and fy22 q1 forecast the results are also included in the 2021 pre feasibility study on the potential red chris underground cut off parameters red chris open pit employs a multi metal nsr based cut off considering metallurgical recovery assumptions transport costs refining and royalty charges the site operating costs include processing cost relevant site general and administration costs and relevant sustaining capital costs a value algorithm is used to calculate the nsr for each block using revenue and cost assumptions as at june 30th 2021 with a gold price of us 1300 oz copper price of us 3 lb and a cad usd exchange rate of 0 75 the cut off value for reporting within the open pit mining area is based on an nsr value above c 16 5 tonne milled these ore reserve revenue factors are consistent with newcrest metal price guideline for the december 2020 ore reserve reporting mining factors or assumptions estimation of the red chris reserve involved standard steps of pit optimisation mine design production scheduling and financial modelling factors and assumptions have been determined as part of a prefeasibility level study or are based on operating experience and performance current mining activity at red chris is via conventional truck and shovel operation with segregated disposal of non acid generating nag and potentially acid generating pag waste the current mining activities demonstrate the appropriateness of this mining method as the basis of the ore reserve estimate mine design parameters are a minimum mining width mmw of 70m is targeted for all benches in both main pit and east pit including upper benches single lane ramps for bottom four benches in main and east zone 5m fractional bench access provided on either side of ramp for services vehicles single lane ramps target 28m width at 10 grade default dual ramp width targets 35m width at 10 grade ramps are circular around pit limits with no switchbacks geotechnical zones within the pit are assigned specific slope parameters based on detailed analysis of ground conditions and other factors which influence geotechnical performance these design parameters are based on current geotechnical experience and ongoing studies global stability analysis confirms conservative factor of safety estimates with applied pit slopes the red chris resource model utilises localised uniform conditioning luc to estimate block metal content this process allows for ore dilution and recovery to be built into the resource model based on the assumption of the selective mining unit smu as the block size the smu assumption 20m x 20m x 12m is based on the mining fleet size and is consistent with a high mill throughput bulk mining strategy due to the luc approach adopted in the resource model no additional mining dilution or recovery factors have been applied to the ore reserve estimate this assumption is supported by the actual reconciliation between resource model and mill performance at red chris project to date being within an acceptable uncertainty range for the style of mineralisation under consideration adequate tailings and waste storage areas have been defined to support the reported open pit ore reserves metallurgical factors or assumptions the open pit ore reserve estimate is based on a maximum 11mtpa comminution rate plant producing copper concentrate with gold and silver credits ore processing at red chris involves a plant design based on a standard porphyry copper flow sheet employing sag and ball milling flotation regrinding thickening and filtering to produce a copper concentrate at a moisture content of 8 for export concentrate is thickened and filtered and then loaded on trucks of nominal 40 tonne capacity for hauling to the port of stewart for subsequent shipment to asian smelters mill tailings are gravity fed rougher or nag tailings to the nag trench and cleaner scavenger or pag tailings and sulphide concentrate to the pag trench the tia is located in a valley to the northeast of the processing plant and at present consists of a north dam and south dam the metallurgical recovery assumptions for ore feed are dependent on the gold and copper grade that varies by pit location overall metallurgical recovery is based on historic production data and laboratory test samples and has been estimated as gold recovery 50 8 copper

lihir is an operating open pit mine on lihir island and the study incorporates learnings from operational execution to date work is progressing on a feasibility study for the phase 14a cutback and any adjustments to the ore reserves statement will be made following the completion of the feasibility study ore reserve classification all of the in situ probable ore reserve is based on indicated mineral resources the proved ore reserve is based on measured mineral resources defined for known and quantified low grade stockpiles the in situ resource classification is based on an assessment of geological confidence as a function of geological and mineralisation continuity mining method current mining activity at lihir is via conventional truck and shovel operation with offshore barge disposal of waste rock and land based and in pit stockpiling and reclaim of lower grade ore ore processing ore processing at lihir involves the main operations of crushing grinding flotation pressure oxidation leaching and electrowinning to recover gold from relatively high grade sulphide feed producing gold doré the lihir process plant utilises proven technology that is widely used in the gold industry for this style of mineralisation the ore processing facility has been operating since it was commissioned in 1996 and upgrades took place during 2011 and 2012 comminution circuit operating optimisations and minor upgrades are planned to achieve a 15 5mtpa plant capacity12 the metallurgical recovery assumption for ore feed to the autoclave is dependent on the gold and sulphide sulphur grades and dependent on sulphur to calcium ratio and proportion of aged stockpile feed for flotation material overall metallurgical recovery is reconciled with historic production data laboratory test samples for stockpiled ore and reflects a partial oxidation metallurgical operating strategy average life of mine gold recovery is modelled to be 81 82 cut off grade lihir open pit employs a grade based cut off taking into account gold price metallurgical recovery assumptions and site operating costs the site operating costs include transport and refining costs royalty charges mining and processing costs relevant site general and administration costs and relevant sustaining capital costs these costs equate to a break even cut off value of us 38 t milled used to define the ultimate pit shell and a marginal cut off value of us 33 t milled or 1 0 g t gold used to define ore and waste material within the ultimate pit shell the marginal site cost is based on an end of mine life low grade stockpile reclaim strategy reducing the site activity and long term cost base the mining cost in the marginal site cost represents the stockpile reclaim cost estimation methodology estimation of the lihir ore reserve involved standard steps of mine optimisation mine design production scheduling and financial modelling factors and assumptions have been based on operating experience and performance at the lihir operations the ore reserve has been evaluated through a financial model all operating and capital costs as well as ore reserve revenue factors stated in this document were included in the financial model a discount factor of 4 5 real was applied this process demonstrated that the lihir ore reserve has a positive npv sensitivities were conducted on the key input parameters including commodity prices capital and operating costs ore grade discount rate exchange rate and recovery which confirmed the estimate to be robust material modifying factors the resource estimation process allows for ore dilution and recovery to be built into the resource model based on the assumption of the selective mining unit smu as the block size the smu assumption is based on the mining fleet size and is consistent with a high mill throughput bulk mining strategy due to the localised uniform conditioning luc approach adopted in the resource model no additional mining dilution or recovery factors have been applied to the ore reserve estimate this assumption is supported by the actual reconciliation between resource model and mill performance at lihir to date being within an acceptable uncertainty range for the style of mineralisation under consideration the pit optimisation takes into account inferred mineral resources however only measured and indicated mineral resources are reported in the ore reserve estimate the inferred mineral resource represents a small portion of material within the ultimate pit design and both the design and financial model are insensitive to the exclusion of this material civil engineered wall support is required for the phase 14a cutback to allow access to the orebody the cutback design also requires mining by a fleet of small equipment owing to the narrow ramp configuration required allowances for these activities are included in the preparation of the ore reserve estimate other modifying factors lihir gold limited and the lihir open pit are in material compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements naturally occurring risks that might have a material impact upon the lihir ore reserve are discussed in the risks section of newcrest s operating and financial review in the appendix 4e and financial report for the year ended 30 june 2021 which is available to view at www asx com au under the code ncm and on newcrest s sedar profile and include the potential impacts of seismic activity environmental permitting for the phase 14a project has been assessed and approved by the conservation and environment protection authority cepa the known legal political environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources or ore reserves are identified in sections 3 and 4 of appendix 1 appendix 1 jorc table 1 lihir 100 newcrest section 1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques lihir is located in an active geothermal area and procedures have been developed to ensure that all drilling activities are conducted in a safe manner which is appropriate for when zones of high pressure steam are intersected data used for the resource estimation is obtained by two main drilling methods diamond coring and reverse circulation rc drilling all available diamond drill holes are sampled by cutting the core in half with a diamond saw with sample intervals being either 1m or 2m in length half the cut core is placed in a calico bag with a sample number and sent to the laboratory for assaying all rc drilling was sampled at 1m intervals collected via a cyclone and split with a riffle splitter the riffle split sample size of 4 5kg is placed in a calico bag with a sample number and sent to the laboratory for assaying drilling techniques drilling is the primary source of data for mineral resource estimation at lihir data is obtained from two main drilling methods diamond coring and rc drilling the majority of drilling for the resource estimation is diamond drill core 93 comprising pq 84 8 mm core diameter hq 63 5 mm core diameter and nq 47 6 mm core diameter very little core orientation is performed on site as the structurally complex and geothermal conditions make it very difficult to obtain accurate orientations minor 7 of resource drilling is rc 5 1 4 diameter completed prior to 2002 used both vertical and angled holes since 2002 all resource drilling has been comprised of diamond core stockpile drilling is campaigned using an rc rig with a 4 bit hole lengths are routinely 36m drill sample recovery core recovery is recorded and stored in an acquire software database there are only minor zones of core loss or poor core recovery core recovery is generally excellent with average core recoveries around 99 there is no identified relationship between core loss and grade and the style of mineralisation suggests this is unlikely there are no records of rc sample recovery logging all diamond drill holes are geologically logged due to the nature of the intense alteration core is qualitatively logged for lithology and alteration and quantitatively logged for structure and geotechnical parameters all core is logged and photographed after marking up metre intervals and prior to cutting and sampling logging data are entered into the acquire database via a laptop computer or historically via manual data entry sub sampling techniques and sample preparation the sampling technique used is considered appropriate for the assessment of lihir mineralisation at the completion of drill core logging the geologist defines which intervals of a drill hole are to be cut for analysis all recent drilling is analysed on 2m intervals on the metre mark pq and hq sized drill core is sampled by cutting the core in half with a diamond blade saw when intact and competent the left hand half is placed in a calico bag marked with the appropriate sample number and sent to the assay laboratory for analysis where the core is too soft to be cut with a diamond saw a knife is used to cut the core in the core tray where the core is too broken or brittle to be cut by the saw the fragments are manually sampled nq sized core is not cut in half as the entire section is sampled so that sample support is maintained the standard sampling interval is 2m but has varied over time from 1m to 2m the remaining half core is stored in the original trays on pallets at the core processing facility lihir has a sample preparation facility at the mine and up to january 2015 there are records for crusher duplicates drill core was crushed and rc and blast hole samples were dried and loaded into the pulverisers without laboratory splitting after 2015 there was a reduction in core sampling and all samples were transferred directly to a bank of 6 lm5 pulverisers without crushing or splitting there are two standby jaw crushers with a small single deck riffle splitter which are rarely used sample preparation for analysis is as follows samples are crushed if required to 10mm maximum diameter and split to a nominal weight of 2 5 3kg using a riffle splitter split samples are dried in an oven at 105 c until dry each sample is pulverised using a labtechnics lm5 pulverizing mill to specified grind parameters of 95 passing 106µm a 200g sub sample is collected for analysis and submitted to the assay laboratory pulp replicates not duplicates are routinely undertaken crushed and pulp duplicates are collected at the orange laboratory the sample preparation and size is considered appropriate for assessment of bulk tonnage mineral deposits of this type quality of assay data and laboratory tests the lihir onsite laboratory has been the primary laboratory used for assaying with some more recent assaying completed at the newcrest services laboratory orange nsw samples are routinely assayed for gold and sulphur gold analysis is by fire assay with 25g charge and atomic absorption spectroscopy aas finish and detection limit of 0 01ppm g t which is considered complete sulphide sulphur is by labfit method where the sample is ignited at high temperature in a stream of oxygen the resulting sulphur dioxide is measured by an infra red detector using a carbon sulphur analyser a detailed quality assurance quality control qaqc program is in place for on going assessment of sampling and analytical procedures the process currently involves analysis of blind submissions of certified reference material standards to lihir laboratory duplicates from the lm5 pulveriser pulp assayed during the same batch blind resubmission of pulps to lihir laboratory replicate submissions of pulps to an alternative laboratory for analysis submission of coarse blank samples non lihir island barren rock samples checks on grind and crush size from the sample preparation steps and laboratory inspections and monthly qa qc meetings a monthly report is prepared detailing qa qc performance to support the mineral resource estimate there have been 30 standards used not all of which were certified for sulphur the first 16 standards were commercially available standards since 2008 there have been 14 standards used all matrix matched data suggests that during the period between 2007 and 2012 there was a positive bias of between 5 and 20 in sulphide sulphur analysis conducted at lihir laboratory data acquisition compared to standards reference materials this suggests the lihir method during this period reflects a total sulphur assay rather than the sulphide sulphur of the certified reference materials in 2013 alternative sulphide sulphur techniques were introduced at lihir which have improved the method accuracy a further sulphide sulphur methodology improvement was implemented in 2016 with the installation of the leco infrared combustion analytical equipment verification of sampling and assaying all data and interpretative inputs to mineral resource estimates are checked and verified in accordance with a range of newcrest standard operating procedures procedures were also in place for all historical drilling programs at lihir diamond drill core samples are processed in house using a dedicated core processing facility sample preparation and analytical laboratory all resource logging data is automatically uploaded to the resource database via logging notebook computers newcrest employs a centralised resource drill hole database team to check verify and validate new data and to ensure the integrity of the total resource database day to day management of the resource data is undertaken by the database administrator on site using the acquire database system prior to resource estimation a centralised resource team conducts further data checks to ensure data integrity prior to estimation regular internal and external reviews of all geological and mineral resource estimation processes are conducted to check the quality and integrity of these procedures no adjustments have been made to assay data location of data points the grid applied is a local mine grid that has it based on amg zone 56 the original topography surface is a light detection and ranging lidar surface created pre mining mining activities are surveyed each month and incorporated into a topographic surface model for depletion purposes all completed drill hole collars are surveyed by the mine surveyors a variety of methods have been used to measure down hole deviation dip and azimuth including conventional borehole camera electronic single shot and gyroscopic methods the majority of the holes have been surveyed using conventional borehole camera methods data spacing and distribution historical drilling has been nominally on 35m eastings but noting the orebody is generally insensitive to drill orientation due to complex mineralisation events the mineral resource has been classified into indicated and inferred mineral resource after assessing the following factors drill hole spacing only areas drilled to 70m x70m drill density have been classified as indicated resource style of mineralisation and geological continuity data quality and associated qa qc grade continuity and proposed mining selectivity and scale of mining refer section 3 resource classification for further details the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish geological and grade continuity appropriate for mineral resource estimation and classification and supported by historical reconciliation with actual production results samples for estimation purposes have been taken but no physical compositing of samples has occurred during the analysis process orientation of data in relation to geological structure gold mineralisation in the luise caldera is hosted within volcanics intrusives and breccias which have undergone extensive alteration two major alteration episodes have been identified which have destroyed much of the original host rock lithologies and due to this an ore type classification has been developed based largely upon various combinations of alteration hardness the degree of brecciation and or leaching of matrix material and the presence of late stage anhydrite veining the deposit is generally sub horizontal the nature of the mineralisation distribution is such that it is insensitive to drill orientation with a wide variety of orientations having been used diamond holes prior to 2002 are predominantly vertical with angled holes used subsequently to define the mineral resource rc holes completed prior to 2002 used both vertical and angled holes sample security samples were transported from drill site to core shed and to site laboratory all within the operational security zone of the mine sample dispatches are reconciled against laboratory samples received and discrepancies reconciled by geology staff audits or reviews an independent review of assaying and qaqc in september 2012 concluded the historic assay bias for gold has now been rectified at lihir sulphur from sulphide has not been assayed correctly at lihir laboratory during some stages of the life of operation assaying precision for gold is considered consistent with industry standards but lacking for sulphide sulphur overall the quality of the lihir laboratory is now well controlled section 2 reporting of exploration results criteria commentary mineral tenement and land tenure status mining and ore processing operations at lihir are conducted pursuant to a mining development contract with the state of papua new guinea and the related special mining lease and a series of granted mining leases exploration licenses leases for mining purposes and mining easements and associated environmental and other

other parties the first systematic mineral exploration in the area was by the png bureau of mineral resources and the geological survey of png between 1969 and 1974 in their report which was released in 1982 it detailed the hydrothermal alteration and thermal activity on lihir island and suggested that it was a favourable geologic environment for epithermal gold mineralisation the ladolam gold deposit was initially discovered in 1982 by joint venture between kennecott exploration and niugini mining a feasibility study was completed by kennecott mining in march 1992 in the mid 1990 s a joint venture was formed between kennecott mining and rio tinto lihir gold limited lgl was subsequently formed to hold the mining development contract the special mining lease and associated tenure mining operations commenced at lihir in 1997 in 2005 rio tinto sold its interest in lgl then in late 2010 newcrest mining limited acquired lgl by scheme of arrangement geology exploration has identified several adjacent and partly overlapping mineral deposits in the luise caldera which are collectively called the ladolam deposit the principal component deposits are called lienetz minifie coastal and kapit gold mineralisation in the luise caldera is contained in a hydrothermally altered porphyry gold system with the gold hosted in volcanic intrusive and breccias within the caldera two major alteration episodes have been identified which have destroyed much of the original host rock lithologies and due to this an ore type classification has been developed based largely upon various combinations of alteration hardness the degree of brecciation and or leaching of matrix material and the presence of late stage anhydrite veining the majority of the gold is contained in sulphides the limits of the mineralisation have not been completely defined and the deposit remains are open at depth along strike and to the east currently limited by the pacific ocean drill hole information no

resource seaward constraint further work a concept study of mining beyond the current seaward constraint of the mineral resource is required to assess the reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of identified mineralisation outside the current mineral resource seaward constraint section 3 estimation and reporting of mineral resources criteria commentary database integrity data is stored in a sql server database known as acquire assay and geological data are electronically loaded into acquire and the database is replicated in newcrest s centralized database system regular reviews of data quality are conducted by site and corporate teams prior to resource estimation in addition to external reviews site visits the competent person for the lihir mineral resource is part of the operational management team for lihir mine geological interpretation gold mineralisation in the luise caldera is hosted within volcanics intrusives and breccias which have undergone extensive alteration two major alteration episodes have been identified an earlier and deeper porphyry style event resulting in potassic alteration grading laterally into propylitic alteration and a later and higher level epithermal event producing argillic advanced argillic phyllic and lower temperature potassic alteration this intensive alteration has destroyed much of the original host rock lithologies and due to this an ore type classification has been developed based essentially upon various combinations of alteration hardness the degree of brecciation and or leaching of matrix material and the presence of late stage anhydrite veining the ore types are roughly sub horizontal in occurrence and form a fairly consistent vertical sequence of clay rich rock grading into white mica feldspar rock then feldspar biotite and at depth into feldspar biotite anhydrite rock within and at the boundaries of the ore types geological structure is also a major influence on the localization of higher gold grades in the orebodies dimension the maximum extent of the mineral resource is 3km x 1km x 350m the deposit is generally sub horizontal with the reporting of the mineral resource extent limited by a seaward constraint an exploration target known as kapit north east is a seaward extension outside the mineral resource estimation and modelling techniques the lihir resource estimate contains estimates for gold arsenic silver copper carbonate molybdenum and sulphide sulphur gold is the primary economic metal with sulphur and carbonate estimates required for autoclave feed management estimates of minor elements are required to assist with overall plant performance management the estimation for each element was undertaken using the non linear estimation method of localised uniform conditioning luc and is based on an underlying diffusion model where in general grade tends to trend from lower to higher values and vice versa in a relatively continuous way raw data was composited to 12m intervals for gold and all other elements uniform conditioning uc was used to estimate gold and sulphide sulphur within 100x100x12m panels the uc model was converted to a luc model into 20m x 20m x 12m blocks that define the selective mining unit smu ordinary kriging ok was used for the local estimation of density into the smu blocks all other elements arsenic silver copper carbonate molybdenum and calcium were estimated into the smu all elements are estimated independently of each other in 2017 the estimation domains were updated for geologically interpreted fault blocks as well as geometallurgical domains these were assessed and validated using contact analysis nine estimation domains were used for gold used also for sulphide sulphur carbonate silver arsenic copper and molybdenum top cutting of extreme values for each element was done on a domain basis by examining the histogram of data such that the top 1 samples were cut so that they contained approximately 10 or less of total metal for example this ranged from 4 to 30 g t for gold domains the resource estimate is validated via visual geostatistical and production reconciliation methods the december 2017 model is the basis of the lihir december 2020 mineral resource moisture all tonnages are calculated and reported on a dry tonnes basis cut off parameters lihir open pit employs a grade based cut off taking

constraining notional pit shell the lihir deposit is extracted via a large open cut consequently some aspects of the model construction reflect the proposed bulk mining method of open pit mining on 12 m benches with a 20m x 20m selective mining unit metallurgical factors or assumptions gold extraction is by pressure oxidation of ore from a combination of direct feed and flotation feed sources depending on sulphur levels the target sulphur content in slurry to the autoclave is in the range 5 10 to ensure auto thermal operation of the autoclave ore blending and flotation plant operation is undertaken in a manner to maintain feed sulphur content in this range metallurgical test work and operating experience at site has shown that there are four main rock alteration domain groups identified as argillic clay advanced argillic epithermal and porphyry gold recoveries recognise float recovery differences between in situ and stockpile material and overall neutralisation cyanidation adsorption nca recovery formulae reflect oxidation intensity environmental factors or assumptions lihir operations comprise an open pit mine ore processing plant and associated supporting infrastructure higher grade ore is processed via pressure oxidation and carbon in leach cyanidation methods with lower grade ore stockpiled for later processing lihir uses deep sea tailings placement dstp in view of the heavy rainfall typically experienced on niolam island the lack of suitable area for a tailings storage facility and the high seismicity of the region dstp was the preferred tailings placement method for lihir the plant tailings are premixed with sea water within the confines of the mining lease before being placed offshore baseline studies were undertaken prior to the approval by png environmental authorities and commencement of the dstp regular monitoring is undertaken to verify the operational performance of the system and is subject to the regulatory criteria established by the png cepa waste rock from the mine is either used for construction purposes or transported in barges for off shore submarine disposal submarine disposal is carefully planned and controlled to achieve a continuous rill slope along the steeply dipping sea floor and to prevent uncontrolled slumping triggering a rise in water levels the mineral resource assumes the continued use of these waste management processes bulk density all bulk density measurements are carried out in accordance with site standard procedures for specific gravity the physical determination of bulk density is undertaken on solid pieces of core 10cm in length intervals for bulk density determination are selected according to lithology or alteration mineralisation type to best represent certain intervals as defined by the geologist the measurements are performed on site as part of the logging process by geological assistants measurements are generally taken at 50m intervals down hole or more frequently if required this is a dry air method of analysis ordinary kriging ok was used for the local estimation of density into the nine geometallurgical domains classification the in situ mineral

reviews the current mineral resource estimate has been externally reviewed by srk in december 2017 and there were no issues or concerns with the mineral resource inputs process and execution srk concluded that the mineral resource estimate was suitable for reporting in accordance with the requirements of the jorc code 2012 discussion of relative accuracy confidence for an indicated resource it is considered reasonable for the relative uncertainty to be 15 in tonnage grade and metal exclusive of each other i e each variable has to satisfy the criteria for an annual production volume at a

confidence level estimates are only considered for gold as it is the primary economic contributor detailed monthly mine reconciliations have been maintained since production commenced the mine

of the lihir ore reserve involved standard steps of pit optimisation mine design production scheduling and financial modelling factors and assumptions have been determined as part of a prefeasibility level study completed in 2020 or are based on operating experience and performance current mining activity at lihir is via conventional truck and shovel operation with offshore barge disposal of waste rock and land based and in pit stockpiling and reclaim of lower grade ore the current mining activities demonstrate the appropriateness of this mining method as the basis of the ore reserve estimate phase 14a design parameters are tabled below to view an enhanced version of this graphic please visit geotechnical slope parameters are based on the detailed analysis of ground conditions and other factors which influence geotechnical performance within the phase 14a cutback the phase 14a slope design parameters are also based on the assumption that a comprehensive system of soil nails cable anchors mesh shotcreting and depressurisation is used to provide additional support to the final wall configuration during cutback development and that a backfill buttress is used to provide long term support after cutback completion the design parameters are based on current geotechnical experience and a prefeasibility level study for the cutback mining area the lihir resource model utilises luc to estimate block gold content this process allows for ore dilution and recovery to be built into the resource model based on the assumption of the selective mining unit smu as the block size the smu assumption 20m x 20m x 12m is based on the mining fleet size and is consistent with a high mill throughput bulk mining strategy due to the luc approach adopted in the resource model no additional mining dilution or recovery factors have been applied to the ore reserve estimate this assumption is supported by the actual reconciliation between resource model and mill performance at lihir project to date being within an acceptable uncertainty range for the style of mineralisation under consideration the pit optimisation takes into account inferred mineral resource however only measured and indicated resource is reported in the ore reserve estimate the inferred resource represents a small portion of material within the ultimate pit design and both the design and financial model are insensitive to the exclusion of this material the selected mining method requires civil engineered wall support as described above to allow access to the phase 14a orebody the cutback design also requires mining by a fleet of small equipment owing to the narrow ramp configuration required allowances for these activities are included in the preparation of the ore reserve estimate a backfill buttress required for long term support of the final cutback wall prevents mining of some existing reserves inventory metallurgical factors or assumptions the ore reserve estimate is based on a maximum 15 5mtpa comminution rate plant producing gold doré ore processing at lihir involves the main operations of crushing grinding flotation pressure oxidation leaching and electrowinning to recover gold from relatively high grade sulphide feed the lihir process plant utilises proven technology that is widely used in the gold industry for this style of mineralisation the ore processing facility has been operating since it was commissioned in 1996 and upgrades took place during 2011 2012 comminution circuit operating optimisations and minor upgrades are planned to achieve a 15 5mtpa plant capacity the metallurgical recovery assumption for ore feed to the autoclave is dependent on the gold and sulphide sulphur grades and dependent on sulphur to calcium ratio and proportion of aged stockpile feed for flotation material overall metallurgical recovery is reconciled with historic production data laboratory test samples for stockpiled ore and reflects a partial oxidation metallurgical operating strategy average life of mine gold recovery is modelled to be 81 82 the potential impact of the presence of low concentrations of copper on leaching efficiency and cyanide consumption has been assessed and is not considered an issue for the ore reserve estimate copper levels are generally below 500ppm and historical performance indicates that levels below 1000ppm show no material impact environmental lihir open pit is an operating mine and has been granted an environmental permit for the mining of the phase 14a cutback infrastructure the lihir operation is an operating mine and has the necessary infrastructure in place for its continued operation costs capital and operating costs have been determined as part of the prefeasibility study based on estimated operating costs for a drilling shotcreting and cable bolt installation program reserve cost estimates are considered to be pre feasibility level provision has also been made for capital expenditure required for a fleet of smaller mining equipment suited to the cutback access configuration life of cutback non sustaining capital is estimated in the range of us 60 70 million no cost impact is expected from deleterious elements it has therefore not been necessary to include additional costs relating to minor elements when preparing the ore reserve estimate transport and refining charges have been developed from first principles consistent with the application and input assumptions for these costs used by the current operation refining charges and transport costs are estimated to average us 2 24 oz of gold a royalty of 2 0 of gold revenue net of refining and transport costs is divided between federal provincial governments and local level governments and landowners a mining levy of 0 5 net of refining and transport costs is also applied in the preparation of this reserve estimate revenue factors long term metal prices and exchange rate assumptions adopted in the december 2020 reserve estimation process are us 1 300 oz for gold at a aud usd exchange rate of 0 75 these assumptions are consistent with newcrest metal price guideline for december 2020 ore reserve period market assessment newcrest is a price taker and gold is sold on the open market and subject to price fluctuations supply and demand for gold from lihir is not a constraint in the estimation of the ore reserve economic the ore reserve has been evaluated through a financial model all operating and capital costs as well as revenue factors stated in this document were included in the financial model this process demonstrated the lihir ore reserve to have a positive npv sensitivities have been conducted on the key input parameters of costs and recovery which confirm the estimate to be robust the npv range has not been provided as newcrest considers this to be commercially sensitive information social engagement with landowners for affected blocks within the cutback footprint and the local community was undertaken through a series of meetings in conjunction with the mineral resources authority mra approval for the project has been endorsed by block executives as documented in the engagement meeting minutes environmental permitting for the phase 14a project has been assessed and approved by cepa other lihir gold limited and the lihir open pit are in material compliance with all

addition on 19 august 2021 the company released cadia pc1 2 pre feasibility study delivers attractive returns newcrest managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said newcrest is in an enviable position with four exciting pfs stage organic growth projects the projections generated by the pfs studies for these projects indicate compelling rates of return and a material improvement in operating margin and cash flow these projects target a 37 increase in copper output and a reduction in our already low all in sustaining cost per ounce by more than 50 over the next decade with the majority of new investment in tier 1 jurisdictions the progression of these studies is consistent with our long term strategy of pursuing profitable growth in a safe and sustainable manner from a portfolio of long life high quality assets optimised through innovation and creativity our ability to identify and maximise value from these organic growth options is supported by our best in class technical expertise especially in deep underground mining where we have a strong track record the projected growth profile of our copper production is particularly exciting and would allow us not just to advance our own sustainability objectives but to participate in the potential opportunities presented by a global shift to decarbonisation while newcrest is primarily a gold company we will continue to have a substantial and increasing exposure to copper a commodity we believe has a compelling growth outlook beyond the base case projections generated by the pfs studies released today we continue to evaluate and progress opportunities to extract the full potential of these growth projects an example of this is east ridge at red chris which is not included in the current red chris pfs but could be incorporated into later studies at havieron the pfs is based on ore reserves of 14mt and does not consider 37mt of inferred mineral resource so there is considerable upside potential for a larger scale operation of more than 3 million tonnes per annum from further exploration success and the ongoing assessment of higher throughput rate options we will also progress other organic projects in the portfolio such as the potential for further open pit and underground opportunities at telfer to extend its life and supplement production from havieron in fy24 and beyond the development of wafi golpu and potentially namosi all of these options and further exploration success elsewhere represent upside potential to the base case outlook presented today we intend to fund and deliver each project through internal cash flow and prudent use of our strong balance sheet and our dividend policy remains unchanged said mr biswas newcrest s pathway to 2030 significant improvement in unit costs sustained gold output and growing copper production in tier 1 jurisdictions the findings of the red chris havieron lihir phase 14a and cadia pc1 2 studies combined with the

by newcrest to represent a stage 1 case for red chris long term future being based solely on the initial mineral resource as currently defined upside exists from further exploration success and definition of the deposit including east ridge with the mineralisation open in both directions as shown below25 to view an enhanced version of this graphic please visit an area of current focus is the potential acceleration of mining of the high grade pods at red chris which is subject to a separate study further analysis of the inclusion of next generation mining systems including single pass cave establishment and the use of electric power to offset diesel in the mining process will be undertaken havieron the pfs is considered to represent a conservative interim or stage 1 case as the havieron pfs currently considers only the indicated mineral resource which is a small portion of the existing resource inventory and excludes inferred mineral resources ongoing infill drilling as well as further study work is expected to increase this with continued exploration success the project could increase in scope and scale from 2mtpa an enhanced development option for havieron considers increasing mining and milling rates to 3mtpa or higher compared to the 2mtpa assumption upon which the pfs has been based further resource growth might also support the use of alternative mining methods which may lower operating costs some of the upside potential of havieron is illustrated by the diagram below that shows the current initial mineral resource on which the pfs is based relative to the total mineralisation and target exploration areas this does not include some of the potential associated with breccia zones and other new zones recently intercepted to view an enhanced version of this graphic please visit telfer other than a very small amount in fy24 from fy24 onwards the production profiles in this release and the havieron pfs release show havieron feed only and do not include ongoing ore feed from telfer there is potential for other ore sources at or near telfer to supplement the havieron ore feed in fy24 and beyond newcrest remains focused on extending the telfer mines current life beyond fy24 building on the recent commencement of the west dome stage 5 cutback further open pit extensional opportunities are being assessed in addition a number of near mine extensional underground targets are being drilled there is also work underway to test whether there is a potential caving opportunity for a lower grade stockwork area between the existing sublevel cave and the western flanks mine area specific areas of interest include an extension of west dome stage 5 towards the east and at depth other potential incremental cutbacks in the west dome pit diamond drilling to extend existing mine areas around the m reefs and a reefs drilling the area around the recently identified lower limey unit south east mineralisation to further extend the resource and reserve assessment of a stockwork target area known as kylo for potential cave mining drilling of the vertical stockwork corridor below the current sub level caving operation to determine amenability to bulk underground mining methodologies newcrest has exploration farm ins and joint ventures with parties who have prospective tenements proximate to telfer namely the wilki project with antipa minerals and the juri juri jv with greatland gold in respect of which an exploration programme is in progress financial capability newcrest s financial objectives are to meet all of its financial obligations maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand cash flow volatility be able to invest capital in value creating opportunities and to provide returns to shareholders newcrest is in an excellent position to progress execution of these projects if and when approved to execution following completion of the feasibility stage given its strong balance sheet and access to liquidity at 30 june 2021 newcrest was in a 176m net cash position comprising 1 873m of cash holdings less 1 635m of capital market debt and lease liabilities of 62m newcrest s next scheduled capital market debt repayment of 650m is not due until fy30 newcrest has committed unsecured bilateral bank lending facilities with 13 bank lenders for a total of us 2bn which were undrawn on 30 june 2021 newcrest targets maintaining an investment grade credit rating and is currently rated investment grade by s p bbb stable and moody s baa2 stable subject to market and operating conditions newcrest expects its projected total operating cash flow over the period fy22 30 to exceed its projected total investing cash flows including the major project capital expenditures associated with the pfs s over the same period if required newcrest will draw on its cash balances and or bank facilities as necessary current projections suggest that this draw down of cash and or bank balances will be limited in both amount and duration finally newcrest reiterates that its dividend policy remains unchanged targeting a dividend payment in respect of each financial year of at least 30 60 of that year s free cashflow with a minimum dividend of us 15 cents per share this provides shareholders with a dividend return while maintaining reinvestment options and balance sheet strength key milestones and estimated

study stage 1 the study has been completed and the newcrest board has approved the progression of the study to the feasibility stage the havieron project the project is located 45km east of newcrest s existing telfer operation and is a high grade low capital intensity project with significant expansion potential newcrest has adopted a staged approach to the evaluation and development of havieron aiming to deliver early production and cash flows from the project while work continues to define potential resource additions and assess growth targets the benefit of existing processing capacity at telfer and ongoing definitional drilling highlights the clear potential for a larger scale operation that will be further assessed during the feasibility stage newcrest managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said it is an incredible achievement that within two years of starting the havieron drilling program we have been able to deliver this significant project milestone and demonstrate financial returns that comfortably exceed our hurdle rate even in this first stage the pre feasibility study underpins an initial ore reserve estimate for the upper section of the south east crescent zone which increases our confidence in achieving first production in fy24 and triggers our entitlement to a cumulative 70 joint venture interest we believe that this is just the first stage of a bright and profitable future for havieron our extensive drilling program continues to assess the extent of the south east crescent zone and further test the northern and eastern breccia for mineralisation which may be suitable for bulk mining methods we have recently delivered several new and exciting high grade intercepts which extend the high grade mineralisation beneath the initial mineral resource estimate and highlights the potential for further resource growth notably the study assumes that havieron is the sole ore feed for the telfer plant and does not assume any potential upside from the extension of telfer s mine life beyond fy24 we continue to assess the potential for further open pit and underground opportunities at telfer to extend its life and supplement

with paste to maintain the overall stability of the opening and enable mining of adjacent stopes this method is typically applied to strong orebodies that require minimal support and are surrounded by strong country rock such as the havieron deposit stopes are mined in a checkerboard fashion with all primary stopes first followed by the intermediate secondary stopes the mining sequence is top down overall divided into a number of different lifts separated by horizontal sill levels which are recovered after the upper and lower level have been mined and filled a sub level spacing of 50m with sill drill levels located 20m below each mining front was selected some sub level spacings are increased to 60m to accommodate the inclusion of ore and minimising additional level development the design consists of nine semi independent mining sequences based on both horizontal and vertical mining fronts the horizontal fronts are determined by the orebody orientations as outlined in figure 4 figure 4

via road trains on an all weather unsealed road the road has been designed to withstand a 1 in a 100 year flood event and maintain access to havieron power will be supplied to havieron from telfer s existing gas power station via a 66 kilovolt kv overhead line running parallel to the nominated haul road corridor further opportunities to replace this with non fossil fuel power generation as part of newcrest s emission reduction program will be evaluated as part of the feasibility study telfer currently operates two processing trains with a total capacity of 22mtpa the havieron ore is expected to be processed through a modified telfer processing plant which will operate a single train at 6mtpa rate on a campaign basis the plant modifications are expected to include magnetic separation within the flotation circuit to reduce the amount of pyrrhotite in the final cu concentrate and a carbon in pulp cip circuit on the flotation tail and cyanide detoxification circuit the expected cost

between the crescent zone and the breccia zones with semi soft boundaries used between the breccia zones kriging neighbourhood analysis was used to define the search neighbourhood for gold and copper gold and copper were estimated independently of each other composite copper and gold grades were capped prior to estimation the resource estimation is based entirely on interpolation the resource model was validated via visual statistical and geostatistical methods reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction have been assessed through ongoing mining and processing studies which

estimation and reporting of mineral resources criteria commentary database integrity data are stored in a sql acquire database assay and geological data are electronically loaded into acquire and the database is replicated in newcrest s centralised database system in melbourne in built validation tools are used in the acquire database and data loggers are used to minimise keystroke errors flag potential errors and validate against internal library codes regular reviews of data quality are conducted by site and corporate teams prior to resource estimation final surveyed collars are checked against the original collar gps pickup and the lidar topographic surface downhole surveys are checked visually and statistically for outliers assay data is checked for negative extreme missing and overlapping samples below detection assay values are set to half the lower detection limit for estimation geological domains are reviewed against core photography geochemistry and corescan data and checked for overlaps and missing intervals data that is found to be in error is investigated and corrected where possible if the data cannot be corrected it is removed from the data set used for resource modelling and estimation site visits the competent person for the indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource estimate is an employee of newcrest and is based in telfer the competent person has remained closely linked with the project at all stages and has completed numerous site inspections on a regular basis with the last visit completed in 2021 the competent person has reviewed the drilling sampling sample security drill logging and data management and is satisfied with the quality of the measures undertaken geological interpretation the geology model is based on grouped primary logging domain codes interpreted from drill cores 3d solids were modelled in leapfrog geo 6 1 using vein intrusive and erosional implicant models the geology model for the havieron deposit comprises a cover sequence and a basement sequence of variably mineralised and altered metasediments the cover sequence consists of 7 sub horizontal units ascribed to the permian whilst the basement sequence consists of the crescent zone that typically comprises of the massive sulphides including locally banded pyrrhotite or chalcopyrite calcite cemented breccia actinolite cemented breccia crackle breccia and the post mineralisation dolerite dyke mineralisation in havieron is hosted in the crescent and to a lesser extent within the cemented breccia s calcite cemented and actinolite cemented breccia these units are therefore used as estimation domains the confidence in the geological volumes that were used to define the estimation domains is reflected in the mineral resource classification dimension variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation are observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and 1000m in vertical extent below 420m of cover the se crescent zone mineral resource extents are 550m in unfolded plan section between 5 40m true width and 750m in vertical extent mineralisation remains open at depth the breccia mineral resource extents occurs as a 50 100m sleeve around the se crescent mineral resource and also a 250x50x300 nw trending zone in the north western half on the breccia complex northern breccia which remains open at depth and to the northwest estimation and modelling techniques geostatistical testing of the gold and copper grade distributions showed that the breccia zones are moderately diffusive in nature and the crescent zone is relatively weakly diffusive in nature even though the crescent zone is weakly diffusive in nature the estimation method of ok is considered appropriate due to the consideration of the geological setting geological observation from the logging data and the geometry of the domain all drillhole samples were composited to 5 metre intervals downhole and honouring the domain boundary ok estimation of gold copper sulphur iron cobalt bismuth arsenic lead zinc and nickel was undertaken into 10 m x 10 m x 10 m blocks for the crescent zone and 20 m x 20 m x 20 m blocks for the breccia with discretisation of 4 x 4 x 4 a single pass run was conducted for gold copper sulphur iron and cobalt estimate and two passes were conducted for bismuth arsenic lead zinc and nickel estimates the minimum and maximum number of informing composites were 10 and between 20 to 24 respectively depending on the domain and variable being estimated due to the highly skewed nature of the grade distribution a grade capping strategy has been applied for variables including au cu co bi as pb zn and ni caps are typically around the value at a 99th percentile of distributions the model grades were estimated in isatis software gold and copper were the only revenue generating elements no recovery of by products has been assumed variables were estimated independently the block size was chosen on the basis of estimation quality and likely scale of mining the block model used for interpolators was populated with local rotations for the crescent zone and the calcite breccia zone based on the orientation of the mineralisation including the high grade structurally control zone with a hard boundary applied between domains the entire resource is based on interpolation of grades the model has been validated via visual statistical and geostatistical method including statistical comparison metal at risk analysis swath plots global change of support discrete gaussian modelling comparison and visual comparison of the drillholes and the blocks by sections and plan views the model assumes the likelihood of a selective mining method for the crescent zone moisture all tonnages are calculated and reported on a dry tonnes basis cut off parameters a value algorithm is used to calculate the nsr for each block using revenue and cost assumptions as of july 2020 the nsr calculation takes account revenue factors metallurgical recovery assumptions outlined below transport costs and refining charges and royalty charges with the gold price of us 1 400 per ounce copper price of us 3 40 per pound and a 0 75 aud usd exchange rate the indicated mineral resource was defined based on a threshold of a 100 t within the se crescent zone a smoothed shell was generated based on a threshold of a 50 t and includes internal below value cut off blocks and excludes isolated above cut off blocks applied for the definition of the inferred mineral resources both indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources are representing the limit of reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction the a 100 t cut off for indicated mineral resources and a 50 t cut off for inferred mineral resources are based on newcrest s experience at its nearby telfer operation its current understanding of the havieron deposit and other benchmarked operations mining factors or assumptions the indicated mineral resource estimate is reported based on the a 100 t nsr value cut off and the average weighted distance of 45metres within the se crescent zone based on mining selective mining the inferred mineral resource estimate is reported within a notional constraining shell based on an a 50 t nsr value cut off based on bulk mining and therefore all internal materials are reported within the constraining shell the current proposal is to potentially commence mining the high grade crescent zone by underground slos metallurgical factors or assumptions havieron underground ore will be processed on a campaign basis through the telfer train 2 treatment plant circuit at a throughput of approximately 2mtpa metal recovery will be through conventional flotation to produce a copper gold concentrate and doré through a newly installed flotation tails leach circuit the technology associated with the ore processing is conventional and the flowsheet is similar to that utilised by other operations metallurgical recovery assumptions are based on detailed analysis and laboratory flotation and leach test work completed on 38 variability samples during the havieron concept 2020 and pre feasibility 2021 studies with good spatial coverage of the se crescent zone of the 38 samples 8 samples are located in the breccia zones and 30 samples are located in the se crescent zone of which 21 samples are located within the se crescent zone indicated mineral resources based on these samples metallurgical recoveries for gold are anticipated to average approximately 88 and recoveries of copper are expected to average approximately 84 throughout the life of the project bismuth is the key deleterious element for the gold copper concentrate product with smelter penalties incurred on the basis of bismuth content the impact of bismuth in concentrate will be managed by mine sequencing and concentrate blending bulk sample or pilot scale test work has not been undertaken environmental factors or assumptions as havieron is a brownfields project the potential environmental impact assessments are not well advanced however the assumption is that there will be no significant impediments to conventional waste management of rock and tailings as utilised at newcrest s telfer operations based on the similarities between the havieron and telfer deposits bulk density all bulk density measurements have been carried out in accordance with site standard procedure and used a standard water immersion method intervals for bulk density determination are selected according to lithology alteration mineralisation type to best represent certain intervals as defined by the geologist the measurements are performed on site by geologists or geological assistants as part of the logging process measurements are based on 10 cm to 20 cm lengths generally taken at 10 metre to 50 metre intervals down hole bulk density from several thousand measurements was estimated into the block model by an inverse distance method on a domain wise basis classification the mineral resource estimate has been classified as an indicated mineral resource and an inferred mineral resource the resource classification is based on drillhole spacing and geological and grade continuity including the assessment of average weighted distance of informing samples the indicated mineral resource estimate is classified within the se crescent zone only with a nominal drill spacing less than 45m x 45m the inferred mineral resource estimate is classified within a nominal drill spacing less than 100m x 100m and the contiguous footprint of the reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction the indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource classifications appropriately reflects the view of the competent person audits or reviews derisk geomining consultants conducted an independent review of the previous havieron underground mineral resource estimate november 2020 and concluded that the estimate has been prepared using accepted industry practice has been completed in accordance with the jorc code guidelines is suitable for preparing a public report documenting the mineral resource estimate some responses and actions were noted from this review and have been included in this updated estimate discussion of relative accuracy confidence the uncertainty of the geological domain at the upper part of se crescent is considered between moderate to low the grade uncertainty of the indicated classification of the se crescent zone is supported by the 15 variability at 90 confidence interval of the mining rate 2 3mtpa derived from the conditional simulation the breccia is considered inferred mineral resources and reflects the wide spaced drilling where the geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade continuity thus it is deemed not necessary to assess the relative uncertainty in tonnage grade and metal over a production volume for inferred mineral resources there is no production data for havieron section 4 estimation and reporting of ore reserves

passengers arriving in singapore must undergo a pre departure pcr covid 19 test last week singapore made a major announcement that it will reopen its borders to visitors from another 9 countries without the need for quarantine since september 8 travellers from brunei and germany which were on a trial of the singapore vaccinated travel lane vtl already enjoy quarantine free entry to singapore starting october 19 vaccinated travellers from another six european countries denmark france italy the netherlands spain and the united kingdom and those from the united states of america and canada will join visitors from germany and brunei on the singapore vtl scheme people travelling from south korea will be able to enter singapore quarantine free from november 15 to be considered travelling from vtl countries visitors must have stayed in these countries for 14 consecutive days before their trip they are allowed to be in multiple vtl countries or transit through these countries during this time those travelling on the vtl scheme must fly on a vtl designated flight which are mainly operated by singapore airlines and lufthansa from germany at the moment other carriers will be added in due course in addition travellers will be required to show proof of having been fully vaccinated against covid 19 with vaccines that are on the who world health organisation emergency use list residents of singapore or the eu who were previously unvaccinated and had recovered from a past covid 19 infection are considered fully vaccinated if they have received at least one dose of an approved vaccine passengers arriving in singapore must undergo a pre departure pcr polymerase chain reaction covid 19 test within 48 hours of flight departure and take another test on arrival at changi airport non residents of singapore must also apply for a vaccinated travel pass vrp online between seven and 30 days prior to the intended entry into singapore furthermore short term visitors must purchase travel insurance with a minimum coverage of sgd 30 000 usd 22 000 for covid 19 related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs prior to travel to singapore during the vtl pilot which lasted about a month out of the 1 926 people who visited singapore from germany and brunei only 2 tested positive on the day of the announcement singapore prime minister lee hsien loong addressed the nation to explain why singapore is reopening aggressively and to placate people who are worried that this may lead to new waves of infection he said singapore cannot stay locked down and closed off indefinitely it would not work and it would be very costly we would be unable to resume our lives participate in social activities open our borders and revive our economy companies and investors need to carry out regional and global business from singapore people working for them need to travel to earn a living students need to go on overseas attachments and internships although singapore has seen the number of covid 19 cases soar to record levels recently with an average of almost 3 200 cases per day in the last week the number of those who have become seriously ill is low at two per cent only two out of every thousand needed intensive care treatment or have died due to a vaccination rate of about 85 per cent of the total population about 98 per cent of those who catch covid 19 in singapore have mild or no symptoms the accelerated border opening will be widely welcomed by the tourism industry which saw a trickle of leisure visitors since covid 19 struck in 2019 the last full year before the pandemic singapore had 19 1 million visitors and tourism accounted for about four per cent of gdp raking in usd 27 1 billion of receipts unfortunately the singapore vtl at the moment does not cover visitors from china indonesia and india the top three countries from which visitors came in 2019 together they accounted for almost 43 percent of all visitors to singapore that year 1 42 million indians visited singapore in 2019 up till now the national carrier singapore airlines with no domestic market has been operating at about 30 per cent of pre covid passenger capacity it is also suffering financially and was forced to raise money in the financial markets to the tune of about usd15 billion earlier in the week echoing singapore s approach in dealing with covid 19 as an endemic disease the international air transport association iata urged governments to implement simplified regimes to manage the risks of covid 19 as borders reopen to international travel it argued that travellers are not adding to the risk to the local population quoting data from the uk which has one of the most liberal stance on visitors entering the country it said that fewer than 250 people have tested positive per day out of the three million passengers which arrived between february and august in its october 4 news release it cited a recent survey of the top 50 travel markets which accounted for 92 percent of global air traffic pointing to the urgent need for the simplification of the various measures governments are using to manage the risks of covid 19 the organisation believes that wildly inconsistent covid 19 travel restrictions are stalling the recovery of air transport travel restrictions bought governments time to respond in the early days of the pandemic nearly two years later that rationale no longer exists covid 19 is present in all parts of the world travel restrictions are a complex and confusing web of rules with very little consistency among them and there is little evidence to support ongoing border restrictions and the economic havoc they create said willie walsh iata s director general except for the headline this story has not been

return on investment establish a budget for financing and forecasting of the project moving forward the overall capital cost of phase i of the project is estimated to be 202 million staged over 17 months of construction this has been a high quality effort by the westwater team samuel engineering dorfner anzaplan and harper said chris jones president and ceo of westwater the result is a first quality facility well timed to take advantage of surging demand for lithium ion batteries and the graphite that makes them work the move to make these batteries in the us from domestic sources makes the coosa graphite project even more important we could not be more pleased with this effort and result the role of se and the three third party technology providers are noted below samuel engineering organize coordinate and develop the overall dfs to interconnect the equipment designed and supplied by the three third technology providers and provide any remaining balance of plant design and components required for a fully operational facility anzaplan engineer and design of the chemical purification process spherical purified graphite spg and sodium hydroxide recovery and wastewater treatment for the chemical purification process the purification process involves caustic roasting caustic leaching acidic leaching and drying spg an intermediate product that is later coated to make coated spherical purified graphite cspg requires a staged milling operation consisting of size reduction micronizing milling and shaping spheronizing harper design and pricing for two 2 vertical furnaces used in the thermal purification process the dfs pertains to phase i of the project westwater plans to develop the project site in two phases phases i and ii a plan and design for phase ii is in place at a pre feasibility level pfs and economics are presented for both of the phases a third phase involving the development of the coosa graphite deposit near the kellyton site is under consideration project development plan phase i beginning in early 2023 the project is expected to begin processing approximately 8 050 metric tons mt per year of graphite concentrate feedstock is anticipated to be supplied from outside sources until at least 2028 after processing and purification approximately 7 500 mt of two products would be available in the following quantities cspg 3 700 mt per year fine products from spg milling 3 800 mt per year phase ii the feedstock processing capacity of the project is anticipated to increase to approximately 35 200 mt per year in 2024 upon completion of phase ii after processing and purification approximately 32 400 mt of two products will be available in the following quantities cspg 15 800 mt per year fine products from spg milling 16 600 mt per year project location the property for the project is located within the lake martin regional industrial park south of the town of kellyton in coosa county alabama and consists of approximately 73 acres please see our press release dated june 22 2021 for more detail the nearest large population center is alexander city which lies approximately 5 miles southeast of the project site proprietary technology westwater has been working with third party technology providers and equipment suppliers to develop the processes for purifying graphite to 99 95 cg and then processing that graphite into battery grade coated spherical purified graphite the result has been a unique environmentally safe process utilizing relatively low temperatures and readily available industrial reagents westwater believes that this process for which wwr has made a patent application is superior to processes used in china and elsewhere in terms of environmental safety phase i of the project is designed to process 8 050 metric tons per year of graphite community benefits construction and operation of the proposed graphite processing facility is expected to result in a positive effect on the socioeconomic characteristics of the regional area westwater projects that the majority of beneficial effects will result from the employment of over 100 persons once the project is in operation project execution summary in the dfs samuel engineering has developed a level 2 execution schedule encompassing engineering procurement construction and start up of phase i of the project the total estimated timeframe for construction of phase i is estimated to be 17 months made up of the four overlapping components below detailed design procurement construction commissioning and startup estimate accuracy and contingency analysis the estimate in the dfs has been developed to a level sufficient to assess evaluate the project s concept various development options and overall viability after inclusion of the recommended contingency and excluding any scope changes the capital cost estimate for phase i is considered to have a level of accuracy in the range of 10 to 15 contingency is an allowance to cover unforeseen costs that may arise during the execution of the project which reside within the scope of work but cannot be explicitly defined or described at the time of the estimate due to lack of more detailed information it is assumed that contingency will be spent however it does not cover any project scope changes or exclusions within the dfs the contingency allowance has been assessed by considering the quality of scope definition takeoff quantities and pricing obtained for each major commodity of the estimate each component is assigned a percentage rate based on the best judgment of the project team in recognition of the degree of detail on which the estimate is based a contingency of 14 6 has been included in the capital cost estimate for both phase i and ii economic evaluation the economic viability of the project was evaluated by developing an economic model model the model was prepared on an annual basis for the project duration which includes phase i and phase ii of the project phase i consists of the coosa plant producing 3 700 mt per year of cspg the subject of the dfs phase ii consists of an expanded plant producing 15 800 mt per year of cspg pfs level estimate the model incorporated the annual figures for the feed purchase operating costs revenues from the sale of graphite products as well as the capital expenditures based on the input parameters the model calculates the annual pre tax cash flows net present value npv of the project based on 8 discount rate npv 8 and the internal rate of return irr two cases were evaluated by the model in the first case the model only included the phase i of the project in the second case the overall project economics were evaluated by adding phase ii to the model the results for both cases are summarized below case i phase i only this case assumes the project has a capacity of using 8 050 mt natural graphite feedstock to produce approximately 3 700 mt cspg per year will operate for 35 years project duration 35 years pre tax npv 8 percent 119 million irr 15 annual pre tax cash flow after the year 2025 24 million per year project pre tax cash flow 656 million case ii phase i
