identified 120 million euros of potential acquisitions in its current markets which fit within such strategy and that could close in 2021 however the reit has not yet entered into any agreements in connection with such acquisitions and there is no certainty any such acquisitions will be completed structure by the end of 2022 the manager intends to either acquire or dispose of current joint ventures in accordance with their respective agreements in an attempt to simplify its corporate structure and governance the reit s preference will be to acquire new properties as wholly owned assets

profit generated from any such sales the board of trustees announced it will begin the participatory distribution program with a special distribution of 10 million to be paid with the regular june distribution on july 15 2021 this is based on 50 of the current cash attributable to sales over ifrs fair market value on the vanves and rueil properties and represents 0 307 per unit the reit expects additional properties including jeuneurs to be included in the asset recycling plan in which case not less than half of after tax realized cash would be distributed in all instances remaining proceeds will be deployed in affo accretive acquisition opportunities in accordance with the above noted investment strategy regular monthly distribution the special committee also performed a review of the sustainability of the reit s current regular monthly distribution taking into consideration current cash flow stability and deployment of the capital on its balance sheet for accretive acquisitions it

amended and restated management agreement effective april 1 2021 with a term nding march 31 2023 subject to an additional one year extension the board of trustees and inovalis sa also agreed that given its relative size the reit will aim to internalize the finance functions on or before april 1 2022 other key features of the revised management agreement include strong incentive for the manager to reduce g a and outsourced services including off sets scalable charges for g a expenses in excess of budgeted amounts and incentive payments to management where actual annual g a expenses are significantly less than the budgeted expenses for that year from january 1 2021 until the completion of the internalization the manager will reimburse the reit half of all costs for the finance function and the asset management fee will be reduced by cad 500 000 once the internalization of the finance function is completed and the reit has an option to fully internalize management once a

skip to comments i m old enough to remember when amazon com only sold books posted on by samadams76 back in the mid 1990s the internet was still a very new thing and not everybody even used a web browser there were still many using archie gopher ftp telnet usenet etc and that was only the geeks most people had no clue about the online world and if they did they were using mainstream services like prodigy owned by sears compuserve and america online to get that interactive online experience at several dollars an hour on a phone line the first browser was called mosaic and it eventually morphed into netscape navigator both of which are mostly forgotten today but it did make some guy whose first name is marc and whose last name is hard to spell a billionaire this would have been 1993 or 1994 around that time people were starting to learn about urls and magazine advertisements started having these curious looking words at the bottom that always began it was called the worldwide web by some but what exactly was the worldwide web back in the mid 1990s well it was partly academic type sites with obscure articles on the works of epicurus the greek philosopher and also rumination on the deeper meanings of nirvana and pearl jam songs written by pimply faced 17 year olds but really the world wide web at the time was this immense wasteland of personal websites in which mostly young people posted every minute detail of their insignificant lives which was a precursor to the kind of inane vanity later to be seen on social media sites like myspace and facebook so that was how things existed on the internet back in the mid 1990s sidenote free republic would be launched in late 1996 and the html has hardly changed so around that 1996 timeframe i was reading my copy of pc computing or maybe it was wired and i learned of a website that was selling books basically the idea was you browsed the website for a book and if you saw something you liked you would click on it and purchase it right then and there you would enter your credit card information right there on the website an utterly reckless idea at the time and the book would be delivered right to your house a few days later it was only about 25 years ago back then it was almost sacrilegious to use the world wide web for commerce but amazon did it pretty much first they quickly expanded their selection to hundreds of thousands of books and not only that they started posting reviews of said books by people who bought them i was addicted from almost day one i still remember the very first book i purchased on amazon it was pillars of the earth by ken follett it arrived just 3 days later in a cardboard box and there were free bookmarks included as well as a letter urging me to review the whole experience on the fledging website that was amazon in quick order amazon expanded into music and video as well and it became my go to site to order music as well and eventually dvds now amazon is the everything store and if i want to order a box of bronze 9 x 2 25 wood screws why i can have them in my mailbox by thursday ditto for that weird looking piece that will fix my dishwasher if i guessed the right part yeah i know most people here hate amazon today and i did cancel my amazon prime when aws helped to shut down the parler site earlier this year but that was one hell of a company back in the day customer service was impeccable i remember ordering a set of bach cantatas and one of the discs was duplicated meaning i was missing one of the cds amazon immediately sent me an entire new set never even asking for the old set back and giving me a 10 gift card for future purchases along with a letter of apology anyway i did like amazon back in the day topics history keywords to samadams76 amazon sold from the books in print catalog same as any brick and mortar could do for you if you d only walked up to the counter and special ordered a book they didn t actually stock all of those titles they just listed them and would backorder quite a few of them if you placed an order to a fool in paradise true but i didn t have to drive to a store by 3 posted onby samadams76 give me a pigfoot and a bottle of beer to samadams76 i could have bought amazon for 18 00 a share my reply they sell books what else could they sell yeah i know to samadams76 i m old enough to remember when to buy a book meant going to a bookstore and seeing what they had small bookstores were for that reason a pleasure i m also old enough to remember the first emails i ever got and sent grad school and two elderly professors picked it up very quickly and when the internet meant telnet or ftp how exciting it was to be able to read a newspaper from akron online via telnet to samadams76 i bought books from amazon starting in 1998 you could search for anything and get it the selection and convenience was decisive to samadams76 the first browser was called mosaic and it eventually morphed into netscape navigator both of which are mostly forgotten today mosaic was the first gui based browser there were text based browsers before that the most sophisticated was a browser called lynx and i believe it is still being maintained to this day i ran lynx on a vax workstation back in the day to hambone 1934 i lost that opportunity too to buy amazon stock early on at the time i thought it was a foolish investment as amazon was losing money for years and years many thought they would never turn a profit and eventually go the way of cmgi or pets com oh well by 8 posted onby samadams76 give me a pigfoot and a bottle of beer to samadams76 i still find it amazing that sears did not pursue the strategy used by amazon sears had everything in stock or in a warehouse and the ability to deliver after all people had been ordering from their catalogs for over 100 years sears could have crushed amazon in the early years to default user i agree and much has been written on how sears had the golden opportunity to take over internet commerce imagine if they had only just posted their immense telephone book sized catalog online back in the mid 1990s by 10 posted onby samadams76 give me a pigfoot and a bottle of beer to samadams76 i love amazon it has been my lifeline to deal with aftermath of surgery also to get ready for it i dont care what bezos does or believes his company has really helped me and when there was a problem with a delivery they accomodated me by either a courtesy gift card or total refund of product and let me keep it i needed some stuff same day delivery amazon was the only way to get it to samadams76 the nineties was a funny time for online commerce i remember listing a guitar on a used gear website called daddy s junky music this was before ebay the buyer responded with an email asking for pictures which i took with a disposable film camera and had developed at one of those kiosks and then snail mailed to him to samadams76 i remember using half com by 13 posted onby bloodandgravy demand for racism is outpacing supply to samadams76 i do recall the bbs it was just kinda neat by 14 posted onby eyedigress trump is my president to samadams76 i remember when mtv played music videos to samadams76 blockbuster could have swatted netflix like a fly but their execs laughed when netflix offered to sell to blockbuster for a tiny sum to samadams76 the first search engine that i used was world wide web worm to dfwgator here is your money for nothin by 18 posted onby eyedigress trump is my president to samadams76 ahh the days of america online using the phone line to get online and my daughter would pick up the phone and i d get disconnected to samadams76 a guy i knew graduated from ohio state computer science he went to work for compuserve which was north of columbus and just starting out around late 80 s early 90 s i can t remrber the exact story but he was offerred stock but took money instead later cs bought out by aol when aol was something many of the employees there he knew retired as multi millionaires in their 30 s and 40 s in the tech bubble of the late 90s i remember amazon stock at 2 3 share when it dropped after the ipo disclaimer

as an asset your supplier is blurred into your daily operation with a common focus on success the supplier fully understands that their success is based on how successful you become within the market as an expense the customer is constantly beating on the supplier for a better and lower price ultimately the situation distills down to trust and whether value is truly visible this is where the first segregation transpires by defining the difference between a vendor and a supplier a vendor is someone you conduct a transactional exchange with like the purchase of peanuts from the street vendor you may not have much of a relationship with the vendor other than the consistency of ongoing transactions or geographic location but it is likely something easy to find an alternate or substitution for if you cannot access it a supplier is someone instrumental to your success they bring to your equation a unique product technology or service when we treat our supplier as an expense it has several visible attributes we will never trust our supplier makes us constantly be searching for a better cheaper source makes us not pay our supplier on time ever even after we dictate extended payment terms makes us never acknowledge their contribution to our business consistent quality is a given once we have a low price it makes us negotiate an even lower price advertisement the result of this expense attitude towards your supplier gives you the following excessive inventory at your location at their location and with wip supplier initiates a low cost country strategy shops the world for cheap labour lack of transparency from your supplier typically lower product yields or increased incoming inspection costs supplier will leverage every opportunity to get more money from you all of the relationship energy is focused on keeping everyone honest instead of working together to grow the business the cost component is always driven by essentially three factors material labour and overhead labour and overhead costs can be significantly lower using a low cost country strategy but this needs to be traded off against the cost to finance these costs through your supply chain and your potential loss of flexibility and agility there is also a good chance that once you are in this rut you will be constantly shifting your supply source today it could be china then perhaps vietnam followed by india or australia where ultimately the supplier will never get to know your business or the cost to manage your supply chain gets oblique against the actual procurement unit cost a supplier is someone instrumental to your success they bring to your equation a unique product technology or service traditional accounting methods can be the biggest asset or liability in this scenario how can you justify waiting 16 22 weeks for goods when you could have a supplier located next door when you look beyond unit cost and calculate your total cost of procurement the decision to source local may make more sense for example add the cost to visit a supplier in china instead of across the street the cost to finance inventory the cost of logistics design review challenges time zone differences and manage quality when you add it all up your total cost of procurement can actually tabulate to be double or triple of the actual procurement unit cost ultimately value is defined by what you are willing to pay for you cannot blame walmart for being one of the largest conduits of cheap china imports to north america when in reality the role walmart play is to be your household purchasing department and you make the final decision as you opt to get maximum value for your hard earned dollars but still want to be insanely compensated for your contribution to society a supplier when used as an asset can really be a competitive advantage and can be evidenced in the following manner trusted partner no inventory commitment you pay as you consume as an example every time a rim and a tire are installed on a vehicle an automatic electronic payment is issued to the supplier no incoming quality inspection everything is source inspected and validated by the supplier supplier is committed to your success transparency and blurring of the lines of your relationship harmonious design reviews where emerging technologies can be harnessed together to provide an advanced value proposition to the ultimate customer typically local when viewing a supplier as an asset always take into consideration the following they are committed to your success they are your hidden factory so have you optimized their capability typically for every person doing the final assembly there exist 10 other people upstream they are transparent and very open to sharing you now have a combined r d resource and opportunity further define our competitive edge they are willing to take risk s or partner with you to achieve a challenge ultimately the market will dictate the price based on value and the price difference between companies can usually be measured within a few percentage points competitors tend to keep a pretty close eye on each other so as a third party my approach is to work with a supplier to leverage this knowledge to my ajdvantage working with suppliers is enjoyable as we combine focus on how to grow our businesses while giving more value to the customer than constantly living in fear about our current pricing in the immortal words from a previous colleague i only want our supplier to know they have a problem when i arrive in their lobby with a cadre of engineers to help solve the problem _______________ richard kunst is an author speaker and seasoned lean practitioner based in toronto who leads a holistic practice to coach mentor and provide management solutions

criteria and that are accretive to affo unit on a normalized leverage neutral basis of 50 primarily in france and germany consider investing up to 15 of total assets in other continental european markets such as spain where the manager currently has operations and expertise the reit is expected to deploy the majority of its cash on hand in furtherance of such strategy the manager has currently identified 120 million euros of potential acquisitions in its current markets which fit within such strategy and that could close in 2021 however the reit has not yet entered into any agreements in connection with such acquisitions and there is no certainty any such acquisitions will be completed structure by the end of 2022 the manager intends to either acquire or dispose of current joint ventures in accordance with their respective agreements in an attempt to simplify its corporate structure and governance the reit s preference will be to acquire new properties as wholly owned assets

given its relative size the reit will aim to internalize the finance functions on or before april 1 2022 other key features of the revised management agreement include strong incentive for the manager to reduce g a and outsourced services including off sets scalable charges for g a expenses in excess of budgeted amounts and incentive payments to management where actual annual g a expenses are significantly less than the budgeted expenses for that year from january 1 2021 until the completion of the internalization the manager will reimburse the reit half of all costs for the finance function and the asset management fee will be reduced by cad 500 000 once the internalization of the finance function is completed and the reit has an option to fully internalize management once a

three year period with the goal of increasing the overall distribution payout by a minimum of 10 annualized increasing the institutional shareholder base to 25 over three years investor communication

the purpose is to rein in ma yun said an adviser to china s state council the country s top government body using mr ma s chinese name it s like putting a bridle on a horse i think among the richest men in china few have good endings jack ma jack ma in eclipse chart by author beijing s protracted dismemberment of jack ma inc continues bridle on the horse hardly describes this orgy of value destruction this horse has suffered multiple amputations performed without finesse by the chinese government the ma empire is worth half what it was 9 months ago the process is not over beijing is now doling out some of the most lucrative slices of ma s business to new partners of its choosing including one of the most corrupt and financially shaky companies in all of china who was jack ma one year ago ma was the richest man in china he was the creator of alibaba china s largest tech company and the ant group the largest fintech company in the world his corporate empire had reached private sector superpower status on a par with the western fang giants alibaba alone was worth more than any u s company except for apple amazon and google ma was also a worldwide celebrity the most famous living chinese person according to polls he was more well known outside china than xi jinping jack ma was jeff bezos elon musk and bill gates all rolled into one he was the front man for the new china it is hard to overstate the importance in china of mr ma and his two companies they have become synonymous to innovation the media in china calls the country s rising tech sector the era of ma the abrupt reversal of his fortunes has been shocking to watch ma s assets have been stripped shorn and degraded rectified is the english word often given as the translation for whatever verb in chinese describes what beijing is doing to his businesses the rectifications the canceled ant ipo the last minute quashing of the ant group s initial public offering was the opening shot which i wrote about at some length last year the offering would have set a world record in fact alibaba s ipo in 2014 had been the largest ever at that time ant s was to have surpassed it by 40 biggest ipo s of all time chart by author the size of the deal itself doesn t portray the scale of the financial phenomenon the ant ipo had become by october 2020 a true frenzy the share price on the private market ran up 50 ahead of the effective date and the offering was said to have been 80 times oversubscribed the wall street journal called it a 3 trillion scramble ma was triumphant it would be he said the biggest ipo in human history furthermore for the first time ever it is set in a city other than new york a miracle is happening the wsj reported that the order book exceeded the value of all the stocks listed on the exchanges of germany then beijing killed the deal carving up the company following the ipo fiasco regulators began to disassemble ant its consumer financing business was set to be restructured with new partners the central bank ordered ant to form a separate financial holding company that would be subject to the kind of capital requirements applied to banks that could open a door for big state banks or other types of government controlled entities to buy into the firm the government also had its eye on one of ant s most valuable assets its data derived from billions of consumer transactions it processes the tech intensive analytics generated from this resource have been the basis of ant s competitive advantage over the less technologically sophisticated traditional banking sector in making consumer credit decisions beijing aimed to rectify that too ant will also be required to break an information monopoly on the vast and detailed consumer data it has collected the central bank said hiving off the treasure trove of data on more than 1 billion people is a key part of ant s business overhaul in response to a regulatory crackdown neutering ant s money market fund ant s group s money market fund was perhaps its most amazing and explosive success story in just four years the fund became briefly the world s largest surpassing the american establishment giants like fidelity and jp morgan and shocking banking executives around the world ant built this fund up by inviting chinese consumers to hold their spare cash leftover treasure in chinese in these accounts beijing took note ant s business was thrown into reverse shrinking 18 in the first quarter of this year and down almost 50 from its peak beijing s crackdown on ant s money market fund chart by author this decline is not as has been suggested by some due to natural market forces interest rate shifts or trends in the chinese equity markets it is the direct result of beijing in action ant group s money market fund has shrunk to a more than four year low as users shifted their cash in the face of china s crackdown on jack ma s payments group ant was ordered to actively reduce size as part of a restructuring deal struck with chinese authorities last week antitrust penalties in april a record fine of 2 8 bn was levied against jack ma s flagship alibaba for antitrust violations the dollar amount appeared far smaller than the financial damage from the broken ant ipo and some observers dismissed it still it was the description of the sin that mattered the company was accused of abusing its market dominance and again ordered the company to rectify its behavior and shrink its business the regulator s punishment of alibaba group is a move to standardize the company s development and set it on the right path to purify the industry and to forcefully protect fair competition in the market standardize purify set on the right path the pronouncement rings with orwellian cadences and who would ever have thought to hear about protecting fair competition from the communists minor harassment chinese authorities have piled on other penalties which seem minor or tangential but in context they display beijing s animus even in petty matters for example the company s highly popular internet browser number 2 in the chinese market with over 400 million active users was deleted at beijing s insistence from the app stores of most mobile and internet companies in march alibaba s web browser removed chart by author in april beijing announced an investigation into the ant s dealings with the shanghai stock exchange to obtain approval for the ipo insider dealing and quasi corruption were implied the probe examines how an array of state funds including massive sovereign wealth fund china investment corp and the country s largest state insurers among them china life insurance co got to invest in ant listing standards and procedures set by both the china securities regulatory commission and stock regulators in shanghai are under scrutiny the way ant s ipo application was handled fueled mr xi s concerns the state s interests weren t being adequately protected closing ma s hupan university also in april ma was removed as president of hupan university the ultra elite business school he founded and endowed in 2015 this is to my mind the saddest of all these injuries the plan for hupan was ambitious bold innovative it promised a fresh approach to business education in some respects going beyond anything done elsewhere after a rigorous six month selection process jack ma s hupan university announced the commencement of its new student class more than 40 ceos from chinese tech unicorns were welcomed to the program which promises to be one of the most powerful business networks in the country however the program is more famous for its powerful alumni that clearly influence china s technology business sector while only 207 chinese corporate executives are among the school s alumni they include many well known names a qualified applicant must head a startup which earns a minimum of rmb 30 million around 4 5 million in revenue has paid taxes for more than three years and has at least 30 employees as an educator myself i was impressed with this model it fit with china s desire to leapfrog the slower more organic american approach to business education and combined what we would call advanced exec ed with an intensive shared personal experience and network cultivation the closest thing to this in the u s is the harvard business school and ma wanted to go even further it was a grand vision it was working hupan quickly became one of china s most prestigious business schools we want hupan to run for 300 years jack ma beijing will now apparently dismantle the whole thing the chinese communist party has grown increasingly suspicious jack ma s elite business academy has been forced to suspend new student enrollments following pressure from beijing as authorities tighten their chokehold on the chinese tech billionaire s empire ma needs to disassociate himself from the organisation but there are worries that hupan may have trouble attracting students if ma exits completely one person said the academy is popular because of him not its curriculum huarong now the worst of it it was reported last week that regulators approved jack ma s ant group to start running a new finance company it will absorb the most profitable part of ant the consumer lending business ant will contribute its massive portfolio of 155 bn in outstanding loans the unit will become the centerpiece of ant s restructured lending business which had grown so large that it issued about one tenth of china s non mortgage consumer loans last year however ant will now own just 50 of the new company to be called chongqing ant consumer finance ant even has to pay another 625 million for a half stake in its own business the other 50 is being handed out to several new partners who apparently are not required to make capital commitments they include a battery company a manufacturer of video surveillance equipment and yes an actual bank though it is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the state owned bad banks set up in the 1990s to process massive amounts of non performing loans that were choking the state banking sector at that time but the real shock is who gets the final seat at the boardroom table huarong asset management they are being given 4 99 of the business for nothing it seems huarong is the most notorious bad actor in all of chinese finance the company was created as another one of the bad banks in the 90s and so was swimming in polluted waters from the start trafficking in bad loans it later expanded its business recklessly into many other areas outside its charter including large risky foreign private investments it is even today not entirely clear to chinese authorities what it owns huarong developed a culture of massive and systematic corruption led by its ceo lai xiaomin until his downfall in 2018 the company became a media villain in china an example of fraud and incompetence the subject of a lurid tv series and documentaries that aired on national networks this year huarong has flirted with bankruptcy as its past sins catch up with it it is the largest chinese issuer of dollar denominated foreign debt 22 bn and is said to be on the edge of default which may provoke a regulatory crisis because of its majority state ownership huarong s troubles threaten the integrity of the larger fixed income market in china and could force a government bailout oh and in january 2021 former ceo lai xiaomin was executed for bribery greed and other sins bringing huarong into this venture shows that someone in beijing has a nasty sense of humor it s as though the u s government had said to facebook mr zuckerberg say hello to your new partner bernie madoff media reports portrayed this new deal as a thaw and an easing of tensions a green light for jack ma but the addition of huarong feels like mockery or even contempt on the part of beijing s regulators for mr ma and what he represents to tie the most dynamic and innovative high tech entrepreneur china has produced so far to a corrupt bankrupt sluggish thuggish and incompetent wreck of a company what can that signify except contempt it is at the very least a message and a warning to the rest of the private sector it is also another strategic blunder on china s part but that is for a future column

washington the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation advertisement are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 percent annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall advertisement economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said consumers advertisement after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says inflation advertisement financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 percent from march to april and 4 2 percent from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it housing advertisement the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 percent in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 percent and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 percent many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated manufacturing u

it would seem that world economic policymakers and academic economists have learned little from the 2008 bursting of the u s housing and credit market bubble today at a time that the world is experiencing an everything asset price and credit market bubble that is very much more pervasive than was the u s housing and credit market bubble of the previous decade the world s major central banks are still keeping their pedal to the monetary policy metal today at a time that the world s central banks keep adding froth to the world s asset and credit markets by their ultra easy monetary policies there is a deafening silence from the academic community about the risks of another central bank induced painful boom bust cycle the primary source of today s global everything asset price and credit market bubble is the maintenance of zero policy interest rates and the unprecedentedly aggressive bond buying activity by the world s major central banks whereas in the wake of the september 2008 lehman bankruptcy it took ben bernanke six years to increase the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet by 4 trillion in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic it has taken jerome powell less than a year to do the same thing not to be outdone over the past year christine lagarde s european central bank has increased the size of its balance sheet from less than 5 trillion before the pandemic to its current level of around 9 5 trillion one way in which the unprecedentedly rapid pace of central bank money printing has manifested itself has been a global equity price bubble as an example today u s equity valuations as measured by the shiller cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio are more than double their historic average they are also at very lofty levels that have been surpassed only once in the past one hundred years another manifestation of rapid money printing has been housing market bubbles around the world this has included a u s housing bubble where house prices today in real terms are at a level similar to those in 2006 at the peak of the previous housing market cycle more disturbing yet for world financial market stability are the pervasive global credit market bubbles that have been spawned by today s ultra easy monetary policies despite their record high public debt levels and their highly compromised budgets in the wake of the pandemic the emerging market economies have still been able to borrow vast amounts of money at relatively attractive interest rates similarly despite having its highest public debt level in its 150 year history the italian government has still been able to borrow at a lower interest rate than the u s government can meanwhile in a world flush with liquidity both u s and european corporates with the worst credit quality have been able to continue borrowing at relatively low interest rate spreads the common factor that keeps fueling these asset price and credit market bubbles is the belief that interest rates will remain at their currently very low rates forever at a time that budget policy has become excessively expansive and now threatens inflation this creates an acute policy dilemma for the federal reserve if the fed chooses to raise interest rates and taper its bond buying program then it risks bursting the global everything asset price bubble that could be problematic for the united states and world financial system as it was in 2009 on the other hand if the fed does not rein in its ultra loose monetary policy it risks allowing price inflation to take hold and asset markets to become even more frothy than they are today that in turn would all too likely set us up for an even harder landing down the road than had the fed acted in a timely manner for the country s sake one must hope that painful as it might be the fed starts tightening its ultra loose policy sooner rather than later by doing so it will at least heighten the chances that the u s economy will avoid a nasty burst in inflation and have a softer landing than it would have if the fed were to stick to its currently ultra loose monetary policy stance desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney image reuters

lima peru ap a rural teacher turned political novice and the daughter of an imprisoned former president traded the lead monday in a tight race for peru s presidency in a runoff election as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter the andean country with 96 of ballots tallied leftist pedro castillo had 50 2 of the vote while conservative keiko fujimori had 49 7 according to official results this is fujimori s third run for president a role her father held in the 1990s the difference between the two polarizing candidates was just over 87 000 votes the figures released by peru s elections agency the national office of electoral processes included almost all votes cast near the country s electoral processing centers the agency was still waiting for the arrival of votes from remote rural areas and abroad no one can say for sure at this point who is going to win fernando tuesta a political scientist at the pontifical catholic university of peru and former peruvian elections chief told a local radio station in 2016 now former president pedro pablo kuczynski defeated fujimori by just 42 597 votes the partial map of votes showed a country split in two castillo overwhelmingly dominated the impoverished rural areas of the andes and much of the amazon fujimori was the candidate of the business elite dominating the capital and other cities on the pacific coast the cities hardest hit by the shining path rebel group during peru s internal conflict between 1980 and 2000 which left almost 70 000 people dead voted for castillo it was an adverse result for fujimori who during the campaign accused the professor without evidence of ties to terrorism the areas where international mining companies are seeking to expand extractive projects also voted almost entirely for castillo in the country s poorest district uchuraccay the teacher captured 87 of the votes while in the richest district san isidro fujimori prevailed with 88 fujimori at a news conference charged that her rival s campaign staff carried out a a series of irregularities during the election but she did not present conclusive evidence she predicted her support would increase when votes from peruvians living abroad were counted meanwhile castillo told supporters that the popular will should be respected i will be the first to enforce the will of the peruvian people here and there he said the polarizing populist candidates have promised coronavirus vaccines for all and other strategies to alleviate the health emergency that has killed more than 180 000 people in peru and pushed millions into poverty the election followed a statistical revision from peru s government that more than doubled the covid 19 death toll previously acknowledged by officials voters across peru where voting is mandatory headed to the polls throughout sunday under a set schedule meant to minimize long lines pre election polls indicated the candidates were virtually tied heading into the runoff in the first round of voting featuring 18 candidates neither received more than 20 support and both were strongly opposed by sectors of peruvian society the candidate who becomes president either keiko or pedro the people the only thing we have to do is accept it but they better govern well said lucia carrion a street vendor in lima there is so much corruption one of them has to stop so much corruption that there is here in peru the pandemic not only has strained peru s medical and cemetery infrastructure left millions unemployed and highlighted longstanding inequalities in the country it has also deepened people s mistrust of government as it mismanaged the covid 19 response and a secret vaccination drive for the well connected erupted into a national scandal amid protests and corruption allegations the south american country cycled through three presidents in november some analysts warn this election could be another tipping point for people s simmering frustrations and bring more political instability president francisco sagasti after voting said the candidates should respect the results and ask their followers to refrain from staging protests over the outcome fujimori a former congresswoman has promised various bonuses to people including a 2 500 one time payment to each family with at least one covid 19 victim she has also proposed distributing 40 of a tax for the extraction of minerals oil or gas among families who live near those areas keiko fujimori herself has been imprisoned as part of a graft investigation though she was later released her father alberto fujimori governed between 1990 and 2000 and is serving a 25 year sentence for corruption and the killings of 25 people she has promised to free him should she win castillo until recently was a rural schoolteacher in the country s third poorest district deep in the andes the son of illiterate peasants entered politics by leading a teachers strike while his stance on nationalizing key sectors of the economy has softened he remains committed to rewriting the constitution that was approved under the regime of fujimori s father both candidates oppose abortion and same sex marriage peru is the second largest copper exporter in the world and mining accounts for almost 10 of its gdp and 60 of its exports so castillo s initial proposal to nationalize the nation s mining industry set off alarm bells among business leaders but regardless of who gets picked to succeed sagasti on july 28 investors will remain skittish the stock market in lima registered declines

problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in

mustang shelby gt500 make ford segment coupe most people would agree the 2020 ford mustang shelby gt500 has more than enough grunt in stock form ford s 5 2 liter supercharged v8 pumps out 760 horsepower and 625 lb ft of torque which is sent to the rear wheels through a seven speed dual clutch automatic transmission that s an excessive amount of power in a road car for most people but it didn t take long for aftermarket tuners to extract even more power from the new gt500 taking the high performance muscle car to new levels of insanity last month the texas tuning wizards at hennessey performance unveiled the new venom 1000 package that cranks the gt500 s v8 up to 1 000 hp and 850 lb ft close now palm beach dyno has shown off what the car s owner claims to be the most powerful 2020 ford mustang shelby gt500 on the planet based on the numbers we re not going to doubt them under the hood is a hellion twin turbo installed by the ohio based tuning shop racemod a bolt on kit is also in development with no customization required if you don t want to get your hands dirty to find out how much power this beast produces the modified gt500 was hooked up to the dyno on the first run at 5 psi of boost the gt500 generates 711 hp and 540 lb ft cranking up the boost pressure to 12 psi increases the power to a very respectable 944 hp and 691 lb ft close if that s still not enough power for you the customized gt500 produced 1 145 hp and 817 lb ft when the boost pressure was increased to 17 psi in the final run the boost pressure is increased to 20 psi and the sound is deafening palm beach dyno expected the gt500 to hit around 1 220 hp and 850 lb ft but was pleasantly surprised when the result came in at a staggering 1 252 hp and 867 lb ft that makes this gt500 even more powerful than a bugatti veyron dyno tests aren t always 100 percent accurate but it hopefully won t be long until the 1 250 hp gt500 gets taken for a spin so we can find out how this massive power increase affects the performance it should be capable of hitting 0 60 mph in well under three seconds and set some blisteringly quick quarter mile times so we can t wait to see it in action
vol 45 no 23 friday june 4 2021 us economy plenty of growth not enough workers or supplies print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs ___ jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said ___ consumers after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says ___ inflation financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 from march to april and 4 2 from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president joe biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it ___ housing the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated ___ manufacturing u s factories are thriving despite the clogged supply chains and the shortage of workers the institute for supply management s manufacturing index rose to 61 2 last month any reading above 50 signals growth and manufacturers have been on a 12 month winning streak half the purchasing managers surveyed by the trade association said they had had trouble finding workers given the supply problems it s unclear whether factories can sustain their steady output the ism found that deliveries from suppliers were coming in at their slowest rate since 1974 sixteen of 18 industries reported slower deliveries ___ ap business writers christopher rugaber in washington and joyce m rosenberg in new york contributed to this report ___ this story was first published on june 5 2021 it was updated on june 7 2020 to correct the name of a trade association it is the commercial food equipment service association not the commercial food service equipment association

amid the continued rapid rise of e commerce and recent impacts of the covid 19 pandemic on distributors and their employees it s reasonable to assume that the time is now for some major distributors to consolidate their physical footprint as a means of doing more with less but according to grainger s ceo the mro products giant has no intentions of substantially leaning out its branch network in a roundtable interview on monday with trade publications including industrial distribution grainger chairman and chief executive d g macpherson spoke candidly about a variety of company topics for about 45 minutes fielding questions with plenty of insight ranging from how grainger has dealt with the pandemic to the state of recovery in the mro market to the threat of amazon business june 15 webinar everything wrong with the b2b sales model and how to fix it sign up here one question i asked him was about if the company is looking to add any more distribution centers in the near future and it followed another editor s question about the size of grainger s branch network given the company s major investments in its e commerce offerings and next day delivery emphasis i think there s been natural curiosity about if grainger plans on pairing down its network of 354 branches across north america 287 in us or boosting its network of 24 distribution centers 17 in us earlier in the interview macpherson mentioned how approximately 70 percent of grainger s revenue comes from the company s digital channels and that he expects that figure to continue to grow each year until it levels off at around 80 percent but even with customer buying habits moving more and more predominantly toward digital methods macpherson said the company is pretty set on the size of its physical presence we like our footprint he said our branch volume has been fairly stable and growing the last 3 years we feel like we re at a place where our branch number will be pretty level as long as we can continue to see modest growth and we re asking our branches to do some different things we want to be local id s 2021 salary survey is here it takes only 5 minutes and helps us provide our annual report comparing salary and compensation levels across the industry get started here grainger s branch count has indeed held very steady since it downsized a considerable number of them mostly overseas during from 2014 2017 worldwide the company shed 98 branches worldwide in 2017 69 in 2016 14 in 2015 and 29 in 2014 that followed a prolonged period of stability from 2011 2013 grainger ended 2016 and 2017 with 284 us branches down from a peak of 390 at the end of 2013 and that figure has only changed by three as of may of this year grainger meanwhile the company opened its largest distribution center earlier this year in the us logistics hub of louisville ky grainger s previous dc additions over the past decade include a 1 3 million square foot highly automated distribution center in new jersey in 2017 a 1 million square foot dc in minooka il in 2013 and dcs in patterson ca and saskatoon saskatchewan in 2012 we have been on a path these past 12 years to get very large dcs with the ability to stock many items as much as 700 000 with the ability to have next day across the country macpherson said monday what we probably don t need is more buildings like that however macpherson said that over the next 5 years grainger will look to add support facilities that can extend the next day delivery capabilities of those larger dcs stay tuned to id for more analysis that came out of monday s roundtable interview

abstract s194 an updated phase 1 study of a novel fully human bcma targeting car t cells ct103a in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma type oral presentation session title t cell re directing therapies in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma about multiple myeloma multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma about ibi326 bcma car t ibi326 is an innovative therapy co developed by innovent and iaso bio previous studies indicate subjects with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma r r mm who received high dose bcma targeting car t cells may achieve better remission but have worse adverse events moreover once the disease progresses again the re infusion of car t cells will not be effective to solve this dilemma ibi326 has been developed a lentiviral vector containing a car structure with a fully human scfv cd8a hinger and transmembrane 4 1bb co stimulatory and cd3ζ activation domains based on strict selection and screening utilizing a proprietary in house optimization platform the construct of the bcma car t is potent and persistent in february 2021 ibi326 was granted breakthrough therapy

washington the u s economy is sparking confusion and whiplash almost as fast as it s adding jobs barely more than a year after the coronavirus caused the steepest economic fall and job losses on record the speed of the rebound has been so unexpectedly swift that many companies can t fill jobs or acquire enough supplies to meet a pent up burst of customer demand things exploded it was like a light switch said kirby mallon president of elmer schultz services a family owned philadelphia firm that repairs and maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and other clients the labor market is just out of control we literally cannot hire technicians we ramped up so quickly the supply chain wasn t ready for it economic forecasters with little historical precedent to guide them through the aftermath of a global pandemic are pondering questions they can t answer with any confidence does robust consumer spending reflect economic strength and resiliency or has it been temporarily propped up by federal stimulus checks was an april run up in consumer prices a temporary blip or an ominous sign of accelerating inflation advertisement are two months of middling job growth the result of too much of a good thing employers want to hire more than they can or a hint that the labor market isn t as strong as economists think in many ways the news has been cause to cheer the economy grew from january through march at a red hot 6 4 percent annual pace and in the current quarter that pace is thought to be accelerating to nearly double digits yet the full portrait of the u s economy is a rather more nuanced one here is a closer look at five vital signs jobs employers last month added 559 000 jobs on top of 278 000 in april those would ordinarily be seen as quite healthy numbers yet against the backdrop of record high job openings and free spending consumers forecasters had expected much more hiring some economists had envisioned the recovery from the pandemic recession driving monthly job growth of 800 000 900 000 even 1 million or more what explains the shortfall advertisement economists point mainly to what they call a short term mismatch companies are posting job openings faster than applicants can respond after all many americans are contending with considerable tumult at home health issues related to covid 19 child care problems with schools slow to reopen career uncertainty after many jobs permanently vanished over the past 15 months and some people earning more from federal and state jobless aid than they did when they worked are taking their time before pursuing another job some say the labor shortage is nothing that can t be solved the old fashioned way by raising pay and offering more generous benefits and working conditions in fact that process appears to have begun average hourly wages rose solidly in april and may consider gina schaefer who owns 13 ace hardware stores in maryland virginia and washington d c and who has been rapidly staffing up for the spring and summer when her sales typically hit highs schaefer has hired nearly 120 people since march both seasonal workers and long delayed replacements for people who left last year when covid ravaged the economy her company pays a minimum of 15 50 an hour to compete with larger chains that now pay 15 and provides health insurance paid vacation sick leave and a 401 k plan after employees have been on the job for about six months we firmly believe that better workplaces do not have a problem finding employees she said consumers advertisement after months cooped up at home millions of consumers have rushed back out again in buoyant spirits and eager to spend their finances bolstered by 1 400 federal stimulus payments earlier this year among the affluent sharp gains in home and stock market equity have further emboldened their impulse to spend consumer confidence is high and americans stepped up their spending again in april after a powerful gain in march fueled by 1 400 stimulus checks to most individuals that said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics sees cautionary signs confidence and spending though still healthy have trended lower and retail sales were flat in april after having surged in march suggesting that the positive effect of the stimulus checks might have faded similar trends occurred late last year after the effects of earlier federal stimulus money began to wear off in addition a monthly survey of consumer confidence by the conference board found that expectations for the next six months actually fell in may i m not sure how this is going to pan out farooqi says inflation advertisement financial markets endured an unwelcome jolt last month when the labor department reported that consumer prices had jumped 0 8 percent from march to april and 4 2 percent from 12 months earlier the largest year over year increase since 2008 some leading critics including former treasury secretary larry summers have been warning that president biden s trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money risk igniting inflation and forcing the federal reserve to resort to interest rate hikes which could derail the economic recovery but fed chair jerome powell and many economists say they think the inflation surge will prove short lived they say it reflects mainly temporary supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices but that should ease over time for now though shortages of lumber computer chips and other materials have contributed to inflation pressures mallon at elmer schultz services in philadelphia said supply shortages are so severe in his industry that members of the the commercial food equipment service association trade group are sharing inventory i can go to a friend if he has a part in stock he said in my 30 years in the business no i ve never seen anything like it housing advertisement the housing market has served as a source of economic strength and resilience during the pandemic supported by ultra low mortgage rates and the desire of many locked down families to move to more spacious digs to accommodate work from home needs but with prices having risen beyond the reach of many and with the supply of homes for sale severely limited the housing boom has lately shown signs of fatigue home construction tumbled 9 5 percent in april a drop that economists attributed at least in part to builders postponing projects because of accelerating costs for lumber and other supplies that have contributed to swelling home prices in april sales of new homes dropped nearly 6 percent and purchases of existing homes fell 2 7 percent many would be buyers will remain on the outside looking in as long as a shortage of available homes keeps sale prices elevated manufacturing u s factories are thriving despite the clogged supply chains and the shortage of workers the institute for supply management s manufacturing index rose to 61 2 last month any reading above 50 signals growth and manufacturers have been on a 12 month winning streak half the purchasing managers surveyed by the trade association said they had had trouble finding workers given the supply problems it s

provide instructions and to host our q a i ll now turn the mic over to our ceo jon kessler jon kessler president and chief executive officer thank you richard well done hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this somewhat brisk very late spring afternoon today we are announcing strong results for healthequity s fiscal first quarter of fiscal year 2022 which ended on april 30 and we are also raising guidance for the full 2022 fiscal year i will discuss our q1 results and acquisition activity during the quarter ted will review operations and progress on wageworks integration and tyson will review the financial details of the quarter and provide detail on our updated guidance for fiscal 22 based on the results that we are reporting today steve neeleman is here and will join in on the q a looking first to the five key metrics that drive our business and that we ve been reporting on for a long time healthequity benefited from the initial economic reopening trends that helped drive year over year growth in hsa members and in assets while commuter and yield headwinds continue to impact total accounts and revenue revenue of 184 2 million fell 3 versus the largely pre pandemic first quarter of last year and that was due to lower year over year custodial yields and commuter revenue which were partially offset by hsa member growth asset growth and other cdb growth adjusted ebitda of 59 0 million was similarly down from the first quarter last year of 63 million total accounts ended the quarter at 12 8 million which does not include the nearly 700 000 commuter accounts that remain in suspense hsa members at quarter s end reached 5 8 million up 9 year over year and hsa assets at quarter s end reached a record 15 billion up and even larger 31 from a year ago that s a lot of percent as ted will detail team purple started fiscal 22 with very promising sales results including a fiscal first quarter record of 115 000 new hsas up 11 from 104 000 new hsas opened in q1 last year hsa investments grew by over 770 million in the quarter as members and their employers continue to contribute and invest investing hsa members grew 51 year over year with more of our members connecting health and wealth and the average balance of hsa members grew an incredible 20 year over year and even 4 sequentially from the fiscal year end despite a restart of spending in addition to these strong organic results in q1 healthequity reached agreements to put roughly 600 million to work driving additional growth this year and for years to come through the acquisitions of luum further and the fifth third bank s hsa portfolio luum is supporting the post pandemic of so i want to talk a little about each of those luum is supporting the post pandemic reboot of our commuter benefits helping clients launch hybrid workplace strategies as offices reopen longer term we think that luum and commuter benefits in general will really be the tools clients use to shrink employee commutings carbon footprint further and fifth third will enhance healthequity s market leadership and scale in our core and growing hsa business adding approximately 0 7 million hsas and more than 2 billion of custodial assets upon their respective closings later this year these figures are of course not included in the numbers that we reported today further we ll strengthen the network partner strategy that has helped fuel healthequity s hsa growth from its very beginning with significant new partners increased commitment to the blue cross and blue shield system and new api based platform capabilities to support flexible branding and deeper integration of healthequity into our partners offerings it will also add deeper the healthequity s total solution for clients partners and members the first quarter in addition to delivering very promising sales and operating results and really important long term acquisition activity delivered evidence of pandemic headwinds beginning to turn into tailwinds healthcare card spend reached pre pandemic levels for the first time during the latter half of q1 with former lagging formerly lagging categories such as medical office visits showing strong growth new sales opportunities and rfp volume and the value of client wins all rose year over year in q1 in line with new hsa opening growth that we reported today bond yields rose and yield curve steepened with both 10 year treasuries and the 10 year versus three months spread adding more than 50 basis points during our q1 and that perhaps portends a rebound in healthequity s custodial yields in the future to fully capitalize on that trend we are expanding our roster of principal guarantee partners what we heretofore call deposit partners to include new insurers as well as banks and credit unions increasing competition for our managed assets and choice for our hsa members heretofore that s a fancy word leading employers announced plans and finally leading employers announced plans to reopen their urban offices after labor day consistent with our assumption of a start to commuter recovery in the second half of the year so in total in q1 while pandemic affects still weighed on our financial performance the team delivered strong sales we committed to acquisition investments with significant long term growth benefits and there was compelling evidence of headwinds becoming tailwinds to growth for fiscal 22 and beyond with that i will turn the call over to ted to review operations and integration ted ted bloomberg executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks jon good afternoon everybody as jon mentioned our selling season is off to a great start first quarter new hsa sales were up 11 year over year and 29 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we re seeing evidence that business opportunities are returning and that the stalled and deferred deals from last year are coming back to the market rfps which only represent a portion of our pipeline are up 13 year over year with bundled rfps meaning more than one product up 15 year over year in the small and medium sized market our sales opportunities are up even more owing both to our marketing efforts and the strong relationships we have with our distribution partners cross sell activities also continue to bear fruit as 30 enterprise partners have agreed to add new services by 1 1 2022 so far this year and 13 partners distribution partners had added new healthequity services to their shelves on the integration front we have a lot going on the team completed another four platform migrations in q1 and we are on track to complete the migrations and decommission work connected to the wageworks platforms by the middle of fiscal 2023 which is ahead of schedule despite our recently announced acquisitions and execution on the cobra subsidy both of which leverage many of the same talented team members while we have migrated 17 of the largest platforms and realized 65 million of synergies to date there remain a number of small and mid size migrations to complete to realize the remaining 15 million of the 80 million in permanent run rate synergies promised as jon mentioned we are well positioned to become the leading hsa provider once the further and fifth third deals are closed planning efforts are under way to achieve 15 million of cost and revenue synergies within three years of close on the further transaction and we believe likely more after that as we fully integrate our technology platforms additionally our cross selling pipeline with luum is beginning to fill with promising opportunities last but not least is a huge shout out to the entire organization for the tireless efforts required to execute against the recent cobra subsidy regulations it takes our entire village to support this effort and partner with clients to deliver this subsidy to those that are eligible there is still much to do but we have started fiscal 2022 quickly and on the right foot thanks to the continued efforts of team purple now i will turn it over to tyson to review our financial results tyson murdock chief financial officer thank you ted i will review our first quarter gaap and non gaap financial results a reconciliation of gaap measures to non gaap measures is found in today s press release first quarter revenue declined 3 as the economic effects of the pandemic impacted service revenue service revenue declined 8 to 102 5 million representing 56 of total revenue in the quarter the decrease is primarily attributable to an over 60 decrease in active commuter accounts while the growth in hsas and other cdbs helped average accounts increased 1 year over year custodial revenue grew slightly to 47 million in the first quarter compared to 46 9 million in the prior year first quarter as 19 growth in average hsa cash with yield and 91 growth in average hsa investments with yield more than offset a 33 basis point decline in the annualized yield on hsa cash the annualized interest rate yield was 179 basis points on hsa cash with yield during the first quarter of this year this yield is a blended rate for all hsa cash with yield during the quarter the hsa assets table of today s press release provides additional details interchange revenue grew 9 to 34 7 million representing 19 of total revenue in the quarter the interchange revenue increase was primarily due to a rebound in spend across our platforms in the quarter and growth in average total accounts gross profit was 103 1 million compared to 108 1 million in the first quarter of last year gross margin was 56 in the quarter operating expenses were 98 9 million or 54 of revenue including amortization of acquired intangible assets and merger integration expenses which together represented 16 of revenue income from operations was 4 3 million compared to 15 1 million in the prior quarter net loss for the quarter was 2 6 million or a loss of 0 03 per share on a gaap eps basis compared to net income of 1 8 million or 0 03 per share in the prior year our non gaap net income was 31 million for the first quarter this year up from 30 8 million a year ago non gaap net income per share was 0 38 per share compared to 0 43 per share last year adjusted ebitda for the quarter decreased 6 to 59 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 32 while operating through the impact of covid turning to the balance sheet as of april 30 2021 we had 737 million of cash and cash equivalents with 972 million of debt outstanding net of issuance costs with no outstanding amounts drawn on our line of credit the cash balance of course will still include still includes the funding required to close the further and fifth third hsa acquisitions based on where we ended the first quarter and our current view of the economic environment we are providing the following guidance for fiscal 22 revenue for fiscal 22 to range between 755 million and 765 million non gaap net income to be between 122 million and 126 million resulting in non gaap diluted net income between a 1 45 and 1 50 per share based upon estimate an estimated 84 million shares outstanding for the year and adjusted ebitda to be between 241 million and 247 million today s guidance includes our most recent estimate of service custodial and interchange revenue based on results today since we have not yet closed on the acquisitions guidance does not include potential revenue from further or from the hsas from fifth third bank as jon indicated earlier we anticipate closing on both those acquisitions later this year our guidance assumes a yield on hsa cash with yield of approximately 175 basis points as with all of today s guidance our yield guidance does not back to the pending further or fifth third hsa acquisitions including transition of hsa cash insured assets to healthequity principal guarantee partners at the then prevailing rates we also continue to be conservative with our commuter estimates and anticipate some accounts to reactivate in the latter half of the year due to return to work guidance also contemplates estimated revenue from cobra subsidy efforts and the effect of run rate synergies from wageworks that ted discussed the outlook for fiscal 22 assumes a projected statutory income tax rate of approximately 25 and a diluted share count of 84 million as we have done in recent reporting periods our full year guidance includes a detailed reconciliation of gaap to the non gaap metrics provided in the earnings release and a definition of all such items is included at the end of the earnings release in addition while the amortization of acquired intangible assets is being excluded from non gaap net income the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is not excluded with that i ll turn the call back over to jon for some closing remarks thanks jon kessler president and chief executive officer thanks everybody thanks tyson nicely done and ted so typically at this point in the proceedings i think those responsible for the promising start to the year and that s purple team members today i also like to give thanks for something else which is the resiliency of teammates over the past 15 months we stayed safe families are taken care of well deserved bonuses were paid and despite not seeing each other in person for more than a year our team became a more inclusive and more cohesive bunch better positioned to deliver on healthequity s full potential for our members our clients our partners and of course our shareholders this is not something leaders do and in fact i haven t even put on long pants in 15 months and we all know from the weekend the challenges that some leaders have with pants so this is something teams thank you team purple for this truly remarkable achievement with that let s open the call to questions operator questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from greg peters with raymond james greg peters raymond james analyst good afternoon everyone hey thank you for your comments about pants you know how to paint a picture for sure jon kessler president and chief executive officer i mean i all i m saying is it seems like my shorts policy has been justified by all the pants attention greg peters raymond james analyst i got it i m in shorts right now myself so jon kessler president and chief executive officer as you should everyone in florida should be greg peters raymond james analyst indeed anyways so i guess i d like to spend a second and have tyson and jon you obviously will comment as well talk a little bit more about the service revenue component and i know tyson you said you gave some comments of why it was what where the pressure was but i guess what i m interested in is not what happened in the first quarter but what i should think about service revenue maybe as a percentage of total account per total accounts or as the economy hopefully recovers in the back half of the year should these numbers begin to improve on a per account basis or is there some competitive pressure out there that will limit the upside to the service revenue on a per total account basis tyson murdock chief financial officer i ll go ahead and start jon jon kessler president and chief executive officer tyson do you want start that tyson murdock chief financial officer yes i mean it really comes down to the commuter come back right that s really what s impacting that service revenue line item and so it just matters when you think about your model and how you think about the return of when that s going to happen and you know what we just talked about was we see as well as our own business people coming back in that september timeframe and really restoring that and of course we re watching that very closely and to date we really haven t seen that return yet now but you see it in the news and you see people at golf tournaments and you see people everywhere so you know that that s going to happen and so i think about that when i think about the competitive side of it as ted just outlined we ve had a we are having a very successful selling seasoning actually gave quite a few metrics within that dialog there just to show that and so i don t think there is anything unusual greg given our prior conversations of course there is always the continued effort to increase hsa account and so our pricing on that will come down single digit percentages every single year we don t disclose that but we certainly are competitive in there when folks have the right number of assets and we re able to really underwrite a deal that from a overall bundling approach provides the right amount of revenue and profit then we ll do it and i think that s really the only thing that remains the same as far as competition i ll stop there and let s see if jon has some other adds jon kessler president and chief executive officer no i mean look i m not sure i have anything real to add but i ll add something anyway i mean which is just the thing is the commuter rebound is not going to be a light switch where and we talked about this last quarter that when we were quizzed greg i think by you and others about the sort of implied conservatism about our guide on the commuter rebounding and that remains true it just but it is clearly happening as folks are returning to cities and so forth and so but that s really the biggest factor in the whole discussion greg peters raymond james analyst okay and then my follow up question will pivot to m a you ve had a busy year so far and you raised equity you ve announced some major transactions to spend the capital you ve raised in equity what s your view of the m a pipeline is there going to be another should shareholders expect another capital raise for you to fund potential opportunities that you see developing in the marketplace or are your hands full at the moment just processing what you ve already announced jon kessler president and chief executive officer i feel like somewhere the antenna of intending of like a 1 000 hedge fund managers just twitch not to imply that hedge fund managers have antenna in any event i look i think the big picture here is that you re seeing increasing returns to scale in our business and those returns are not going to be evenly shared and so there is going to continue to be m a activity and i think we ve demonstrated better than anybody both that we can deliver strong returns from m a in particular portfolio related m a and that from the perspective of sellers that we are a good partner and the fifth third transaction is sort of an example of that where i think as folks understood understand certainly was there were some discussion in the public domain about fifth third talking and working with others but we have i think proven to be a really good partner in navigating their modest twists and turns but a few twists and turns in getting this thing done so that to me is is the key to this venues one can we show that we re delivering good returns and two can we show that we re a good partner for sellers and that s a winning combination that we ve got i don t know what deals will be concluded in the second third or fourth quarter but we do even after this current transaction we ve transactions we have a little bit of powder left for those kinds of things and for those kinds of portfolio type things and we won t hesitate to go forward if we think they re strong return for shareholders so that s kind of where am at right now greg peters raymond james analyst got it thanks for the answers tyson murdock chief financial officer thanks greg jon kessler president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator thank you our next question comes from george hill with deutsche bank your question please george hill deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question and jon i ll say it s over 90 degrees in new hampshire so i m in shorts too jon kessler president and chief executive officer outstanding george hill deutsche bank analyst i guess i want to jon kessler president and chief executive officer probably on backwards george hill deutsche bank analyst i don t know about that i would just focus in two questions number one is on the selling season and i guess do you see a return to normal happening fast enough that you feel comfortable about the company s ability to take share on an organic basis as we go through the selling season for 2022 starts and part b of my question is i don t know if you have the ability to have interactions with the customers of either further or fifth third by talking about maybe net dollar retention or net client retention would love to hear your thoughts around that jon kessler president and chief executive officer yes ted why don t you start and then steve can provide some color around what we re seeing in the sales cycle and beyond the statistics offered earlier and ted i think you re in a great position i ll add something if it s valuable to talk about the further clients since collectively we ve talked to most of them ted bloomberg executive vice president and chief operating officer yes sure i m happy to kick it off and then turn it back to you gentlemen to add some color commentary so i think on the first part of your question george on the sales sales cycle we are cautiously optimistic our sales representatives are busy the quality of the finalist meetings that we re holding are high deals that did disappear last year are coming back to the market our relationships with partners are developing but one of the you ve covered us long enough to know we don t really know how the sales cycle is going to turn out until january of 2022 and so all the inputs and all the top of the funnel stuff and all the activity levels are where we want to be and we feel really well positioned relative to the marketplace in those conversations before i turn it over to steve and jon i ll just take a quick shot at the second part of your question which is the further and fifth third client bases we did work analytical types we did a fair amount of market research in preparation for these acquisitions especially the larger one further and further has a tremendous reputation in the marketplace their clients like working with them their distribution partners like working with them which is one of the things that attracted us so much to the asset and so we have high hopes for client and partner retention on both sides of the coin i personally as jon said in on significant portion of both client and distribution partner calls and we are really pleased that we ve heard and so we think we have in the further team a great team that s delivered great high quality service to their clients for a long time and so we re pretty bullish about the retention prospects but obviously a lot of work to be done and worth a shout so i ll turn it over now to jon and steve to add some color jon kessler president and chief executive officer steve stephen d neeleman founder and vice chairman yes hey george good to hear your voice i would just kind of tag team off of what ted said i think what we ve noticed this year is just the tone is different in these meetings right rather than people with their hair on fire trying to figure out how to get people out of the office and all of that and just really a lot of distraction there just is a lot better focus and people are making choices and we want to win them all but sometimes leaders will say it s better almost to get to know we re going in a different direction then i ll put this on hold for another year because it kind of resets the clock and we re pretty confident that when people even if they don t choose healthequity they re going to choose us at some point and i think we ve just seen a lot more of this positive intent to make choices move ahead continue to offer health savings accounts and other cdbs to their membership base and so we just feel that as kind of the proverbial tailwind whereas last year it was a headwind people were just distracted and we have a lot of no decisions last year and a lot of finalist meetings that you could tell that we weren t at the top of their mind when we remain with them so we re encouraged and i love being on all of these calls and meetings i m as to do with our teams jon kessler president and chief executive officer and the point i d add to all that is in terms of i think those questions in fact those answers effectively address the question around market share growth if i then sort of just talk about market growth one of the items that ted talked about in his prepared remarks is that the growth is the growth that we have seen in lead flow around the smb and mid sized markets and that is to a significant and it s several fold what it was last year and that s in part due to the efforts that the team has made to sort of build the muscle around direct selling as well as the muscle around marketing and lead generation on the b2b side into small and mid sized now that we have a product to sell and so that s true but it also perhaps reflects some genuine growth in that area of the market which we really want to see for the market to the market as a whole to outperform here so again consistent with the earlier comments i think george the answer is that it s only one quarter but it s a quarter that both in terms of the actual accounts turned in relative to what other competitors reported as well as the sort of pipeline data is quite promising george hill deutsche bank analyst very helpful jon thank you jon kessler president and chief executive officer thank you sir operator our next question is from david larsen with btig your question please david larsen btig analyst hey hi congratulations on a good quarter and a good start to the year here jon kessler president and chief executive officer thank you david larsen btig analyst can you maybe talk yes can you maybe talk a little bit more about your expectations for custodial revenue it seems to me like the yield environment is coming in right in line with where you thought it would just any thoughts around where that might trend going forward there has been talk about rising inflation potential for the fed to raise interest rates just any more color around that would be very helpful thanks so much jon kessler president and chief executive officer sure let me say in the short term it is important to note that our guidance for the year is 175 million on custodial yields and remains 175 million and that is despite turning in 179 million with respect to cash with yield in q1 and as i believe it was tyson maybe it was darcy commented last quarter we did expect that that yield will come down a bit over the course of the year as we have multi year agreements that will roll over as sort of part of our ladder so the yield headwind broadly is still with us that having been said i do think there are a number of things both that we are doing in that that are happening out in the marketplace or the economic environment that are promising and clearly the fact that it s not i think we all tend to look at maybe the last 10 days or whatever our feeling is but we ve now gone through both our full fiscal first quarter in the period since where medium and longer term yields are sustaining at substantially higher levels 50 basis points 60 basis points higher than they were let s say six months ago and additionally while bank deposits pricing will always lag all of that and should nonetheless over the long term those things tend to fall in the same pattern and so that s encouraging and then internally as i offered in the comments and tyson kind of mentioned this as well we re taking some steps to assure that the assets that we manage that are guaranteed are irr competed for vigorously and even more so than in the past this has always been a strength of the company it s always been something that we try to do well both for ourselves and for our members and clients that helps us keep things competitive and all that kind of stuff and we re going to do more of that and so that s another thing that as that kind of headwind turns into a tailwind that our goal is to build the biggest possible sale to cash it and i don t think that will have an effect this year if anything again over the course of the remainder of this year our expectation is that the guidance implies is that that yields will still be coming down but i think over the long term of the business this seems like a pretty good thing and i should say lastly that having a kind of weathered this period of ultra low yields we re weathering i shouldn t say weathered weathering this period of ultra low yields and kind of borrowing from steve s experience in the airline business and using that period to really right size the business and make the cost decisions we need to make and be efficient and also continuing to build the platform and so forth that all pays even bigger dividends when you see those yields come back so we re looking forward to the point where we can while it isn t here yet we re looking forward to the point where we can all seem like we re real smart then but it will be because of the actions we ve taken now david larsen btig analyst great thanks so much it seems like this might be sort of a floor for yields would you generally agree with that and fiscal 23 should probably have higher yields would you agree with that generally speaking jon kessler president and chief executive officer i what we ve said elsewhere is and i actually we are definitely not in the business of giving fiscal 23 guidance on anything at this point what we ve said on that point is that at least in terms of cash that fiscal we are still placing contracts at less than they are rolling over to so the implication is that and fiscal 23 would be the third year of that activity and so the implication is that that we re that i don t think i m in a position to say it up i m not calling it kessler bottom on this but or i should say and probably that s all i should say because i don t feel like we should be out there we ll provide 23 guidance as soon as we can i mean but that s about it tyson anything to add on that point tyson murdock chief financial officer no i think you got it david larsen btig analyst thanks very much congrats on a good quarter jon kessler president and chief executive officer thank you david operator our next question comes from donald hooker with keybanc your question please donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst great good afternoon i was curious i d love to hear jon your thoughts one thing that stuck out to me on the further acquisition was sort of the ability to private label and i was trying to make heads or tails of that is that something that s significant can you talk about like why one would want to private label i think had you tried that in the past and it wasn t is there something unique about what further is doing that makes that a little bit more interesting now jon kessler president and chief executive officer thank you for asking about this don i think what you see is it s interesting in having been around our market for a very very long time our goal is to be to meet our partners where they are with regard to how we distribute when we re distributing to our partners and there are there is there are times when partners are very interested in kind of embedding the product more deeply and then there are times when they re more interested in conveying independents and those things kind of come and go for each partner at healthequity we have primarily not been a shop that and we re using private label but let s understand it s a little more broad than that it s really about the depth at which we can embed the product into the services of our partners right we have that has not been our thing you ve got to choose what you re going to do and so forth and there are certain elements that will probably never be our thing we don t sell software we sell a service that software enables that kind of thing but what further has done and what through the magic of apis we will be doing together is i shouldn t say the magic of apis it s not magic but it s sometimes it s like ball bearings called api and i think that what it really gives us the opportunity to do as we migrate is to meet partners where they are and sometimes partners want to do more kind of embedding of the product label or otherwise and sometimes less and i just think that s a great opportunity the primary place that this has been utilized is in the health plan segment right where you ve seen some clients make round trips on this if partners make round trips on this topic but i think there s opportunity across what we did where we can leverage the best of what we do as well as our partner as well as doing more than one plus one makes two with our partners and so i guess i see this is useful from a technology perspective useful certainly competitively to the extent that it s something we couldn t offer there are absolutely partners that we would love to have partnered with us but we just haven t had this capability and we want to be wherever in hsa so that s kind of the idea is and sometimes being wherever in hsa is means we brought on real depth on the cdb side so we could deal with clients who want to buy total solution and then sometimes it means partnering in different ways and then sometimes as here it means being able to be offer whatever level of solution our partners want at the point that they want it to help drive our strategy but also their strategy donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then maybe jon kessler president and chief executive officer go ahead steve stephen d neeleman founder and vice chairman i was just going to make one comment just real quick it s interesting even among health plans some segments they want to have it more completely brand point to the health plan whereas like for example large employers tend to say they don t really want that they may have multiple health plans so it doesn t make sense to have a health plan s brand on the hsa or the cdb solution whereas when you get into smaller businesses and individuals maybe makes more sense so to jon s point this just creates more flexibility as we partner with these health plans so jon said it well donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst so intriguing and then maybe real quick can you give us a quick update on your perspective on the employment picture with you re employers i think last year we were worried about unemployment it seems like things are raging back is there a tailwind here for you guys what s in your guidance jon kessler president and chief executive officer yes i think i mean our guidance simply reflects the broad macro consensus i mean what i would say is that that just now this is just me putting on my very ill fitting macro economist stat i think the unemployment rate is declining faster than the employment market you see and the source of that is twofold one is you have workers that are never going to reenter the workforce and that seems pretty clear from the data and or or they will reenter very slowly whenever it is that they absolutely have to or they try something else or whatever but there s probably 3 million workers that will never or at least there is a good chance they will never return to the workforce and that s why the unemployment rate is declining faster than jobs are growing and then secondly there has been some real dislocation in certain industries that s real and it s going to take some time to heal so i guess my point would be we are absolutely following the macro consensus and this is this item absolutely is one factor that should help the underlying market heal and if we can take the kind of share this year that we took last year with a heal market that would be absolutely fantastic but it s also worth noting i think just that the headline doesn t tell the full story we are still not back at the level of jobs that we had pre pandemic and we re still probably 5 million 6 million short of that so there is still some wood to chop and it s going to the gains are going to be harder to get from here donald hooker keybanc capital markets analyst thank you for your perspective richard putnam investor relations thanks don operator our next question comes from stephanie davis with svb leerink stephanie davis svb leerink analyst hey guys congrats on the quarter and the transactions and count me on team shorts as well it is very jon kessler president and chief executive officer all right stephanie davis svb leerink analyst could you walk me through the change to your guidance and how we should we think about the impact to it and how much of that was offset by yield versus service revenues as you guys remain conservative on commuter versus maybe something else some other bucket of conservatism jon kessler president and chief executive officer tyson tyson murdock chief financial officer yes thank you stephanie how are you stephanie davis svb leerink analyst hey tyson murdock chief financial officer you ve got me thanks for the question when i think about the raise on guidance i really think about we had a reasonable quarter coming out of q1 that was good it was still a pandemic quarter obviously so you still have the issues with commuter you still you have to spend coming back and so that s the positive thing you ve got fsa accounts rolling off based on some of the timing and the legislation pushing those out so some of that spend goes away and then you ve got the cobra efforts in there so it s really a balance among all those different items to really push that guidance up a little bit and so we thought that s exactly where right now we think that we re going to be and there s a lot to be learned over the course of the remainder of the year about how the business returns from that so those are some of the things that i m taking into account as i think about it and i don t know if jon ted you guys have anything to add jon kessler president and chief executive officer no stephanie davis svb leerink analyst all right then thinking about those pockets of upside that you could have i was hoping you could delve a little bit more into the cobra business and any kind of early influence you re seeing on the recent policy change around reimbursement stephen d neeleman founder and vice chairman yes there we re particularly busy so we did actually i mean the team as ted outlined made significant efforts to get in front of our clients customers to help them be within the regulations and start to get out the commitments for the notification efforts that needed to occur and get those out and certainly we will generate revenue during q2 namely getting those out and then you ll see the after effects of that in potentially the people who actually uptake cobra but there has been a significant effort and that you see the cost you see the revenue that will come in q2 not necessarily going to give amounts some of that in the initial guidance and some of that now in this in the uptick to guidance here as well stephanie davis svb leerink analyst understood thank you both richard putnam investor relations thanks stephanie operator thank you our next question comes from sean dodge with rbc capital markets jon kessler president and chief executive officer sean sean dodge rbc capital markets analyst hi good afternoon maybe going back to the acquisition the fifth third hsa so 149 000 accounts holding 407 million of assets are there any other details you can share with us to help us understand the potential incremental revenue that will add are there monthly account fees similar to healthequity how much is invested versus cash any difference in the yields those assets are earning jon kessler president and chief executive officer yes i mean a couple of things i mean first of all we say we will either at close or next quarter whatever some point shortly thereafter we will reflect this in our guidance and then you ll have it and we would sort of encourage you to do same but all that having been said i think typically when we acquire portfolios the per account fees are lower than sort of healthequity average per account fees for an hsa because that s something that they will have relied on more readily and also because in this case certainly because the average balance is higher if you do the math the average balance in the accounts is well over 3 000 so and then i guess so that s probably one factor i mean we ll obviously place the assets and so we ll place them at then current prevailing yields and we ll see how that goes when it s time to do it and then the spend the interchange side is pretty typical for our account so that s a little bit of information i guess fundamentally i would say sean that that we ll try and reflect this in our guidance as soon as it closes the challenge of doing so in advance sort of boils down to we wouldn t have closed it sean dodge rbc capital markets analyst got it ok and then maybe just quickly on cobra tyson you said there was a little bit of activity revenue related to some of the notifications in the second quarter if we think about the improving employment picture the employment recovery does that impact your view on how many end up actually being in a position where they would need or opt to take covid not cobra in the latter half of the year jon kessler president and chief executive officer we don t think too many people are going to opt to take covid i think i would suggest it is very early days but not by us sure not by all of us i mean i ll take a shot at this i mean look i think this is kind of one of the unknowns that has led us that s factored into our guidance for remainder of the year and it s an interesting year with more than the usual number of moving pieces and so the real answer is we don t know and when we don t know we try to forecast what we can see and that s what we ve tried to do both in terms of cost and revenues and you could someone could mount that exactly that argument and say well wait a minute if everyone has jobs and there is some truth to that so we ll look at one way or the other this thing is not going to be the be all end all of human existence in one direction or the other the best thing about it is that some people who need to get taken care of were taken care of and hopefully we have shown our clients that we ll work our butts off to do that whether the revenue impact or profitability is material or not sean dodge rbc capital markets analyst got it okay that s very helpful thanks richard putnam investor relations thanks sean operator thank you our next question comes from mark marcon with baird mark marcon baird analyst good afternoon and congrats on the quarter i m wondering if you can talk a little bit about with the increased number of deposit partners that you ve talked to how should we think about the typical premium that you re going to get as it relates to the effective yield relative to say three to five year jumbo cds how is that looking now jon kessler president and chief executive officer yes i mean it s a little bit hard to know mark because there is not much placement occurring right now we re in a season where there s a lot of talking and the rubber meets the road a little later in the year but well i guess i will say is that the trick to obtaining a premium period is having is one having competition for your money and two having a track record of delivering because at the end of the day nothing none of these agreements are real until the money moves and so those are things that help us there are a lot of discussions going on with different parties and unfortunate i think this is one of those where and again obviously most of the impact would be or all the impact would be in future years since most of our placements will occur late in the year but nonetheless it s something we work pretty hard at every year and certainly having more places to put that money makes us somewhat more optimistic that we can catch as much of the benefit of having it as there is mark marcon baird analyst okay i mean just a follow up on that i mean it does seem you did say that current placements are coming in at an effective yield it s less than what s rolling off do you are you getting the sense though that bottom end is starting to move up so as we think about not necessarily for the full year for next year but just in terms of sequentially that by the end of this year we re probably getting we re going to be getting closer to the bottom in terms of the effective yield jon kessler president and chief executive officer i mean the gap is clearly narrowed in both directions right so i think you re trying to ask if there has been a narrowing on the other side that is the demand side and the answer is yes mark marcon baird analyst okay great and then interchange really picked up nicely can you talk a little bit about this sequential monthly acceleration that you re seeing there because that looks i mean that s where things were really strong relative to expectation so can you talk a little bit about that just the pace of the rebound there jon kessler president and chief executive officer tyson tyson murdock chief financial officer yes that was a real bright spot as we closed every single month we would see that things were largely normalized if not even a little better in some cases relative to the different places where people spend and particularly in the area of people going and getting medical procedures which was the one that was sort of lag and the one that has the most amount of spend to be tracked we saw that that was very consistent we walked through the quarter and so that was nice to see that nice to see it was better than what we even expected of course the commuter interchange is clearly still not there mark marcon baird analyst great thank you very much jon kessler president and chief executive officer i mean i would just add mark here just for others i know you know this very well because we ve talked about it many times but that interchange is still has a seasonal component to it and so for example we will in the first quarter we benefit from the fact that we have accounts that are ending in this case from two years ago but nonetheless are ending their grace period right where and all that kind to things and that we will not have in future quarters and that ll be reflected in both total accounts as well as interchange so and of course people have topped off their accounts at the beginning of the year and all that so we were certainly pleased to see it and i think relative to our kind of pre pandemic levels we kind of feel like healthcare spend is kind of back to where it was but that s still there is still going to be some seasonality in q2 and in particular in q3 that folks should be thinking about as they model full year mark marcon baird analyst great look forward to talking again tomorrow richard putnam investor relations thanks mark operator thank you our next question comes from sandy draper with truist securities sandy draper truist securities analyst thanks so much jon since you bring it up the 80s it sounds like there may be effects of all this stuck in the commuter benefits well a lot of my questions have been asked but maybe just following up on that the comment about the stronger spend we did note for the first time in a while we actually saw the cash per account was down sequentially been building is that just because we re starting to see some spend and just would love your thoughts on how you see that interchange a bit the interchange revenue is going up should we make sure we re being taken the offset of that is some of that money is going to be coming out of the cash balances jon kessler president and chief executive officer yeah it s a really important sandy thank you for making it look we are thrilled with the aggregate balance growth just thrilled and thrilled that that is a function of not just market growth it s been primarily market growth but also growth meaning net asset value growth but also people continuing to put more into the accounts than they re taking out and a case could certainly have been made that we would see in this quarter a balance decline as people sort of begin to spend again we will see that so i think what s the biggest thing that s happening is just the continued move towards investing and as we ve talked about many many many many many times while that has the trade off in terms of individual dollars as we saw in this quarter it also has the effect of people tending to put more money in and stick around and that money grows faster and so forth in the aggregate so that s good for the business and i kind of relate it to a little bit to predictions about the long term of the business for the sector as a whole to achieve its full potential more people have to be looking at these long term accounts and that s going to be in the investment balances grow quicker than cash balances and so seeing that at this level in this quarter even in the quarter where we still had substantial increase in spend on a sequential basis seems pretty good sandy draper truist securities analyst got it jon kessler president and chief executive officer but it is something but it is as you say it is something that we all have to factor in and certainly we have tried to factor into our thinking about guidance for the full year sandy draper truist securities analyst okay great well i actually don t have a follow up so i ll try to keep the call to an hour jon kessler president and chief executive officer i m sure sandy is wearing shorts sandy draper truist securities analyst yes i m wearing shorts jon kessler president and chief executive officer marcon is our only maybe non shorts guy and maybe i mean maybe peters peters might not be wearing shorts even though he said he was wearing shorts operator we have a last question in queue gentlemen allen lutz with bank of america your question please jon kessler president and chief executive officer mr lutz allen lutz bank of america analyst hey thanks for taking the questions going back to the service revenue i guess we know that the commuter segment is causing a big impact there but historically you look at fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 sequentially in fiscal 2020 that was down slightly so can you just remind us as we think about the service line item heading into the second quarter what are the puts and takes in investment commuter there jon kessler president and chief executive officer tyson you want to take that one tyson murdock chief financial officer yes i do think it goes back to just thinking about how we underwrite deals and thinking about amount of assets right the fees associated to it and then the bundling aspect of it as well and so there when you think about hsas and how we price those relative to account balances and a good example is the one that jon just pointed out which was the fifth third deal and the amount of those accounts that we re bringing over and there is a lot of revenue that could be generated off those accounts that increases the size of the sale and so that moves that revenue down into that and can still be a line item but if you really think about the whole aspect of our custodial and service revenue line items it s almost starting to feel when i think about deals of signing off on as a blend of it because i m thinking further to that particular customer and that s even more so true when you think about bundling sales together and finding opportunities to have more problems there essentially being able to get better pricing on certain things in the service fee area to increase the amount of margin that we re able to take off of those so i think you ll continue to see that a little bit and to the extent that like jon said over the long term we can get rates to rebound that creates a huge opportunity for us and i think it s not going to be anything that s going to be an extreme amount of the decrease relative to that service revenue line item we certainly manage it every single day i m signing each one of those deals we re thinking about how we negotiate and install and so forth allen lutz bank of america analyst got it thank you operator thank you and this concludes q a i would like to turn the call back to jon kessler for his final thoughts jon kessler president and chief executive officer well that s you ve gotten as much thought out of me as you re going to get thanks everyone look forward to seeing some of you at least on video shortly and maybe soon in person who knows thanks all operator duration 61

been hit with a derivative suit in a washington federal court accusing the company of inflating its stock price by overhyping a purported covid 19 treatment while executives dumped millions of shares stockholder david berndt said in friday s suit that the company which is focused on the development of a drug with potential benefits for hiv patients made an about face and began touting that drug as a covid 19 treatment resulting in a significant increase in the company s stock price while cytodyn stock traded for less than 1 per share throughout 2019 the price peaked at more than 10 per share in june 2020 berndt said the suit names chairman of the board scott a kelly president and ceo nader z pourhassan chief financial officer michael mulholland and directors jordan g naydenov alan p timmins and samir r patel the vancouver washington based company is a nominal defendant berndt alleged that while the company s stock price was sufficiently inflated with the covid 19 cure hype long term shareholders including defendants nader z pourhassan and michael mulholland dumped millions of shares in april 2020 pourhassan sold more than 4 8 million shares of company stock about 85 of his total holdings of company stock for more than 15 7 million in total proceeds after purchasing shares at prices less than 1 per share berndt alleged that december mulholland sold more than 1 1 million shares for more than 5 8 million in total proceeds then sold more than 711 000 shares for more than 4 4 million in proceeds a week later according to the suit berndt said the company released materially false and misleading statements in violation of federal securities law including through an august 2020 press release in which the company announced it had requested emergency use approval from the u s food and drug administration it would later be revealed that the company did not actually make such a request to the fda according to the suit brandt also alleged the company issued press releases describing the results of certain data on its drug leronlimab but buried a disclosure that the primary endpoint of the study lowering all cause mortality at day 28 was not statistically significant according to the suit company stock dropped in the trading days following the release of that data to close at 2 35 on march 9 2021 berndt said the executives scheme began to unravel when the wall street journal reported aug 25 2020 that cytodyn was not being considered for operation warp speed the federal initiative to accelerate the production of covid 19 vaccines and treatments and had only completed a preliminary qualification to be included in the initiative company stock dropped more than 17 to 3 15 over the following two trading days according to the suit berndt also alleged that

entering into the convertible promissory note and its amendments converting the note to newly issued shares of company stock and settling those shares into the market at a profit iliad operated as an unregistered securities dealer and generated substantial profits berndt alleged according to the suit the u s securities and exchange commission filed suit against iliad and its related entities in september 2020 alleging they violated the mandatory dealer registration requirements of federal securities law and calling iliad s principal a recidivist violator of the federal securities laws berndt

treatment berndt s suit includes counts of breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets unjust enrichment and violations of the exchange act he asked the court to direct the defendants to take

by david morgan and david lawder washington reuters several top u s senate republicans on monday rejected treasury secretary janet yellen s g7 deal to impose a global minimum corporate tax and allow more countries to tax big multinational firms raising questions about the u s ability to implement a broader global agreement the opposition from republicans may push president joe biden to attempt to use budget procedures to pass the initiatives with only democratic votes it left lawyers and tax experts in washington wondering whether it could get done without crafting a new international treaty which requires approval by a two thirds majority in the evenly split 100 member senate it s wrong for the united states republican senator john barrasso said of the tax deal struck on saturday by finance ministers from the g7 wealthy democracies i think it s going to be anti competitive anti u s harmful for us as we try to continue to grow the economy and certainly at a time when we re coming out of a pandemic barrasso who chairs the senate republican conference told reporters at the u s capitol in the landmark agreement g7 finance ministers agreed to pursue a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 and to allow market countries to tax up to 20 of the excess profits above a 10 margin of around 100 large high profit companies yellen said the significant unprecedented commitment would end what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation in exchange g7 countries agreed to end digital services taxes but the timing for that is dependent on the new rules being implemented the deal could pave the way for broader buy in by g20 countries and some 140 economies participating in international negotiations over how to tax large technology firms such as alphabet nasdaq inc s google facebook inc nasdaq amazon com inc nasdaq and apple inc nasdaq all are expected to be included in the new broader mechanism which is targeted for a final international agreement in october republican senator pat toomey said the deal would drain tax revenues away from the u s treasury to other countries adding that he hoped some democrats would be unwilling to subject the american economy to this kind of misery there will be no republican support for this and they ll have to do this on a party line vote that needs to fail toomey told fox business network treaty or not daniel bunn an international tax expert at the tax foundation a right leaning think tank in washington said he believed that establishing new taxing rights on 100 multinational firms would require a new tax treaty the u s constitution gives the president the right to make international treaties if two thirds of senators present concur u s participation in some international treaties has been hampered by domestic partisan divides in which a president approves the deals but they are not ratified by congress manal corwin head of kpmg s washington national tax practice and a former u s treasury official said yellen s g7 deal could be done through legislation that overrides existing bilateral tax treaties using a simple majority as part of budget reconciliation procedures with vice president kamala harris as the tiebreaking vote democrats control 51 votes in the senate but cannot afford to lose any democratic votes senator ron wyden asked how much can be done with the budget reconciliation procedures and what would require a super majority vote said those are all questions that lawyers are now immersed in wyden who chairs the tax writing senate finance committee told reporters that deterring the use of tax haven countries and ensuring minimum levels of corporate taxation were in the long term interest of american workers there s a lot of heavy lifting to do here wyden added it s going to take a number of months that s for sure toomey who sits on the finance committee said he believed democrats could push through the tax changes with only democratic votes without a treaty but added that would require the united states to surrender and agree not to oppose changes imposed by other countries

biden s nomination of gary gensler to chair the securities and exchange commission sec sec staff grants relief under rule 14a 8 b 1 on february 5 2021 the staff of the sec s division of investment management issued a letter granting no action relief to templeton emerging markets income fund to exclude a rule 14a 8 shareholder proposal requesting that the fund board consider authorizing a self tender offer for at least 30 of the fund s outstanding common shares at net asset value the staff wrote the fund argues that the proposal may be excluded from the proxy materials as permitted by rule 14a 8 b 1 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended because the proponent does not hold securities entitled to be voted on the proposal you represent that the proponent holds securities that are entitled to vote only on certain matters which do not include the subject of the proposal rule 14a 8 b requires that in order to be eligible to have a proposal included in a company s proxy materials a shareholder must hold securities entitled to be voted on the proposal based on the information you provided there appears to be some basis for your view that the proposal may be excluded in reliance on rule 14a 8 b 1 accordingly we will not recommend enforcement action to the commission if the fund excludes the proposal from its proxy materials in reliance on rule 14a 8 b 1 this letter is consistent with letters issued by the staff in 2020 to dividend and income fund april 10 2020 and first trust senior floating rate income fund ii june 17 2020 in which the staff permitted the funds to exclude shareholder proposals pursuant to rule 14a 8 b 1 in circumstances where the funds governing documents did not permit the shareholder proponent to vote on the subject matter of

governs matters of shareholder governance absent conflict with federal law in our december 2020 newsletter sec reopens universal proxy comment period on april 16 2021 the sec issued a release reopening the comment period on its proposal to require the use of universal proxy cards in all nonexempt solicitations in connection with contested director elections universal proxy proposal background on october 26 2016 the sec issued a proposing rule release on the universal proxy proposal which if adopted would give shareholders the ability to vote for their preferred combination of nominees from competing slates without having to attend the shareholder meeting under the universal proxy proposal companies and dissidents would be required to provide shareholders with a proxy card that lists the names of all nominees clearly distinguishing between company nominees dissident nominees and proxy access nominees and listing nominees within each group in alphabetical order a nominee for election as a director would have to agree to be named in any proxy statement relating to a company s next meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected management and dissidents would be required to provide each other with timely notice of the names of their nominees separate from any notice required under a company s advance notice bylaw dissidents also would be subject to a filing deadline for their definitive proxy statement and required to solicit shareholders representing at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the election of directors the sec s short slate rule permitting dissidents to nominate candidates for a minority of board seats and identify company nominees they would not vote for would be eliminated as no longer necessary under a mandatory universal proxy card regime the sec also proposed amendments requiring companies with majority voting standards in director elections to provide against and abstain options on proxy cards and requiring companies with plurality voting standards to disclose the effect of a withhold vote the universal proxy proposal would not apply to election contests at registered investment companies or business development companies bdcs the comment period on the universal proxy proposal ended on january 9 2017 reopened comment period the sec explained that the reopened comment period is intended to allow interested parties to submit further comments and data on the universal proxy proposal as well as additional comments on the questions raised in the reopening release in light of market developments since the publication of the universal proxy proposal in 2016 with respect to investment companies the sec noted developments in corporate governance matters affecting funds particularly registered closed end funds and bdcs the sec stated contested elections of directors for registered closed end funds and bdcs have been more common in recent years as compared to the few years preceding the 2016 release other corporate governance developments relating to funds since the 2016 release include for example an increase in interest by closed end funds in including provisions in their governing documents requiring that directors be elected by a majority of all shares outstanding rather than of shares voted and funds opting into a state s control share acquisition statute in light of these developments the sec is requesting comments on the following questions relating to investment companies e are considering whether we should apply the proposed universal proxy card requirements to registered closed end funds and bdcs we request comment on the extent to which the similarities or differences among open end funds registered closed end funds and bdcs should result in similar or differential application of the universal proxy rules how commonly do registered closed end funds and bdcs utilize a unitary structure where a single board oversees every fund in a fund complex how frequently do they use a cluster board structure where two or more boards each oversee a different set of funds in the complex do the same concerns noted by commenters about a dissident director disrupting this cluster board structure in open end fund complexes apply to these registered closed end funds and bdcs to the extent a universal proxy card requirement would cause disruptions for open end funds closed end funds or bdcs are the costs of these disruptions justified by the benefits to shareholders of the ability to vote by proxy as if they were attending the shareholder meeting in person to what extent would disclosure to shareholders in the proxy materials regarding such potential losses in efficiency be sufficient to mitigate the risk of such disruptive outcomes we have observed that a large fraction of the recent contests at closed end funds involve a dissident contesting elections of multiple funds in the same fund complex to what extent is any potential disruption to unitary or cluster boards different in situations where a dissident is seeking election of directors for multiple funds in a complex how if at all should such contests affect our consideration of whether to extend the mandatory universal proxy card requirement to some or all funds in reviewing proxy contests since 2016 we observed that many closed end funds subject to a proxy contest utilized a classified board structure meaning that only a minority of the board was up for election each year accordingly even when dissidents ran a full slate of directors such directors if elected would still only represent a minority of the board how common is a classified board structure for registered closed end funds and bdcs how if at all does such a structure affect contested elections or our assessment of whether the proposed rules should apply to registered closed end funds or bdcs in particular does a classified board structure itself increase the chance of dissident directors disrupting unitary and cluster boards regardless of whether funds with classified boards are subject to the proposed rules we request any data or examples that would help us to better ascertain the degree of interest by shareholders in funds in splitting their votes in contested elections in the 2016 release the sec noted that the types of changes pursued by dissidents at registered closed end funds and bdcs such as converting a closed end fund to an open end fund have tended to be binary in nature are there other types of goals or compromise approaches that dissidents have pursued at such registrants in more recent years to what extent are mixed board outcomes where some but not all of a dissident s nominees are elected an effective means of achieving dissident goals in contests at registered closed end funds and bdcs if we extended the proposed rules to some or all funds would a different minimum solicitation requirement be appropriate for these registrants than for others if so what threshold would be appropriate and why how if at all would the appropriate threshold differ across open end funds registered closed end funds and bdcs how does the concentration of ownership and types of holders of open end funds registered closed end funds and bdcs differ from other registrants that may be the subject of proxy contests does the solicitation process differ for contests at open end funds registered closed end funds or bdcs as compared to other registrants how would the costs and other effects of the minimum solicitation requirement differ when applied to contests at these registrants as opposed to other registrants as discussed above we have observed recent developments in the area of corporate governance affecting funds particularly registered closed end funds and bdcs how if at all are such developments or other developments relevant to our assessment of whether the proposed rules should apply to registered closed end funds and bdcs would a universal proxy card facilitate shareholder voting in registered closed end fund and bdc elections what would be the costs and benefits and other economic effects of applying the proposed rules to registered closed end funds and bdcs or more broadly to other kinds of funds to what extent do any developments since the 2016 release affect the anticipated costs and benefits how if at all have any such developments changed the differences in the likely economic effects of applying the proposed rules to some or all funds as compared to operating companies as noted above we have not observed any proxy contests in open end funds since 2000 would there be benefits to applying the proposed rules to all funds including open end funds to the extent open end funds do face proxy contests what would be the costs of applying the proposed rules to open end funds in the absence of contests the sec noted in the 2016 release that in the absence of the proposed universal proxy card requirement applying to funds the current rules would continue to apply including the short slate and bona fide nominee rules do commenters believe that these rules are necessary or appropriate for any fund not required to use a universal proxy card or does the lack of proxy contests in open end funds indicate that it would be appropriate to rescind these rules even if we do not extend the application of the proposed rules to open end funds there are registered closed end funds and bdcs that like open end funds do not hold annual meetings to elect directors because of their state of incorporation or type of corporate entity or because they are not listed on an exchange if we were to exclude open end funds from the proposed rules because of the lack of annual meetings should the exclusion apply to registered closed end funds and bdcs that do not hold annual meetings should such funds continue to be subject to the short slate and bona fide nominee rules are there any other developments since 2016 we should consider in our assessment of whether the proposed rules should apply to open end funds closed end funds or bdcs what are the economic effects of any such developments the reopened comment period closes on june 7 2021 see the sec release no 34 91603 nyse withdraws proposed rule change to amend limits on investments in private funds by listed closed end fund investments on may 6 2021 the nyse withdrew a proposed rule change to amend section 102 04 of the nyse listed company manual to establish limits on investments in private funds by listed closed end funds section 102 04 a currently does not include an explicit restriction on the kinds of investments a listed closed end fund may include in its portfolio in contrast rule 22e 4 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended 1940 act provides that no open end fund may acquire any illiquid investment if immediately after the acquisition the fund would have invested more than 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets we understand that through the listing approval process the nyse in response to guidance from the sec division of trading markets has generally taken the position that a closed end fund that invests in private funds may not be listed on the nyse the proposed rule change had been announced on april 20 2021 and under the proposal section 102 04 a would have been amended to provide listed closed end funds a limited ability to invest in private funds see the notice of withdrawal sec release no 34 91871 and the nyse proposal form 19b 4 sec adopts modernized marketing rule for investment advisers on december 22 2020 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern investment adviser marketing under the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which had not be substantively updated since their adoption over forty years ago the amendments create a single merged rule that replaces rule 206 4 1 advertising rule and rule 206 4 3 cash solicitation rule the final marketing rule will apply to communications sent to clients and private fund investors but will not apply to advertisements about registered investment companies or bdcs according to the adopting release the final marketing rule contains principles based provisions designed to accommodate the continual evolution and interplay of technology and advice the sec also adopted amendments to form adv to provide the sec with additional information about advisers marketing practices and related amendments to the books and records rule under the advisers act the marketing rule became effective may 4 2021 and institutes an 18 month transition period before investment advisers are required to comply with the new rule the sec staff also recently released faqs relating to the adoption of rule 206 4 1 that address the compliance date and inclusion of interim performance information in an advertisement see the faqs marketing rule definition of advertisement under the final marketing rule the definition of advertisement contains two prongs one that captures traditional advertising communications and another that governs traditional solicitation activities the first prong includes any direct or indirect communication an investment adviser makes to more than one person or to one or more persons if the communication includes hypothetical performance that offers the investment adviser s investment advisory services with regard to securities to prospective clients or investors in a private fund advised by the investment adviser or offers new investment advisory services with regard to securities to current clients or investors in a private fund advised by the investment adviser but does not include i extemporaneous live oral communications ii information contained in a statutory or regulatory notice filing or other required communication provided that such information is reasonably designed to satisfy the requirements of such notice filing or other required communication or iii a communication that includes hypothetical performance that is provided a in response to an unsolicited request for such information from a prospective or current client or investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser or b to a prospective or current investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser in a one on one communication the second prong includes any endorsement or testimonial for which an investment adviser provides compensation directly or indirectly but does not include any information contained in a statutory or regulatory notice filing or other required communication that is reasonably designed to satisfy the requirements of such notice filing or other required communication registered investment companies and bdcs the proposed amendments would have generally applied to advertisements sent to investors in pooled investment vehicles as defined in rule 206 4 8 of the advisers act and would have included an exclusion for rics and bdcs because the new marketing rule applies only to private funds the sec determined that the proposed exclusion for advertisement and marketing materials of rics or bdcs was not required general prohibitions the sec also adopted general prohibitions of certain marketing practices in any advertisement an adviser may not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made in the light of the circumstances under which it was made not misleading include a material statement of fact that the adviser does not have a reasonable basis for believing it will be able to substantiate upon demand by the sec include information that would reasonably be likely to cause an untrue or misleading implication or inference to be drawn concerning a material fact relating to the investment adviser discuss any potential benefits to clients or investors connected with or resulting from the investment adviser s services or methods of operation without providing fair and balanced treatment of any material risks or material limitations associated with the potential benefits include a reference to specific investment advice provided by the investment adviser where such investment advice is not presented in a manner that is fair and balanced include or exclude performance results or present performance time periods in a manner that is not fair and balanced or include information that is otherwise materially misleading to establish a violation of the marketing rule the sec will not need to demonstrate that an investment adviser acted with scienter negligence is sufficient testimonials and endorsements the marketing rule permits investment advisers to include testimonials and endorsements in an advertisement subject to the rule s general prohibitions and certain additional disclosures and conditions the definitions of testimonial and endorsement under the final rule are intended to capture activities previously covered by the cash solicitation rule definition of testimonial under the final rule testimonial means any statement by a current client or investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser i about the client or investor s experience with the investment adviser or its supervised persons ii that directly or indirectly solicits any current or prospective client or investor to be a client of or an investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser or iii that refers any current or prospective client or investor to be a client of or an investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser definition of endorsements under the final rule endorsement means any statement by a person other than a current client or investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser that i indicates approval support or recommendation of the investment adviser or its supervised persons or describes that person s experience with the investment adviser or its supervised persons ii directly or indirectly solicits any current or prospective client or investor to be a client of or an investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser or iii refers any current or prospective client or investor to be a client of or an investor in a private fund advised by the investment adviser disclosure oversight and disqualification provisions the marketing rule prohibits the use of testimonials and endorsements in an advertisement unless the adviser satisfies certain disclosure oversight and disqualification requirements disclosure advertisements must clearly and prominently disclose whether the person giving the testimonial or endorsement the promoter is a current client or investor and whether the

trading on march 11 2021 the staff of the sec s division of investment management issued a statement addressing cross trading practices under rule 17a 7 of the 1940 act and requesting feedback on ways to enhance the regulatory regime governing cross trades in the statement the staff noted that consideration on potential amendments to rule 17a 7 is on the sec s rulemaking agenda background on december 3 2020 the sec adopted new rule 2a 5 under the 1940 act which establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 act and new rule 31a 4 which establishes relevant record keeping requirements to support fair value determinations rules 2a 5 and 31a 4 became effective on march 8 2021 with a compliance date of september 8 2022 readily available market quotations rule 2a 5 provides that a market quotation is readily available only when that quotation is a quoted price unadjusted in active markets for identical investments that the fund can access at the measurement date provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable the sec explains this definition is consistent with the definition of a level 1 input in the fair value hierarchy outlined in u s gaap a security will be considered to have readily available market quotations if its value is determined solely by reference to these level 1 inputs fair value as defined in the act and further defined in rule 2a 5 therefore must be used in all other circumstances in the adopting release the sec addressed concerns raised by commenters regarding the application of the new definition of readily available market quotations on cross trades under rule 17a 7 rule 17a 7 permits purchase or sale transactions between a fund and certain affiliates referred to as cross trades if certain protective conditions are met among those conditions rule 17a 7 generally requires that cross trades i involve a security for which market quotations are readily available and ii be effected at the independent current market price of the security the sec reiterated that the definition of readily available market quotations will apply in all contexts under the 1940 act and the rules thereunder including rule 17a 7 and accordingly certain securities that had been previously viewed as having readily available market quotations and being available to cross trade under rule 17a 7 may not meet our new definition and thus would not be available for such trades for example the sec explained that evaluated prices indications of interest and accommodation quotes would not be readily available market quotations under rule 17a 7 compliance with the definition of readily available market quotations may require funds to reevaluate or change their cross trading practices the sec acknowledged that many cross trades are executed in reliance on certain sec no action letters and that the sec staff is reviewing these letters to determine whether to withdraw them or portions thereof the sec separately noted that consideration of potential updates to rule 17a 7 is on the sec s rulemaking agenda and welcomed public input statement the sec staff acknowledged that cross trading practices have evolved over the last several decades in the statement the staff identified the following four areas where industry feedback would be particularly

are not publicly reported commissioner elad l roisman also issued a separate statement the same day supporting of the staff s decision to seek feedback on rule 17a 7 he wrote during the comment process for we heard that rule 2a 5 and its definition of readily available market quotation would likely affect the ability of funds to trade fixed income securities with their affiliates these were important concerns and remain so today i am grateful that the staff is moving forward in reviewing rule 17a 7 and prioritizing questions related to fixed income in particular this past year we have all seen that our fixed income markets are critical to the functioning of our other securities markets and our economy more broadly i look forward to hearing insights from commenters about how we can

february 4 2021 the sec published a request for comments on potential reform measures for money market funds mmfs as described in a report issued by the president s working group on financial markets pwg on december 22 2020 entitled overview of recent events and potential reform options for money market funds report pwg report findings the pwg studied the effects of the covid 19 pandemic on the short term funding markets the report noted that in march 2020 short term funding markets came under stress due to growing economic concerns related to the pandemic and an overall flight to liquidity and quality among investors it further detailed that while government mmfs saw significant inflows in march 2020 the prime and tax exempt mmf sectors faced significant outflows and increasingly illiquid markets for the funds assets and as a result began to contribute to general stress in short term funding markets before the federal reserve established facilities to support these markets including mmfs the report presented observations that these events occurred despite multiple prior reform efforts to make mmfs more resilient to credit and liquidity stresses due to the structural vulnerabilities of prime and tax exempt mmfs the pwg stated that it was incumbent upon financial regulators to examine the events of march 2020 closely and in particular the role operation and regulatory framework for these mmfs with a view toward potential improvements the working group proposed the following reform options for prime and tax exempt mmfs removal of the tie between mmf liquidity and fee and gate thresholds reformed conditions for imposing redemption gates imposition of a minimum balance at risk changes to mmf liquidity management countercyclical weekly liquid asset requirements floating net asset value requirements for all prime and tax exempt mmfs a swing pricing requirement capital buffer requirements a requirement for liquidity exchange bank membership and new requirements governing sponsor support the pwg noted in the report that it is not currently endorsing a particular measure rather the working group emphasized that any policy reform should be evaluated in terms of its ability to advance the overarching goals of reform including whether such policy updates effectively address the mmf structural vulnerabilities that contributed to stress in short term funding markets improve the resilience and functioning of short term funding markets and reduce the likelihood that official sector interventions and taxpayer support will be needed to halt future mmf runs or to address stresses in short term funding markets more generally request for comments the sec requested comments on i the potential policy measures described in the report both individually and in combination ii the effectiveness of previously enacted mmf reform and iii the effectiveness of implementing policy measures proposed in the report in addition to or in place of

grand rapids mich the shelves at big box stores have been unpredictable at best when it comes to produce a supply shortage on many fresh items decimated produce sections and butcher counters all of the last year and a half even a shortage on shipping pallets themselves slowed the flow of product around the country but for stores who bought local and farms that sold local the loss of chain markets was the gain of small ones we re not reliant on that national source of supply said alan hartline owner of kingma s market in grand rapids when the shortage happened early in the pandemic customers began to recognize that we are still in stock and it largely had to do with where kingma s was buying from their partnerships from their butcher items to their baked goods and vegetables come from west michigan it takes a lot of pressure off shipping and supply costs our local relationships they ve been somewhat self contained our meat comes from holland michigan our pork from coopersville said hartline that s helped us be somewhat resilient kingma s not only stayed in supply because of that but hartline believes they also picked up a lot of customers fed up with lacking or underwhelming produce kingma s relies on a few farm partners for fresh items including green wagon farm in ada heather anderson who owns the 18 acre farm with her husband chad said their ability to grow produce inside and year round has helped fill the local need for what national stores can t get easily we definitely had some people that kind of had some scares there s that nervousness rumbling through she said the restaurants obviously took a big hit and so we kind of thought we were going to lose out but we do have our grocery partners like kingma s because it s a short drive from the farm to the markets they serve produce that was in the ground one day can be in your grocery bag and on your plate the next the national shortages have shown the resiliency of the buy local concept it s certainly been a preferable model for local stores and farms we actually saw an increase in sales i think our best sales year yet said anderson people are appreciating their local sources we re on the good side of this said hartline if there is one

until monday june 14 2021 discussion of non gaap financial measures non gaap financial measures exclude the effect of share based compensation expense amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with acquisition amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisition and divestiture related costs restructuring and other related charges including but not limited to asset impairment charges employee severance costs and facilities related charges resolution of legal matters and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to marvell s core business marvell uses a non gaap tax rate to compute the non gaap tax provision this non gaap tax rate is based on marvell s estimated annual gaap income tax forecast adjusted to account for items excluded from gaap income in calculating marvell s non gaap income as well as the effects of significant non recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency marvell s non gaap tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non gaap tax rate such as tax law changes significant changes in marvell s geographic mix of revenue and expenses or changes to marvell s corporate structure for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 a non gaap tax rate of 5 0 has been applied to the non gaap financial results marvell believes that the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to marvell s financial condition and results of operations while marvell uses non gaap financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap consistent with this approach marvell believes that disclosing non gaap financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for gaap financial measures allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance externally management believes that investors may find marvell s non gaap financial measures useful in their assessment of marvell s operating performance and the valuation of marvell internally marvell s non gaap financial measures are used in the following areas management s evaluation of marvell s operating performance management s establishment of internal operating budgets management s performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models and management s determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance based equity awards adjustments may vary from award to award non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of marvell s business as determined in accordance with gaap as a result you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of marvell s results as reported under gaap the exclusion of the above items from our gaap financial metrics does not necessarily mean that these costs are unusual or infrequent marvell stand alone non gaap results represent combined non gaap results after excluding inphi results for the portion of the first quarter falling after the acquisition date we

yes he s popular he won re election in a landslide but he s still wrong about second amendment rights and now he s playing with fire with our elections vermont s liberal republican gov phil scott wants non citizens to be given the right to vote via breitbart advertisement vermont gov phil scott r is asking state lawmakers to pass an elections law that would allow non citizens across the state to vote in local municipality elections scott vetoed two pieces of legislation that sought to give non citizens the right to vote in local elections in montpelier and winooski vermont however he said he is not opposed to the plan but wants state legislatures to send him a bill that would give non citizens the right to vote statewide in local elections this is an important policy discussion that deserves further consideration and debate such a statewide policy could mean that legal immigrants with green cards and work visas would be allowed to vote in vermont s local elections like school board mayoral and city council races this isn t the first time scott has decided to betray the party after the 2018 school shooting in parkland florida scott along with then florida gov rick scott passed laws that increased the purchasing age for all firearms to 21 most states had long held that those 18 years of age or older could purchase rifles or shotguns while a handgun purchase was always set at 21 now in both states scores of law abiding americans won t be allowed to exercise their second amendment rights vermont also expanded background checks and banned so called high capacity magazines and bump stocks so maybe we shouldn t be shocked scott feels this way but when it comes to elections the standard should be simple only american citizens can vote period

i remember an argument with a kid in eighth grade he claimed that everything people do is equally selfish if you do not give money to charity you are selfish because you want to keep that money for yourself if you do give you are just as selfish because you want other people to think well of you and you want to think well of yourself all of life turns on private regard one might imagine that the kid s point was to criticize the human race for being so self involved quite the opposite his aim was to attack those who aspire to higher moral purposes they think they re better than the rest of us they re not logicians would note that when someone adopts the same principle to account for anything and everything that principle loses its explanatory value it s like saying god made me do it or it s simply fate by such terms all happenings are the same surely it is fairer to say that some actions are more selfish than others are no one disputes that selfishness plays a role in most of the things we do but there are different kinds and degrees of self interest giving money to an impoverished stranger is more expansive than buying a treat for yourself people who serve their country as soldiers police officers teachers and social workers are different from drug dealers and professional gamblers most of us would insist also that some individuals seem especially selfish they care only about themselves or so we think others go out of their way to assist the people they meet furthermore the range of people one cares about what i call the circle of compassion varies widely some people are generous only to their immediate family and beyond that to their extended kin and friends others cast a much wider net indeed the greatest souls care about the entire planet and its creatures can circumstances encourage people to be more or less selfish are some countries more selfish than others are although i could compare the united states to other places such as sweden brazil and uganda i will focus only on the u s here i insist that americans are by nature no more selfish than other people are but our society does allow us indeed encourages us to pursue that narrow vision of life in this pair of posts i try to show the social supports for this attitude to use the language of the sociologist social institutions established cultural patterns for addressing basic life issues make selfishness seem like the normal even optimal response to the challenges we face those institutions include economics politics family relations justice before the law education health care religion and recreation doubtless i could have chosen a less pejorative term than selfishness after all we americans are proud of our independence self reliance individualism and entrepreneurial spirit all these suggest that we like to take care of ourselves and accomplish personally determined goals selfishness is different it implies that we care little about the life possibilities of other people except as these contribute directly to our own fulfillment we see no reason to help those others we want to keep everything we have for ourselves part i of this post discusses the economic foundations of selfishness part ii considers other dimensions of life it is the essence of our society s capitalist economic system that individuals are able to accumulate wealth and to use that wealth as they see fit although the word wealth has several meanings we tend to associate it with money or at least with possessions that are convertible to money by such terms the wealthiest people are loaded for most americans the principal source of money is pay for employment whether that be salary fees tips commissions or wages however millions of others derive money from property they own especially from that sort capital which has the capacity to generate valued goods and services think of the businesses people own and their various stocks tools and technologies add to these abstract investments like stocks bonds and related commodities retired individuals and others who have reached the age of 59 ½ may also draw on heretofore tax protected retirement accounts either established privately or in conjunction with their employers although some retirees especially in the public sector participate in fixed benefit plans that guarantee a stream of income and healthcare support for life increasingly workers have shifted or been shifted to an individual retirement system whose reserves rise and fall with the vagaries of the financial markets what this means is that all too often americans become money hawks and that this quality of circumspection lasts for a lifetime they ask themselves when can i retire how much will i have to live on how will i handle healthcare costs for my spouse and myself will i run out of money before i die what will happen if i have to move to an assisted living facility will there be anything left for my heirs with the problem so defined many commit themselves to accumulating as much as possible because the future is unknowable especially the knowledge of how long one will live it is wise to have contingency funds financial advisers are all too willing to produce estimates of potential income streams based on hundreds of economic scenarios typically their counsel is to manage risk by investing more in the products they offer do this as early as possible be clear that most of this is idle speculation for vast segments of the population poorer people operate with much shorter economic horizons the poorest live day to day some of these people depend on social safety nets including for most seniors social security these are basic economic platforms which allow them to get by from day to day curious also is the fact that some members of the better off classes resent these supports in america people should take care of themselves people should work even if it s for the lowest wages to be sure we are entitled to think about other people and their predicaments as we will however we should acknowledge that our attitudes about such typically reflect our understandings of our own placement in society if we are preoccupied with attaining and then maintaining a secure life sphere where we can operate productively that anxiety hinders our generosity to others self regard is a very important matter so are the basic

the supreme court refused to hear a major case on homelessness letting stand a ruling that protects homeless people s right to sleep on the sidewalk or in a public park if no other shelter is available here homeless people line the sidewalk on 16th street in san diego on dec 16 2019 kohler is the ceo of the regional task force on the homeless and lives in little italy housing ends homelessness while it s a complex and layered issue if we start every conversation about homelessness with the truism that if a person has a home they are no longer homeless other aspects can fall into their proper place advertisement it is easier to talk about solutions to supportive services crisis response an adequate shelter system rental assistance property storage and outreach if we can agree that housing must be the backbone of all of these discussions california gov gavin newsom just announced a major infusion of state dollars to this end coupled with an unprecedented amount of one time federal dollars heading to local municipalities to assist in their recovery from the pandemic and another potential major revenue source if assembly bill 71 passes it is important that we use that money where it can make the most impact increasing the capacity of our housing stock diversifying our shelter system and investing in our homelessness supporting work force a recent report published by the regional task force on the homeless identified a 21 percent increase in the last year in the number of people accessing homeless services in the county significantly there was a 78 percent increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness for the first time advertisement yet in the same year one challenged by a pandemic 6 028 people in san diego were helped to remain in or exit to a permanent housing setting it can be done the regional task force believes there are three primary areas where this windfall of funding should be focused with the majority of it going toward housing while building new affordable housing is critical it is not the only way to provide housing local leaders should be looking to acquire properties that can be easily turned into temporary and permanent housing san diego saw success last year with the purchase of old hotels through the state s project home key the governor is now expanding the resources available for us to continue doing this in a significant way no stone should go unturned no property should go unevaluated the county and every city in the region should actively be looking at properties in their jurisdiction and considering an application the region should also be making better use of its existing rental market with some creativity the units that already exist in san diego can be unlocked to help individuals families veterans and youth get off the streets nearly 40 percent of adults in san diego live with a roommate for example yet shared housing is not a strategy we typically think of to end homelessness advertisement the regional task force on the homeless has contracted with brilliant corners a nationally known nonprofit that specializes in innovative methods to acquire units in the private rental market and make them available for homeless households just last month brilliant corners cultivated 24 new units of housing through private landlords willing to rent to people experiencing homelessness scaling this program up could lead to hundreds of new units of housing strategically housing needs to be the priority however there is an opportunity and need to improve the regional shelter system so that people have somewhere to live while waiting to be matched with housing resources the shelter system needs to be more diverse to include places to go for example for women who cannot be around men shelters should better accommodate the aging homeless population many of whom have disabilities and lack any income or some people have pets they do not want to leave behind additionally every government owned parcel in the region should be assessed for its viability as a place where people can live or shelter safely temporarily regional leaders need to be creative and consider all options having low barriers to entry and high focus on housing as the end goal on these lots can better serve our neighbors who are experiencing homelessness than can a sidewalk a bench or a park advertisement and finally once someone has been housed there is still a need for people to work with them to ensure they are remaining in a stable situation the pandemic has taxed a work force that is already in a high stress environment san diego needs to invest in the training and paying of the workers who take on this incredible challenge homelessness is solvable as a region we have an incredible opportunity in front of us to do just that let s be thoughtful and strategic about how and where we are investing our resources

toyota motor selects nutanix cloud platform to realize a new way of working tweet nutanix nasdaq ntnx a leader in private cloud hybrid and multicloud computing today announced toyota motor corp head office toyota city aichi president and representative director akio toyoda has adopted the nutanix cloud platform to build a virtual desktop infrastructure vdi environment that can run 3d cad software delivering a new way of working for its engineering design group toyota an automobile manufacturer with approximately 360 000 employees worldwide was quick to announce its commitment to work style reform in 2016 and has introduced a work from home program for about 13 000 employees however there were varying degrees of adoption among different departments for example the engineering design group was not able to support a remote work model for all employees team members had to work from their physical workstations in the office whenever working on design projects using 3d cad software in addition the dx promotion division was facing challenges with workstation maintenance and procurement costs to shift gears and solve the issue toyota decided to leverage hyper converged infrastructure hci to build a vdi environment that can support high performance applications and run 3d cad software the nutanix cloud platform stood out for its ability to support virtual graphics processing unit vgpu functions required to render 3d graphics in hci virtual environments in addition nutanix s flexibility and scalability were important factors to help the team quickly respond to changing business demands the nutanix cloud platform enabled a vdi environment for approximately 1 000 devices and was up and running far ahead of toyota s initial schedule to expand its vdi environment employees in the engineering design group also said the move enabled them to work in a new way and this became even more important when they were forced to work from home due to the spread of covid 19 but were able to continue perorming design work without interruptions moving forward our plan is to roll out similar systems not only to toyota motor but also to toyota group companies said the dx promotion division s masanobu takahisa in the future we hope to also support cae software on the vdi environment and continue to promote work style reform in the engineering design group in addition to expanding work style options for employees in its engineering design group the move to nutanix enabled toyota to consolidate shared and underutilized workstations into its vdi environment with the aim of eventually cutting the number of workstations to approximately half which would also result in significant cost reductions toyota is a leading global company in the manufacturing industry enabling employees to embrace the future of work we are proud to have helped toyota implement a new way of working which was previously thought to be difficult to achieve said matt young svp of sales asia pacific and japan at nutanix supporting quotes from toyota employees due to the covid 19 pandemic the elementary school that my child attends was closed in march 2020 and i was also forced to work from home said naomi tsuji of the advanced body technology development division thanks to the 3d cad environment on vdi i have been able to perform design work at home without any inconvenience when we would go to manufacturing sites for meetings we had no choice but to present our designs using paper drawings said yugo ichida of the commercial zev fundamental development division i always thought communication would be smoother if i could use 3d cad now we can have deeper and better discussions while looking at the 3d cad models together discussing the improved work efficiency masami uehata of the zev b d lab added before deploying nutanix paper drawings had to be printed and taken outside the office with nutanix we can communicate with our clients and other departments while showing the 3d cad screen during meetings being able to make decisions on the spot has allowed us to work more efficiently and reduce the amount of work we have to take home about nutanix nutanix is a

this article is more than 2 years old filmpublicityarchive united archives via getty images the 1000 year period between the fall of the western roman empire and the renaissance is typically called the middle ages a period when the government and economy was largely feudal feudalism is a broad term to describe the complex interdependent relationships between various classes of people in society during the middle ages people in the 21st century typically see feudalism as a bad thing and more importantly something from the distant past lords and ladies vassals paying homage fiefs and serfs are all language that at most are used figuratively and pejoratively today yet two feudal terms landlord and tenant live on not only in our popular conception of the relationship between people in the housing market but also in federal state and local law that could be changing with a new proposal in ohio that would replace landlord and tenant with housing provider and resident if you don t know the scene from monty python where dennis an ordinary briton sometime in post roman england challenges king arthur on violence inherent in the system of feudalism you won t forget it if it wasn t so serious it would be funny that this dialogue is not too different from the one going on today at least between so called tenant advocates and local elected officials arthur shut up will you shut up dennis ah now we see the violence inherent in the system arthur shut up dennis oh come and see the violence inherent in the system help help i m being repressed arthur bloody peasant dennis oh what a give away did you hear that did you hear that eh that s what i m on about did you see him repressing me you saw it didn t you today dennis might get a job at the ironically wealthy organ at in the ivory tower of princeton the eviction lab citing eviction averages as the basis for bad and even bizarre housing policy what helps the eviction lab successfully foist it s false narrative you can read about an example of the faulty use of data here and shady data because there remains a sense among the general public that there is a profound power imbalance between people who own and people who rent housing here s what i said in an editorial published friday in the columbus dispatch the truth is that most housing providers aren t anywhere close to being lords at all according to the department of housing and urban development hud there are between 10 million and 11 million individual investor landlords managing an average of two units each many with just one unit overall about half of the 45 million rental units are owned and operated by individuals ordinary people of those a harvard study found that a decline in low cost units brought their share of the national rental stock down from 33 percent in 2012 to just 25 percent in 2017 with decreases in all 50 states and washington dc why are many smaller housing providers the ones who provide most of the low cost rental options in the country getting out of the business it s becoming impossible to operate in an environment where literally dozens of regulations imposing requirements ranging from registering tenants to vote to banning eviction during the school year are being passed by local governments across the country why is this happening because people are persuaded that there is a power imbalance between housing providers and residents of rental housing an imbalance favoring housing providers but tenants are not forced to live anywhere they don t want to like medieval serfs unless housing is in very short supply when housing is scarce and demand is rising prices go up when this happens people with less money do indeed experience what buyers in any market feel when there is inflation fewer choices as their money buys a lot less of everything it s simple if we want to empower people who are looking for housing the best way to do this is to allow the production of a lot of housing everywhere of all kinds the proposal to replace the terms landlord and tenant will not produce more housing by itself but it is an essential step to rewire the popular perception and align it with reality most housing providers and their customers are hardworking people trying to make a living and they aren t generally at enmity with one another eviction is a vanishingly small problem less than 1 of leases end up with eviction in seattle and nobody rents property only to evict people changing the language is a small but important step to moving beyond the false eviction narrative and toward more collaborative and truly helpful housing policy
the food and drug administration on monday approved biogen s alzheimer s treatment ushering in the first new drug for the disease in nearly two decades the drug which was previously known as aducanumab but will be sold under the brand name aduhelm is designed to erode the sticky plaque that builds up in the brains of people with alzheimer s scientists have theorized that the substance kills brain cells and causes the memory loss that characterizes the disease in clinical trials aduhelm reduced the levels of those plaques but wasn t definitively shown to improve memory and cognition the fda approved the drug under a special accelerated pathway that allows for the use of drugs that are reasonably likely to have a benefit for patients even when there is uncertainty about how well they work an fda advisory committee said in november that biogen s tests had failed to show that the drug effectively treated alzheimer s the fda generally follows the advice of its advisory committees there has been considerable public debate on whether aduhelm should be approved as is often the case when it comes to interpreting scientific data the expert community has offered differing perspectives dr patrizia cavazzoni the director of the fda s center for drug evaluation and research said in a statement on monday the agency concluded that the benefits of aduhelm for patients with alzheimer s disease outweighed the risks of the therapy close to 6 million americans have alzheimer s meaning the market for the drug could be substantial biogen hasn t said how much it will charge for the treatment citi and svb leerink analysts have estimated that aduhelm could drive us 10 billion to us 12 billion in annual revenue biogen has invested more than us 2 billion in developing aducanumab and other experimental alzheimer s drugs biogen s stock surged 58 percent to us 450 62 after the approval decision giving the company a market value of about us 69 billion though the clinical trial found that aduhelm worked on a subset of participants the fda will allow for widespread use of the treatment patients will need brain scans to monitor for small hemorrhages known as amyloid related imaging abnormalities or aria neither biogen nor the fda immediately disclosed when it would become available aducanumab s rocky road to the fda almost ended in failure 2 years ago biogen s fda application hinged on two identical late stage clinical trials that were shut down in early 2019 after an interim analysis indicated they would likely fail but biogen didn t cut its losses the company continued to parse the data roughly six months later biogen surprised the drug industry by announcing that a subset of participants in one of the trials had been showing positive signs the participants amyloid plaque levels were down and their ability to recall words remember life events prepare meals and complete other everyday tasks had improved the company said those test results were the bedrock of biogen s fda application but data from the other failed late stage trial and another early stage trial were also included the separate outcomes of the late stage or phase three tests were a point of contention during the fda s review of the drug david knopman a neurologist who was involved in biogen s clinical trials last year called on the biotech firm to run a new late stage trial saying the data biogen had presented didn t prove that the drug helped patients perfection may be the enemy of the good but for aducanumab the evidence doesn t even rise to good he wrote to the fda in october contrary to the hope that aducanumab will help alzheimer patients the evidence shows it will offer improvement to none it will harm some of those exposed and it will consume enormous resources the advisory committee which included researchers clinicians and a biostatistician largely said that biogen s argument in favor of approval was full of holes but fda officials said they found the data from the successful phase three trial robust and exceptionally persuasive and determined that the positive trial results could back up biogen s application biogen spent 2 billion developing its alzheimer s drugs over the past 5 years brian abrahams an rbc capital markets analyst estimated in january that biogen had a 15 percent chance of fda approval others placed biogen s odds closer to 40 or 60 percent citing cases in which the fda had approved products for previously untreatable diseases those odds looked even better after the fda delayed its decision deadline to june 7 from march 7 deadline extensions commonly lead to an approval analysts said in january patient advocacy groups also supported approval citing the lack of options for patients the last entirely new drug for alzheimer s namenda was approved in 2003 for people with moderate to severe forms of the disease the other drugs to hit the market since have been combinations of new and existing products the alzheimer s field has been filled with trial failures leading several large pharmaceutical companies to end their work in the area biogen has spent at least us 2 billion developing three potential treatments over the past five years according to financial statements one of those drugs was shelved in 2019 because of poor trial results while another ban2401 is still being tested by a partner eisai biogen s strategy of targeting the sticky amyloid plaque has been abraded by drug failure after drug failure from other companies the theory got some support in january when eli lilly reported success with an amyloid targeting drug in a phase two study but most drug companies still working in alzheimer s treatments have left the amyloid argument behind instead targeting other neurological elements in the hopes of treating the disease this article was originally published by business insider more from business insider
juniper networks and nec build new network for herotel to create south africa s first commercial network driven by segment routing juniper networks nyse jnpr a leader in secure ai driven networks and nec corporation nec news alert tse 6701 a leading global integrator of it and network technologies today announced that they have worked with herotel south africa s largest fixed wireless service provider to enable the country s first commercial network to deploy segment routing as part of a significant network upgrade initiative herotel s operational drivers for this innovation and investment include scalability and reach agility cost effectiveness and the ability to consistently provide a superior user experience that can be tailored to regional requirements since its foundation in 2014 herotel s overarching mission has been to drive ubiquitous affordable internet connectivity and access to services and content across south africa s 1 22 million km² including communities in remote districts in addition to rapid organic growth of its network the acquisition of numerous local service providers over a short period of time has further broadened herotel s reach however this approach has also led to a disparate cost inefficient infrastructure in need of simplification and alignment to meet its objectives over the past year this need has been exacerbated by significantly increased demand for secure reliable connectivity and bandwidth during work at home and extended lock down periods with thousands of workers accessing corporate resources from unknown home networks furthermore given the large distances between data centers and other points of presence the ability to store and stream bandwidth heavy content closer to as many customers as possible has become another imperative for herotel herotel chose to build its new ip network based on segment routing principles augmenting traditional mpls multi protocol label switching techniques to maximize operational flexibility and agility and to help deliver improved consistent user experiences at scale and cost effectively segment routing is a control plane architecture which simplifies traffic engineering enabling the path that data packets take across the network to be determined in advance this means fewer network elements are involved avoiding slow response to sudden network changes it also supports the application qos quality of service mapping specific applications and end users to preferential network service paths additional information herotel has now consolidated 19 separate networks and operating frameworks into a single architecture in support of its simplification and cost control program having acquired 40 different service providers between 2018 and 2020 during south africa s initial national lock down period starting in march 2020 herotel experienced a 30 percent increase in network traffic for the remainder of 2021 herotel aims to bring another 60 000 new customers

the second home co ownership startup announced it will only buy homes valued at 2 million or more in napa and sonoma and pledged a 20 000 donation to an affordable housing related nonprofit for each pacaso home sold second home co ownership startup pacaso has implemented a number of operational changes in response to community members in napa and sonoma counties voicing concerns about the company taking over properties in their neighborhoods in april pacaso filed a lawsuit against the city of st helena in napa valley california after the city banned the startup s fractional homeownership model stating it violates a city ordinance prohibiting timeshares pacaso however disagrees claiming that the company s properties are not timeshares as of monday pacaso had four properties in the napa sonoma region listed on its website valued between 2 8 million and 4 99 million and available for between 418 000 and 745 000 per share amid backlash from community members in napa and sonoma pacaso announced this week it would only buy homes in the area valued at more than 2 million so that it would not compete with homes in the markets median price tier of about 800 000 in addition pacaso pledged a 20 000 donation 2 500 for each one eighth ownership interest for each pacaso home sold to an unspecified local nonprofit that aids in housing affordability the company is also adding new regulations to its owner code of conduct in relation to noise levels at properties with new limits on the level of decibels output by home sound systems the code of conduct had already prohibited parties and vacation rentals at pacaso properties furthermore a pacaso appointed point of contact will also be available receive feedback from community members 24 7 the updates to the owner code of conduct will be effective across all of pacaso s markets of operation but the company is still evaluating whether or not its new policies specific to napa and sonoma will extend into other markets at some point the moves by the company came after pacaso purchased a home at 1627 rainier avenue in napa in april for 1 13 million and the community voiced its displeasure at pacaso taking away a property considered to be part of the area s workforce housing inventory pacaso subsequently decided that it will resell the property to a single owner rather than as fractional shares the misconception in napa is that we re a timeshare and that we re commercializing residential neighborhoods and the misconception is just not true austin allison ceo of pacaso told inman with co ownership you re buying real estate you re not buying time allison went on to give an example about how an individual who purchases a timeshare at a marriott club is investing in time at the club and would essentially be left empty handed if the company went out of business however someone who invests in a share of a pacaso home becomes part owner of the property and if pacaso were to go out of business that factor would not change the property owner s ownership status allison also pointed out that pacaso owned homes are a fairly small percentage of the homes owned by second homeowners or investors in the region he added that in one recent month out of 700 homes sold in sonoma pacaso represented co owners in about two of those home purchases but about 50 percent of those home sales were not categorized with a primary owner exemption meaning that those sales were made by either second homeowners or investors so we re one of a fraction of a single percent of second homes that are being purchased in these local markets allison said so i think there s absolutely reason valid reason for people to be frustrated right now around housing still some community members in napa and sonoma have felt like the company has overextended its reach into the local housing stock it s obvious the community doesn t want them there just like here brad day a spokesperson for sonomans together opposing pacaso stop told the press democrat a company with a moral compass would announce that they are backing out of all residential neighborhoods fractional ownership time shares destroy the fabric of communities by turning local neighborhoods into a revolving door of people on vacation pacaso is kryptonite to communities stop has formed a petition on change org against pacaso s fractional ownership homes in sonoma and the surrounding neighborhoods which over 1 890 people have signed as of monday with its deep pockets and slick marketing pacaso thinks it can do business in any community and ignore regulations pertaining to time shares vacation rentals and transient occupancy the petition reads their position seems to be that because a vacation home is owned by an llc rather than being rented none of these regulations apply houses listed on pacaso could have been sold to local families the petition continues instead they are destined to be flipped into vacation homes it is unlikely that sonoma residents will ever get to live there meanwhile the increasing demand for vacation homes will continue to drive prices out of reach for working class families susan gorin first district supervisor in sonoma county who has a fractional ownership on a home in lake tahoe herself added that fractional ownership on a property in a resort town versus an established residential town is a very different situation it is not surprising neighbors are angry about this ownership model intruding into their neighborhoods especially when there is a vacation rental exclusion zone already overlaid on that neighborhood gorin said to the press democrat there is an impact on neighborhoods from fractional ownership homes a single family home might have a certain level of services coming into the neighborhood to maintain the house but probably not at the frequency required for this ownership model pacaso told inman that the average home the company owns in napa and sonoma is valued at about 4 million which places the majority of its inventory in a luxury tier amid the general outcry however some locals have expressed their support for pacaso empty second homes with absentee owners are not a good solution for the economic recovery of our small business community travis stanley napa chamber of commerce ceo said in press materials provided by pacaso to the press democrat pacaso s business model actually provides more sustainable economic support and utilizes local vendors to buy sell sustain and maintain the properties on a year round basis allison told inman much the same adding that through co ownership pacaso s business model allows second homeowners who might otherwise be looking for housing stock within the median price range of 800 000 to climb into a higher price tier by sharing that cost with other co owners thereby freeing up lower priced homes for locals he also added that it felt like the company was bearing the brunt of pent up frustration from locals at increasingly high prices in the market which are a result of a variety of market factors at play not necessarily just pacaso entering napa and sonoma we actually relieve pressure from the median price tier not add to it allison said even though what we re doing even though co ownership is not new and we didn t invent that the service that we re providing is new and there s a lot of attention around pacaso right now and i think it s easy to point at somebody and direct your frustration pacaso s federal lawsuit against st helena which was filed on april 6 aims to guarantee the legally protected rights of homeowners to enjoy the benefits of owning property in the beautiful surrounds of st helena the lawsuit further claims that letters distributed by the city have scared real estate agents and chilled their efforts to buy and sell ownership interest in pacaso properties pacaso currently owns or manages five homes in st helena email

income of 6 3 million or 7 13 per diluted share compared to net income of 5 3 million or 5 95 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal year 2020 net sales for the first nine months of the current year amounted to 321 1 million a 5 5 percent decrease from the 339 7 million in sales for the same nine month period of last year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we had income from operations of 8 5 million after depreciation of 3 4 million the third fiscal quarter of the prior year generated income from operations of 0 6 million after depreciation of 3 3 million gross profit

million after depreciation expense of 10 3 million gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 was 33 2 million or 10 4 percent of net sales compared to 35 2 million or 10 3 percent of net sales for the same period in fiscal year 2020 dana s weber chief executive officer and board chair stated business conditions for our current quarter are significantly different compared to last year s third fiscal quarter world steel producers struggled to keep pace with growing demand and various supply constrictions resulting in a wide spread short supply of steel as a result the cost of our raw materials increased substantially and steel raw material availability tightened even further we have worked to pass through and stay ahead of these increasing costs by increasing the sales prices where possible the business environment of the current fiscal quarter compares favorably to that we experienced in our third quarter of fiscal year 2020 during which the pandemic became wide spread and crude oil prices sank the extreme winter conditions faced by our oklahoma facilities in february 2021 adversely affected gas and power supply and limited our operations for a significant part of that weather event yet the engagement of our employees allowed us to mitigate the overall impact our strong balance sheet and liquidity position have positioned us well to successfully navigate and gain strength since the onset of those unforeseen global events we remain focused on financial strength and flexibility our total cash and availability is 77 5 million which we believe to be a competitive advantage selling general and administrative expenses were 10 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 9 3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 sg a expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 reflect an increase in costs associated with increased profitability such as company wide incentive compensation and variable pay programs sg a expenses were 24 3 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 and 26 5 million for the first nine month period of fiscal year 2020 there is less discretionary spending and company wide incentive compensation in the first nine months of the current year because the first two quarters of fiscal 2021 were impacted by the pandemic and low oil prices whereas the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 were not significantly affected by the pandemic and low oil prices interest expense was 0 3 million and 0 7 million in the third quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively interest expense was 1 0 million and 2 4 million in the first nine month periods of the current and prior fiscal years the differential in interest expense between the periods is primarily due to lower debt levels capital expenditures incurred amounted to 1 5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 10 7 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 our capital investments were largely focused on

increased steadily since 2010 after falling by 17 during the great recession of 2007 09 typically home improvement spending falls during economic downturns however the covid 19 recession has proven to be an exception to the rule one key reason is that the current recession disproportionately impacted lower wage workers who are less likely to own homes on the other hand higher income homeowners didn t suffer the same level of job losses or reduced wages but benefited from reduced spending on things like eating out and travel which freed up cash for other expenses with many of such homeowners

lu ping china daily experts encourage further opening of financial markets with rmb denominated financial assets more attractive than ever to global investors experts are saying that china should continue to steadily open its financial markets most economies worldwide are still paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic and commodity prices recently surged to record highs financial assets such as rmb denominated ones which can provide stable returns are being chased by investors worldwide but inflation has become a major factor in diluting gains in april holdings of rmb bonds by foreign institutions rose month on month by 64 86 billion yuan 10 16 billion such institutions favor the treasury bond issued by the central authorities in china in april their holdings of such bonds rose by 51 74 billion yuan month on month according to china central depository and clearing co financial conditions have continued to improve in the united states the eurozone and the united kingdom according to research by moody s investors service while such conditions in emerging markets have recovered to their historical average policy support and the progress made with rolling out of covid 19 vaccines have boosted these conditions in addition to the attraction of financial assets foreign capital inflows to china s financial markets have been triggered by the widening gap between yields of chinese treasury bonds and those issued in the us the chinese currency has gained more than 10 percent against the us dollar over the past year buoyed by the economic rebound from the pandemic and capital inflows from overseas it recently reached highs last seen in may 2018 but this rapid appreciation is expected to be short lived because market forces will result in a two way fluctuation of the exchange rate according to experts the increased participation of foreign capital in china s financial markets will not change in the short and medium term zhong hong vice president of the bank of china s research institute said foreign investors will continue to buy rmb denominated assets this year while there may still be some uncertainties and fluctuations in the global market these investors are attracted by china s sound economy and its relatively stable interest and exchange rates compared with those elsewhere in the world zhong said quotas option fang xinghai vice chairman of the china securities regulatory commission said chinese regulators would take measures to keep the capital market stable during further opening up and prevent large scale fluctuations which can be caused by cross border capital flows he added that one option is to apply quotas to control daily southbound and northbound trading through the shanghai shenzhen and hong kong stock connect programs in the event of foreign capital coming in and causing big fluctuations in the stock market we can temporarily stop trading fang said during a panel discussion at the boao forum for asia in april we also have measures to prevent the market being affected by major fluctuations which can result from large inflows and outflows of foreign capital he added at the end of march foreign capital accounted for about 5 percent of china s stock market he said adding that in comparison the proportion of chinese stocks in major global indexes remains very low as foreign capital floods increasingly into the domestic stock market it is playing a more important role in pricing shares the fact that such capital is mainly held by institutional investors means it can contribute to market stability fang said he added that financial regulators are considering further increasing the proportion of chinese stocks in major global markets and expanding the scale of inclusion to attract more foreign capital xuan changneng deputy head of the state administration of foreign exchange or safe said moderate net inflows of cross border investments in securities mainly in stocks and bonds have been maintained so far this year in line with the generally stable situation on foreign exchanges john waldron president and chief operating officer of the goldman sachs group said pilot projects providing increased free convertibility of foreign exchange have been launched recently in beijing and shenzhen guangdong province he said these projects indicate the right direction for financial opening up and the opening of capital services is good news for many foreign funded enterprises entering china on may 6 in the latest move to assist the opening up of china s financial sector the people s bank of china the central bank released new detailed rules for the proposed greater bay area cross boundary wealth management connect the rules include quotas for residents of the gba to make certain financial investments wealth management connect is a pilot program aimed at helping residents of the gba which comprises nine cities in guangdong along with hong kong and macao to make cross boundary investments in wealth management products or wmps offered by banks in the gba the proposed aggregate quota of 150 billion yuan and a limit of 1 million yuan per person for cross boundary wmp investments in the gba is particularly noteworthy sonny hsu vice president and senior credit officer at moody s investors service said the proposed rules are positive news for the asset management units of banks on the chinese mainland hong kong and macao however the banks potential revenue from the program will be limited as northbound and southbound investments are initially capped at 150 billion yuan hsu added analysts said the connect program if implemented will mark a further step toward convertibility of the renminbi under the capital account a pilot area has also been established in the southern province of hainan on april 9 safe and other financial regulatory departments jointly issued a set of new policies to further boost opening up of the financial sector at hainan free trade port these rules allow certain institutional investors to freely send funds both incoming and outgoing by adopting required methods and to make investments under designated quotas meanwhile foreign exchange registration procedures have been simplified joe yizhou he managing director of australian capital equity has witnessed china s accelerated financial opening up since regulators announced a series of policies in 2018 these measures included lifting the foreign ownership cap for banks and asset management companies treating domestic and foreign capital equally and allowing some financial institutions to set up branches and subsidiaries at the same time to date policy implementation has been efficient said he who is working on establishing a renminbi investment entity at hainan free trade port through the qualified foreign limited partnership program the special policies in hainan can facilitate foreign investment into china as the application procedure and market access requirements have been simplified and a greater level of flexibility is offered compared with other regions in china he said china s capital markets in particular have experienced deeper reform and further opening up with china s stock markets becoming more welcoming to the light asset new economy sector i have seen more entrepreneurs in this sector choose the a share market as their ipo initial public offering destination he said policy support although foreign capital was introduced into the a share market almost two decades ago there has been an acceleration in recent years following the launch of the shanghai shenzhen hong kong stock connect program the acceleration was boosted when msci indexes which measure stock market performance in a particular area incorporated china stocks in 2018 in the private equity market many foreign investors who have a wait and see attitude are expected to make more rmb denominated direct investment due to the arrival of policies to further open up the financial market from my experience the foreign exchange policies so far support the free conversion of a certain amount of profits that we earned in china and there are basically no obstacles in doing so he said as china has swiftly controlled the pandemic foreign investors have shown increased confidence and optimism toward the country s markets in addition to the secondary stock and bond markets they are paying more attention to equity investment especially in innovative and high tech companies according to experts australian capital equity is seeking investment opportunities in advanced fields such as the digital economy new lifestyles and technology innovation on april 20 president xi jinping said in a keynote speech delivered via video link to the opening ceremony of the boao forum for asia annual conference that china would continue to develop hainan free trade port and new systems for a higher standard open economy china will take an active part in multilateral cooperation on trade and investment fully implement the foreign investment law and its supporting rules and regulations cut further the negative list on foreign investment continue to develop the hainan free trade port and develop new systems for a higher standard open economy he said all are welcome to share in the vast opportunities of the chinese market the president said waldron from goldman sachs said that if china continues to improve laws and regulations in the financial sector in compliance with international standards and ensures unrestricted access for foreign investment the country can expect to attract more international investors and institutions the measures taken will further strengthen global investors confidence in the chinese market he said

paris alphabet inc s google agreed to pay french regulators a fine of nearly 270 million settling one of the first antitrust cases globally that allege the tech company abused its leading role in the digital advertising sector france s competition authority said it had also accepted a series of proposed commitments google made to settle the case including promises to make it easier for competitors to use its online ad tools the wall street journal first reported the proposed settlement last month google s commitments will be binding for three years the authority said google to spend 3 8 million to settle accusations of hiring pay biases we have agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data and use our tools with other ad technologies said maria gomri google s legal director in france in a blog post we re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms she said while google s commitments are binding only in france they will become a template for how the company could resolve similar complaints from publishers and advertising technology rivals elsewhere potentially changing how google operates its system around the world gomri said google would test its changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly including some globally as part of the case the french competition authority alleged that the company s advertising server historically known as doubleclick for publishers and used by most large online publishers to put ad space up for sale gave google s online ad auction house adx an advantage in advertising auctions in part by providing information about rival bids the authority also alleged other forms of self preferencing between google s advertising technology tools including adx s offering better interoperability options to doubleclick for publishers these practices were particularly serious because of their powerful impact on online advertising intermediaries said isabelle de silva the head of the french competition authority in a press conference monday the regulator said google has made five general commitments as part of the settlement they include no longer allowing adx to use competitors bids to optimize its own bids and giving rival ad servers equal access to data about advertising auctions the regulator said an independent observer will be responsible for monitoring google s compliance and will report back to french regulators the settlement is part of a broader wave of antitrust enforcement against big technology companies on both sides of the atlantic last week the european union and the u k each said they were opening formal antitrust

ownership of some of the most widely used tools for buying selling and auctioning ads they have also criticized google for both owning and operating its own ad supported products such as google search and youtube saying that creates conflicts of interest that harm competition in online advertising a group of u s states led by texas sued google in december 2020 for allegedly operating a digital advertising monopoly the u k competition authority began an investigation in january into whether google s plan to remove user tracking tools called cookies from its chrome browser could hurt competition in the online ad industry the european commission the eu s top antitrust regulator has also been investigating google s advertising business the french case stems from a complaint brought to the authority in 2019 by a group of news publishers led by news corp the journal s parent company news corp which has historically been a vocal critic of google s role in the advertising technology industry has since made a pact with it to be paid for its content but remains the lead complainant in the case the french competition authority has been investigating potential anticompetitive behavior in the online advertising business for several years publishing a report on the topic in 2018 the french authority spent about a year investigating the case brought by news corp and presented

loading loading nutanix solution enables toyota employees to use 3d cad design software remotely nutanix ntnx a leader in private cloud hybrid and multicloud computing today announced toyota motor corp head office toyota city aichi president and representative director akio toyoda has adopted the nutanix cloud platform to build a virtual desktop infrastructure vdi environment that can run 3d cad software delivering a new way of working for its engineering design group toyota an automobile manufacturer with approximately 360 000 employees worldwide was quick to announce its commitment to work style reform in 2016 and has introduced a work from home program for about 13 000 employees however there were varying degrees of adoption among different departments for example the engineering design group was not able to support a remote work model for all employees team members had to work from their physical workstations in the office whenever working on design projects using 3d cad software in addition the dx promotion division was facing challenges with workstation maintenance and procurement costs to shift gears and solve the issue toyota decided to leverage hyper converged infrastructure hci to build a vdi environment that can support high performance applications and run 3d cad software the nutanix cloud platform stood out for its ability to support virtual graphics processing unit vgpu functions required to render 3d graphics in hci virtual environments in addition nutanix s flexibility and scalability were important factors to help the team quickly respond to changing business demands the nutanix cloud platform enabled a vdi environment for approximately 1 000 devices and was up and running far ahead of toyota s initial schedule to expand its vdi environment employees in the engineering design group also said the move enabled them to work in a new way and this became even more important when they were forced to work from home due to the spread of covid 19 but were able to continue performing design work without interruptions moving forward our plan is to roll out similar systems not only to toyota motor but also to toyota group companies said the dx promotion division s masanobu takahisa in the future we hope to also support cae software on the vdi environment and continue to promote work style reform in the engineering design group in addition to expanding work style options for employees in its engineering design group the move to nutanix enabled toyota to consolidate shared and underutilized workstations into its vdi environment with the aim of eventually cutting the number of workstations to approximately half which would also result in significant cost reductions toyota is a leading global company in the manufacturing industry enabling employees to embrace the future of work we are proud to have helped toyota implement a new way of working which was previously thought to be difficult to achieve said matt young svp of sales asia pacific and japan at nutanix supporting quotes from toyota employees due to the covid 19 pandemic the elementary school that my child attends was closed in march 2020 and i was also forced to work from home said naomi tsuji of the advanced body technology development division thanks to the 3d cad environment on vdi i have been able to perform design work at home without any inconvenience when we would go to manufacturing sites for meetings we had no choice but to present our designs using paper drawings said yugo ichida of the commercial zev fundamental development division i always thought communication would be smoother if i could use 3d cad now we can have deeper and better discussions while looking at the 3d cad models together discussing the improved work efficiency masami uehata of the zev b d lab added before deploying nutanix paper drawings had to be printed and taken outside the office with nutanix we can communicate with our clients and other departments while showing the 3d cad screen during meetings being able to make decisions on the spot has allowed us to work more efficiently and reduce the amount of work we have to take

here s what you need to know america s most powerful battleships were never actually built the five montana class battleships leviathans designed to dwarf even the giant iowa class battleships were authorized for construction but never built victims of the ascendance of naval aviation nearly as large as a modern supercarrier the montana class like all battleships was made obsolete by the success of the aircraft carrier in the late 1930s the u s government recognizing the deteriorating world situation sought to rebuild u s naval power the crash of the stock market in october 1939 as well as the washington and london naval treaties had slowed the growth of the u s navy and reduced its tempo of peacetime operations by 1940 however with fighting raging in asia and europe it was clear the united states needed to beef up its defensive capability to deter attack or to prosecute a war if it were dragged into conflict in 1940 the federal government authorized the famous two ocean navy capability that laid the groundwork for the wartime u s navy that followed one set of authorized ships five montana class battleships to complement the iowa class battleships america s shipyards would split the work between the philadelphia navy yard two new york navy yard two and norfolk navy yard one numerous proposals were floated for the montana class ships though they all had one thing in common they were considerably larger than the iowas the iowa class battleships were 860 feet long displaced 58 000 tons fully loaded and featured nine 16 50 caliber main guns secondary armament was in the form of twenty 5 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of firing on targets in the air on land and at sea speed would have been 28 knots slower than the iowa class 33 knot top speed the montanas montana ohio maine new hampshire and louisiana would be slower than the iowas but much more heavily armed and armored one of the first designs of the class which never made it off paper was for an 860 foot long warship with a displacement of 52 000 tons with a trial displacement of 64 500 tons the ships would have been armed with twelve 16 50 caliber guns giving them twenty five percent more firepower in the main battery the twelve guns would have been installed in four three gun turrets two forward and two aft to the iowa classes two forward and one aft secondary armament would consist of twenty 5 inch 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of anti ship amphibious landing support and anti air defense by march 1940 navy ship architects floated a new even bigger design a battleship 1 050 feet long with a waterline beam of 120 feet the ship would have a standard displacement of 70 000 tons and a trial displacement of 80 000 tons the main battery would have stayed the same but the secondary battery would feature twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns the longer barrel length on the new 5 inch guns resulted in a higher velocity and longer range thus increasing the size of the battleship s protective bubble against aircraft officially the u s navy states the montanas would have been a compromise between the two designs though on the high end the navy s statistics for the ships include a length of 921 feet a beam of 121 feet and the same armament of twelve 16 50 guns and twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns top speed would have been the same as previous ships maxing out at 28 knots the navy states that the third design featured improved armor against shellfire and torpedo attacks over previous battleships and would have been the only new world war ii era u s battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own the montana class battleships would have served on the u s navy s battleship line prepared to duke it out with the opposing navy s own fleet of battleships in a decisive battle unfortunately for the battleship community the reign of the battlewagon was already coming to an end the attack on pearl harbor on december 7th 1941 and the destruction of the royal navy s force z on december 10th 1941 made it painfully clear that aircraft including aircraft carriers had eclipsed battleships as the primary weapon at sea the sinking of the battleship hms prince of wales and battlecruiser hms repulse for the loss of only three japanese aircraft demonstrated how much large surface ships were at the mercy of air power the montana battleships were initially delayed to prioritize new aircraft carrier construction then cancelled outright in 1943 the u s navy would not build a ship as large as the proposed montanas until 1955 when the supercarrier uss forrestal entered service like montana forrestal was approximately 900 feet long and had displaced 80 000 tons fully loaded unlike montana however it could pack up to eighty five aircraft of various types on its flight deck and hangar giving it a much greater striking range flexibility in adapting to various missions and the ability to rapidly replace lost combat power by simply adding more aircraft the u s navy never built more battleships after the iowa class let alone larger ones the montana class battleships were obsolete before the steel was cut for them tragic for battleship fans but proof that the navy was heeding trends and choosing to spend resources wisely during a turbulent and stressful time had the navy stubbornly pushed ahead and built the montanas a lack of carriers could have extended the length of the war and cost even more lives ironically had the montanas been built we might look back on the battleship era with considerably less pride and nostalgia than we do today kyle mizokami is a writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the diplomat foreign policy war is boring and the daily beast in 2009 he co founded the defense and
