stocks were generally higher even before the streaming video giant announced its latest financial results wall street stayed in a good mood on tuesday building on monday s gains with further advances the size of the move higher wasn t quite as big as yesterday but the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 and s p 500 gspc 1 20 were all up in the neighborhood of 1 on the day index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 12 338 s p 500 1 14 42 nasdaq 0 90 97 many stocks performed well during the regular trading session but many investors had their eyes focused squarely on what would happen after hours when netflix nflx 2 52 released its third quarter financial report after having struggled through a sluggish period following its boom during the early years of the covid 19 pandemic netflix gave some evidence that it s finally bouncing back and some investors think that it might be the first sign of a potential end to the long bear market that has plagued wall street since before 2022 began why netflix shares soared shares of netflix rocketed higher in after hours trading rising more than 14 the streaming video company s results were certainly far from perfect but they came in better than many had feared and showed netflix moving in the right direction the key metric that most people paid the closest attention to was netflix s total number of paid memberships globally that figure rose by 2 41 million over the past three months to 223 09 million worldwide and the gain was more than double the number of quarterly additions that netflix had previously projected other key measures of financial performance were mixed revenue slipped sequentially to 7 93 billion with year over year growth slowing to just 5 9 net income was down 3 5 to 1 40 billion resulting in earnings of 3 19 per share however free cash flow fcf bounced back from recent weakness reversing outflows of 106 million in the year ago period with positive fcf of 472 million netflix blamed the reduction in revenue between the second and third quarters entirely on foreign exchange effects on a currency neutral basis netflix saw continued strong growth in its international segments including 19 sales gains in the asia pacific region and in latin america as well as 13 in europe the middle east and africa indeed some of those headwinds are likely to plague netflix going forward as well the company projected fourth quarter revenue to fall further to 7 8 billion again because of the strength of the u s dollar it cited its new ad supported tier in helping to drive 4 5 million new subscriptions in the fourth quarter will ads work netflix spent considerable time talking about its new ad supported plans which will take effect not just in the u s but in nearly a dozen markets internationally as well viewers can expect five minutes of advertising per hour of content with prices 20 to 40 below the current entry level price of basic plans netflix reported that advertisers are excited about the opportunity to tap into its large customer base given that the 12 markets where netflix is rolling out its ad supported tier constitute about 75 of the global market with 140 billion in brand advertising getting hold of netflix inventory will be a lucrative proposition for advertisers on the other hand the move comes at a time when many investors are nervous about the prospects for businesses that rely on advertising revenue with the economy on precarious footing some fear that a slowdown or full blown recession could result in advertisers pulling back on their marketing spending that won t necessarily stop netflix s growth but it could weigh on short term results more broadly though signs that consumer facing businesses are holding up well could be extremely important in bolstering investor confidence in the end it ll be positive signs like this that pull stocks out of their current bear market once an inevitable recovery starts to generate cyclical business momentum across the economy

a surging us dollar is making local currencies weaker and contributing to skyrocketing prices of everyday goods and services the cost of living in cairo has soared so much that security guard mustafa gamal had to send his wife and year old daughter to live with his parents in a village 70 miles 112km south of the egyptian capital to save money gamal 28 stayed behind working two jobs sharing an apartment with other young people and eliminating meat from his diet the prices of everything have been doubled he says there was no alternative around the world people are sharing gamal s pain and frustration an auto parts dealer in nairobi kenya a seller of baby clothes in istanbul turkey and a wine importer in manchester united kingdom have the same complaint a surging united states dollar makes their local currencies weaker contributing to skyrocketing prices for everyday goods and services this is compounding financial distress at a time when families are already facing food and energy crunches tied to russia s invasion of ukraine a strong dollar makes a bad situation worse in the rest of the world says eswar prasad a professor of trade policy at cornell university many economists worry that the sharp rise of the dollar is increasing the likelihood of a global recession sometime next year the dollar is up 18 percent this year and last month hit a 20 year high according to the benchmark ice us dollar index which measures the dollar against a basket of key currencies the reasons for the dollar s rise are no mystery to combat soaring us inflation the federal reserve has raised its benchmark short term interest rate five times this year and is signalling more hikes are likely that has led to higher rates on a wide range of us government and corporate bonds luring investors and driving up the us currency most other currencies are much weaker by comparison especially in poor countries the indian rupee has dropped nearly 10 percent this year against the dollar the egyptian pound 20 percent and the turkish lira an astounding 28 percent celal kaleli 60 sells infant clothing and diaper bags in istanbul because he needs more lira to buy imported zippers and liners priced in dollars he has to raise prices for the turkish customers who struggle to pay him in the much diminished local currency we re waiting for the new year he says we ll look into our finances and we ll downsize accordingly there s nothing else we can do rich countries are not immune in europe which was already teetering toward recession amid soaring energy prices one euro is worth less than 1 for the first time in 20 years and the uk pound has plunged 18 percent from a year ago the pound recently flirted with dollar parity after new uk prime minister liz truss announced huge tax cuts that roiled financial markets and led to the removal of her treasury secretary bad news for the global economy ordinarily countries could get some benefit from falling currencies because it makes their products cheaper and more competitive overseas but at the moment any gain from higher exports is muted because economic growth is sputtering almost everywhere a rising dollar is causing pain overseas in several ways it makes other countries imports more expensive adding to existing inflationary pressures it squeezes companies consumers and governments that borrowed in dollars that s because more local currency is needed to convert into dollars when making loan payments it forces central banks in other countries to raise interest rates to try and prop up their currencies and keep money from fleeing their borders but those higher rates also weaken economic growth and drive up unemployment put simply the dollar s appreciation is bad news for the global economy says capital economics ariane curtis it is another reason why we expect the global economy to fall into recession next year in a gritty neighbourhood of nairobi known for fixing cars and selling auto parts businesses are struggling and customers unhappy with the kenyan shilling down 6 percent this year the cost of fuel and imported spare parts is soaring so much some people are choosing to ditch their cars and take public transportation this has been the worst says michael gachie purchasing manager with shamas auto parts customers are complaining a lot 2022 is uniquely painful gyrating currencies have caused economic pain around the world many times before during the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s for instance indonesian companies borrowed heavily in dollars during boom times then were wiped out when the indonesian rupiah crashed against the dollar a few years earlier a plunging peso delivered similar pain to mexican businesses and consumers the soaring dollar in 2022 is uniquely painful however it is adding to global inflationary pressures at a time when prices have already been soaring disruptions to energy and agriculture markets caused by the war in ukraine magnified supply constraints stemming from the covid 19 recession and recovery in manila raymond manaog 29 who drives the colourful philippine mini bus known as a jeepney complains that inflation and especially the rising price of diesel is forcing him to work more to get by what we have to do to earn enough for our daily expenses he says if before we travelled our routes five times now we do it six times in the indian capital new delhi ravindra mehta has thrived for decades as a broker for american almond and pistachio exporters but a record drop in the rupee on top of higher raw material and shipping costs has made the nuts much costlier for indian consumers in august india imported 400 containers of almonds down from 1 250 containers a year earlier mehta says if the consumer is not buying it affects the entire supply chain including people like me he says kingsland drinks one of the united kingdom s biggest wine bottlers was already getting squeezed by higher costs for shipping containers bottles caps and energy now the rocketing dollar is driving up the price of the wine it buys from vineyards in the us and even from chile and argentina which like many countries rely on the dollar for global trade kingsland has offset some of its currency costs by taking out contracts to buy dollars at a fixed price but at some point those hedges run out and you have to reflect the reality of a weaker sterling against the us dollar says ed baker the company s managing director translation soon customers will just have to pay more for their wine
dr vernon coleman 21st century wire regular readers of my books and these pages will understand that the financial chaos engulfing the world and threatening to send the uk back beyond the recession into a deep dark financial depression and back to the economic dark ages will know that nothing that is happening is happening by accident this in case you are in any doubt is the beginning of the great recession the new normal which the conspirators have been boasting about for years laughably there are some ignorant collaborators who claim that the great recession is another conspiracy theory if only they were right the coming financial chaos was apparent years ago when i wrote my book stuffed back in 2012 i pointed out that the government can no longer afford to pay the pensions it has promised to public sector workers nor can the government afford to pay the state pension and just to make things worse government and eu policies have destroyed the attractiveness of private pensions in a generation s time our streets will be packed with geriatric english beggars pleading to be given enough money to buy a little food and now we re very close to that the current uk squabble between truss s apparently chaotic and spendthrift government and the apparently incompetent bank of england is setting us all up for a perfect financial armageddon the bank of england says that our financial problems are caused by the government s spend spend spend policies which is true the government says the bank of england should have raised interest rates faster which is also true meanwhile as british pension funds collapse millions who were looking forward to a decent retirement can now look forward to penury poverty and the need to carry on working until they drop and the bank s governor is in washington with the chancellor i m sure they are having a wonderful time might i suggest that they stay there british pension funds are in a mess because of the twin policies of the bank of england and the new government but bailey who gets over half a million quid a year as governor of the bank and who can rightly claim to be the most overpaid buffoon in britain says the problem is the fault of the pension funds for doing what they are forced to do hold government bonds and that they should sort out the mess gilts including bizarrely index linked gilts have suffered an unprecedented collapse what a lot of strange things are happening these days all unprecedented and apparently inexplicable but remember nothing is happening by accident once you realise what is happening it is remarkably easy to understand just how the conspirators are pushing britain into a real deep and lasting depression the international monetary fund says that 2023 is going to be worse than 2022 by the way and the consensus is that britain is in a worse mess than any other country we re deep in orwell country now citizens of other countries shouldn t laugh too much all other countries are also heading for financial disaster the only difference is that britain is going to get there first everywhere you look there are lies deceptions and mis directions the government says that the unemployment figures are low but that s just a crafty bit of manipulation the fact is that millions of hapless innocent young people are at university studying for degrees in subjects such as golf course management how many thousand golf course managers does the world need i wonder those unfortunate kids are only at university because it keeps them out of the unemployment figures exams have been made much easier to increase the number of students apparently qualified for further eduction they re paying a fortune for fees and accommodation and building up huge debts in the process and when they finally qualify they ll struggle to find jobs most of them will never be able to pay back their student loans their education will leave them with nothing but happy saturday night memories and huge ever lasting debts and then there are millions of people on benefits they don t count towards the unemployment figures of course and their numbers have been boosted by the 2 million folk suffering from happy furlough syndrome usually mis spelt long covid by collaborating brain dead journalists these people enjoyed their months on paid furlough so much that they don t want to go back to work and long covid the hypochondriac s delight has replaced i ve got back trouble doctor and i m suffering from stress doctor as the primary cause of people being too sick to work determined to make things ever worse the lunatics who now run the asylum want those on benefits to receive a rise equal to inflation rather than limited to the pay rises which will be given to workers and strikers this of course will encourage even more millions to abandon the idea of work and choose instead to join the 2 million enjoying the delights of happy furlough syndrome meanwhile commentators politicians and journalists are desperately trying to keep interest rates down to protect the million or so who have taken out mortgages too many assumed that absurdly low rates were permanent and they failed to prepare and plan and save no one gives a damn about the countless millions who have scrimped and saved and been prudent and who are now receiving next to nothing in interest on their savings at some point the constantly penniless banks must surely start making money they re borrowing money at 0 1 and lending it out at 6 even greedy bankers should surely be able to make money with those figures one teenage scribbler for a national publication claimed that the pension crisis is nothing to worry about if you re about to retire then you ll just have to delay your retirement for a few years was the comforting advice and if you re younger just put more money into your pension to rebuild the losses heaven knows what the advice is for those who manage their own pensions who if

president biden vowed tuesday to make codifying roe v wade his first legislative priority if democrats control congress after the november elections tying the outcome of the midterms more directly to enshrining abortion rights than he has previously and raising the stakes for a tumultuous election where his party faces strong head winds during a speech at the howard theatre in d c biden said he would send a bill codifying abortion protections to congress and sign it before jan 22 the 50th anniversary of the supreme court decision that guaranteed a woman s right to an abortion but he also sought to tap into the outrage that spilled onto the streets after the court s june 24 ruling that overturned roe i m asking the american people to remember how you felt the day the extreme dobbs decision came down and roe was struck down after all those years biden said i want you to remember that the final say does not rest with the court now it does not rest with the extreme republicans in congress it rests with you and if you do your part democratic leaders in congress will do their part and i ll do my part advertisement the major speech three weeks before the midterm elections was in part to reignite democratic fury over the supreme court s decision to overturn roe an outcome that incensed liberals and many centrists this summer he made it clear that protecting access to abortion was his party s main message this election season even as its political impact has been blunted in recent months as voters fret over economic issues such as inflation biden s speech solidified a dynamic for the final three weeks of a campaign that finds republicans stressing issues such as crime immigration and inflation to argue that the country has been engulfed in chaos under the democrats meanwhile democrats have been emphasizing republican opposition to abortion rights and other issues to suggest that the gop has become a party of extremists since most legislation in the senate requires 60 votes to advance the democrats would need to pick up several seats to codify abortion protections the senate is split 50 50 with vice president harris casting tiebreaking votes democrats also have a small edge in the house but most strategists on both sides expect republicans to take control of that chamber on nov 8 advertisement only a handful of republicans would be expected to vote for a bill declaring abortion rights the law of the land right now we re short a handful of votes biden said with the midterms looming many democrats have made abortion a central campaign issue saying republicans in power would enact a nationwide ban and that other rights would be at risk if emboldened conservatives control congress sen lindsey o graham r s c has introduced a bill that would make abortion illegal throughout the united states after 15 weeks of pregnancy they re talking about the right to contraception and the right to marry who you love biden said kevin mccarthy the republican leader of the house has said if they take over our work is far from done he wants the house to pass a law that would ban abortion nationwide advertisement fury over the supreme court s decision in june sparked protests outside the court and across the country and has led to a jump in female voter registration which most analysts believe benefits democrats two months after the court s ruling voters in kansas widely rejected a state constitutional amendment that would have allowed new restrictions on abortion bolstering democrats hopes that outrage over the issue could help them turn back what earlier seemed like a likely republican triumph in the midterms since the dobbs decision democrats have filled the airwaves with television commercials on abortion and taken out full page newspaper ads in senate and house battlegrounds in michigan democrats have successfully put on november s ballot a measure that would enshrine abortion access in the state constitution in wisconsin democratic gov tony evers himself up for reelection called legislators into a special session to get rid of the state s abortion ban though republicans quickly scuttled that plan biden and other democrats have seized on graham s abortion ban legislation saying it is an example of republicans adopting extreme stances graham s move appeared to contradict the position of other republican lawmakers who have long said abortion is an issue that should be decided by the states advertisement republicans meanwhile have attempted to center the campaign on the economy and crime in the final weeks of the midterms hoping to make gains with late deciding voters in polls economic issues such as inflation and jobs to register as the largest concerns for voters and a drag on democrats running for office an economist yougov poll released last week found that 43 percent of americans said abortion is very important to them down from 48 percent in the previous two weeks the same poll found 65 percent saying jobs and the economy were very important that was 67 percent last week and 68 percent the week before that share this article share separately a new york times siena college poll asked likely voters what was the most important problem facing the country in an open ended question and 5 percent volunteered abortion that was less than the 44 percent who said either the economy or inflation was the most important issue facing the country up from 36 percent in july democrats have sought to address economic issues by pointing to their passage of legislation to cut prescription drug costs biden s move to forgive student loan debt and white house actions to cut gas prices but democratic leaders concede privately that if the conversation is about the economy they are at a disadvantage while if it turns to abortion rights they have the edge advertisement in tuesday s white house press briefing press secretary karine jean pierre said the attacks on abortion access including far reaching bans enacted by several gop led states resonate powerfully with a large number of americans it is very clear that the majority of americans support roe jean pierre said a majority of americans disagree with the decision that the supreme court made just a few weeks ago and you see that in polling after polling after polling the majority of americans have been very clear on where they stand on this she declined to elaborate on how many additional senate votes biden believes democrats need to make meaningful change biden has said he supports ending or amending the 60 vote filibuster threshold to enshrine abortion rights but democratic sens kyrsten sinema ariz and joe manchin iii w va have said they oppose overturning the filibuster biden would need at least two more votes to counter their opposition and scuttle the parliamentary rule advertisement it is less clear what additional steps biden will take to protect abortion rights if the democrats cannot both hold the house and add a couple seats in the senate an outcome that few in either party expect biden has already signed an executive order allowing people to cross state lines to get an abortion and he has sought to protect access to medication abortions that can be prescribed via a telehealth appointment and shipped through the mail but the white house has ruled out other ideas that some activists are demanding such as using federal lands for abortions saying they are impractical or would invite legal challenges one potentially complicating factor is that biden a lifelong practicing catholic has struggled with the abortion issue and personally opposed abortion rights at times he has spoken throughout his career of his discomfort with abortion with the result that he has sometimes been out of step with his party advertisement i don t like the supreme court decision on abortion i think it went too far biden then a new senator said in 1974 after the supreme court decided roe v wade i don t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body during the 2020 democratic presidential primary biden drew fierce criticism within the party for his support of the hyde amendment which prohibits federal funding for abortions he changed his stance on the issue after sustained pressure from democrats and when the court issued the dobbs decision last summer biden s initial response was criticized inside and outside the white house by democrats who felt he failed to speak with enough passion or force to meet the moment for millions of women who had lost what they considered a fundamental right abortion rights advocates also said the biden administration was slow to respond and should have been better prepared given that a draft opinion had leaked weeks before biden is the second catholic president in u s history after john f kennedy and democrats are looking to him to be the leading champion of abortion rights as it faces its greatest challenge since roe but even as democratic candidates particularly those in blue states such as california and oregon center abortion in their campaigns biden has rarely emphasized the issue advertisement his speech tuesday came after a four day three state west coast swing last week during which he uttered the word abortion twice biden did speak of the importance of electing democrats to protect a women s right to choose but the issue of abortion was far from the focus of the trip or any of the individual events his two mentions of the word abortion happened during fundraisers for democratic candidates one for the democratic congressional campaign committee in los angeles on thursday and one for tina kotek the democratic nominee for oregon governor on saturday

inflation the federal reserve has raised its benchmark short term interest rate five times this year and is signaling more hikes are likely that has led to higher rates on a wide range of u s government and corporate bonds luring investors and driving up the u s currency most other currencies are much weaker by comparison especially in poor countries the indian rupee has dropped nearly 10 this year against the dollar the egyptian pound 20 the turkish lira an astounding 28 celal kaleli 60 sells infant clothing and diaper bags in istanbul because he needs more lira to buy imported zippers and liners priced in dollars he has to raise prices for the turkish customers who struggle to pay him in the much diminished local currency we re waiting for the new year he said we ll look into our finances and we ll downsize accordingly there s nothing else we can do rich countries aren t immune in europe which was already teetering toward recession amid soaring energy prices one euro is worth less than a 1 for the first time in 20 years and the british pound has plunged 18 from a year ago the pound recently flirted with dollar parity after britain s new prime minister liz truss announced huge tax cuts that roiled financial markets and led to the ouster of her treasury secretary ordinarily countries could get some benefit from falling currencies because it makes their products cheaper and more competitive overseas but at the moment any gain from higher exports is muted because economic growth is sputtering almost everywhere a rising dollar is causing pain overseas in a number of ways it makes other countries imports more expensive adding to existing inflationary pressures it squeezes companies consumers and governments that borrowed in dollars that s because more local currency is needed to convert into dollars when making loan payments it forces central banks in other countries to raise interest rates to try and prop up their currencies and keep money from fleeing their borders but those higher rates also weaken economic growth and drive up unemployment put simply the dollar s appreciation is bad news for the global economy says capital economics ariane curtis it is another reason why we expect the global economy to fall into recession next year in a gritty neighborhood of nairobi known for fixing cars and selling auto parts businesses are struggling and customers unhappy with the kenyan shilling down 6 this year the cost of fuel and imported spare parts is soaring so much that some people are choosing to ditch their cars and take public transportation this has been the worst said michael gachie purchasing manager with shamas auto parts customers are complaining a lot gyrating currencies have caused economic pain around the world many times before during the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s for instance indonesian companies borrowed heavily in dollars during boom times then were wiped out when the indonesian rupiah crashed against the dollar a few years earlier a plunging peso delivered similar pain to mexican businesses and consumers the soaring dollar in 2022 is uniquely painful however it is adding to global inflationary pressures at a time when prices were already soaring disruptions to energy and agriculture markets caused by the ukraine war magnified supply constraints stemming from the covid 19

they are precise small in size able to effectively penetrate air defences when fired in groups and above all they re cheap in russia s invasion of ukraine killer drones have cemented their reputation as a potent cost effective weapon that can seek out and destroy targets while simultaneously spreading the kind of terror that can fray the resolve of soldiers and civilians alike they re also quickly surpassing missiles as the remote weapon of choice known as the poor man s cruise missile the flying death machines can flood any combat theatre much more cheaply russia s unleashing of successive waves of the iranian made shahed drones over ukraine has multiple goals taking out power plants and other key infrastructure crushing morale and ultimately draining the enemy s war chest and weapons as they try to take them out how do wartime drones work drones remote controlled or preprogrammed have been used extensively in battle to gather intelligence direct artillery strikes and to a lesser extent drop explosives there are many types sophisticated unmanned combat aerial vehicles that can launch missiles such as the us made predator are better known the shahed drones that russia has rebranded as geran 2 are far cruder packed with explosives they can be preprogrammed with a target s gps coordinates they are known as suicide drones because they nosedive into targets and explode on impact like a missile that s reminiscent of japan s world war ii era kamikaze pilots who would fly their explosives laden aircraft into us warships and aircraft carriers drones like the shaheds are called loitering munitions by the military because when used at short range they can hover over an area and then hit a target on an operator s command according to the ukrainian online publication defence express which cites iranian data the delta wing shahed is 3 5m long 2 5m wide and weighs about 200kg it s powered by a 50 horsepower engine with a top speed of 185km h the drone has previously been used in yemen and in a deadly oil tanker attack last year said behnam ben taleblu senior fellow at the washington based think tank foundation for defense of democracies and while its range is about 1000km drone expert samuel bendett with the cna think tank said the shahed is being used in ukraine at much shorter ranges that s because its gps guidance system which is vulnerable to jamming isn t very robust this undated photograph released by the ukrainian military s strategic communications directorate shows the wreckage of what kyiv has described as an iranian shahed drone downed near kupiansk ukraine photo ap shaheds are known to have been controlled via radio under the iranians whether russia is capable of the same in ukraine is unclear though ukrainians have reported seeing the drones change direction suggesting at least some remote control because they are cheap and plentiful russia has increasingly used shaheds in ukraine ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said last week that russia had ordered 2400 from iran their use lets russia avoid putting sophisticated aircraft and pilots at risk and save its limited stock of expensive long range precision missiles in this week s attack on the ukrainian capital of kyiv the city s mayor vitali klitschko said 28 drones made up waves of successive attacks fired from a truck launcher in rapid succession the drones can fly low and slow better able to avoid radar detection they don t technically swarm bendett noted that kind of sophisticated drone technology exists when multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles communicate with one another instead the shahed is simply launched in bunches in order to overwhelm defences particularly in civilian areas they know that most will not make it through he said their power to terrorise exceeds their explosive might however according to mykola bielieskov a research fellow at ukraine s national institute for strategic studies the shahed only carries a 40kg explosive charge which pales in comparison to the explosive force that a conventional missile s 480kg warhead can deliver at a much longer range it is difficult to hit serious targets with such drones bielieskov said but it s also extremely difficult to shoot them down small punch but low cost at a mere us 20 000 nz 35 000 apiece the shahed is only a tiny fraction of the cost of a full size missile for example russia s kalibr cruise missiles which have seen widespread use in eight months of war cost the russian military about 1 million nz 1 76m each at such a low cost the shahed has been used effectively to saturate targets whether a fuel depot or infrastructure and utilities like power or water stations russia has used them with precision in combination with intelligence drones to attack ukrainian artillery said bendett firefighters carry the body of a person killed after a drone fired on buildings in kyiv ukraine on monday waves of explosive laden suicide drones struck ukraine s capital as families were preparing to start their week early on monday the blasts echoing across kyiv setting buildings ablaze and sending people scurrying to shelters photo ap despite its small size the shahed s explosive charge appears powerful enough to do damage in this week s attacks one drone struck an operations centre while another slammed into a residential building ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments killing four people bielieskov from ukraine s national institute for strategic studies said russia is now directing shaheds at civilian rather than battlefield targets because ukrainian forces have learned how to fight them effectively intercepting a little more than half of them with no immediate end in sight the conflict s financial burden will weigh heavier on moscow which isn t receiving billions in weapons transfers from western nations like ukraine is as the conflict essentially becomes one of attrition who can withstand that human material and financial burden the longest finding cheaper but still potent weapons will be key shahed 136 is a cheap version of a cruise missile which russia can t produce fast said bielieskov taleblu said russia will likely continue to boost its long range strike capabilities with iranian drones this should raise alarm bells for europe and the world he said russian officials haven t issued any data about the number of missiles fired during the conflict but ukraine s defence minister recently alleged that russia has used most of its high precision missile arsenal a war of nerves the incessant buzzing of the propeller driven shahed drones dubbed mopeds and lawnmowers by combatants can induce terror for anyone under its flight path because no one on the ground knows exactly when or where the weapon will strike zelenskyy seized on the drones terror element posting on social media the whole night and the whole morning the enemy terrorises the civilian population bielieskov conceded that shahed drone

a vision of metascience an engine of improvement for the social processes of science october 18 2022 how does the culture of science change and improve many people have identified shortcomings in core social processes of science such as peer review how grants are awarded how people are selected to become scientists and so on yet despite often compelling criticisms strong barriers inhibit widespread change in such social processes the result is near stasis and apathy about the prospects for improvement people sometimes start new research institutions intended to do things differently unfortunately such institutions are often changed more by the existing ecosystem than they change it in this essay we sketch a vision of how the social processes of science may be rapidly improved in this vision metascience plays a key role it deepens our understanding of which social processes best support discovery that understanding can then help drive change we introduce the notion of a metascience entrepreneur a person seeking to achieve a scalable improvement in the social processes of science we argue that 1 metascience is an imaginative design practice exploring an enormous design space for social processes 2 that exploration aims to find new social processes which unlock latent potential for discovery 3 decentralized change must be possible so outsiders with superior ideas can t be blocked by established power centers 4 ideally change would align with what is best for science and for humanity not merely what is fashionable politically popular or media friendly 5 the net result would be a far more structurally diverse set of environments for doing science and 6 this would enable crucial types of work difficult or impossible within existing environments for this vision to succeed metascience must develop and intertwine three elements an imaginative design practice an entrepreneurial discipline and a research field overall it is a vision in which metascience is an engine of improvement for the social processes and ultimately the culture of science how does the culture of science change imagine you re a science fiction author writing a story depicting a scientific discovery made by an alien species in your story you show the alien scientists up close how they work how they live would you show them working within institutions resembling human universities with the phd system grant agencies academic journals and so on would they use social processes like peer review and citation would the alien scientists have interminable arguments as human scientists do about the merits of the h index and impact factor and similar attempts to measure science almost certainly the design of our human scientific social processes has been too contingent on the accidents of history for the answers to those questions to all be yes it seems unlikely that humanity has found the best possible means of allocating scarce scientific resources we doubt even the most fervent proponents of say harvard or the us national science foundation would regard them as a platonic ideal nor does it seem likely the h index and similar measures are universal measures of scientific merit this doesn t mean the aliens wouldn t have many scientific facts and methodological ideas in common with humanity plausibly for instance the use of mathematics to describe the universe or the central role of experiment in improving our understanding but it also seems likely such aliens will have radically different social processes to support science what would those social processes be could they have developed scientific institutions as superior to ours as modern universities are to the learned medieval monasteries the question how would aliens do science is fun to consider if fanciful but it s also a good stimulus for immediately human relevant questions for instance suppose you were given a large sum of money say a hundred million dollars or a billion dollars or even ten or a hundred billion or a trillion dollars and asked to start a new scientific institution perhaps a research institute or funder what would you do with the money would you aim to incrementally improve on the approaches currently taken by harvard the nsf hhmi and so on or would you attempt to create radically new institutions which transcend existing institutions a new organizational approach to doing science not just in the sense of new scientific ideas or methods in specific fields but rather new social processes for science that is new ways to select and support human beings to make discoveries our distant ancestors did not after all anticipate the immense improvements possible in humanity s discovery ecosystem perhaps with sufficient insight further transformative improvements are possible these questions aren t just hypothetical lots of concrete work has been done on the question what s wrong with the social processes of science and how can we improve them some of this work is in papers essays and manifestos explaining how to fix or improve peer review or funding or hiring or the career structure of science and so on early entries in the genre include such celebrated works as francis bacon s the new atlantis and novum organum and vannevar bush s science the endless frontier and of course there is much modern work from fields including the economics of science funding the science of science science and technology studies science policy and others in the mass media and on social media and in informal conversation amongst scientists alongside these proposals many adventurous people are building new and sometimes daringly different scientific organizations there are big new research institutes such as the arc institute deepmind and altos there are tiny pirate insurgencies such as the center for open science dynamicland eleutherai and dozens or perhaps even hundreds more there are new funders such as convergent research fast grants the ftx foundation vitadao and many more of course many of these are differentiated in part by their specific research focus for example deepmind was one of the first large organizations focused on artificial intelligence research but many also have theses based in part on new or unusual approaches to the basic social processes of science and when we talk to the founders of such organizations they often express hope that not only will their organization succeed it will be a beacon succeeding so spectacularly that the underlying social ideas will spread widely improving humanity s discovery ecosystem as a whole how realistic is that hope does our discovery ecosystem improve in response to successful experiments with new social processes or is it resistant to change only improving slowly in a nutshell this essay explores the question how well does the discovery ecosystem learn and can we improve the way it learns as we address this question many related questions naturally arise does the discovery ecosystem enable the rapid trial of a multitude of wildly imaginative social processes or are only tiny incremental changes ever possible can outsiders with great ideas displace existing approaches or can change only come from people and organizations who already have enormous power what we ll find is a discovery ecosystem in a state of near stasis with strong barriers inhibiting the improvement of key social processes we believe it s possible to change this situation in this essay we sketch a vision in which metascience drives rapid improvement in the social processes of science this vision requires a strong theoretical discipline of metascience able to obtain results decisive enough to drive the adoption of new social processes including processes that may displace incumbents it also requires a strong ecosystem of metascience entrepreneurs people working to achieve scalable change in the social processes of science in some sense the essay explores what it would mean for humanity to do metascience seriously and it s about placing that endeavor at the core of science we believe the net result will be a portfolio of social processes far more structurally diverse than today enabling crucial types of work difficult or impossible within existing environments and so expanding the range of possible discoveries as far as we are aware these questions have not previously been explored in depth to make the questions more concrete let s sketch a few specific examples of unusual social processes that could be or are being trialled today by adventurous funders or research organizations these sketches are intended as brief illustrative examples to evoke what we mean by changed social processes though the examples are modest and conservative indeed some ideas may be familiar to you though perhaps not all versions scaled out across science would significantly change the culture of science it s a long list to emphasize the many diverse opportunities for imaginative change later in the essay we develop deeper ways of thinking that generate many more ideas for change fund by variance instead of funding grants that get the highest average score from reviewers a funder should use the variance or kurtosis or some similar measurement of disagreement in reviewer scores as a primary signal only fund things that are highly polarizing some people love it some people hate it one thesis to support such a program is that you may prefer to fund projects with a modest chance of outlier success over projects with a high chance of modest success an alternate thesis is that you should aspire to fund things only you would fund and so should look for signal to that end projects everyone agrees are good will certainly get funded elsewhere and if you merely fund what everyone else is funding then you have little marginal impact century grant program solicit grant applications for projects to be funded for 100 years done through an endowment model the cost would be a small multiple of conventional 5 or 10 year funding the point is to elicit an important type of intellectual dark matter problems of immense scientific value that can t be investigated on short timelines inspired by seminal projects such as the co2 monitoring at the mauna loa observatory the framingham heart study and the cape grim air archive tenure insurance tenure track scientists often play it safe in the projects they take on encourage people to swing for the fences by offering a large payout if they fail to receive tenure supposing 80 of tenure track faculty receive tenure the cost for a large payout would only be a modest addition to an existing benefits package a premium of 8k per year for 6 years with a 5x multiplier and reasonable assumptions about interest rates would result in a payout of over 300k that s several years of pre tenure salary in many fields and at many institutions this suggestion is an instance of two more general patterns 1 moving risk to parties who can more easily bear it making the system as a whole less risk averse and 2 a plausible way to increase people s ambition is to de risk by improving their fallback options in the event of failure failure audit many funders advocate high risk high reward research but this is often mere research theater not seriously meant for instance in 2018 the european research council issued a self congratulatory report claiming that a they fund mostly high risk work and b almost all the work they fund succeeds with 79 of projects achieving either a scientific breakthrough or a major scientific advance if almost every project succeeds then this is not a definition of high risk we recognize to prove the seriousness of their intent about risk funders could run credible independent audits on their grant programs and if the failure rate for grants persists below some threshold say 50 the program manager is fired or at a different level of abstraction the entire funder could be audited and if the number of grant programs which fails is below 50 the funder s director is fired acquisition pipeline for research institutes people often lament the loss of or large changes in great private research institutes past parc in the 1970s is perhaps the best modern example if parc in the 1970s was so great why didn t the nsf acquire it an acquisition would have been within their mission and almost certainly a far better than median use of nsf s funds there might well have been political or bureaucratic barriers but if so the problem lies in politics and bureaucracy not in the merit of the idea if public or philanthropic acquisition of private research institutes was common it may incentivize the creation of more outstanding private research institutes pull immigration programs moving between countries is an intimidating and arduous exercise often involving a considerable amount of know how there is no a priori reason some enterprising country let s say estonia which has run several innovative experiments in the way they approach immigration couldn t simply identify outstanding people they d like as immigrants and directly recruit them imagine a valet shows up on the doorstep of every science olympiad student in the world with a first class plane ticket to estonia a pre approved visa an offer of several years of first rate private mentoring in whatever field or fields they desire a stipend and housing as part of a community of similarly extraordinary students it d be interesting to see what the long run outcomes from such a community would be open source institute like a research university but instead of producing understanding in the form of research papers it would produce understanding in the form of open source software and open protocols with a penumbra of concomitant goods such as prototypes demos open data and yes papers based on the thesis that sometimes important new understanding isn t best expressed in words but rather in code or protocols a number of superficially similar programs already operate but none as far we know genuinely change the underlying political economy the means by which people build their reputation and career which is the primary point institute for traveling scientists a yacht that sails around the world boarding and de boarding scientists in each port it would be a mobile version of places like the stanford center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences somewhere stimulating and relaxing for scientists to go on sabbatical learn a new field or perhaps write that book they ve been meaning to write inspired in part by craig venter s round the world trip for the ocean sequencing project long shot prizes purchase insurance premiums against extremely unlikely possibilities that would transform the world a proof that p np a proof that p np a constructive algorithm solving np complete problems quickly cold fusion true faster than light travel a perpetual motion machine and so on the more unlikely the outcome the larger the prize can be even for a small premium cheap unlikely to succeed and extraordinarily impactful if it led to solutions to such problems public hall of shame anti portfolio the venture capital firm bessemer venture partners maintains a public anti portfolio of companies where they had an opportunity to invest but failed it includes enormously successful companies such as apple google facebook tesla and many others each failure is accompanied by a short story naming the bessemer partner who had the opportunity to invest but didn t and describing often fancifully and amusingly why they failed to invest every science funder every university and every scientific journal in the world should maintain a similar anti portfolio alternately a collective anti portfolio could be constructed by a third party willing to tolerate some opprobrium it wouldn t be popular but done well it would be invaluable interdisciplinary institute most proposals for interdisciplinarity are tepid take interdisciplinarity seriously by setting up an institute which identifies say 30 different disciplines and then hires three people to work at the intersection of every possible pairing of disciplines that s just 1305 people a large program but tiny on the scale of modern science this would be a deliberately variance inducing strategy most pairings of disciplines would produce little but there are likely a few where great discoveries would unexpectedly be made through the combination those few would pay for all the rest a less expensive approach would be to sample from randomly chosen pairs of disciplines with the disciplines potentially coming from a much longer list at the bench fellowship in their heyday senior scientists at places such as bell labs and cambridge s laboratory for molecular biology often carried out research work themselves or in direct hands on collaboration with 1 3 others yet modern universities often strongly encourage scientists to take on a managerial role applying for grants but being hands off in research work this fellowship would fund senior scientists to spend essentially all their time actually doing science the thesis here is that for some types of work important discoveries are most likely if done by someone highly skilled with a deeply developed affinity for some part of nature put another way the thesis is that for some scientists there are increasing returns to focused expertise not the diminishing returns assumed in the conventional scientist becomes manager of a large group model printing press for funders an entity endowed with 10 billion could spin out new funders each year it could spin out for instance a single funder with a roughly 500 million endowment perhaps running a competition to find the operators of the new funder or it could spin out a larger number of smaller funders if each new funder had a radically different thesis this could significantly increase the structural diversity of science and perhaps increase the diversity of ambient working environments available to scientists it would also be possible to set up a similar kind of printing press for research organizations mutatis mutandis and perhaps to set up sunset clauses for the organizations so they don t permanently occupy organizational space in the discovery ecosystem organizational longevity would then necessarily be through people and ideas being passed to future organizations not organizational inertia excitement quotient for funders scientists often apply for grants on the basis of what they believe is fundable rather than with their best ideas we ve spoken with scientists who tell us i know i can get funding for many fashionable but unimportant projects but i can t get funding for the work i think is most important why should a funder or anonymous peer reviewer know better than the scientist how they should use their skills it has the flavor of the busybody stranger who tells a parent they re parenting wrong many funders effectively give veto power to such strangers one approach to partially address this is for an independent agency to sample people applying to different funders asking how excited were you about this grant application they can then publicly rate different funders by comparing excitement scores this would place pressure on funders to fund work applicants were excited about and raise questions if it was mostly pro forma with these examples in mind we may restate the basic questions of the essay suppose for instance that the first of these ideas fund by variance was given a serious trial perhaps with multiple rounds of debugging and improvement suppose it was found that when implemented well it was a decisive improvement over the committee based peer review approach used today by many funders would it then be adopted broadly or would other institutions ignore or resist it in a healthy dynamic discovery ecosystem it would spread widely displacing inferior methods when appropriate by contrast in a static ecosystem even if the early trials were extremely successful other institutions would be slow to respond or resistant to change they would get hung up over whether the approach came from the right originator or was prestigious enough in a healthy discovery ecosystem the improved idea could come from anywhere in early drafts of this essay we were hesitant about writing the concrete list of ideas above we worried that it would anchor readers on these are the changes nielsen and qiu are arguing for but the individual programs are not the point indeed we ll suggest many more and sometimes deeper ideas later in this essay rather the point is that a flourishing ecosystem would rapidly generate and seriously trial an enormous profusion of ideas including many ideas far more imaginative than anything listed above the best of those ideas would be rigorously tested iterated on debugged and scaled out to improve the entire discovery ecosystem indeed if truly bold ideas were being trialled then they would include many ideas we would at first disapprove of but sometimes the evidence for them would be so strong that we d be forced to change our minds as stated above the focus of this essay is how the discovery ecosystem improves part of the motivation for this focus is the belief that the design space for promising new social processes is vast we won t prove this belief but we ll try to make it plausible in part 1 of the essay we ll discuss heuristics for exploring this metascience design space these heuristics arise out of plausible models of how human beings make discoveries indeed all the social processes of science reflect and are grounded in such models often implicit or informal folk theories of how discovery happens weak metascientific ideas result in weak social processes stronger metascientific ideas result in stronger processes insofar as we can improve our metascientific theories we can improve the way human beings make discoveries a good way to develop that understanding is to explore boldly in the design space above understanding which ideas do and don t work and why throughout this introduction we ve used many different but related terms talking about changing the social processes of science changing the culture of science changing the institutions of science changing the discovery ecosystem and so on from now on we ll use social processes of science as an informal catchall by that we mean the institutional practices incentives norms and so on widely used in science so when we talk about change to the social processes of science we are talking about changes to things like peer review or hiring practices or how funders approach risk as well as broader ideas such as the pull immigration or printing press for funders or anti portfolio ideas mentioned above the phrase social processes of science is unfortunately unwieldy but it is nonetheless very helpful to have such a catchall we will save the use of other terms for when we have a more specific need as noted earlier the essay is an entry in the field of metascience this still emerging field overlaps and draws upon many well established fields including the philosophy history and sociology of science as well as newer fields such as the economics of science funding the science of science science policy and others while we draw on all these fields there are notable differences in our focus unlike the philosophy of science we are more concerned with social processes than methodology the two are intertwined so this is a difference of degree not kind but is nonetheless real of course fields such as the sociology of science and the science of science do focus on social processes but the focus is primarily descriptive not imaginative design and active intervention as discussed in our work the exception is science policy which has design and intervention as core goals however in the science policy world interventions are often focused on what is practical within existing power structures we shall be concerned with more a priori questions of principle and enabling decentralized change i e change that may occur outside existing power structures for all these reasons we think of the essay as simply part of metascience one factor not discussed in the main body of the essay is the relationship between metascience and several external factors affecting the future of science artificial intelligence the rise of china and india the colonization of space and intelligence augmentation we discuss these briefly in an appendix to the essay the focus in the body of the essay is more endogenous to science underlying the essay is the assumption that improved social processes can radically transform and improve science most scientists we ve spoken with agree with at least a weak form of this assumption for instance many strongly advocate metascientific principles like the importance of freedom of inquiry for scientists or that it strengthens science if outsiders can overturn established theories on the strength of evidence not their credentials for science to work well such ideas must be expressed even if imperfectly in the design of the social processes of science as said above the quality of our social processes and of our institutions is determined by the quality of the metascientific ideas they embody but our assumption in this essay is much stronger than that weak form again we believe improved social processes can radically transform and improve science it s not so obvious this is true some scientists we talk with are excited by this idea and agree that new social processes may be transformative others sharply disagree telling us that broad ecosystem level social changes make little substantive difference to the actual science indeed several notable scientists have expressed this to us using minor variations on a single phrase all that matters is to fund good people doing good work several others have said words to the effect of i admire your optimism but the system never really gets any better there s just more and more bureaucracy and accountability it s possible those people are correct but the only way to determine that is to actively explore the question what if there are truly transformative social processes waiting to be discovered we ll proceed on that assumption for now and return at the end of the essay to reconsider whether it is true for now let us merely recount an anecdote from the legal scholar and computer scientist nick szabo szabo writes of how during the early renaissance exploring the oceans was an extremely risky business ships could run aground or be blown badly off course by storms sometimes entire crews and ships and cargoes were lost there were risks at all levels of an expedition from the health and livelihood of individual sailors through to financiers who faced ruin if the ship ran aground or was badly damaged but szabo points out this risk profile changed considerably in the 14th century when genovese merchants invented maritime insurance for the cost of a modest premium the people financing the expedition would not suffer if the ship was damaged this spread the risk and made the expedition much less risky for some though not all participants that change in the funding system helped enable a new age of exploration discovery and prosperity it is easy to imagine a salty genovese sea captain upon being asked how to improve shipping saying that you just need good ships crewed by good sailors this would be in the vein of our scientist friends telling us just fund good people doing good work it contains a large grain of truth but is not incompatible with system level ideas radically improving the situation the salty scientists are correct but only within a limited outlook research organizations do need to be maniacal about funding good people with good projects they can also make system level changes which have much more profound effects this essay is about such system level changes put another way we believe our salty scientists are blind to just how strongly systems and social processes shape creative work this isn t because they re unimaginative often it s because the systems change they ve seen during their own careers is mostly bureaucracies making themselves happier and often everyone else unhappier with more red tape and demands for accountability naturally such scientists are cynical about the prospects for improvement we hope to make a convincing case that much more unconventional changes are possible resulting in a profoundly different and better discovery system a variation of this line of critique is that the current social processes of science already produce many terrific outcomes this is certainly true it s a humbling experience to talk to the best scientists what they can do is genuinely astounding and you think to yourself this is it these are extraordinary human beings being used by humanity to near their full capacity it s a wonderful achievement of humanity that we do support such people and it s reasonable to ask why we d need anything else why not just scale this up indeed sometimes when talking with such people we encounter friendly or skeptical bewilderment for them and their friends the current system works well and they don t see the need for anything different but perhaps there are very different types of scientist and scientific work who could also achieve astounding things in science perhaps achievements which the current system is unknowingly bottlenecked on because their personality type doesn t thrive within that system and perhaps they and their approach to science would thrive if there was more structural diversity in the social processes of science this is a central point to which we shall return at first glance this essay may appear to be an entry in that flourishing genre what s wrong with science and how to fix it this genre is well represented on social media in conversation among scientists and in articles in the scientific and mainstream media here are the things wrong with peer review and how to fix them indeed the genre is not new you can find discussions of these issues going back decades and even centuries each generation confronts the problems anew and proposes solutions anew but although there is no shortage of grand hopes and plans progress is often slow our point of view is different in a crucial way we are not proposing a single silver bullet we believe the opportunity is far larger what we want is a flourishing ecosystem of people with wildly imaginative and insightful ideas for new social processes and for those ideas to be tested and the best ideas scaled out we will show in part by example that there are many different possible approaches to fixing peer review instead of believing we already know the answers and just need to implement them it s better to develop a discovery ecosystem which can rapidly improve its own processes the fundamental underlying questions are how do social processes in science change is there a general theory of such change is it possible to speed up and improve that change this subject isn t fashionable in the same way as yet another proposal for how to fix grant agencies or how to fix universities but we believe it is a fundamental issue in the way human beings make discoveries is a central problem of metascience and at the very core of science as a final note we ve used informal language throughout the essay and that may make some readers mistake it for journalism but while it is in part a synthesis that isn t the primary intent rather it s intended as a creative research contribution a broad vision of the purpose and potential of metascience and how it can change science we introduce terminology and simple models for many key elements of metascience and sketch many core problems our arguments unavoidably sometimes use speculative and incomplete reasoning we shall borrow from many existing fields but our work isn t primarily intended as a contribution to those fields rather it s intended as a sketch of part of the emerging proto field of metascience to help it along the way to becoming a fully fledged field part 1 exploring the metascience design space one conception of metascience is that it s about fine tuning science making incremental tweaks to social processes such as peer review or grant making but we conceive of metascience differently believing radically different and far better social processes are possible and that the metascience design space is vast and mostly unexplored indeed we believe the design space is so large that exploring it will require decades or centuries at the least still in part 1 we hope to evoke something of that grand size we ll explore the space focusing initially on simple program ideas that could be trialled unilaterally by some imaginative funder although this initial focus is restricted it can be used to illustrate generative design heuristics that help explore in imaginative ways later we ll broaden our scope along the way we ll sometimes run across well known ideas things like the currently fashionable idea of funding lotteries or the idea that one should fund people not projects but to keep the discussion fresh we ll also mention ideas that have only rarely been discussed or which to our knowledge are novel the funder as detector and predictor one heuristic for exploring the metascience design space let s begin with a simple heuristic for exploring the design space we call this the funder as detector and predictor model or just the detector and predictor model for short as the name implies this is a two part model in one part of the model we think of a science funder as a kind of detector or sensor a collective human instrument aiming to locate intellectual dark matter that is it aims to locate important ideas or signals present in the discovery ecosystem but ignored by existing funders for example the century grant program aims to elicit a class of previously invisible intellectual dark matter ideas for projects that should last a century or more there may be many great ideas for such projects out there there may be few such ideas we won t know unless we do a determined search in this part of the model crucial questions to ask include what types of important signal are present in the system but are currently ignored is there information which is systematically being hidden and if so how might it be elicited and what new mechanisms can we develop to locate and amplify signal concretely what do the body of scientists know that is important and yet currently either invisible or not visible enough to funders and how can we surface that information in the second part of the detector and predictor model funders are thought of as predictors trying to predict future outcomes in particular they use some inference process to make decisions about an uncertain future on the basis of incomplete current information this is the underlying problem to be solved in funding discovery as an example the idea of high variance funding is based on a simple change to the inference method used to make decisions instead of using typical or average scores use the variance in scores to help decide which proposals to fund in this part of the detector and predictor model crucial questions include what information might we collect what hedging and aggregation and indirection strategies might be used where is there asymmetric opportunity or opportunity for unique marginal impact what are the possible contractual designs where is the risk and how can it be moved and transformed many of the suggestions we made in the introduction may be understood through the lens of the detector and predictor model we already mentioned the century grant program and high variance funding but many others may also be viewed this way for instance failure audits are about observing the outcomes from the inference model in order to determine whether it s achieving some desired end and using incentives to change the model used or the pull immigration program is about surfacing previously invisible intellectual dark matter many of the programs involve both parts of the model high variance funding changes as already mentioned the prediction method but will also likely elicit different types of grant proposal encouraging people with riskier ideas to apply in this sense what you detect and how you predict are interwoven more broadly it s stimulating to simply look through the earlier examples and see how the model applies or not the detector and predictor model is not intended to be universally applicable nor to be literally correct as a descriptive model rather it s a generative design heuristic to help generate plausible interesting program ideas by playing with the model you can easily generate an endless supply of potential programs to illustrate let s describe four more programs motivated by a view of the funder as a detector searching out intellectual dark matter endowed professorships by 25 many of history s great scientists made key discoveries while very young this was true for example of giants such as newton darwin and einstein it s also been true more recently think of joshua lederberg discovering bacterial conjugation at the age of 21 or brian josephson discovering the tunneling current between superconductors at the age of 22 concerningly in recent times the age at which scientists can establish independent research programs has substantially increased often people who begin research in their early 20s can t establish independent programs until their late 30s or 40s instead they work on someone else s research program or leave science the thesis of this endowment program is that it will unlock latent potential for discovery if we give some young people full independence to follow their ideas to this end establish endowed professorships and associated project support at a few outstanding institutions say harvard and cambridge for promising scientists no more than 25 years old if even a few recapitulate the success of a lederberg or a josephson such a program would be well worth it focused research organizations fros first trialled in 2021 these are organizations of scientists and engineers which require levels of coordinated engineering or system building inaccessible to academia often tens of millions of dollars they aim to produce a well defined tool technology or scientific dataset examples include e11 bio developing tools to make it relatively easy and inexpensive to map mice brains down to the level of single synapses and the cultivarium most work in synthetic biology has been focused on a few model organisms but the cultivarium is developing tools to make synthetic biology routine in a much wider range of organisms at first glance fros seem similar to endeavors such as ligo the lhc and the human genome project each of which also involved large scale science and engineering in pursuit of well defined ends but in the past such endeavors were conceived and funded on a bespoke basis the innovation of fros is that they are a scalable way of eliciting and creating such entities the underlying thesis is that such a scalable means would reveal many valuable fros that are currently latent it is again a mechanism to search out and activate a kind of intellectual dark matter para academic fellowship a fellowship for people to do independent research work outside academia the underlying thesis is that there are many such people who have extremely unusual combinations of skills skills unlikely to be found in academia but which may enable important discoveries think of people such as jane jacobs judith rich harris and robert ballard indeed if we go back further in time think of the young albert einstein during his time in the swiss patent office again this is building a detector for a class of undervalued intellectual dark matter and then funding whatever seems most promising discipline switching fellowship to make it easy for outstanding scientists to change fields we have met many scientists who have no trouble getting funding in the field they are currently working in but who tell us they would prefer to be working in some other field this is strange they have funding to work on projects they re not so keen on but not for things they consider more promising sometimes they have some special insight or edge that they feel gives them an advantage in their desired new area others feel they have run the course of what they have to contribute in their current field whatever the reason funders currently largely ignore this information it is yet again intellectual dark matter surfacing and acting on it will help people better use their talents done at sufficient scale it would help established but moribund fields die and it would also surface useful aggregate information if people are unexpectedly going into unglamorous fields or leaving high status fields that s a striking signal that something is afoot many small scale programs along these lines are already done it would be interesting to make say 50 000 such grants each year providing a huge injection of disciplinary liquidity into science as with the program ideas suggested in the opening section we re not claiming that any one of these program ideas would revolutionize science indeed we re not even claiming any particular one would work well at all some might work quite poorly though we re not sure which a healthy discovery system should trial a profusion of ideas including many which fail that s what it means to be trying risky things we do believe it s worth trialling all the ideas above and many more conducting such trials would help answer an immense variety of questions things like how much demand is there for discipline switching what are the resulting flows of scientists between disciplines what determines those flows how well do young people perform as principal investigators are there systematic differences in the directions they explore and so on a cornucopia of questions partial answers and useful data in that sense even failed programs would be successful they will contribute crucial knowledge to our understanding of metascience and in the event that one of the programs works strikingly well it can be scaled up it may even begin to change the culture of science there is a particular sense in which existing funders already change their detector they actively search for new research subfields to fund consider for instance the way the nih systematically expands their panel areas or the way darpa searches for technological whitespace but the notion of intellectual dark matter goes much further than that the unifying motivating question is what does the body of scientists know that is important and yet is currently either invisible or not visible enough to funders for example fros are not principally about expanding the range of fields being considered rather they are about a change in the structure of scientific problem which may be attacked at all how do you know such intellectual dark matter exists you can t but the success of bespoke prior projects such as ligo the lhc and the human genome project at least suggest it s worth looking similarly the discipline switching fellowship isn t about expanding the range of fields considered but rather about making use of scientists knowledge of their own comparative advantage and again this is suggested by famous examples francis crick from physics to molecular biology ed witten from mathematics to physics and so on if you talk with individual scientists and appreciate the barriers preventing such switching you realize the intellectual dark matter exists and a scalable discipline switching fellowship is natural such intellectual dark matter is replete in the history and current practice of science by searching out specific examples it s possible to identify many more programs in the vein of those above the programs just described were generated by thinking of funders as detectors what if we focus instead on funders as predictors trying to develop new inference procedures to make decisions again there are an immense number of ways this can be done here s three program suggestions based on changed prediction methods elicit the secret thesis sometimes a scientist undertakes a project because they have some special secret something they know that no one else fully appreciates giving them a unique competitive edge feynman talked about the necessity of having to think that i have some kind of inside track that i have some special mathematical trick that i m going to use that don t have or some kind of a talent but if you re a scientist with such an edge you re in a bind when it comes to funding you don t want to disclose this special edge in a peer reviewed grant you may be telling competitors your best ideas thus the standard peer review procedure sometimes suppresses the information that would be most useful for making decisions it s an inverse market for lemons a form of asymmetric knowledge where perverse incentives inhibit the applicant from revealing how good their idea is of course some projects have competitive edges of a less easy to copy nature e g special equipment or personnel but not all a grant application could have a short separate section where scientists are asked to describe any secret competitive edge they have the funder would promise this secret thesis is seen only by the professional not peer program manager the secret thesis could then be used as an input in the decision making sometimes it would be the decisive input a quota for young program managers suppose 50 percent of program managers were required to be appointed before age 28 and only allowed to serve for five years perhaps offer program manager jobs to all the hertz or nsf graduate fellows at age 27 how would that change the nature of decisions made conventional wisdom says it requires age and experience to make good decisions perhaps that wisdom is correct but the thesis here is that younger program managers would make systematically different decisions to today s incumbents an effective change in inference method and perhaps with some advantages relative to the current situation it would also be interesting to try similar ideas at other levels of a funder perhaps at the level of the overall ceo or director what would a 25 year old director do differently compared to the 50 60 and even 70 somethings common now at most funders a nobel prize for funders the early stages of important discoveries often look strange and illegible people grappling with fundamental ideas in ways at the margin of or outside conventional wisdom since such projects often look like anything but sure bets there is a strong incentive for funders to delay support just when it is most needed in order to avoid looking foolish this is especially true of individual program managers who naturally shy away from funding things that may later seem silly or frivolous it s striking to contrast this situation with venture capital where there is a strong incentive to fund in the earliest stages when stock is cheap because of the uncertainty the net result is more chance of looking silly when things fail but also a much larger windfall if things work out it s interesting to think about ways of rewarding the science funders especially individuals who are first to put their own reputations on the line to support such projects this can be done in many ways one natural way is to create one or more prizes to publicly recognize such brave funders we could explore the generative power of the detector and predictor model at much greater length each element can be riffed upon endlessly generating many more program ideas but that s not our purpose in this essay rather the model is here as an example of a generative design heuristic which can be used to explore one tiny part of the metascience design space let s now discuss more briefly several other such design heuristics each provides a different way of exploring that design space while illustrating the broader idea of metascience as an imaginative design practice metascience as an imaginative design practice the detector and predictor model poses the question where is there intellectual dark matter and how to detect and amplify it the underlying thesis is that there are many such types of dark matter and by identifying new types we can activate untapped latent potential for discovery now let s briefly discuss four other metascientific questions motivating different ways of exploring the design space each question needs an essay or book of its own and could generate dozens or hundreds of program ideas each with its own in depth treatment but we believe these brief descriptions evoke what is possible and help convey different theses about where there is latent potential for discovery how to 10x the rate at which new fields are created the physicist paul dirac once said that the 1920s when quantum mechanics was discovered was a period in which it was very easy for any second rate physicist to do first rate work indeed history suggests the early days of new scientific fields are often golden ages with fundamental questions about the world being answered quickly and easily by contrast later work often requires far more effort to make progress on more incremental questions as dirac said decades after the discovery of quantum mechanics there has not been such a glorious time since it is very difficult now for a first rate physicist to do second rate work we believe science is badly bottlenecked on field formation in particular we believe current social processes in science are designed to support work in existing fields but strongly inhibit work critical to the creation of new fields what programs would dramatically increase the rate of production of fruitful new fields and how to simultaneously avoid the creation of unfruitful potemkin fields animated by money rather than deep ideas such programs would support ideas which are in their very early stages illegible through conventional processes outside standard disciplines and from unusual sources to develop such programs would mean understanding early signals that a new field is stirring and designing to detect and support those signals we believe many such signals are actively selected against in existing funding programs and selecting for them would unlock tremendous latent potential for discovery how to greatly increase support for high risk high reward projects this is based on the idea popular though not universal among scientists that an enormous opportunity in science is to increase support for high risk high reward research as we mentioned earlier funders often talk about high risk high reward research in their marketing brochures but it s often merely words and research theater not actual risk to develop programs to support genuine risk means developing commitment mechanisms that tie allocation of resources to risk we ve already seen some design ideas that can help measuring risk bundling and unbundling and moving it around through ideas like insurance and hedging improving scientists fallback options one of many possible means of de risking increasing variation and disagreement increasing pressure for a thesis identifying a unique competitive edge these ideas arose incidentally as we developed other ideas pursued for their own sake they could be developed much further and other primitives introduced it s notable that existing science funders seem to be bringing little urgency to the pursuit of such ideas for instance for more than a decade we ve heard funders talk about taking a portfolio approach none that we know of have actually gone beyond largely toothless informal heuristic approaches indeed they are not even systematically using the simplest of tools things like dollar cost averaging routine portfolio rebalancing insurance or hedging much less more sophisticated ideas institutional investors in the financial markets take risk seriously and routinely use such ideas science funders could and should develop analogous ideas risk can potentially be designed and the relationship to reward understood how to fix the problems with hypothesis testing the reproducibility movement hypothesis testing has been widely used in science for decades and plays a central role in many fields it has been known almost as long that it is susceptible to questionable research practices p hacking the file drawer effect and many others the meta researcher john ioannidis has used this to argue that most published research findings are false the rough claim was that a large fraction of results in many fields amount to little more than statistical noise in the 2010s a small cadre of people seriously developed a suite of greatly improved research practices that aimed to make those fields much more reliable this work is ongoing but initial results are encouraging and we discuss this work more in part 2 of this essay the underlying thesis is that these changed practices enable much stronger foundations for many fields and consequently a reliable accumulation of knowledge that may sound dry but it parses out close to it means these fields can begin to make reliable cumulative progress and that s an enormous transformative change how to ensure scientists share results openly so others may build on their work the modern open science movement in the 17th century scientists often kept their discoveries entirely secret or would publish accounts only in the form of anagrams which could later be unscrambled to establish priority over competitors early metascientists such as henry oldenburg realized science and humanity would be far better served if scientists openly shared their discoveries they worked hard to establish the scientific journal system a kind of collective long term memory for humanity one that enabled scientists to build on each others results modern computer networks radically expand the possibilities for open science enabling scientists to build on each others ideas data and code in formerly unprecedented ways this enables an ongoing restructuring of how scientists work both individually and collectively there are many other plausible questions one might ask other generative heuristics to explore the design space even more briefly 1 in biology evolutionary innovation often follows catastrophe this happens in markets too would it lead to an explosion of discovery if we temporarily but drastically decreased and then increased funding to entities such as the nsf we don t expect this suggestion to be popular but that does not mean it s wrong 2 can we use cryptoeconomics to radically improve the political economy of science creating far stronger alignment between individual incentives and collective social good 3 can we diversify exploration and unleash creativity by decreasing the amount of grant overhead since overhead incentivizes universities to follow grant agency fashion and is thus a strong centralizing force these questions are different to where is there intellectual dark matter and how to detect and amplify it but each expresses a different design heuristic helping us explore different parts of the metascience design space as we noted earlier the value of those heuristics lies not in their descriptive correctness or universality but rather in their ability to help generate good new design ideas each is based upon a plausible broad thesis about where there is latent potential for discovery and sketches mechanisms to unlock that potential the greater the potential and the better it is activated the more transformative underlying these heuristics is a view of metascience as an imaginative design practice it s a view very different from that common in the natural sciences which are most often about more deeply understanding existing systems or natural variations thereof design by contrast is about inventing fundamental new types of object and action which don t obviously occur in nature consider genovese maritime insurance as an example it wasn t a change to how ships were built or sailors trained rather it introduced a radical new interlinked set of abstractions the insurance premium counterparties spreading of risk insurance payouts these are beautiful non obvious ideas none of which naturally occur in the world rather they were invented through deep design imagination and despite being made up they transformed humanity s relationship to the world this is characteristic of design imagination it must have seemed to the genovese that financiers were naturally reluctant to finance expeditions given the risks and that this was a fixed feature of the world and yet design showed that this was an illusion which could be radically changed we mention this because discussions of metascience often give short shrift to imaginative design we often meet people who think metascience means studying relatively minor tweaks to existing social processes for things like peer review hiring granting and so on those minor tweaks are genuinely valuable and can teach us much but we believe that imaginative design can be at the core of metascience that means inventing fundamental new primitives for the social processes of science it means developing tremendous design imagination and insight and new ideas to explore the metascience design space we believe the most important and powerful social primitives in this design space are yet to be discovered it s challenging to illustrate this idea of imaginative design as well as we should like that s in part because truly imaginative design is hard the individual program ideas we ve described illustrate no more than rather modest levels of imagination a few ideas like the failure audits or tenure insurance or the century grant program do involve moderately striking new design ideas not all ours but they re not as imaginative as maritime insurance was in its time still we hope you ll think of individual program ideas like these as points in a pointilist sketch to evoke metascience as a design practice and we re confident that deeper and more imaginative ideas are possible than anything we gesture at here developing such ideas is part of the challenge and opportunity of metascience there s no reason to expect scientists to be good at this sort of design scientists are users of the discovery system not for the most part designers there s no reason they should deeply understand how to improve it any more than someone who drives a car should understand how to design and build a great car a good driver will notice problems with their car and may have important insights about cars but that doesn t mean they ll understand the origins of those problems in the design or how to fix them or how to design new and better cars just because someone is good at science doesn t mean they have the skills of a good designer worse they re sometimes convinced they know and will ignore or hold in low regard people who actually have more insight about these things it s all soft skills not real knowledge of science in this view and so how could an outsider have anything useful to say contrariwise just because someone has strong convictions about the social processes of science doesn t mean they actually have much insight indeed we confess to much self doubt on this point on this issue humanity is still figuring out how to tell the difference between people with insight and people who merely have strong convictions about how science should be we ve been developing the idea of metascience as an imaginative design practice in part 2 we ll argue that this is one of three major components of metascience the other two components are 1 metascience as an entrepreneurial discipline actually trialling and then scaling out new social processes and 2 metascience as a research field aimed at deepening our understanding of the social processes of science in part as a tool to evaluate their impact on discovery all three components must work together for metascience to be successful the point about scaling out deserves amplification our discussions so far have been of modest pilot trials that could be done unilaterally today if such ideas were scaled out broadly they would change science far more profoundly than the trials they would change the culture of science i e the ambient environment and background working assumptions scientists take for granted as a concrete example suppose programs to support much higher risk work were scaled out broadly done well the culture would change so that it was routine for scientists to pursue extremely ambitious and risky projects taken far enough some scientists may begin to worry about their plans not being risky enough rather than too risky this change in culture would have many follow on effects in how scientists choose what to work on in how they develop and change over the course of their working lives in the personality characteristics of the people who choose to go into and remain in science and so on we believe it s not an exaggeration to say that such a change would transform the culture of science and it would be a qualitatively different kind of change than merely a trial program that s just one example many others could be given but we trust the broader points are clear 1 large cultural shifts are different in kind from unilateral pilot trials even if the cultural shift is merely making widespread some idea of the trial and 2 each of the trial ideas above have natural extensions as part of broader cultural changes summarizing and looking ahead in the vision that will emerge metascience is not just about the study of science understanding descriptively what is happening it has as a fundamental goal interventions to change science and metascience is not only about incremental interventions it is also about wildly imaginative design conjuring new fundamental elements for social processes in science this is what we mean when we say metascience is an imaginative design discipline furthermore metascience is not just theoretical that is it is not just about new understanding and papers in the conventional academic mode it requires building new organizations new programs new tools and new systems only by such entrepreneurial building is it possible to test metascientific ideas and to improve our understanding that improvement is both valuable in its own right and also improves what people can build in the future at the same time it is not sufficient just to build local systems metascience also requires moving from comparatively small trials to broader cultural changes in science that is the main subject of part 2 of the essay part 2 the decentralized improvement of the social processes of science bottlenecks inhibiting decentralized improvement imagine you re a graduate student with a brilliant idea to improve the way science is funded chafing under what you perceive as a flawed academic system you learn about the history of science and alternate funding models you talk with many scientists and delve into alternate models of the allocation of resources ranging over fields such as finance organizational psychology and anthropology you develop and discard many ideas over time your ideas get more imaginative and insightful and you gradually develop insights you believe would enable you to create a new funding agency one that would given time and resources be vastly superior to the status quo you raise pilot funding and begin to operate you identify some misconceptions in your ideas and improve them still further suppose you did all this and your idea genuinely was vastly better for science than existing funders such as the nsf and nih would your funder rapidly grow to be larger and more influential than the nsf and nih this has not happened in the modern era nor has it happened that such an outsider has rapidly grown a research organization to a scale outstripping harvard and cambridge and other incumbents examples like janelia and altos might seem superficially to be examples but they are not they didn t grow because they were better rather they were simply endowed in advance by wealthy donors indeed the possibility of such growth happening seems almost ludicrous garage band research organizations don t grow to worldwide pre eminence but we ll argue that this kind of change is both highly desirable and potentially feasible in science one tremendous strength of modern science is that a similar phenomenon does happen routinely with scientific ideas outsiders or people with little power e g graduate students replacing established ideas with better ones there are many famous examples think of the way the young and unheralded francis crick james watson and rosalind franklin triumphed over linus pauling in the race to decode the structure of dna pauling was the most famous chemist then alive and he announced his incorrect structure for dna first crick watson and franklin were scrappy outsiders apparently beaten to the punch but they were right and pauling was wrong and their structure was almost immediately accepted by the scientific community including pauling or think of the 22 year old brian josephson whose work on superconductivity was publicly rebutted in a paper by john bardeen the only person ever to win two nobel prizes in physics but josephson was right and bardeen was wrong and the physics community quickly sided with josephson or perhaps the most famous example of all the 26 year old albert einstein a patent clerk who proposed new conceptions of space time mass and energy and in almost no time his ideas triumphed over the old these examples are exalted but something similar happens routinely at a much less exalted level one of the best things a graduate student can do in their phd is convincingly show that a celebrated idea of one of their elders is incomplete often a gentle way of saying wrong or needs extension that s the way careers are made and the ideas of science are updated and improved while this process is often bumpy this replacement or improvement of scientific ideas is genuinely routine it s foundational for science and happens so often that it s tempting to take for granted but it only happens because extraordinary institutions ensure that good ideas from relative outsiders can get a fair hearing even when they contradict established wisdom the value of such decentralized change in ideas has been understood since at least the time of francis bacon who argued for the primacy of experiment and against the received authority of church and state and it was baked into the royal society s motto nullius in verba take no one s word for it chosen in 1660 and still used today of course our scientific institutions don t always achieve this ideal of supporting decentralized change in ideas there are many cases think of lynn margulis or gregor mendel or alfred wegener where the establishment resisted new ideas long after they should have been taken seriously but nonetheless our scientific institutions do remarkably well protecting and testing novel ideas and amplifying genuine improvements even when they come from outsiders what about the analogous process for updating the social processes of science we began this section with the concrete example of a graduate student attempting to displace today s funders or universities but the idea can also be interpreted more broadly to include widespread changes to social processes such as peer review funding hiring and so on such as the alternatives discussed in part 1 in an ideal world there would be a means by which many ideas for new social processes could be easily trialled and then taken quickly through the following metascience learning loop many of the steps in this diagram could be accomplished today by daring and imaginative funders but some of the steps are very difficult to accomplish today in particular suppose you trial some new social process and find it greatly superior to existing processes how would you scale it in this section we argue that there are many strong forces inhibiting scaling enough so that many existing social processes in science are in a state of near stasis almost unable to change more broadly in part 2 we ll discuss whether and how it is possible to move out of this stasis so the social processes of science can be much more rapidly improved when we criticize say funders for being near stasis we re often immediately told that s not true funders try new processes all the time just look at all the interest in funding lotteries funding lotteries are the idea that instead of deciding grant outcomes through a peer review process they should fund grants at random from among the pool of applicants usually after filtering out obviously kooky ideas the hope is that this will increase the diversity of project ideas submitted the idea seems to have first been seriously suggested by daniel greenberg in 1998 it s been developed over the quarter century since and began to receive small scale trials in the latter part of the 2010s now in the early 2020s funding lotteries are a fashionable topic of investigation and it s plausible that over the next decade or so they will be widely deployed although we doubt they ll become the dominant mode of funding funding lotteries are genuinely interesting and we re pleased to see serious trials but we re unimpressed by them as a rebuttal to the charge of stasis they re rather the exception that proves the rule it s hardly dynamism when it takes a quarter century to get widespread interest in and serious trials of one idea there should have been at least a hundred ideas equally or more ambitious trialled over the same period a flood not a trickle most of those ideas would have failed or been qualified successes and ideally a few would have succeeded so decisively that they d now be deployed at scale funding today ought to look vastly different than a quarter century ago not just different in the sense of making the administering bureaucracies happier more process more red tape more requirements for accountability no vastly scientifically better enabling an explosion of discovery when the new york times ran a laudatory 2020 article about encouraging results from small scale trials of funding lotteries they briefly noted the response of the nsf and nih the u s national science foundation and the national institutes of health say that they have not tested lotteries and don t currently plan to do so improving their approach isn t a top institutional priority and matter of urgency for those agencies it s something to do only if it doesn t interfere with other priorities we believe there are four main reasons scalable change to social processes is hard in science first is the centralization of control over science in a small number of large funders and influential research institutions if you ask scientists to tell you how granting hiring and peer review are broken many will tell you about a plethora of problems and make suggestions for improvement unfortunately many of the suggestions are of the form the nih should this may work if the director of the nih or the nsf throws their weight behind the proposal but that happens rarely when most resources are under the control of a few organizations which are not designed to undergo radical organizational change those organizations are a bottleneck preventing improvement second in many cases there is no single organization or person who can make a change again you hear the system needs to change the incentives in even when true no one is singly responsible for processes such as peer review or the importance of high impact journals or etc you can t get a meeting with the director of science as a whole and convince them to throw their weight behind a change they are instead collective action problems this does not mean single individuals can t have a big impact if the director of the nih went on the warpath against impact factor for instance they could make a big difference but it s still a community held norm and requires collective change of course you may complain privately that the incentives are not right and something should be done but while that may blow off steam sensible working scientists mostly just get on with their scientific work the third factor which reinforces the first two is network effects that homogenize social processes over and over we hear variations on i d like to try this new thing publishing in an unconventional way supporting students in high risk or unfashionable work changing to an unfashionable field but i have a responsibility to my students and collaborators to toe the line right now there s a tyranny of the community people won t try unusual things since their community would look askance the unusual things therefore never get serious attention as a result the community thinks poorly of those very possibilities such communities have mechanisms designed to help them collectively change their scientific ideas but no similar mechanism for changing their social processes this is compounded by a shadow of the future people worrying about imagined future judgments of their community suppose for example someone wishes to experiment with sharing their scientific results in a non standard way they must weigh that desire against the imagined future negative judgment of some hiring or granting committee this may seem a small thing but community judgment is so important in science that it strongly inhibits experimentation these three factors badly bottleneck change within existing institutions the obvious workaround is to build new institutions which by fiat may ignore the first two factors such new institutions could for example simply declare that publication in high impact journals is forbidden to employees or engage in practices strongly encouraging high risk work but when this is done the third factor network effects influence the startup institution even more strongly scientists considering working for jazzy not for profit or for profit startup institute must ponder do they really want to give up publication in high impact journals or to work on risky projects that may not pan out or to do anything else which violates the norms of their scientific community if they ever decide to leave their jazzy startup institute job won t they then have a tough time finding another good job after all other potential employers haven t changed their standards just because jazzy startup institute has the shadow of the future looms strongly for such ventures causing a kind of regression to the institutional mean one of us mn has worked in many unusual startup research organizations the perennial question within such organizations is if i hew to local aspirations will that damage my chances of getting a job anywhere else now such forces could be overcome if jazzy startup institute seemed likely to grow to be far larger than others so its standards became dominant and replaced those of the existing community but there s a fourth bottleneck which is that there s no natural feedback loop driving growth in new institutions in particular even if a new institution is scientifically outstanding that does not mean it will grow to be much larger than existing institutions between these four bottlenecking factors the discovery ecosystem can only change many of its social processes very slowly with that said these bottlenecks only apply to change in certain kinds of social process those which are collectively held it is often possible to change social processes when they re not controlled by central agencies or network consensus or strongly influenced by community judgment or the shadow of the future and when we look empirically we see lots of variation in labs and institutions in just these ways we ve seen labs with very unusual approaches to mentorship for example or to hosting visitors or to seminar culture and so on such variations in social process fall outside the bottlenecking forces mentioned above and so can be changed unilaterally such changes are of great interest both from the practical point of view of doing better science and as objects of study within metascience but they re not within the scope of this essay in this sense the essay is about a vision of a particular aspect of metascience that aspect concerned with improving social processes that are collectively held and so subject to these bottlenecks for the most part we ll omit the collectively held from collectively held social processes through the rest of the essay though it should be understood we ve argued that stasis affects collectively held social processes in science this stasis may be illustrated in many ways and we ll now briefly mention a few these examples are not meant as dispositive evidence but rather are merely plausible illustrative examples one such example is provided by the shanghai rankings the longest running ranking of the world s research universities in the 19 years since being founded in 2003 the top 10 universities have merely shuffled around every single year with just one exception 8 in 2003 was replaced in 2004 s table of course such rankings are only imperfect and perhaps do not capture genuine changes within the research ecosystem but neither does this seem illustrative of dynamism and change by contrast if you consider the top ten technology companies in the nasdaq index they ve been transformed over the same time period 2022 s biggest companies include meta facebook which didn t exist at all in 2003 tesla which began operation in 2003 and alphabet google which was a promising but still small private company in 2003 many of today s other behemoths were relatively small in 2003 like nvidia amazon and apple all far down the nasdaq as we noted at the beginning of this section it simply wasn t possible in 2003 for a grad student to start their own research university and to have it grow to be one of the top 10 research universities in the world and yet the analogous thing did happen with nasdaq companies there is far more institutional dynamism in tech than there is in research this is not an intrinsic fact about the world but rather a consequence of the ways the institutions are designed and so can be changed as another illustrative example consider the case of katalin kariko one of the key scientists behind the messenger rna mrna vaccines that helped end the covid 19 pandemic that dominated the world in the early 2020s kariko worked in relative obscurity for decades never earning more than 60 000 per year she was ultimately demoted by the university of pennsylvania her grant applications were repeatedly turned down every night i was working grant grant grant and it came back always no no no a key collaborator said of their attempts to raise funding people were not interested in mrna the people who reviewed the grants said mrna will not be a good therapeutic so don t bother and summarized the situation when your idea is against the conventional wisdom that makes sense to the star chamber it is very hard to break out kariko eventually left the university and academia on its own this story doesn t illustrate stasis rather it seems merely to be a story of mistakes made by the nih and the university of pennsylvania but any system will always make mistakes the issue of stasis arises when we ask whether the discovery ecosystem systematically learns from such mistakes have the nih or the university of pennsylvania done a serious post mortem on this failure and made determined changes to the way they do things the signs are not encouraging the university of pennsylvania which demoted kariko before she left now runs advertisements touting the way penn researchers made the breakthrough leading to the mrna vaccines and sudip parikh chief executive of the american association for the advancement of science claims that the mrna vaccines are a product of doubling our investment in the nih he s not entirely wrong some later work on the mrna vaccines did benefit from nih funding but at the crucial early stages when support was most needed it was and it came back always no no no if research organizations can and will take credit for discoveries where they manifestly screwed up how can the discovery ecosystem get any better kariko s story has been told and retold so many times in so many high profile places that it may become an exception to the rule and actually lead to genuine change but the pattern is commonplace in the late 1980s the molecular biologist douglas prasher figured out how to clone the green fluorescent protein gfp giving some jellyfish their bright green color prasher realized the bright green color made gfp potentially an excellent tracer a kind of tag that could be used to track the location of cells in other organisms not just jellyfish and thus monitor things like gene expression in an organism unfortunately prasher s requests for further funding were turned down fortunately for humanity the work was taken up by other scientists some of whom later received the 2008 nobel prize in chemistry one of the laureates stated of prasher s contribution they could ve easily given the prize to douglas and the other two and left me out at the time of the nobel prize prasher was unable to obtain work in science and was instead working as a shuttle bus driver for a car dealership honest work making a contribution but also something that could be done by many people it s hard not to agree with one of his former colleagues who said it was a staggering waste of talent again the issue is not that a mistake was made by the funder large scale systems operating under conditions of great uncertainty will always make mistakes such mistakes are an important and indeed inevitable part of the process the real problem is how to make those systems responsive so they learn from their errors and so as with kariko the right question to ask is has there been a serious post mortem on the error with prasher and has there been any systematic change in funding or hiring practice as a result again we know of no major initiative to make such changes unfortunately the discovery ecosystem currently appears to learn little from such errors you might respond wasn t all this work ultimately done anyway so is the failure to support the work really an indictment of the current discovery system and does it matter if it doesn t change in response to such apparent errors the trouble with this argument is that we ve no way of knowing what discoveries are not being made at all we see merely the tip of the iceberg scorned scientists who managed to just barely find their way through but how many katalin kariko s have been missed how many are struggling out there right now perhaps on the verge of leaving science and how many have already left science or never even made the entry unfortunately most of the examples of change in social processes that we know of are changes toward more bureaucracy and accountability it s perhaps unsurprising that bureaucracies want more seeming control but it often seems likely that such changes have done as much to hurt science as to help peter higgs the physicist who won the nobel prize for proposing the higgs boson in some sense the ultimate cause of mass in the universe has stated today i wouldn t get an academic job it s as simple as that and described himself as an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises david deutsch co founder of the field of quantum computing conceived quantum computers in the early 1980s without any grant funding later in 1985 deutsch received a small grant for followup work in 2018 he asked a member of the granting committee if he would have gotten that grant under 2018 criteria and was told no chance that he could not have ticked any of those boxes in his nobel lecture sydney brenner one of the great molecular biologists stated i want particularly to record the patient and generous support given to me by the medical research council of great britain such long term research could not be done today when everybody is intent only on assured short term results and nobody is willing to gamble innovation comes only from the assault on the unknown and in 2009 in the the new york times richard klausner a former director of the nih s national cancer institute said there is no conversation that i have ever had about the grant system that doesn t have an incredible sense of consensus that it is not working that is a terrible wasted opportunity for the scientists patients the nation and the world in the 13 years since the nih the world s largest science funder has only made relatively small incremental changes to how it operates in this section we ve argued that many of the social processes of science are in stasis and identified four bottlenecking forces responsible for that stasis our argument is not watertight and we don t expect to convince people who do not want to be convinced but we believe the argument is plausible enough to proceed in the remainder of this essay we ask how can we avoid or weaken these bottlenecking forces to achieve scalable improvements in the social processes of science a prototype of success the replication crisis and the renaissance in social psychology so is there any prospect for breaking this near stasis in an ideal world we d recount many inspiring stories of change and develop a playbook for what we shall later dub metascience entrepreneurship unfortunately the inhibiting forces are strong and many of the examples we looked at while researching the essay were depressing stories of sclerosis is a better title for a horror movie than an essay about science still there are some partial successes and in this section we discuss a major change we admire both to see what we can learn and to try to understand what remains to be done the example comes from the replication crisis in social psychology which we briefly mentioned earlier the crisis is usually described as a negative event but as we ll see it can be viewed as a positive prototype for changed social processes while also illustrating the challenges of making such changes it is perhaps most often associated to a remarkable 2015 paper which attempted to replicate the results of 100 experimental social psychology papers all taken from leading psychology journals this 2015 paper put together by a collaboration of 270 authors calling itself the open science collaboration found that only 36 of the 100 replications reported statistically significant results by contrast 97 of the original studies reported statistically significant results furthermore the mean effect sizes in the replications were roughly half of the original effect sizes this paper helped ignite a major controversy not just within social psychology but broadly across science many people considered the drop from 97 to 36 a sign that something was badly amiss in social psychology a 2015 new york times article quoted jelte wicherts an associate professor of scientific methodology and statistics at tilburg university as saying i think we knew or suspected that the literature had problems but to see it so clearly on such a large scale it s unprecedented in the seven years since publication the open science collaboration s 2015 paper has been cited more than 7 000 times we ve had individual scientists tell us things like i no longer trust many of my own papers before it s not that they were dishonest in the earlier papers rather they were proceeding honestly and carefully as they understood things at that time but they now understand that the methodological approaches they used in earlier work were unreliable some well known social psychologists were unhappy with the furor in the same new york times article norbert schwarz a professor of psychology at the university of southern california commented there s no doubt replication is important but it s often just an attack a vigilante exercise in a highly critical response to the 2015 paper also published in science researchers at harvard and the university of virginia concluded we applaud efforts to improve psychological science many of which have been careful responsible and effective and we appreciate the effort that went into producing osc but metascience is not exempt from the rules of science osc used a benchmark that did not take into account the multiple sources of error in their data used a relatively low powered design that demonstrably underestimates the true rate of replication and permitted considerable infidelities that almost certainly biased their replication studies toward failure as a result osc seriously underestimated the reproducibility of psychological science as suggested by these quotes the 2015 open science collaboration paper triggered a lot of pushback and a robust and still ongoing conversation what did the unsuccessful replications mean were there major problems in some techniques commonly used in social psychology were major reforms in the field needed and what if anything did it mean for other fields of science the paper had many thoughtful caveats e g it is also too easy to conclude that a failure to replicate a result means that the original evidence was a false positive replications can fail if the replication methodology differs from the original in ways that interfere with observing the effect we conducted replications designed to minimize a priori reasons to expect a different result by using original materials engaging original authors for review of the designs and conducting internal reviews nonetheless unanticipated factors in the sample setting or procedure could still have altered the observed effect magnitudes after this intensive effort to reproduce a sample of published psychological findings how many of the effects have we established are true zero and how many of the effects have we established are false zero is this a limitation of the project design no it is the reality of doing science even if it is not appreciated in daily practice humans desire certainty and science infrequently provides it scientific progress is a cumulative process of uncertainty reduction that can only succeed if science itself remains the greatest skeptic of its explanatory claims as earlier quotes suggest there is disagreement about what s causing the replication crisis however many scientists suspect the cause is certain practices widely used in social psychology that may make it easy to publish incorrect results for example the practice of only publishing a study when it obtains a statistically significant finding that sounds reasonable after all when things don t pan out doesn t it make sense to move along quickly to your next project it s practical also since many scientific journals are extremely reluctant to publish null findings but this practice has a dark side if you do enough studies pure chance means that occasionally you will obtain what looks like evidence for an effect but was really a statistical fluke furthermore if null results are seldom reported that means the literature may fill up with papers providing evidence which is just such statistical flukes what seems like a reasonable practice can create a consequential bias in scientific journals we ve focused on the role of the 2015 open science collaboration paper in triggering the replication crisis but the replication crisis arose gradually it s beyond our scope to do a full history but useful to sketch some of the background at first this brief history will seem disconnected to the arc of the essay not a changed social process in sight but we ll eventually see that these apparently disconnected historical facts reflect why it s so hard to change social processes and what ultimately needed to happen the 2015 paper was the culmination of a series of troubling events over 2011 2015 this series began in 2011 when a well known social psychologist named diederik stapel was found to have committed fraud fabricating data on a large scale since then more than 50 of stapel s papers have been retracted the year 2011 also saw the publication of a paper by the social psychologist daryl bem using the methods of social psychology to demonstrate evidence for precognition this wasn t a crank it was a well known and respected social psychologist publishing a peer reviewed paper in the high profile journal of personality and social psychology furthermore unlike in stapel s case there was no suspicion of fraud bem s work used standard practices in the field however the extremely surprising nature of the results posed a sharp question about whether those standard practices might sometimes produce unreliable results in 2012 stéphane doyen and colleagues published an attempt to replicate the famous priming effect in psychology the result in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory that replication failed it was an embarrassing failure for the field in part because in 2011 nobel laureate daniel kahneman had published a widely read popular book which described the priming studies extensively in the book kahneman states about priming disbelief is not an option the results are not made up nor are they statistical flukes you have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true yet the failed replications led kahneman to lose much confidence in the field and he wrote a widely distributed letter noting that questions have been raised about the robustness of priming results and that i see a train wreck looming kahneman s letter received a lot of public scrutiny with these events in the background in 2012 it began to be common to use the phrase replication crisis to describe the state of social psychology many social psychologists were concerned about the state of their field and a steady drip of troubling results continued until the 2015 open science collaboration paper demonstrated that the problems weren t just sporadic but were plausibly affecting the entire field but while the replication crisis came to a head over 2011 2015 many of the problems had been known for decades writing in 1985 the well known psychologist paul meehl identified 10 obfuscating influences in what he called soft psychology these were widely used practices including the practice described above of only submitting for publication studies which obtain statistical significance meehl did not hold back the net epistemic effect of these ten obfuscating influences is that the usual research literature is well nigh uninterpretable if the reader is impelled to object at this point well but for heaven s sake you are practically saying that the whole tradition of testing substantive theories in soft psychology by null hypothesis refutation is a mistake despite r a fisher and co in agronomy that complaint does not disturb me because that is exactly what i am arguing well nigh uninterpretable is about as damning a phrase as we know to describe a large fraction of an entire field similar points though less flamboyantly phrased have often been made by other scientists writing in 1975 the well known social psychologist anthony greenwald identified many of the same problems with significance testing among others he identified the following behaviors as problematic submitting results for publication more often when the null hypothesis has been rejected than when it has not been rejected continuing research on a problem when results have been close to rejection of the null hypothesis near significant while abandoning the problem if rejection of the null hypothesis is not close failing to report initial data collections renamed as pilot data or false starts using stricter editorial standards for evaluating manuscripts that conclude in favor of rather than against the null hypothesis all these practices are understandable very human behaviors if your study almost shows statistical significance it s tempting to run just a few more analyses in the hope of meeting the threshold for significance that way you can publish it rather than abandoning months of work as unpublishable unfortunately such practices may also lead to a scientific literature full of erroneous conclusions as mentioned in part 1 in 2005 the meta researcher john ioannidis published the provocatively titled why most published research findings are false the essence of ioannidis s paper is that in many parts of science we lack good theories to tell us what are plausible hypotheses and what are not because of that people are likely to test many false hypotheses if they test far more false hypotheses than true say 20 false hypotheses for each true one then false positives might outnumber true positives in the published literature indeed for any given experimental data set it s often possible to run many different analyses and in this way you re very likely to eventually find some apparently interesting hypothesis that seems supported by the data the scientific l

people with adhd are having trouble filling adderall prescriptions at some pharmacies because of a nationwide shortage in both brand name and generic adderall example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video beginning in late summer some people raised alarms about a potential nationwide shortage of adderall a stimulant medication commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder commonly known as adhd if you take this medication i d recommend you talk to your doctor asap said one doctor in a warning about the adderall shortage on twitter there is no release date as of right now meaning we don t know when it ll be back in stock the question is there a nationwide shortage of adderall the sources the answer yes there is a nationwide shortage of adderall this includes generic versions of the drug what we found both the food and drug administration fda and the american society of health system pharmacists ashp report a nationwide shortage of mixed amphetamine salts commonly referred to by the brand name adderall on their separate drug shortage databases the fda announced a nationwide adderall shortage on oct 12 saying it was limited to the immediate release formulation of the name brand drug and its generic versions ashp which uses different criteria from the fda for identifying a drug shortage says the shortage has been ongoing since july 27 2022 for immediate release formulations of adderall and since aug 24 2022 for the longer lasting extended release formulation the current shortage of amphetamine salts is due to manufacturing delays by one of the larger manufacturers of the product an ashp spokesperson said other manufacturers are unable to make enough supply to keep up with demand the fda clarified the manufacturer experiencing delays is teva pharmaceuticals which produces both brand name adderall and generic versions of the drug teva the largest supplier of adderall in the u s told nbc news back in august that a labor shortage on its packaging line was to blame for delays in delivering orders to some pharmacies this shortage follows another adderall shortage that began in 2019 and ended in spring 2022 according to the fda and ashp we received a lot of shortage reports from patients during the shortage earlier this year but we are receiving many more reports from patients about the current shortage so it appears to be worse the ashp spokesperson said back in august the national community pharmacists association ncpa said that 64 of surveyed community pharmacies had trouble getting ahold of adderall this year teva may remain behind on fulfilling demand until december 2022 according to the fda teva has active supply of both branded adderall and its generic version and continues to produce and refill the channel regularly at levels above historical demand a teva spokesperson told verify in an emailed statement it is possible that some people may encounter a backorder intermittently based on timing and demand but these are only temporary we are actively shipping both branded and generic adderall to customers and we expect inventory recovery in the coming months even with the manufacturing delays and labor issues the fda says teva has been producing a larger supply of adderall than it would typically expect to due to increased market demand according to health research company trilliant health adderall prescriptions nationwide have increased since before the covid 19 pandemic began this trend is driven entirely by a sharp increase in prescriptions for adults the fda said that patients who take adderall should talk to their doctor about alternative treatment options if they have difficulty getting their medication

larry fink is having a bad year some estimates place investments withdrawn from blackrock the firm where he is ceo at nearly 3 billion just from states pulling treasury funds due to fink s public political agenda in the second quarter of 2022 blackrock exceeded average market losses with assets under management falling 22 to 8 5 trillion third quarter assets under management fell another 15 with adjusted earnings down 12 8 and revenue falling 15 advertisement following the third quarter release ubs analyst brennan hawken downgraded the company s stock from buy to neutral and dropped the target price to 585 from 700 in hawken s note on the change he cited growing pushback on blackrock s environment social and governance esg investment strategy we are downgrading blk to neutral based on environmental pressure to earnings and risk from the firm s esg positioning hawken wrote in a note stating that blackrock could face increased regulatory inspection and the possibility of diminished fund management business blk s early and energetic adoption of esg principles in its fund management and shareholder proxy activities have positioned the firm as an esg leader in our view however as performance deteriorates and political risk from esg has increased we believe the potential for lost fund mandates and regulatory scrutiny has recently increased in august 19 states joined together to pen a letter to fink warning that state funds would be in jeopardy if blackrock continued to prioritize environmental goals over investor returns the letter cited dozens of examples where fink s public statements and blackrock s actions conflict directly with the company s claims of political neutrality will hild director of consumers research said in response to hawken s assessment ubs is acknowledging the reality that american consumers and the state officials that manage their pensions are waking up to blackrock s esg scam their misuse of public and private funds has cost americans thousands in increased inflation people are sick of it and fighting back ubs is right the backlash against blackrock has just begun advertisement related louisiana fights back against blackrock for pushing woke agenda following hild s warning news broke that missouri state treasurer scott fitzpatrick announced that the missouri state employees retirement system mosers pulled 500 million in pension funds managed by blackrock fitzpatrick cited his belief that blackrock was ignoring its fiduciary responsibility in favor of forcing a political and social agenda this is the right thing to do for missouri state employees who rely on the assets managed by mosers for their retirement fiduciary duty must remain the top priority for investment managers a duty some of them have abdicated in favor of forcing a left wing social and political agenda that has failed to succeed legislatively on publicly traded companies fitzpatrick said he added mosers has an obligation to manage its assets in a way that prioritizes providing maximum possible returns for retirees and taxpayers we should not allow asset managers such as blackrock who have demonstrated that they will prioritize advancing a woke political agenda above the financial interests of their customers to continue speaking on behalf of the state of missouri missouri state treasurer fitzpatrick is taking decisive action to protect the people of missouri by divesting pension funds from blackrock who has weaponized esg by pushing radical climate and social policies under the guise of an investment strategy said derek kreifels ceo of the state financial officers foundation sfof advertisement kreifels went on to explain how esg investing hurts americans blackrock s reckless agenda is robbing americans of their retirement dollars and driving up costs from the gas pump to the grocery store treasurer fitzpatrick s commitment to his fiduciary duty and protecting missourians hard earned money follows similar actions to protect individual s investments by several states including utah west virginia arkansas louisiana and most recently south carolina recommended new gain of function research on omicron raises serious questions following fitzpatrick s announcement hild added treasurer fitzpatrick is the latest in a growing line of state officials who are taking action to show the citizens of their state they re willing to do what it takes to protect their financial well being from blackrock s dishonest investment strategy he also noted the effect esg investing has on consumers adding to the fact that blackrock is prioritizing politics over profits is the primary role they ve played in crippling american energy companies and driving our nation into our current energy crisis blackrock s esg crusade has harmed american consumers financially and it will leave many americans struggling to heat their homes this winter consumers research applauds treasurer fitzpatrick for doing what is right for missouri and the american people advertisement fink did cheer rising energy costs at the recent meeting of the clinton global initiative he said they reduced the green premium and called to change the charters of global banks to align with his global esg agenda it looks like fink s firm is paying a green penalty as of today s close blackrock is trading below hawken s new target at 581 a loss of almost 40 year to date

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net
