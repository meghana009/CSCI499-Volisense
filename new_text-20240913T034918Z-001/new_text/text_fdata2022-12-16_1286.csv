daily treatment for schizophrenia without the need for titration data show clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement with emraclidine in panss total score at six weeks and was overall well tolerated compared with placebo results demonstrate selective targeting of the m4 muscarinic receptor subtype as a potential novel treatment approach for schizophrenia comprehensive phase 2 development program in schizophrenia currently underway cambridge mass dec 15 2022 globe newswire cerevel therapeutics nasdaq cere a company dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the brain to treat neuroscience diseases announced today the publication of data from its phase 1b clinical trial of emraclidine a novel muscarinic m4 selective positive allosteric modulator in adults living with schizophrenia in the lancet in the phase 1b trial both treatment groups of emraclidine assessing 30 mg once daily and 20 mg twice daily demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in assessments of symptom severity positive and negative syndrome scale panss total score and emraclidine was generally well tolerated compared with placebo after six weeks of treatment we believe the data from the phase 1b trial published in the lancet support the potential of emraclidine to be an important treatment option with a novel mechanism of action for people living with schizophrenia said john h krystal m d robert l mcneil jr professor of translational research and professor of psychiatry of neuroscience and psychology and chair of the yale department of psychiatry at yale school of medicine emraclidine demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant antipsychotic effects with no meaningful differences in gastrointestinal adverse events extrapyramidal symptoms or weight gain compared with placebo current schizophrenia treatment options are often associated with debilitating side effects including neuromotor effects sedation weight gain metabolic abnormalities and an increased risk for heart disease unfortunately these side effects have a negative impact on a person s quality of life and functioning and can lead to treatment discontinuation and relapse said christoph correll m d author professor of psychiatry at the zucker school of medicine at hofstra northwell in new york and professor and chair of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at charité university medicine in berlin based on the impressive findings from the phase 1b trial emraclidine a potential treatment with a novel mechanism of action may provide an alternative therapy for people living with schizophrenia that may help mitigate the vicious cycle of disease progression that has been driven at least in part by problems with tolerability of current treatment options we are so pleased that the positive results of the phase 1b trial have been published in this leading medical journal the lancet underscoring the strength of cerevel s deliberate and differentiated scientific approach to bringing forward novel treatments to address devastating neuroscience diseases said raymond sanchez m d author chief medical officer of cerevel therapeutics cerevel is rapidly advancing emraclidine as a potential treatment option for people living with schizophrenia and recently initiated its comprehensive phase 2 development program by selectively targeting the m4 receptor subtype emraclidine has demonstrated a potential novel treatment approach rationally designed to harness antipsychotic benefit with the goal of minimizing the side effects associated with non selective muscarinic agents said john renger ph d author chief scientific officer cerevel therapeutics this publication underscores our scientific leadership as we work tirelessly towards becoming the premier neuroscience company data from this trial were announced in june 2021 as well as at conferences including the american college of neuropsychopharmacology 2021 the 2022 congress of the schizophrenia international research society psych congress 2022 and the neuroscience education institute congress 2022 based on these positive results in june 2022 cerevel initiated its phase 2 development program evaluating emraclidine in schizophrenia in two adequately powered placebo controlled phase 2 trials known as empower 1 and empower 2 expected to read out in the first half of 2024 recently in order to accelerate a potentially registrational package for emraclidine in schizophrenia the company also initiated empower 3 a 52 week open label safety extension trial about the phase 1b trial design this two part phase 1b trial was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of emraclidine in people living with schizophrenia the first part of the trial part a was a multiple ascending dose design to establish safety tolerability and appropriate dosing based on pharmacokinetics the second part of the trial part b assessed the safety and tolerability of emraclidine 30 mg once daily and 20 mg twice daily compared with placebo about emraclidine emraclidine is a positive allosteric modulator designed to selectively target the m4

by adam beam sacramento calif ap california will stop making companies pay employees who can t work because they caught the coronavirus while on the job for the past two years california workplace regulators have tried to slow the spread of the coronavirus by requiring infected workers to stay home while also guaranteeing them they would still be paid but thursday the california occupational safety and health standards board voted to end that rule in 2023 in part because the rule has become harder to enforce only people who caught the virus while at work are eligible to keep getting paid but the coronavirus is now so widespread that it s much harder to tell where someone got sick plus changes in quarantine rules mean most workers are not required to stay home once they ve been exposed to the virus as long as they don t have symptoms and don t test positive for the disease while the board approved the new rule by a 6 1 vote many board members said they were disappointed the rule was changed the new rules will last for two years because they are temporary regulations put in place in response to the pandemic regulators will soon begin working on permanent rules and thursday several board members promised to make sure the permanent rules include a requirement for sick workers to keep getting paid we are now going to be telling workers they must be excluded from work if they are sick from workplace exposure but we are not requiring they will be paid we all know this will lead to people needing to work while sick board member laura stock said i really want to ensure that we won t make this mistake again workers who do miss work because of the coronavirus can use sick leave a state law passed earlier this year requires companies to give workers up to two weeks of paid time off if they get sick from the coronavirus but that law expires in december and it s not clear if lawmakers will extend it in 2023 not all workers have sick leave including low wage workers in the service industry like fast food restaurants those workers can file for workers compensation benefits if they have to miss time because they have the coronavirus but the process is arduous and it s no guarantee they will be approved mitch steiger senior legislative advocate for the california labor federation said people who file workers compensation claims are five times more likely to be denied than people who file non coronavirus claims it doesn t matter where the worker got the virus to show up at work with it can then become a workplace outbreak steiger said although the rules about paying workers are changing much of the other covid 19 regulations are still in place the state still has rules about ventilation testing and how to handle outbreaks companies are still required to notify employees if they have been exposed to the virus while at work and they have to make free coronavirus tests available to workers who have come in close contact with someone else on the job who has been infected business groups on thursday urged the board to reject the rules arguing there doesn t need to be any coronavirus standards at all democratic gov gavin newsom will end the state s coronavirus emergency declaration in february and all of the executive orders that came with it thursday the orange county public health agency announced it was shifting its coronavirus response from an emergency posture to routine business operations now is the moment to end this said rob moutire policy advocate for the california chamber of commerce

so at one point today stocks were down 950 points that s after falling 150 points yesterday it took a while for fed head jay powell s comment to sink in but as we noted last night powell and the fed are aiming for recession that s what their new economic projections show a 1 point rise in unemployment and a 0 5 gdp for next year that s as institutionally close as a central bank will ever come to letting you know in their own little fed speak way that they want a recession right of course recessions are bad for stocks by the way recessions are bad for everybody and as art laffer said last night if you believe a recession is coming well what are you doing to prevent it well the answer from jay powell is we re not going to prevent it we re going to keep raising rates and cutting back on excess money that s a hell of a way to run a railroad you know if powell really had hair on his chest he would stand up on his hind legs and tell congress to stop excess federal spending or taxing or regulating and end the war against fossil fuels dow plunges in perfect storm for stocks in fact there was a time when both paul volcker and alan greenspan as fed chairs would actually negotiate with congress and the white house behind the scenes that if you cut spending and the deficit we won t raise rates now jay powell was a cheerleader for the spending bills in 2021 he kept telling us there was no inflation problem and then it was transitory now he s telling us there s an intractable inflation problem and he s going to keep tightening money into a recession i call that swinging from one extreme to the other it s not healthy for a senior public servant actually it s not healthy for anybody and speaking of unhealthy behavior well senator rand paul was dead right when he said on this show last night sen rand paul the omnibus will be 3 000 pages we ll get it 2 hours before they want to pass it no one will read it but hidden in the 3 000 pages will be we are going to waive pay go so steve moore is right it will take 41 votes but the other thing is 41 votes would stop the big spending we have completely and totally abdicated the power of the purse republicans are emasculated they have no power and they are unwilling to gain that power back what a wonderful clip what a great senator our pal steve moore has argued to enforce the budget spending caps or some combination of actions that would generate automatic spending cuts or negotiated spending cuts that might take 150 billion out of the 2 trillion monstrosity called the omnibus bill there are twelve appropriation committees that should be holding public hearings on the merits of spending levels and policies there should also be a budget resolution to direct those appropriation committees in aggregate terms this is called regular order but there s nothing regular about regular order the senate bypasses it and puts a couple people in a smoke filled room and decides to spend whatever it wants dictating its will on 350 million americans who may well suffer the inflationary and recessionary consequences of their usurpation of power this is so undemocratic it s beyond belief this is so unrepresentative that it s beyond belief and it s so antithetical to economic prosperity that it s beyond belief now the latest news the house has passed a continuing res that goes to december 23 this afternoon the senate voted 75 20 to debate a one week cr big deal that s just buying time for this omnibus bill which may spend several hundred billion dollars in new money above the current services baseline might stick in child tax credits without work requirements in fact it might put a bunch of temporary covid spending plans and turn them into permanent mandatory spending that s what democrats want to do and the republican leadership is going along with this so far that is pathetic click here to get the fox news app rand paul told us that the last time he proposed to enforce the spending caps he had 3 votes plus himself in the gop conference isn t that just terrific what s that to do with republican credibility on spending and inflation the answer from our friend senator paul is that it emasculates the gop s credibility merriam webster dictionary defines emasculation as deprival of strength vigor or spirit message to gop senators get your manhood back shut down the government if you have to but save america and kill the omnibus bill this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the december 15 2022 edition of kudlow

after three days of exhaustive heart wrenching work on the part of our newspaper staff that began moments after the very first call for help rang out from sandy hook elementary school on the morning of december 14 2012 and continued through the weekend the newtown bee published an extra edition for the first time in its history providing readers with hyper local coverage on the tragedy and how the world was reacting to it written by then editor curtiss clark this editorial from the front page of that special edition was recognized as the best of the year among his peers by the new england newspaper press association as our community continues to reflect on the events of that fateful december morning ten years on we felt it appropriate to reprint that award winning editorial the holiday season had already settled over newtown like a snow globe and the spirited center of sandy hook glittered with lights and bubbled with good cheer then on friday morning a young man filled with anger and trouble armed beyond reason took deadly aim at sandy hook s true heart its elementary school the violence wrought in the next several minutes left 26 dead mostly 6 and 7 year olds and several of the adults who tried to protect them the scale and the horror of the crime still outpaces our capacity to understand it we expect it always will the shootings at sandy hook elementary school shook and shattered the spell of newtown s picturesque holiday traditions and the anguish and grief that spilled out of us was delivered to the world by legions of journalists arriving in caravans of satellite trucks as if drawn by some dark star of calamity what they found when they got to town however was not a town in pieces but a community already coming together with friends neighbors and mere acquaintances gathering around those most grievously wounded and supporting each other as the people in this town have always done inevitably because we are the town that we are that became the story broadcast to the world so many people in town have been interviewed by journalists who have never been to newtown before some have never been to new england before of the many inquiries the bee received from journalists around the country and abroad we were struck by the curiosity of two television news crews from germany and denmark who presented themselves in our lobby with questions which we are sure were asked repeatedly of people all over town the questions went to the character of our town two questions were typical did you ever in your wildest imagination think that such a tragedy could happen in newtown the answer unexpected as it may seem for this stock question is yes newtown is not a sleepy town as some seemed to think and its people are not unthinking or without sophistication it turns out we are imaginative and whenever we have heard of other places wounded by hideous crimes like columbine or virginia tech our wild imaginings did consider the possibility of it happening here our school personnel and emergency responders prepared and trained for such an improbable occurrence and that forethought and training certainly saved lives knowing what we know now we would characterize those imaginings as being more rational than wild these shootings have certainly changed the town so how will newtown get over this and where will the town go from here yes the killings at sandy hook school have turned the town upside down how and when we get our bearings straight depends on the uncertain requirements and timetable of emotional healing which varies for each of us but we are already on our way buoyed not only by the poignant vigils and religious services of this past weekend but by the outpouring of support for our town from around the world when the president of the united states comes to grieve with us the world watches and shares our sorrow and supports our recovery in this special edition we share a sampling of the hundreds of messages of heartfelt concern and support that have come in to the bee from around the nation and the world this collective focus of concern for our town and for the hardships of our people is not without meaning or consequence it makes real the holiday wish from st luke that so often is repeated by rote and on earth goodwill toward men as to where we go from here we answer as always that in setting our sights on the future we take direction from our past from the 300 years of newtown s history the community has inherited a legacy of independence of spirit self awareness and community action people take care of each other here there is 135 years of evidence of that in the pages of the bee that story will not change in the future but our community has suffered a grievous wound a wound that will leave an obvious scar from now on when people learn that we are from newtown they will focus on that scar and perhaps impolitely it will be the first thing they ask about our town we will never hide it or

the world which is listening so closely to us now remember the great promise of all the lives of the children and the educators who died at sandy hook elementary school and live accordingly

gov kathy hochul said thursday that she s not considering raising taxes in her new state budget proposal due out next month even though new york s fiscal outlook continues to deteriorate hochul said that just one year ago the state s revenues were at near record rates and federal pandemic related funding was pouring in from washington literally a year ago when we were looking at our landscape it was very bright hochul said it was a bright day now the u s is experiencing the highest rate of inflation in 40 years concern over high fuel prices and a drop in the stock market this year it s a totally different story hochul said she said controlling state spending will be a top priority in 2023 the governor said she s already working on her budget proposal which is due at the end of january and she said raising taxes will not be part of the equation i don t believe that raising taxes at a time when we just cut taxes makes sense hochul said hochul last year initiated a property tax rebate and implemented the final phase of a middle class tax cut two years ago before she was governor the state raised the income tax rate on wealthy new yorkers the governor said she is also not reneging on a commitment to fully fund schools under what s known as the state s foundation aid formula the funding was the subject of a decades long court battle which plaintiffs won in 2006 but a plan to fulfill the order and fully fund the schools was scrapped during the great recession just over a decade ago an agreement to fully restore the money did not come until this year under the plan an additional 21 3 billion will go to schools in the next state budget and increase to 23 2 billion a year by 2024 when it is fully phased in hochul said there are also built in increases in health care funding and in the medicaid program which is partially funded by the state and she said those increases which she called necessary for helping move out of the pandemic also won t be altered those are already committed obligations that we are going to meet the governor said but then there s all the agencies and how we manage those robert mujica hochul s budget director has asked the agencies to hold the line on spending in their budget requests mujica said he and the governor took steps in the current budget in case an economic downturn occurred they held back billions of dollars from pandemic related federal funding in reserves and are growing the rainy day fund from 4 to 15 of the state s total budget and he said some big ticket one time spending items including bonus payments to health care workers were financed with one time sources of revenue from the federal relief packages so they won t be a burden on future spending plans but mujica said the federal reserve s recent interest rate increases aimed at slowing economic growth to tame inflation will likely alter the state s predictions of steady economic growth over the next few years he said that s a concern for wall street and the financial industry which is responsible for a significant percentage of the state s total tax collections the outlook is extraordinarily challenging mujica said mujica said for now though revenue collections remain strong and unemployment is low close to pre pandemic levels mujica is leaving his job at the end of the year to run the financial oversight board in puerto rico his successor has not yet been named

ellen stanek cfa managing director co chief investment officer and president of baird funds managed by such a deep and experienced team these funds have proven to be great complements to our existing funds and provide additional choices for our investor on the occasion of this three year milestone the baird municipal team shared a few thoughts on the current market environment yields rose significantly in 2022 as the federal reserve sought to harness inflation what did that mean for bond investors in 2022 as yields rose and the curve flattened and then inverted the odds of a recession have increased we expect inflation to temper over the next several quarters while the labor market is still very tight secular disinflationary forces such as demographics and technology persist the bond market seems to be saying that the inflation surge will not be a long term issue that said with yields up sharply and spreads widening we see market opportunities but this will be accompanied by a higher risk environment with higher volatility and periods of less liquidity what does this mean for bond investors going forward the upside is that bond investors are now earning significantly higher yields the inverted yield curve can mean that investors are especially benefiting at the short end of the curve but this may be fleeting past curve inversions have been an economic signal of a looming recession which has led to declining interest rates investors with a longer time horizon were rewarded for moving out beyond very short maturities read our latest insights the fleeting free lunch of the inverted yield curve what is your outlook on the mnicipal bond market for 2023 municipal credits are in great shape with revenues and reserves providing support for the market we

austin texas ap shares of tesla rose slightly thursday despite news that ceo elon musk sold another 3 58 billion worth of the electric vehicle maker s stock this week the stock closed at 157 67 up less than 1 but still close to its two year lows tesla did fare better than the broader u s stock market where concerns about rising interest rates led to a 2 5 drop in the s p 500 index musk the new owner of twitter sold the tesla shares from monday through wednesday according to a filing posted wednesday night with the u s securities and exchange commission it wasn t clear where the proceeds of the sales were being spent musk has sold nearly 23 billion worth of tesla stock since april with much of the money likely going to help fund his 44 billion acquisition of twitter early last month he sold nearly 4 billion worth of tesla shares according to regulatory filings the sale comes as shares of the electric vehicle and solar panel maker have collapsed losing over half their value since musk first disclosed in april that he was buying up twitter stock wedbush analyst dan ives said in a client note that musk seems to be changing the tesla narrative from the fundamental electric vehicle transformation story to becoming a source of funds to finance his twitter acquisition the twitter nightmare continues as musk uses tesla as his own atm machine to keep funding the red ink at twitter which gets worse by the day as more advertisers flee the platform with controversy increasingly driven by musk ives wrote the falling shares of tesla have bumped musk from his status as the world s wealthiest person with his net worth falling to 174 billion according to forbes he was passed last week by french fashion and cosmetics magnate bernard arnault
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the new england fishery management council announced a new 10 year plan as climate change is largely blamed for the fish s decline in maine waters newburyport mass european sailors in the 1600s and indigenous people before them discovered cod as the first plentiful fishery on maine s coast long before even lobster but the species has sharply declined in recent decades and a governing body is setting new fishing rules to try to bring the population back the new england fishery management council announced a new 10 year cod management plan that includes catch limits for fishermen tom nies is the executive director of the council that regulates the region s fisheries it s extremely low right now compared to where it has been historically he said of the popular white fish as reported by the associated press annual catch totals in the early 1990s were around 20 million pounds in 2021 maine fishermen hauled in 50 000 pounds though the population declined quickly it s going to take serious work to bring it back up there are no magic answers nies shrugged all you can do is keep trying maine fishermen aren t trying to catch cod these days said ben martens president of the maine coast fishermen s association his organization placed cod as the only fish on its logo cod was what we built new england on the back of he said now it s happenstance when a groundfisherman pulls one up in their net martens said that while they sometimes disagree with federal regulators on the data points his fishermen are equally invested in bringing the fish back from the brink in a way that s what makes the council s job difficult these days it s not fighting fishermen to stop overfishing jamie cournane has spent a decade with the council and heads its groundfish work instead she explained they re up against our changing planet some of the biggest challenges to try and rebuild the stock have to do with factors outside of fishing which include those environmental conditions that changing climate cournane said and that s something that cod is facing right now the good news for any concerned fishermen catch limits won t change for the next two years making the process gradual the bad news after that the council won t know how strict to be until they look at the catch numbers from those two years fishermen in particular are eternally hopeful that the next year is going to be better and there will be more fish in the ocean martens said
when jillian barkley opened soft spirits a non alcoholic bottle shop in los angeles in october 2021 the selection of non alcoholic na wines fit on one very small shelf a year later there s a whole wall of the store dedicated to the beverages that s due in part to demand non alcoholic wine is our fastest growing category and the option customers seem most excited about she says in fact nielseniq found a 23 2 increase in demand for na wines in 2022 as compared to 2021 if you re looking to try some na bottles or just want to have sans alcohol options on hand for your next gathering it s important to know how to pair these booze free wines with food while some wine and food pairing rules still apply there are distinct differences but before we get to the pairings here s a brief look at na wine basics what is non alcoholic wine at sipple an na bottle shop in houston founder danny frounfelkner stocks two different styles of na wine the first is alcohol free wine in which fermentation was stopped during the winemaking process these offerings tend to be more fruit forward according to frounfelkner then there s dealcoholized wines which began as fermented wine but have had the alcohol removed often through vapor distillation of the two customers gravitate more towards dealcoholized wines as they re more wine adjacent he says frounfelkner s favorites include dealcoholized wines by prima pavé buzzkill surely noughty giesen sovi and jøyus there are also bottlings like those by proxies these beverages aren t wine but aim to recreate the experience of enjoying it with a meal proxies are built from the ground up by layering ingredients like fruit tea acid spices bitters and more in order to preserve the complexity tannin texture acid and body intrinsic in wine without any alcohol says devin campbell co founder and chief product officer at proxies now that we have the basics down here s how the pros recommend pairing na wines with a wide array of appetizers how to pair na wine with cheese soft cheese getty images i d pair a soft brie with non1 salted raspberry chamomile says frounfelkner the australian brand makes some interesting lightly sparkling easygoing blends with a nice hit of salinity that can make them fun to pair with food for creamy burrata or buffalo mozzarella he recommends prima pavé s blanc de blancs or its rosé brut the former is a dry blend of pinot grigio sauvignon blanc and gewürztraminer grapes the rosé is fruity and crisp and made with the same grape trio along with montepulciano d abruzzo for tangy goat cheese frounfelkner suggests trying dealcoholized brand sipclean s rosé or giesen rosé barkley also recommends new zealand winemaker giesen but her pick is the sauvignon blanc which serves as an acidic counterpoint to milky cheeses like muenster or gouda hard cheese getty images frounfelkner would pair manchego with sovi red blend or noughty rouge for a salty pecorino he d pair it with giesen sauvignon blanc barkley is also a manchego fan and says this buttery spanish sheep s milk cheese pairs beautifully with studio null prickly red a tempranillo and syrah blend campbell s pick is proxies pastiche a gewürztraminer style blend the undertones of lychee peach and pineapple work great with hard stinky cheeses he says cheese boards getty images when it comes to mixed cheese boards what s a host to do you can never go wrong with riesling i d recommend eins zwei zero sparkling wine says barkley how to pair na wine with non cheese appetizers fruit fruits make a great addition to cheese boards or can help balance out heartier meals frounfelkner recommends buzzkill sauvignon blanc or giesen sauvignon blanc with salted grapefruit he d also pair jøyus sparkling white with papaya or mango with chili lime salt seafood sauvage was created to be an alternative to a classic crisp white wine says campbell the herbal notes and zest lend itself to pairing with seafood appetizers such as fresh oysters barkley also suggests lyserød sparkling tea from copenhagen which is a rosé like bubbly that s smooth and dry for another oyster pairing it would work well with other light and refreshing appetizers too like a crudo not into oysters try a campechana a mexican shrimp cocktail with surely rosé or noughty sparkling rosé says frounfelkner olives pair salty olives and mixed nuts with sipclean french colombard white blend salty dips like an olive tapenade pair well with non 1 3 or 5 frounfelkner adds charcuterie prosciutto wrapped cantaloupe a classic italian summer starter calls for a refreshing sparkling wine like prima pavé s blanc de blancs says frounfelkner as for a spread of cured meats non 1 salted raspberry chamomile is a charcuterie board s match made in heaven adds barkley the salinity feels right at home with cured meats the fruity sweetness provides balance and a warm floral finish lingers on the palate pairing tips getty images know your non alcoholic whites from your reds frounfelkner tells customers looking for bottles that the na sparkling wines still whites and rosés that we stock can be paired as you would with an alcoholic wine but that s not quite the case for na reds they have the farthest to go and the most to gain although we re seeing innovation and improvements as time goes on for na still reds he says no matter what grape used or region it s from approach them as if they were a light to medium bodied dry italian red wine that s what most of the current reds on the market are most akin to people have a much more enjoyable pairing going into it with those expectations take inspiration from restaurants you re going to see more na wines on restaurant drink menus restaurants are looking to extend hospitality to and capture revenue from all patrons who may or may not be drinking says campbell plus drinking na wines at a restaurant is a great opportunity to try different options and see how they pair with your meal proxies has collaborated on special blends with sean brock chef and owner of audrey in nashville and sommeliers andré huston mack and miguel de leon they also have their products on the menu at aquavit in new york city and at the french laundry in napa valley campbell says they anticipate further growth in 2023 keep an open mind just like when you re transforming a classic cocktail into a non alcoholic version it s usually not a one for one substitution says frounfelkner you have to build the na classic cocktail with more mindfulness by taste and with an open mind it s important to approach pairing wine and foods in a similar manner don t fear though as barkley says the possibilities are endless

min recession concerns grow on wall street investor concerns that the federal reserve s aggressive rate hiking campaign will push the economy into a recession are growing on wall street the fed all year have been very consistent they have to fight inflation they ve got to get it down and they re going to tighten financial conditions to do so said huw roberts head of analytics at quant insight however he said the u s equity markets are becoming more sensitive to real economic data rather than financial conditions as they head into the next calendar year increasingly the 2023 main story will be about the real economy in other words just how hard a recession we re going to get can the fed engineer a soft landing or will we get a full blown ugly hard recession roberts added sarah min

stanley s mike wilson that rapidly slowing growth isn t priced into the market yet he said in an interview with squawk box thursday people assume earnings are going to come down but it s the magnitude of that decline and how fast it s going to happen we think that is where the surprise is said wilson the firm s u s equity strategist that negative operating leverage that we see from that falling inflation is what is going to hurt margins and that s irrespective of whether there is an economic recession he s predicting 11 decline in year over year growth for s p 500 companies next year while his year end target for the index is 3 900 he anticipates it will drop to between 3 000 and 3 300 in the first quarter the earnings recession will be brought on by a whole host of reasons including an economy that has been overstimulated demand destruction from higher prices and the federal reserve s rate hikes this year wilson said there will also be a reaction from corporations at some point confidence just fails and the corporations stop sending because they re like we ve got to batten down the hatches a little bit he said michelle fox

by adam kovac december 15 2022 a new report from a prominent jewish environmental group urges american jewish institutions to pull billions of dollars worth of investments out of the fossil fuel industry the organization dayenu argues that it s a moral obligation considering the industry s role in climate change but also that clean energy presents a financially smart alternative the report issued thursday analyzed tax filings and financial statements from the top bodies of the four major denominations of judaism in the u s the union for reform judaism united synagogue of conservative judaism orthodox union and reconstructing judaism it also included data from the 20 largest private jewish foundations and 20 largest jewish federations as well as the national federation advising that its calculations were rough and acknowledging that jewish institutional investment alone would do little to help the environment dayenu estimated these organizations investments made up one third of the 100 billion in total u s jewish institutional investment based on that the group estimated total jewish institutional investment in the fossil fuel industry at 3 3 billion forwarding the news thoughtful balanced reporting from the forward and around the web bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day terms required i agree to the forward s terms of service and privacy policy email required when minimal investment information was available for a jewish institution dayenu assumed that fossil fuels make up about 6 of its investments a proportion comparable to a diversified index and on par for institutional investments across the market the report is part of a larger push in recent years from environmental groups which have called on governments companies and nonprofits to divest from fossil fuels their campaigns have met with some success particularly with colleges dayenu did not identify the federations and foundations used in its calculations washington director dahlia rockowitz said the omission was intentional as the goal was not to shame any individual organizations this is not intended to be a calling out moment but a calling in she said these numbers are to help people sort of metabolize what the impact is of the climate crisis and how their financials are tied up in that and how this represents an opportunity for action a powerful gesture in january dayenu called on jewish institutions to divest from the fossil fuels industry at the time chief strategy officer phil aroneanu acknowledged that even if all money invested by jewish institutions were withdrawn from fossil fuels and reinvested in green energy it would not make or break the industry between 2016 and 2020 60 of the world s largest banks invested over 3 trillion into fossil fuel companies still aroneanu said jewish divestment is a powerful symbolic gesture pulling money out of fossil fuels wouldn t only be a moral act said rockowitz on the eve of the report s release but also a financial opportunity with green energy presenting a sound long term investment is pulling money out of fossil fuels risky oil and gas companies would like you to think so rockowitz said but when you actually run the numbers and looking into the longer term it s undeniable that the future is renewable a caution but some financial experts have cast doubt on the efficacy of calls for divestment in fossil fuels jewish communal leader greg neichin who is also managing director of impact investing firm ceniarth said divestment campaigns often oversimplify and are often not the best way to make both a financial and environmental impact neichin who chairs the jewish community federation of san francisco the peninsula marin and sonoma counties impact investing task force used the example of a charity selling their shares of an oil company if somebody sells those shares in exxon mobil those shares are going to be bought on the open market in 30 seconds he said in his view divestment gives foundations a superficial green win they sort of get their gold star for having done something which is really not much and then they feel like they re off the hook in terms of devoting more actual dollars into the problem he said rather neichin said the smart move would be to focus on where an institution s investment money can have the greatest positive impact such as energy efficiency projects in low income communities jewish groups respond jewish institutions were not able to review the document before thursday but when contacted by the forward several said the issue is one that they are aware of and are working to address barbara weinstein an associate director at the union for reform judaism said the report s recommendations are in line with the urj s goals she noted the organization s pension board already offers a jewish values fund which does not include any holdings in coal companies a task force is also examining the divestment issue although there is no timeline for when the findings will be made available what this task force is looking at is how we can use the impact of the funds that we have to make a difference on climate issues that could include divestment but it is not the ultimate conclusion that we are necessarily driving towards she said this is very much a process of learning of understanding and seeing how we can best use the leverage that we have as a movement to make a difference on this issue and i think dayenu s report is a really important part of that whole process a spokesperson for reconstructing judaism declined to comment no one from the united synagogue of conservative judaism was available to comment before press time while a spokesperson for the orthodox union did not respond to efforts to contact them other organizations were more tentative on the report s findings in a statement eric fingerhut president and ceo of jewish federations of north america said the connection between investment and climate is extraordinarily complex and cannot be captured by rough estimates based on broad assumptions as a founding member of the jewish climate leadership coalition we look forward to continuing to work with a wide range of partners to advance this cause he added a spokesperson for the jewish federation of metropolitan chicago said the organization does not invest in any stock of any company directly but did not mention funds that could include fossil fuel based assets however she added the chicago federation is exploring various jewish values based investment models that will include environmental aspects among its considerations

telemedicine must be available in more languages more defining terms have been added for non english speakers to reduce the language barrier in diabetes education the a1c test is recommended for diabetes diagnosis and screening at the point of care prevention or delaying type 2 diabetes and associated comorbidities through regular monitoring of the glucose level subsequent implementation of prevention measures in individuals at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes this approach is known as statin therapy for example pioglitazone could be used to reduce the possibility of myocardial infarction or stroke in people with a history of insulin resistance and prediabetes to support those with diabetes weight loss cardiovascular risk reductions and a reduction in hyperglycemia progression must be considered several changes have been made in immunization particularly concerning coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 and pneumococcal pneumonia vaccinations several age specific recommendations have been added individuals who have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld and diabetes must be encouraged to lose weight and could be subjected to pharmacotherapy glucagonlike

demand is not about to collapse due to a pandemic and no price wars by producers are present at the moment the sell off in recent weeks comes as open interest has fallen to an 8 year low last week we published one of the more bearish articles on the oil price outlook as reviewed by commodity analysts at standard chartered according to the analysts their proprietary crude oil money manager positioning index that compares net longs across the four main new york and london based crude contracts relative to open interest and historical norms is currently more negative than those for all other commodities they track stanchart says that in recent months crude oil has remained close to the bottom of the ranking of metals and energy in terms of implied positive speculative preference while gasoline has been close to the top stanchart s crude oil index currently stood at 70 3 the lowest since mid april 2020 about a week before wti prices settled at a negative price the index had declined by 57 4 over the past three weeks marking the largest three week fall since february 2020 just before the temporary collapse of the opec agreement well sentiment in the oil markets has deteriorated with stanchart now saying their crude oil money manager positioning index has declined further by 2 7 w w to a 31 month low of 73 according to the commodity experts open interest across the four contracts stands at 3 755 million barrels mb the lowest since the first week o 2015 and 2 544mb below may 2018 s record high our crude oil positioning index has fallen for four consecutive weeks related petrobras sheds 41 billion in market value in 2 months oil prices have nearly given up the year s gain though energy stocks remain the best performing class with the sector s popular benchmark the energy select sector spdr etf nysearca xle having rocketed an impressive 50 1 ytd skewed to higher prices thankfully for the bulls stanchart says very little of the latest fall in open interest is due to the active opening of new short positions rather it is primarily due to the closing out of existing longs it does not appear to us that speculators have been adopting a new and far more bearish narrative or specific negative views about oil market fundamentals stanchrart writes in its latest report instead we see the plunge in the index as reflecting the final abandonment of a series of hypotheses that had encouraged speculative longs these range from a tightening of the market due to pent up demand and a lack of spare output capacity through to imminent supply gaps when eu sanctions on russian crude oil became effective in the interim passing through background noise on super cycles predictions of usd 380 per barrel bbl oil and a series of incorrect views about opec policy as such stanchart believes that all this closing out of longs is due primarily to the market now abandoning these views along with traders reducing risky positions before the end of the year for the first time in 2022 no new focal point has emerged to seamlessly continue what has been the dominant rolling crisis narrative leaving crude oil prices prey to more top down macro led concerns and the associated correction in prices stanchart said the experts have revealed that closing out of speculative longs has now moved into oil products mainly driven by weak demand rising inventories and fewer than expected effects from reductions in russian flows stanchart says its money manager positioning index for heating oil fell 25 3 w w to 10 5 that for gasoline fell 25 7 w w to 34 2 while that for gasoil fell 14 8 w w to 24 4 overall the analysts say positioning is now much less distorted than it has been for a while which is a good thing because short term risk reward is now skewed towards higher prices last week stanchart noted that the situation this time around is very different from what it was during the historic oil price collapse of 2020 despite multiple market gauges sending red flags left right and center something that s likely to limit the downside on oil prices for one the analysts note that oil market fundamentals are far more supportive this time than they were in early 2020 demand is not about to collapse due to a pandemic and no price wars by producers are present at the moment the experts say that oil prices are caught in the backwash from top down macro trades with both positive and negative news on the economic front triggering selloffs advertisement according to stanchart negative u s economic data points are triggering an oil price selloff due to recessionary fears however positive data points are ironically having a similar effect due to the strengthening of the u s dollar further sentiment has been buoyed by china s reopening but as timescales dragged many traders have preferred to bet more in the metals markets instead at the same time the new shorts are relatively weak and will soon be covered helping to shore up oil prices by

article the worst may be yet to come for the stock market wall street s mini rebound since mid october has recovered some of the index s sharp losses from the first 10 months of the year it closed monday a shade below 4 000 up more than 10 since its bottom two months earlier many analysts expect stocks to end 2023 at least around this range if not a bit higher after the federal reserve finally stops hiking interest rates in order to get high inflation under control but before getting to that endpoint much of wall street is also forecasting stock prices to fall sharply in the interim related how federal reserve s series of rate hikes could affect your finances consider morgan stanley which says the s p 500 could drop all the way to a range between 3 000 and 3 300 during the first three months of the new year that would mean it loses up to a quarter of its value from monday s closing level the low end of that range would also be 37 5 below the record set in early 2022 the reason for the bank s pessimism is that its strategists forecast much weaker corporate profits than the rest of wall street on the revenue side businesses are feeling the pressure as manufacturing and other areas of the economy are weakening at the same time morgan stanley says profits will get squeezed on the other end by higher wage costs after businesses had to give workers raises corporate profits will likely be coming off record levels from 2022 which helped companies return more cash to investors through dividends and stock buybacks to be sure the strategists led by michael wilson say the s p 500 could end 2023 at 3 900 if things go mostly as they expect not far from its current level strategists at goldman sachs also forecast a trough during the first half of the year possibly at 3 600 that would mark a nearly 10 drop from monday s close and it s based on goldman sachs expectation that the economy can avoid a recession if the economy does contract as many on wall street expect goldman strategists led by david kostin said the s p 500 could fall all the way to 3 100 at deutsche bank strategists see the u s economy falling into a recession in the second half of 2023 that could pull the s p 500 down to 3 250 before it hits bottom about halfway through the recession which the german bank sees lasting the last six months of the year then the s p 500 could end the year as high as 4 500 if stocks follow their typical playbook around recessions say the strategists led by binky chadha related us inflation slowed to 7 1 over past 12 months
twitter founder jack dorsey released his opinion of the twitter files exposing his platform s biased censorship admitting his serious failures around free speech while still claiming a lack of hidden agendas dorsey tweeted his take on the twitter files dec 13 claiming it was based on the principles i ve come to believe due to his experiences founding and leading twitter he began with a list 1 social media must be resilient to corporate and government control 2 only the original author may remove content they produce 3 moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice this seemingly anti censorship list is ironic in light of twitter files revelations that dorsey was part of the top censorship team at twitter and was at least aware of the reasons for banning former president donald trump despite trump not violating any platform rules dorsey did at least admit in a blog post that he had messed up badly the twitter when i led it and the twitter of today do not meet any of these principles dorsey confessed he said that was my fault alone and that he had given up hope of upholding the principles in 2020 when an activist entered our stock then and there he began planning to leave twitter he wrote twitter did have too much power over speech dorsey confessed the biggest mistake i made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation versus building tools for the people using twitter to easily manage it for themselves dorsey then specifically referred to trump s ban saying twitter did the right thing for the public company business at the time but the wrong thing for the internet and society but the former ceo did not admit the full scale of twitter s bias under his watch he denied any ill intent or hidden agendas mrc s censortrack has years of records of twitter s biased censorship people need tools to resist an enforced media or government narrative dorsey said allowing a government or a few corporations to own the public conversation is a path towards centralized control but dorsey did not expound upon twitter s secret coordination with the government to censor americans despite twitter s past heavy censorship dorsey asserted content takedowns and suspensions should not be possible and only authors should be able to erase their own content from the internet he recommended ranking and relevance algorithms on a localized scale with options for users to select instead of a centralized moderation system he also seemingly endorsed a level of antitrust reform and an open protocol for businesses dorsey wrote that he knew people would distrust his recommendations based on his own record and added that he wished he had made twitter uncomfortably transparent in all their actions he then ended the piece by condemning attacks on former twitter colleagues and promoting new technologies for social media only time will tell if the anti free speech trend on social media is reversible conservatives are under attack contact twitter at 415 222 9670 and demand that big tech be held to account to mirror the first amendment if you have been censored contact us at the media research center contact form and help us hold big tech accountable

by nouriel roubini december 15 2022 information clearing house the world economy is lurching towards an unprecedented confluence of economic financial and debt crises following the explosion of deficits borrowing and leverage in recent decades in the private sector the mountain of debt includes that of households such as mortgages credit cards auto loans student loans personal loans businesses and corporations bank loans bond debt and private debt and the financial sector liabilities of bank and non bank institutions in the public sector it includes central provincial and local government bonds and other formal liabilities as well as implicit debts such as unfunded liabilities from pay as you go pension schemes and healthcare systems all of which will continue to grow as societies age just looking at explicit debts the figures are staggering globally total private and public sector debt as a share of gdp rose from 200 per cent in 1999 to 350 per cent in 2021 the ratio is now 420 per cent across advanced economies and 330 per cent in china in the united states it is 420 per cent which is higher than during the great depression and after world war ii of course debt can boost economic activity if borrowers invest in new capital machinery homes public infrastructure that yields returns higher than the cost of borrowing but much borrowing goes simply to finance consumption spending above one s income on a persistent basis and that is a recipe for bankruptcy moreover investments in capital can also be risky whether the borrower is a household buying a home at an artificially inflated price a corporation seeking to expand too quickly regardless of returns or a government that is spending the money on white elephants that is extravagant but useless infrastructure projects over borrowing such over borrowing has been going on for decades for various reasons the democratisation of finance has allowed income strapped households to finance consumption with debt centre right governments have persistently cut taxes without also cutting spending while centre left governments have spent generously on social programmes that aren t fully funded with sufficient higher taxes and tax policies that favour debt over equity abetted by central banks ultra loose monetary and credit policies have fuelled a spike in borrowing in both the private and public sectors years of quantitative easing and credit easing kept borrowing costs near zero and in some cases even negative as in europe and japan until recently by 2020 negative yielding dollar equivalent public debt was us 17 trillion and in some nordic countries even mortgages had negative nominal interest rates the explosion of unsustainable debt ratios implied that many borrowers households corporations banks shadow banks governments and even entire countries were insolvent zombies that were being propped up by low interest rates which kept their debt servicing costs manageable during both the 2008 global financial crisis and the covid 19 crisis many insolvent agents that would have gone bankrupt were rescued by zero or negative interest rate policies quantitative easing and outright fiscal bailouts but now inflation fed by the same ultra loose fiscal monetary and credit policies has ended this financial dawn of the dead with central banks forced to increase interest rates in an effort to restore price stability zombies are experiencing sharp increases in their debt servicing costs for many this represents a triple whammy because inflation is also eroding real household income and reducing the value of household assets such as homes and stocks the same goes for fragile and over leveraged corporations financial institutions and governments they face sharply rising borrowing costs falling incomes and revenues and declining asset values all at the same time worse these developments are coinciding with the return of stagflation high inflation alongside weak growth the last time advanced economies experienced such conditions was in the 1970s but at least back then debt ratios were very low today we are facing the worst aspects of the 1970s stagflationary shocks alongside the worst aspects of the global financial crisis and this time we cannot simply cut interest rates to stimulate demand after all the global economy is being battered by persistent short and medium term negative supply shocks that are reducing growth and increasing prices and production costs these include the pandemic s disruptions to the supply of labour and goods the impact of russia s war in ukraine on commodity prices china s increasingly disastrous zero covid policy and a dozen other medium term shocks from climate change to geopolitical developments that will create additional stagflationary pressures unlike in the 2008 financial crisis and the early months of covid 19 simply bailing out private and public agents with loose macro policies would pour more gasolene on the inflationary fire that means there will be a hard landing a deep protracted recession on top of a severe financial crisis as asset bubbles burst debt servicing ratios spike and inflation adjusted incomes fall across households corporations and governments the economic crisis and the financial crash will feed on each other least resistance to be sure advanced economies that borrow in their own currency can use a bout of unexpected inflation to reduce the real value of some nominal long term fixed rate debt with governments unwilling to raise taxes or cut spending to reduce their deficits central bank deficit monetisation will once again be seen as the path of least resistance but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle which is what will happen when central banks abandon the fight in the face of the looming economic and financial crash nominal and real borrowing costs will surge the mother of all stagflationary debt crises can be postponed not avoided nouriel roubini professor emeritus of economics at new york university s stern school of business is the author of megathreats ten dangerous
