billionaire magnate elon musk has made a fortune from tech but he s never run a company like twitter this week it showed experts said musk the ceo of tesla and spacex spoke for the first time thursday about his 40 billion bid to take control of the social media company and he gave few specific details of any plans he might have despite being full of his usual swagger on topics such as electric cars and rocket science at the ted2022 conference musk spoke in general terms about allowing more content to go unmoderated on the platform in the name of free speech a change that could allow more hate speech and harassment to flourish and didn t address core business concerns such as user growth or advertising revenue experts warned that musk s vision for the platform should he successfully acquire the company could lead to major hurdles down the road how musk might lead twitter musk s lack of experience in the worlds of advertising and social media stuck out to some analysts he doesn t seem to have a sophisticated notion of what it means to engage in a global media business said siva vaidhyanathan author of a book about facebook and the director of the center for media and citizenship at the university of virginia he s never been in this business he s been in a scattershot of businesses that have nothing to do with media or communication vaidhyanathan said musk has built a loyal fan base on twitter his account is one of the most watched with 82 million followers just behind singer lady gaga and just ahead of narendra modi the prime minister of india but that doesn t mean he knows much about drumming up ad dollars or attracting new people to twitter and that lack of experience could be a headwind for him as he tries to persuade twitter s shareholders and directors to accept his bid neither tesla nor spacex nor musk s earlier enterprises such as paypal has significant money making operations in ad sales tesla doesn t even spend much on advertising i think if elon takes over twitter he is in for a world of pain he has no idea yishan wong a former ceo of reddit said in a series of tweets friday he said musk 50 may be influenced by the internet culture of an earlier era when fewer people were online and tech company ceos weren t being asked to referee major political debates or make world shifting content moderation decisions like whether or not to ban a sitting president from the platform musk could scare advertisers on friday musk s takeover chances grew slimmer when twitter s board unanimously adopted a poison pill defense allowing shareholders to buy more stock at a discount which could force musk to pay an even higher price to take over the company still a pathway to purchasing twitter is open to musk if he can afford it and he has expressed serious interest at the conference thursday musk said he would err on the side of leaving up some of the content that twitter now takes down because it says the content violates its terms of service if it s a gray area i would say let the tweet exist he said but that s not necessarily how big corporate advertisers think and they have been a not so secret force in recent years pushing social media apps to clean up the content generated by users in 2020 more than 200 companies participated in a boycott of facebook pausing their ad spending and citing concerns about hate speech and misinformation no advertisers want to have their message in the same timeline as anti semitism or violence again women that s just bad business vaidhyanathan said so now the advertising industry is wary of musk s proposal to loosen speech rules on twitter according to mike zaneis co founder of the brand safety institute a nonprofit organization of digital advertisers concerned about objectionable material online this topic certainly has been top of mind for marketers over the past few days said zaneis nobody wants to go back to the wild wild west he said referring to a time when forums and social media platforms had little to no content moderation it was painful it was harmful to brands it was harmful to citizens we ve made incredible strides and i think a reversal would be unfortunate musk seems well aware of that influence and has criticized it the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if twitter depends on advertising money to survive musk said this month in a tweet that was later deleted how to encourage free expression some experts panned musk s ideas as unrealistic for reasons unrelated to advertising including that unchecked online harassment and bullying might drive away users and end up harming free expression the idea that rewriting the rules would free up this suppressed speech that s essentially a fantasy said suzanne nossel a member of the oversight board created by facebook to oversee speech rules on its services the inevitability is that the boundary less platform where there are no limitations would quickly sink down under the weight of spam harassment disinformation and falsehoods said nossel also the ceo of the free speech organization pen america social networks founded recently on the idea of looser speech rules such as parler and truth social have inevitably written their own community guidelines and developed ways to take down at least some content it may simply be that when networks grow past a certain size they become unmanageable renée diresta the technical research manager at the stanford internet observatory wrote in the atlantic there are also daunting regulatory and legal challenges around free speech online especially outside the united states where public expectations of what s allowed aren t shaped as much by the first amendment to the u s constitution the european union for example is poised to enact a new law called the digital services act which would require tech companies to catch certain content deemed problematic in real time and may lead to more filtering of speech not less at least in the e u you re going to have to put in place systems that control the amplification of illegal speech and then you re going to have independent audits and the regulators are going to be watching said karen kornbluh a senior fellow at the german marshall fund a nonprofit organization that supports stronger ties between the u s and europe speech rules are even more onerous in countries such as pakistan and turkey while musk said he would intend for twitter s rules to hew closely to the law kornbluh said he may not have a full understanding of the complexities of that project his comments are a little bit naïve of the changing regulatory system kornbluh said

twitter is trying to thwart billionaire elon musk s takeover attempt with a poison pill a financial device that companies have been wielding against unwelcome suitors for decades what are poison pills supposed to do the ingredients of each poison pill vary but they re all designed to give corporate boards an option to flood the market with so much newly created stock that a takeover becomes prohibitively expensive the strategy was popularized back in the 1980s when publicly held companies were being stalked by corporate raiders such as carl icahn now more frequently described as activist investors twitter didn t disclose the details of its poison pill friday but said it would provide more information in a forthcoming filing with the securities and exchange commission which the company delayed because public markets were closed friday the san francisco company s plan will be triggered if a shareholder accumulates a stake of 15 or more musk best known as ceo of electric car maker tesla currently holds a roughly 9 stake can a poison pill be a negotiating ploy although they are supposed to help prevent an unsolicited takeover poison pills also often open the door to further negotiations that can force a bidder to sweeten the deal if a higher price makes sense to the board a poison pill can simply be cast aside along with the acrimony it provoked clearing the way for a sale to completed true to form twitter left its door open by emphasizing that its poison pill won t prevent its board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal at a higher price adopting a poison pill also frequently results in lawsuits alleging that a corporate board and management team is using the tactic to keep their jobs against the best interests of shareholders these complaints are sometimes filed by shareholders who think a takeover offer is fair and want to cash out at that price or by the bidder vying to make the purchase how did elon musk react to twitter s announcement musk a prolific tweeter with 82 million followers on twitter had no immediate reaction to the company s poison pill but on thursday he indicated he was ready to wage a legal battle if the current twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty musk tweeted the liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale musk has publicly said that its 43 billion bid is his best and final offer for twitter but other corporate suitors have made similar statements before ultimately upping the ante with an estimated fortune of 265 billion musk would seem to have deep enough pockets to raise his offer although he is still working out how to finance the proposed purchase how has this defense worked in the past takeover tussles often dissolve into gamesmanship that include poison pills and other maneuvers designed to make a buyout more difficult that s what happened in one of the biggest and most drawn out takeover dances in silicon valley history after business software maker oracle made an unsolicited 5 1 billion offer for its smaller rival peoplesoft in june 2003 the two companies spent the next 18 months fighting with each other as part of its defense peoplesoft not only adopted a poison pill that authorized the board to flood the market with more shares it also created what it called a customer assurance program that plan promised to pay customers five times the cost of their software licenses if peoplesoft was sold within the next two years creating an estimated liability of up to 800 million for an acquiring company peoplesoft also got another helping hand when the u s department of justice filed an antitrust lawsuit seek to block a takeover although a judge ruled in oracle s favor even though the company ended up selling to oracle peoplesoft s defense strategy paid off for its shareholders oracle s final purchase price was 11 1 billion more than twice its original bid

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story providence r i twitter said friday that its board of directors has unanimously adopted a poison pill defense in response to tesla ceo elon musk s proposal to buy the company for more than 43 billion and take it private the move would allow existing twitter shareholders except for musk to buy additional shares at a discount thereby diluting musk s stake in the company and making it harder for him to corral a majority of shareholder votes in favor of the acquisition twitter s plan would take effect if musk s roughly 9 stake grows to 15 or more the poison pill injects another twist into a melodrama surrounding the possibility of the world s richest person taking over a social media platform he described thursday as the world s de facto town square twitter said its plan would reduce the likelihood that any one person can gain control of the company without either paying shareholders a premium or giving the board more time to evaluate an offer such defenses formally called shareholder rights plans are used to prevent the hostile takeover of a corporation by making any acquisition prohibitively expensive for the bidder even if it discourages his takeover attempt musk could still take over the company by waging a proxy fight in which shareholders vote to retain or dismiss the company s current directors twitter said its plan doesn t prevent the board from negotiating or accepting an acquisition proposal if it s in the company s best interests they re gearing up for a battle here with musk said daniel ives an analyst for wedbush securities they also have to give themselves time to try to find another potential buyer musk has offered to buy the company outright for more than 43 billion saying it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with its users and do better at serving what he calls the societal imperative of free speech having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization he said during an onstage interview at a ted event thursday just hours after his bid was announced with about 82 million twitter followers musk is both a prolific user of the platform and a vocal critic of the measures it has taken to restrict accounts that spread misinformation or amplify violent rhetoric and hate speech he said thursday he s opposed to permanent user bans the most famous of which is twitter s suspension of former president donald trump s account after the jan 6 capitol riot musk revealed in recent regulatory filings that he d been buying twitter shares in almost daily batches starting jan 31 ending up with a stake of about 9 only vanguard group controls more twitter shares a lawsuit filed tuesday in new york federal court alleged that musk illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices after musk announced his stake twitter quickly offered him a seat on its board on the condition that he would limit his purchases to no more than 14 9 of the company s outstanding stock but the company said five days later that musk had declined ives said twitter s poison pill path is a predictable defensive maneuver but could be seen as a sign of weakness for the company on wall street musk could try to fight the measure in court but no court has overturned a poison pill in the last 30 years said columbia university law professor john coffee rallying shareholders to kick out the board might be more doable but also presents challenges to musk coffee said musk s offer already faced resistance before twitter threw its friday counterpunch a saudi prince who is among twitter s major shareholders scoffed at musk s offer in a thursday tweet al waleed bin talal said he would reject musk s overtures because he didn t believe 43 billion comes close to the intrinsic value of twitter given its growth prospects the prince punctuated the tweet with another one from 2015 disclosing his kingdom company had raised its stake in twitter to 5 2 about half of what musk now holds while musk s 54 20 per share offer is nearly 40 greater than twitter s stock price before he disclosed his huge investment it s still far below the peak closing price of 77 63 reached less than 14 months ago at that time twitter was valued at about 62 billion musk responded to the prince with a tweet asking how many twitter shares he holds and then made what may have been a veiled reference to the 2018 murder of journalist jamal khashoggi that was tied to saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech musk asked in a thursday tweet in a sign that investors are skeptical about musk s offer twitter s stock fell in the first day of trading after the takeover bid was announced thursday exactly the opposite of what an approving market reaction looks like the stock markets were closed friday for the good friday holiday twitter said it plans to disclose more details of its shareholder plan in an upcoming regulatory filing another outspoken billionaire dallas mavericks owner and tech investor mark cuban weighed in on twitter to share his theory that musk is making his bid to goose the company s stock price so he can sell his stake at a profit using a profane term cuban also postulated musk is using the bid to torment the u s securities and exchange commission the stock market regulatory agency that fined musk 20 million in 2018 after he tweeted about a potential buyout of tesla that never materialized in thursday s ted event musk made it clear he is still incensed with the sec and cursed the regulators with a profanity contributing michael liedtke

twitter s board of directors on friday voted unanimously to use a tactic called a poison pill to fend off elon musk s attempt to take over the company in such a defensive tactic all twitter shareholders except musk could buy more shares at a discount this would dilute the world s richest person s stake in the company and prevent him from recruiting a majority of shareholders supporting his move if musk s ownership in twitter grows to 15 or more the poison pill would go into effect musk who earlier this week was revealed as the company s largest individual shareholder with 9 2 of the shares later offered more than 43 billion or 54 20 a share to purchase the entire company musk s offer would provide a substantial premium over twitter s current stock price of just more than 45 a share free speech concern expressed when musk made his offer he lamented the company s stance on free speech i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the filing i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form but instead of putting musk s offer up for a vote with twitter shareholders the company s board said friday that it would instead offer its shareholders a chance to buy even more shares at a steep discount effectively diluting the price of the stock the plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity gains control of twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium the company said the twitter board s plan will be effective for one year as rumors of a poison pill action circulated thursday musk speculated via twitter on what might happen if the current twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty he wrote the liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale one analyst dan ives of wedbush securities told the new york post that the board s move was a defensive measure adding that shareholders would not likely view it positively we believe musk and his team expected this poker move which will be perceived as a sign of weakness not strength by the street ives told the post josh white a former financial economist for the securities and exchange commission told bbc that musk s negotiation tactics might not be the right approach if musk wants to acquire the company i actually think if he was truly serious about the takeover attempt he would have started at a price and left the window open for negotiation white said twitter storm edward rock who teaches corporate law and governance at new york university s law school also had doubts about whether musk was serious about buying twitter as rock told npr musk can show he is serious by revealing how he plans to finance the takeover which he did not show in his sec filing or launch a proxy contest to replace twitter board members in response to its poison pill if musk fails to do so rock said he s not going to acquire the company and people can just write it off like some of his other twitter storms some information for this report came from the associated press

comment twitter on friday said its board of directors had unanimously approved a plan to prevent a hostile takeover something that became a distinct possibility after billionaire elon musk offered 43 billion to buy the social media network the poison pill or rights plan the biz said will reduce the likelihood that any entity person or group gains control of twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders the rights plan would require musk to negotiate directly with the board to increase his share of the company beyond 15 percent after that every existing shareholder with the exception of musk would be able to buy twitter stock at a discounted rate it adds an obstacle to a musk takeover but doesn t preclude it in fact musk is reportedly talking to potential financial partners who could help him consummate the deal musk ceo of tesla and spacex a self described free speech absolutist who once falsely labeled a british cave explorer a pedo guy on twitter and then defeated the ensuing defamation claim last month began buying up shares of twitter previously he has suggested that somehow twitter through its content moderation is limiting free speech that s just wrong apart from the terms of the sec settlement musk signed that limit his freedom to post misleading tweets but that s another story the first amendment of the us constitution prevents the government from setting speech rules it does not constrain how private sector entities should treat lawful speech content moderation is necessary for social media platforms to function setting aside musk s crowd baiting pronouncements about freedom and speech his quiet share purchases have spoken louder than tweeted provocations and have alarmed twitter employees not sold on musk s managerial benevolence after revealing on april 4 2022 that he d acquired 9 2 percent of twitter s shares he was offered a seat on the company board then declined it perhaps because bad mouthing twitter and serving on its board presented a conflict of interest and was subsequently sued by twitter shareholders for delaying disclosure of its share purchases to hear musk tell it he wants to make some changes such as deploying an edit button a crowd pleaser and something twitter maintains it has been working on and open sourcing the algorithm that surfaces tweets something relevant mainly for those who choose twitter s algorithmically ranked home view of tweets rather than the chronologically ranked latest view a top priority i would have would be eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on twitter he said during a ted conference interview on thursday he did not mention whether he would banish 60 percent of his own twitter followers suspected to be fake or take action against the army of tesla boosting bots that reportedly have helped lift the automaker s stock then again everything changes musk s musings about what might be come with no guarantees during the tesla boss s ted appearance moderator chris anderson said last week when we spoke elon i asked you whether you were thinking of taking over you said no way i do not want to own twitter it is a recipe for misery everyone will blame me for everything musk without directly addressing that he had disavowed interest in twitter said he knows the process will be painful and he still wants to buy the company it s important to the function of democracy musk said it s important to the function of the united states as a free country and many other countries and to help freedom in the world i think civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of twitter as a public platform i do think this will be somewhat painful and i m not sure i will actually be able to acquire it civilizational risk is hard to measure and it s not clear how twitter content moderation compares to the ai apocalypse a longstanding concern for musk or the covid 19 pandemic which has actually led to almost one million deaths in the us keep in mind that this is the man who on march 6 2020 tweeted the coronavirus panic is dumb and has published numerous other tweets arguing against public health mandates that attempt to mitigate if not civilizational risk then national corporate and individual risk and speaking of painfulness earlier former reddit ceo yishan wong believes musk will be in a world of pain if he buys twitter as the spacex supremo has no experience in handling a large scale internet platform anderson later asked musk how he amassed so many followers on twitter even excluding the bots the number of people following him is a lot i m tweeting more or less stream of consciousness musk answered it s not like let me think about some grand plan about my twitter or whatever i m like literally on the toilet or something i m like oh this is funny and then tweet that out you know what would be funny twitter banning musk just for giggles
source bigstock the only good news after the massacres in ukraine is that so many ugly behemoth superyachts have been seized and will not be polluting the seas this summer there is no more horrible sight than an oligarch s superyacht on the horizon and that is before it disgorges its passengers which is a horror show in itself arab boats are even worse as are the hookers on board the other good news is that elon musk has become the largest stakeholder of twitter and in a trojan war replication has challenged putin to a duel oh what a wonderful world this would be if those who started wars would duke it out with their opponents rather than sending lots of youngsters to do the fighting for them but don t hold your breath the last time it was done achilles challenged and killed hector then dragged him from his chariot three times around the walls of troy agamemnon has been on my mind lately after having read what a man named paul krugman wrote in the bagel times paul not agamemnon wrote that putin has surrounded himself with people who tell him what he wants to hear really this is an exclusive worthy of walter duranty s one in the ny times that informed us that there was no man made famine in ukraine back in the 1930s only a few million died strongmen have been surrounding themselves with yes men since well agamemnon s time and that is why the greek leader has been on my mind he brought back cassandra with him after the sack of troy and didn t bother to even ask her a question or two for any of you who have not been reading professor peter jones cassandra was king priam s prettiest daughter in fact some said she was more beautiful than the abducted and seduced but not abandoned greek who caused the ten year war to begin with and she possessed prophetic gifts being an ancient greek i have always consulted with cassandra and this is why i ve survived all these years agamemnon should have debriefed his captive before returning but if the trojans hadn t listened to cassandra s warning about the wooden horse why would the victor of the war have done so boy could the young and beautiful trojan have told the greek leader a thing or two about his future let s face it unlike with our boris who yet again lucked out when putingate turned partygate into nothingate agamemnon s homecoming party was a total bust his wife clytemnestra s lover aegisthus murdered him aegisthus was in turn killed by agamemnon s son orestes and although my direct ancestor homer does not say if orestes then murdered his mother he implies it see what i mean when i say agamemnon should have posed a few questions to cassandra but i m getting carried away here all this started with that fool paul krugman announcing the obvious all strongmen listen to yes men and jail those who disagree with them but why am i surprised paul the fool has in the past predicted that the stock market would hit zero because of trump s election and the thing went through the roof he has yet to comment on the duel between vlad and elon thank god who will emerge victorious if it takes place it s gonna be vlad because of judo and wrestling with tigers and all that whereas elon just wrestles with girls like amber heard elon you should call me i know some dirty tricks that you don t but i won t be hanging around my phone waiting as you ve already gone hollywood on me if putin had a cassandra around before he invaded would he have listened to her strongmen don t usually change their minds because they believe in their own propaganda in putin s case it was a belief in his army s prowess and the eagerness of ukrainians to submit to russian rule in the good old us of a foreign policy aides to biden spent their trump years consulting firms funded by defense department contractors this is in itself unethical because it puts them in the pocket of the military industrial complex a monster that can only be fed by war these are the people who laud america s wars in afghanistan iraq and libya and are the ones now itching to get into a fight with vlad they are also advising zelensky on how to browbeat the west into getting involved being an ancient greek i have always consulted with cassandra and this is why i ve survived all these years if anyone bothered to ask me about ukraine before the fighting started i d have advised zelensky to cool it as far as nato is concerned nato is a red flag to the russkies and rightly so then i would have told putin to take up elon musk s challenge and name the date and neutral place but stay away from ukraine or at least just grab donbas and call it a day but does anyone ask for advice from taki nowadays i d be lucky if the russians ask me because they believe in history the americans will not because they are trying to erase their story one that saw ben franklin perform a miracle in paris and get the frogs involved in america s war of independence from you know who without the french support in money and ships great americans like washington jefferson and of course franklin men born englishmen would not have died as americans but as englishmen you figure it out

ranchers often consider themselves caretakers of their land and it s that kind of thinking that s motivating them to sign up for an innovative new approach called rangeland carbon offsetting that s when ranchers agree not to till their soils so that carbon is captured there into perpetuity keeping it out of the atmosphere where it could contribute to climate change wyoming public radio s melodie edwards sat down with birch malotky who recently reported on the issue for the university of wyoming ruckelshaus institute s magazine western confluence she told us about the may family who got involved with the program birch malotky the may family is a family of ranchers in southeastern colorado and prowers county a multigenerational ranch family who have been working the land for decades and like many ranchers they were facing issues with unexpected weather patterns issues with the low and variable price of beef and really high infrastructure and land costs and as ranchers who own their own land they have to pay their mortgage they have to pay all their infrastructure costs and they re really subject to sort of a lot of market volatility for the cost of their product and then weather volatility and so they ve had to downsize their herd three times in the past couple of decades mostly because of drought and then had to build back up and it really becomes a financial hardship and then also just hurts the integrity of the herd as well melodie edwards one person in the article ends up saying that ranchers are the last stronghold and i just wonder if you might delve into that statement and kind of talk about what it is and how it is that ranchers are protecting the grasslands and you know why it s so important to protect the grasslands bm grasslands are one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world and in the united states they re one of the least protected in the northern great plains region almost 90 percent of intact grasslands are privately owned which means that it s not up to the federal government or state parks or anyone it s up to the private landowners to manage them in a way that s good for grassland species and they re important because obviously they re a unique ecosystem they also provide water filtration and storage they provide carbon sequestration because they re mostly privately owned it s really important that we work with private landowners to ensure that they remain grassland and so in a lot of cases those are ranchers because they re able to graze on the grassland while keeping the ecosystem relatively intact me it sounds like something called the rangeland carbon offsets has been developing and so i wonder if you can kind of explain what those are and how that can help ranchers who are in the situation like the mays bm yeah it s this really cool potential win win win where ranchers are having a tough time grasslands are under threat and obviously we re facing major issues with climate change and so what rangeland carbon credits are is ranchers are paid to ensure that the grassland under their care is never plowed to make way for row crop agriculture and so that means permanent conservation of the grassland that s payments for up to 50 years to the ranchers and then that means that carbon stays in the ground forever me i wonder if you can talk just a little bit about how the may family found out about this opportunity how they got involved and how it s helping them bm yeah so the mays actually kind of helped pioneer this so last time i checked there are less than a dozen of these grassland projects in existence and that the mays were the second ever the mays had historically been renting their land and when they got the option to purchase their land dallas may who s the head of the ranch right now his first thought was how can we protect this land forever and so he reached out to a lot of conservation organizations and initially was just talking just about easements but then billy gascoigne who works for ducks unlimited sort of floated this idea of adding a carbon credit project to an easement and so everyone worked together they sort of developed a brand new protocol for how this project would work and now it s great so the 20 000 acre may farm and ranch is protected forever from development and the mays receive a yearly payment for their carbon you know one of the interesting things is dallas said to me we re not in it for the money the money helps obviously but it s all about keeping this land protected keeping it native prairie the way god planted it he said so that s kind of the situation in the current financial market but the other thing i should note is that we re seeing the price of carbon rapidly increasing and so even the sort of total value of carbon offset exchanges for 2021 was a 60 percent increase over 2020 and so there may not be a huge financial incentive now but there may be a greater financial incentive in the very near future me so we ve kind of looked at it from the point of view of the rancher but i wonder if you can talk about why corporations and organizations and people are interested in doing these offsets what are their motives for doing it bm right so i mean the latest ipcc report came out and it s basically like things are super super dire and everyone wants to feel like they can do something and then also there s increasingly pressure on companies to become greener to become more sustainable to become more climate friendly and so it s a range it can be individuals it can be organizations it can be corporations who either make a carbon neutral or carbon zero commitment or who they flew and they want to offset their travel that s what might lead someone to offsets in general i think what people really like about this particular type of offset which is nature based solutions is that they can offer these co benefits like protecting important ecosystems and biodiversity and providing support to local communities me if there was a rancher out there listening how would they go about even finding out more about whether they would qualify and just participating in this kind of a program bm yeah so i think a great way to start is working with local land trusts because you re going to need an easement eventually to complete a project and your local land trust is going to have the resources or they re going to be able to connect you with a project developer who specializes in this and that project developer is going to be able to look at your land and the county level information and your soil stuff and they re going to be able to tell you if you re eligible and what sort of return you might be looking at and so i would say starting with your local land trust to start the conversations reach out and find who else to talk to about it

twitter is trying to thwart billionaire elon musk s takeover attempt with a poison pill a financial device that companies have been wielding against unwelcome suitors for decades what are poison pills supposed to do the ingredients of each poison pill vary but they re all designed to give corporate boards an option to flood the market with so much newly created stock that a takeover becomes prohibitively expensive the strategy was popularized back in the 1980s when publicly held companies were being stalked by corporate raiders such as carl icahn now more frequently described as activist investors twitter didn t disclose the details of its poison pill friday but said it would provide more information in a forthcoming filing with the securities and exchange commission which the company delayed because public markets were closed friday the san francisco company s plan will be triggered if a shareholder accumulates a stake of 15 or more musk best known as ceo of tesla currently holds a roughly 9 stake can a poison pill be a negotiating ploy although they are supposed to help prevent an unsolicited takeover poison pills also often open the door to further negotiations that can force a bidder to sweeten the deal if a higher price makes sense to the board a poison pill can simply be cast aside along with the acrimony it provoked clearing the way for a sale to completed true to form twitter left its door open by emphasizing that its poison pill won t prevent its board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal at a higher price adopting a poison pill also frequently results in lawsuits alleging that a corporate board and management team is using the tactic to keep their jobs against the best interests of shareholders these complaints are sometimes filed by shareholders who think a takeover offer is fair and want to cash out at that price or by the bidder vying to make the purchase how did elon musk react to twitter s announcement musk a prolific tweeter with 82 million followers on twitter had no immediate reaction to the company s poison pill but on thursday he indicated he was ready to wage a legal battle if the current twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty musk tweeted the liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale musk has publicly said that its 43 billion bid is his best and final offer for twitter but other corporate suitors have made similar statements before ultimately upping the ante with an estimated fortune of 265 billion musk would seem to have deep enough pockets to raise his offer although he is still working out how to finance the proposed purchase how has this defense worked in the past takeover tussles often dissolve into gamesmanship that include poison pills and other maneuvers designed to make a buyout more difficult that s what happened in one of the biggest and most drawn out takeover dances in silicon valley history after business software maker oracle made an unsolicited 5 1 billion offer for its smaller rival peoplesoft in june 2003 the two companies spent the next 18 months fighting with each other as part of its defense peoplesoft not only adopted a poison pill that authorized the board to flood the market with more shares it also created what it called a customer assurance program that plan promised to pay customers five times the cost of their software licenses if peoplesoft was sold within the next two years creating an estimated liability of up to 800 million for an acquiring company peoplesoft also got another helping hand when the u s department of justice filed an antitrust lawsuit seek to block a takeover although a judge ruled in oracle s favor even though the company ended up selling to oracle peoplesoft s defense strategy paid off for its shareholders oracle s final purchase price was 11 1 billion more than twice its original bid
fort collins is going after some big goals for 2030 and 2040 and it will take an equally large magnitude of funding to achieve them fort collins city council took a high level look at the funding needs during its tuesday evening work session the first of several planned conversations about the city s sustainable funding plan staff estimate the city needs to find additional revenue sources of 30 million to 39 million annually to fund four key areas parks and recreation infrastructure replacement affordable housing public transit and climate action to put that annual funding need into context fort collins revenue from all sources was 647 5 million in 2021 the annual funding need represents about 4 5 to 6 of the 2021 revenue these conversations could culminate in a proposal for new taxes or fees though it s too early to say what any such proposal might look like if city leaders do decide on a ballot measure it likely wouldn t land on the ballot until at least april 2023 some council members suggested it could take until 2025 staff broke down the funding shortfalls in each of the four areas parks recreation face 12 million annual shortfall for major repairs maintenance the city s parks and recreation departments need about 12 million annually to cover a growing shortfall in asset management as well as a 1 million projected shortfall in annual operations and maintenance expenses asset management is the more significant issue here the city has consistent voter approved revenue streams to build new parks and recreation facilities but doesn t have enough funding for major repairs and replacements as those facilities age impact fees fund new park construction but the city can legally use those funds only for creation of new parks not maintenance or infrastructure replacement at existing parks similarly voter approved capital improvement funds can only be used to build new recreation facilities as outlined in the relevant ballot measure fort collins operations and maintenance budget covers run of the mill repairs but can t foot the bill for things like resurfacing tennis courts replacing the aging hvac system at the mulberry pool or upgrading rolland moore park s 38 year old playground previously fort collins is falling behind on maintaining aging parks transfort faces escalating shortage to fund service expansion transfort faces a shortage of about 7 7 million annually over the next 20 years then almost 10 million annually in the years following that these funds would cover the cost of major planned capital projects and service expansions including three or four new bus rapid transit routes on elizabeth street north college avenue harmony road and maybe a fourth location doubling transfort s service hours significantly increasing high frequency routes and creating an all electric fleet fort collins transit master plan details many of these goals which are part of a vision to make public transit quick and easy to use with little planning transfort director drew brooks has said his vision for public transit is that residents won t even have to look at a bus schedule they ll just be able to head to the bus stop and know a bus is coming in a matter of minutes these goals intersect with fort collins our climate future plan which looks to public transit as one way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles the city gets much of its public transit funding from the federal government which typically matches about 50 of local funds staff are hopeful the matching ratio could increase in the future more new max routes might be coming to fort collins sooner than you think fort collins seeks funding to facilitate affordable housing construction fort collins affordable housing goal is to make 10 of the city s housing stock affordable by 2040 currently about 5 of the housing stock is affordable meaning income restricted to get there the city needs to facilitate the development of 282 new affordable units each year the necessary funding to meet those annual production goals is 8 5 million to 10 million in addition to current funding of 1 5 million to 3 million the city is also 700 units behind its goals for 2015 2020 and it will cost an estimated 27 million to catch up in other words fort collins needs to increase its funding for affordable housing by a factor of at least three to five times its current spending fort collins doesn t build affordable housing itself but the city offers a leg up for affordable projects the additional funding would expand those aids and incentives more purchases for the city s land bank a mechanism where the city buys land and sells it to affordable developers at a discount more support for developers to preserve existing affordable units extended restrictions on affordability which typically last for a few decades and expanded eligibility for fee credits among other strategies addressing affordability colorado state northern colorado get creative to help employees afford rising home prices our climate future plan faces 6 million annual shortfall for climate action staff estimate an annual shortfall of more than 6 million that s the estimated cost of pursuing the goals in the city s our climate future plan the plan encompasses goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 of 2005 levels by 2030 becoming carbon neutral by 2050 sending no waste to landfills by 2030 and achieving 100 renewable electricity by 2030 among other goals fort collins has made significant progress on its climate goals reducing emissions by 24 as of 2021 reaching a balance of more than 50 renewable energy last year and diverting about 52 of waste from landfills in 2020 but the 2030 goals are a big jump and with much of the lower hanging fruit picked off continued progress will require more investment the 6 million plus annual estimate includes 3 5 million to help electrify gas heated homes 2 6 million to expand ev charging stations and investments in universal composting climate equity partnerships residential energy efficiency efforts and more more fort collins got mixed results on 2020 climate goals what does that mean for 2030 goals the immediate next steps for the city involve progressing to all renewable energy rolling out universal composting and expanding local and regional transit networks the next big challenge will be electrification of cars home heat and water heaters staff said it s not clear at this point if council will decide to prioritize the various needs or look for ways to fund all of them mayor pro tem emily francis said she thinks potential taxes or fees should be part of the conversation but we d be hard pressed to ask residents to pay 20 million to 39 million a year to cover everything we need there are tradeoffs she added but i think we also need to think about how we are approaching building and what the appropriate level of service is in fort collins do all parks need giant playgrounds and tons of grass and field i just think that we continue to build these things and then we can t pay for them and we re digging ourselves into a hole she added that she thinks council should look at affordable housing as essential infrastructure rather than only a council priority since we need housing for people to be able to live and work and play here council member kelly ohlson noted that there are a lot of moving parts in the discussion given the shifting landscape of existing city taxes and fees some of which expire in the next few years he said the council finance committee will need to start drilling down on how much of each category the city wants to fund i think that s where it s going to get challenging not because we don t have agreement on the issues he said it s a question of how much does each get and how do we fund them several council members and staff said 2025 could be a more realistic timeline for a potential ballot measure in addition to the legwork of coming up with a proposal the city will also need time to convince voters to approve it mayor jeni arndt said she d be comfortable with proposing a tax or fee increase because the city s tax load for residents is low relative to some other communities including boulder denver grand junction and colorado springs but she added before we ever go to the bat with this we have to tell the story the council finance committee will continue to discuss the sustainable funding plan on a monthly basis and the topic is likely to appear on a council work session agenda in the second half of 2022 want

society is slowly returning to normal but some pandemic trends are likely here to stay the pandemic is more than just a health crisis it has upended the way we interact socially and professionally triggering a wave of adoption of the technologies that kept us connected during the worst of it in some cases those trends have persisted particularly for businesses and employees who benefit from work from home arrangements even though the economy has mostly reopened it wouldn t be possible without companies like workiva wk 0 36 which provides a powerful data unification platform that makes even remote teams feel like they re together its stock has dipped 35 from its all time high amid the broader tech sell off and with the company s largest customers driving rapid growth it might be time to jump in for the long term bringing work together visibility can be a major issue for managers of remote teams large organizations can use dozens of different tech applications in everyday operations so tracking workflows across all of them can be a challenge if employees are working in different locations technologies like cloud computing have made this easier but workiva takes things a step further its platform is a one stop shop for all data no matter what applications are being used workiva connects with leading storage platforms like alphabet s google drive and dropbox in addition to systems like salesforce and workday to pull data from all of them and aggregate it in one place the company offers management an easy way to monitor projects and compile reports particularly critical filings to the securities and exchange commission sec workiva supports over 350 sec form templates and the platform is used by eight of the world s top 10 banks rather than having to chase down individual teams for information users can access it all centrally through workiva in fact it is customers like those big banks that are driving workiva s growth the breakdown workiva reports its total customer figures each quarter but it also provides a breakdown of its three highest spending cohorts those with annual contract values of 100 000 150 000 and 300 000 as might be expected workiva s biggest spenders make up the smallest portion of the company s total customer base however a graph of the year over year growth rates of each customer group between 2020 and 2021 looks very different put simply the groups of customers spending the most money each year with workiva are growing the fastest this implies that larger organizations are finding a lot of utility in workiva s platform which makes sense because they re typically the most complex and would therefore derive the most benefit from such tools according to data from ladders which has tracked remote work trends among america s largest companies an obvious shift is occurring prior to the pandemic fewer than 4 of high paying jobs were remote opportunities but that number has leaped to 15 today and ladders estimates that by the end of this year 25 of all professional jobs in the u s will be remote companies are even dangling remote work as an incentive to keep and attract quality employees for example in 2021 professional services firm pricewaterhouse coopers announced that 40 000 of its employees in america could work from anywhere they like the bottom line this trend may slow down as we eventually move on from the pandemic but it s unlikely to reverse that s a major opportunity for remote work enablers like workiva and also for investors who have a chance to pick up the stock at a 35 discount to its all time high right now
in the wake of house subcommittee hearings this week on threats coming from the chinese communist party ccp the fbi and lawmakers are warning of the cybersecurity threat that the ccp poses to u s infrastructure over the last year the size and scope of the ccp s cyberwarfare tactics have begun to come to light which u s officials have publicly admitted to being stunned by on tuesday fbi director christopher wray repeated his warnings from january when he stated that china s hackers are wreaking havoc on american infrastructure remarking that the ccp is the defining threat of our generation he continued china s hacking program is larger than that of every other major nation combined if each one of the fbi s cyber agents and intelligence analysts focused exclusively on the china threat china s hackers would still outnumber fbi cyber personnel by at least 50 to 1 examples of the ccp s cyberwarfare campaign on the u s abound a recent report from the heritage foundation catalogues how ccp have hackers infiltrated key sectors including communications energy and water and may have the ability to access heating and air conditioning systems to overheat data servers to cause blackouts by disrupting control rooms that regulate water and electricity and to manipulate surveillance cameras at some of these facilities in february a report revealed that chinese hackers had embedded themselves inside u s infrastructure it environments for five years without being detected in order to extract sensitive information in addition the military is among the prime targets of the ccp s cyberwarfare campaign in 2013 it was discovered that a china backed military hacking group known as apt1 had pilfered military contractor designs such as the patriot thaad and aegis missile systems as well as aircraft designs including the f a 18 super hornet v 22 osprey black hawk helicopter and f 35 joint strike fighter government email servers have also been exploited by ccp hackers with the biden administration hammering microsoft for its lax cybersecurity policies on thursday s edition of washington watch with tony perkins rep rich mccormick r ga contended that increased openness about the threat of ccp hackers is needed in order to keep the u s government accountable e can t always talk about because a lot of the stuff is classified that s the problem the american public really needs to be informed on a lot of this stuff so they can put pressures in the right areas unfortunately a lot of stuff is not declassified sometimes on purpose sometimes because we just get used to containing this information mccormick a former emergency room doctor who serves on the house foreign affairs committee as well as the house armed services committee went on to highlight a recent cyberattack on the health care industry but quite frankly we don t have to worry just about cybersecurity and having our information stolen e recently had a bunch of hospitals shut down their billing process just that alone could be destructive stealing a patient s information how we reimburse medicine and hospitals and doctors it sounds like a trivial thing but when that happens for a couple of weeks you re talking about billions of dollars of impact one out of every three patients the congressman further pointed out the immense scope of the cybersecurity threat posed by the ccp we re being constantly attacked relentlessly attacked it s disruptive to our entire society can happen on power grids it can happen to your information it can happen to businesses this is something that we have to be more and more aware of because as ai comes into its full fruition it starts to affect us it can literally be like this scenario out of movies where you see stoplights changing the wrong color at the wrong time could cause catastrophes shut down your power to a hospital it could do all kinds of horrible things that would impact our economy and our society in major ways family research council president tony perkins responded by emphasizing the importance of a competent government his puts a lot of responsibility on the government because if there s one thing the government has a responsibility to do is to protect us author dan hart is senior editor at the washington stand the post lawmakers fbi director warn of ccp s vast cyberwarfare campaign appeared first on dr rich swier

twitter ceo parag agrawal sought to bring ease to employees concerns on thursday and reassured that the company was not being held hostage in reaction to elon musk s proposed offer to buy the social media platform for 43 billion according to reuters agrawal took questions from staff during a companywide meeting on thursday and allegedly told them we as employees control what happens while encouraging them to remain focused employees submitted questions to ask the ceo in the company s slack messaging service during the meeting agrawal told staff that musk s offer is still under review by the board of directors however the ceo indicated that the board will be acting in the best interest of shareholders reuters reports are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to the board an employee asked agrawal i have a strong point of view that people who are critical of our service their voice is something that we must emphasize so that we can learn and get better agrawal responded after informing that the board will act in interest of shareholders on the topic of free speech another employee asked agrawal to address how he viewed musk s definition of free speech and whether it aligned with how twitter approaches the concept according to reuters in response agrawal said that the company was focused on continuously improving the health of conversation on twitter but didn t provide further details in what s being described as a best and final offer to buy twitter inc tesla ceo elon musk launched a hostile takeover bid early thursday morning of 54 20 per share in cash in a tweet musk announced that he d made an offer and linked to the sec filing musk s offer would represent a 54 percent premium over the jan 28 closing price and a value of about 43 billion according to bloomberg business the 50 year old electric car mogul filed with the us securities and exchange commission on thursday morning that filing included a letter sent to twitter s chairman of the board bret taylor reading i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company as a result i am offering to buy 100 of twitter for 54 20 per share in cash a 54 premium over the day before i began investing in twitter and a 38 premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced my offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted i would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder twitter has extraordinary potential i will unlock it after his initial purchase of 9 1 percent of a stake in the company musk was set to join the twitter board of directors however parag agrawal ceo of twitter announced on the platform sunday night that elon musk decided not to join the tech giant s board this led to speculation that musk was planning a hostile takeover of the company had he decided to join the board he would have to cap his ownership of the company at 15 percent the filing shows that musk has hired morgan stanley as his adviser for the takeover the offer price also includes the number 420 widely recognized as a coded reference to marijuana he also picked 420 as the share price for possibly taking tesla private in 2018 a move that brought him scrutiny from the sec some had been suggesting that a hostile takeover could be a possibility he wants the influence and so the potential is now set up for a hostile takeover of twitter or at least the threat of a hostile takeover of twitter if they do not change their wayward ways jack posobiec said on human events daily earlier this week the board announced that they would be meeting on thursday after musk publicly stated his intention to buy saying that it was his best and final offer a source told the new york times that the board is trying to design whether or not to move ahead with a shareholder rights plan that would limit the ability of a single shareholder to acquire an excess amount of stock forcing the company into a sale this is a tactic used by companies in an attempt to thwart what s known as a hostile takeover of a company where the company could create new shares that would limit the value of existing shares musk does have the ability to directly reach out to shareholders to buy more stock if the board rejects his bid musk also said on thursday in an interview with ted2022 that he has a plan b though he would not elaborate on what that was the new york times reports that shareholders are concerned that musk does not have the capital for the investment though he has said outright that he is able to fund the buy musk would prefer a situation where shareholders stay with the company and work with him to bring the platform more in line with free speech laws musk said that the shareholders should be given a vote and in fact he offered a more than a fair price per share over 54
twitter s poison pill plan to prevent privatization by elon musk is the single clearest and loudest virtue signal in the history of planet earth a virtue signal that represents a complete abandonment of fiduciary duty and responsibility to shareholders the board cannot justify this not if the corporation s interest is its business but if ideology is their real business as we have all said and known for years well then jeff carlson is a chartered financial analyst a popular twitter user himself and a writer on a variety of subjects and he lays it out in this epic thread a question for blackrock vanguard_group you ve held positions in twitter for years price performance has deteriorated how do you explain to shareholders your resistance to elonmusk offer how do you explain not taking simple steps to enhance performance long ago jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 given the incredibly simple steps that are required 1 allowing the platform to run as an open forum for free speech 2 encouraging subscriber growth rather than banning conservative ideologies 3 removing wasteful overhead your refusal to do so raises very real questions jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 are you using your shareholders money to promote your own ideologies at the direct expense of increased return to your shareholders because honestly that s the only explanation i can come up with given the steps you ve allowed to be taken in the management of twitter jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 a follow on question specific to vanguard_group if you believed value at twitter to be so high why didn t you increase your ownership of twitter before elonmusk offer seems odd that you would acknowledge value in change when you refused to make that change yourself jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 another question i have is for alwaleed_talal and the secgov yesterday you said being one of the largest long term shareholders of twitter kingdom_khc i reject this offer odd as you don t show as a holder your claim moved twitter stock materially do u still own jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 adoption of a poison pill is only utilized when entrenched management has failed and is trying to stave off their ouster not surprising that twitter has done so but how does vanguard blackrock rationalize this to their fund s shareholders jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 the only answer to what we re seeing is the answer that everyone knows this is not a financial transaction it never was the valuation is not in assets cash flow growth or ebitda twitter s valuation to their holders lies in the authoritarian control of free speech jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 the valuation is not in assets cash flow growth or ebitda twitter s valuation to their holders lies in the authoritarian control of free speech amen that is how you do a takedown thread and there s more jack dorsey tried to change the subject and carry on as if nothing was happening and he did it by trying to claim moral high ground on the issue of trust yeah no you voted for the poison pill jeff carlson themarketswork april 15 2022 it s a beautiful thing but it exists for a very ugly reason woke destruction of all that is american because the only way to destroy everything else is to destroy speech first still it ain t over til it s over twitter is hoping to frustrate elon out of his offer by imposing roadblocks like a post offer poison pill this is a defense tactic 3 likely outcomes 1 twitter ends up in a shareholder derivative suit for breach of fiduciary duty for not properly evaluating the entire 1 bowtiedranger bowtiedranger april 15 2022 fairness of elon s offer 2 twitter is in play meaning the board has to execute a sales process to find the highest bidder 3 elon launches a proxy battle teams up with other major shareholders to takeover twitter more traditional hostile takeover approach 2 bowtiedranger bowtiedranger april 15 2022 if you re a twitter board member you re going to have alot of sleepless nights coming up 3 bowtiedranger bowtiedranger april 15 2022 the fight is ongoing

buck got some big questions to pose on our friend senator bill hagerty of the great state of tennessee which of course clay big tennessee fan but everyone loves tennessee senator thanks for being with us sen hagerty it s great to be back with you thank you buck what do you make of the situation as it s unfolding right now at the southern border currently beyond the capacity of border patrol to process the people illegally crossing as of today that s already happening they think it might double maybe even triple within 30 days chuckles what is the biden administration thinking sen hagerty the biden administration is not thinking at all about what s happening at the border if they were they wouldn t be allowing this you know they won t go there joe biden won t go to the border democrat politicians won t go i recently led a group of tennessee sheriffs and mayors down there cause we re dealing with the aftermath what s happening at that border right here in tennessee they re turning every town into a border town and i ll tell you this each month here in tennessee is worse than the month before in terms of the number of overdoses and deaths most of it due to fentanyl all of it coming across that southern border it s the chinese communist party shipping the fentanyl and its precursors into mexico they re working with their partners in the drug cartels those cartels control the entirety of the northern border they have lost complete control of the northern border of mexico to the drug cartels the mexican government cannot control them and those cartels are controlling that border and ours they re using humans to basically take the border patrol officers and get them completely distracted and tied up and then they re shipping the fentanyl across in major quantities to poison our youth here in america it s just terrible clay senator appreciate you coming on as you ve discussed that situation at the border it appears that a lot democratic senators probably not coincidentally a lot of them in very much toss up states and running for reaction are opposed to the biden administration s decision on title 42 what sort of recourse do you guys have in the senate to fight against this what do you anticipate that looking like as may the 23rd moves closer and closer to fruition here sen hagerty clay i m actually introduce legislation to strengthen title 42 and i need my democrat colleagues to join me in this cause if we do we can come back with legislation that will basically take this title 42 rule and put it into law and the biden administration will have no chance but to keep it in force my addition to that you know if title 42 is based on a public health emergency they ve used covid as the rationale tuberculosis could be that a public health emergency that would cause you know danger and harms to americans with people coming across that border with unknown diseases well there s something else coming across that border and it s fentanyl it s illicit drugs and it is kill our kids in fact it s the number one cause of death for americans between the ages of 18 and 45 last year over a hundred thousand lives lost to this this is a public health crisis my legislation strengthens that and that s exactly how we push back and again begin to arm our border patrol agents with the tools they need to stop this the biden administration has tried to destroy every tool they had they stopped building the wall it s just a disgrace when you see what s happening down there just big gaps and holes in the wall they won t allow the border patrol agents to do their job they re taking away every tool now when you take away title 42 again which is their one tool that they had to say look because of the public health crisis we can turn people away they remove that we re gonna be completely swamped at the border i was told that we would have as many as a million people come over after the title 42 is dropped in late may if that were to happen they re building up on the border now and they re just gonna crush and overwhelm our border patrol buck speaking to senator bill hagerty of tennessee senator the economy is not good chuckling as i m sure everyone listening already knows and you know sen hagerty yes buck inflation number just came out this week 8 5 the biden regime is struggling to come up with an explanation other than it s putin s fault what are you seeing and hearing about how this is gonna go in the midterms how much of an effect this will have and is your expectation that until there s different leadership it s just gonna continue to get worse it s remarkable biden keeps saying i believe even still that the way to deal with inflation is to pass this 5 drill spending package sen hagerty it s the most ridiculous thing i ve ever heard they believe that spending more money reduces inflation this started back in march of last year when biden came in and shoved through on a completely partisan basis you remember not a single republican vote they shoved through a 1 9 trillion stimulus package the economy was already moving in a positive direction i warned then that it would set off inflation that they wouldn t be able to control they did it anyway again with 50 partisan votes and kamala harris casting the tie decision they came in and shoved another 1 9 trillion of stimulus into an economy that was already overheating and they set this thing off the other thing they did though that i think was even more serious than the stimulus spending that they put in place was the war that joe biden waged on the oil and gas industry here in america he started that on day one he canceled the keystone xl pipeline he forbade drilling on federal lands whether it be onshore or offshore they killed the permitting process for pipelines what they ve done is sent a message to the capital markets that you shouldn t invest in oil and gas in america we re gonna destroy the return on your investment so that s dried up capacity in the oil and gas industry no new investment is going in there that had the effect of increasing domestic energy prices of course but it also had a global impact because these energy prices are all tied so the energy price increases what he saw at the pump of diesel fuel gas we ve seen it in heating oil throughout america some places doubled what we ve also seen is this has happened on a global basis in fact the biggest beneficiary of the price increase that biden kicked off is vladimir putin because they re the second largest producer of oil in russia so he s actual inadvertently funded putin s war machine at the same time he set off inflation here in america this is all joe biden s fault now what he s trying to do is blame it on the ukraine invasion this was well underway before putin ever invaded ukraine all joe biden did was fund it clay senator you ve got a good business background you ve been involved in a lot of companies over the years and this just happened in the last hour or so so you may not have had a lot of time to digest it but twitter s board has adopted a poison foil effectively it appears keep elon musk from being able to buy the company and implement more free speech freedoms so that people can say what they actually think in a marketplace of ideas what are your thoughts on the battle over twitter on the board s actions from both a business and political perspective sen hagerty well let s just give our listeners a quick rundown of what a poison pill is a pill is a mechanism that evidently the twitter board is i knew they were contemplating it i m sorry they went ahead and did it because i think they violated their fiduciary duty in most cases that s the result twitter shareholders are gonna suffer because of this because this poison pill mechanism basically means if elon musk takes steps to acquire at a premium to acquire the stock of twitter there s an automatic dilution provision that essentially whites out and dilutes the investment so it s gonna basically damage the value of the company they re willing to sacrifice shareholder value so they can pursue their own control keep management in place and so they can continue to pursue their own political agenda because they ve already contorted twitter into a political machine i think that probably has already suppressed shareholder value elon musk probably sees the potential to unlock that value because he could make it an open forum not subject to censorship and not subject to political bias that would probably already unleash a lot of value chuckles and now the board of directors is gonna put in place a poison pill mechanism to not allow them to go ahead and exercise the premium that is being offered that s very detrimental to shareholders i m certain there will be a tremendous number of lawsuits over this buck two more things for you quickly senator hagerty one do you think those lawsuits are likely to be successful right it s one thing to sue it s another thing to actually get a judgment and then is there a pathway i know you re not on the twitter board and not sitting around looking at the m a possibilities here what the actual structure of twitter is internally but is there a way that elon musk i mean he s the richest man in the world can he force a buy of twitter even if twitter tries to stop you know what i mean is there a nuclear option sen hagerty well i ve served on new york stock exchange boards nasdaq boards there are a variety of options that he has in the delaware courts i m not sure where twitter is incorporated but it depends on which court system the suits are brought in the options though are multiple on the lawsuit side as well as the financial mechanisms that he can use to obtain control anyone direct means direct and in direct means so the answer is i haven t fully analyzed it i m not certain what tack he may take next but certainly elon musk has an enormous amount of resources available to him to pursue this if he wants to clay senator hagerty we appreciate it and by the way i m looking forward to seeing you at mar a lago on tuesday with president trump for a big event sen hagerty i look forward to being there with you clay that will be great i look forward to seeing you there clay should be a lot of fun that is senator hagerty of tennessee

performed better than analysts expectations richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor said alongside slightly lighter volumes which have traditionally accompanied a shortened trading week leading into easter the quarterly earnings season is kicking off in earnest as us banks begin to report inflationary pressures such as energy and labour costs are expected to pressure earnings which are unlikely to scale the heights of last year while there are expected to be some strong numbers emanating from the energy and materials sectors the likes of consumer discretionary and communication stocks may be feeling the pressure more than most he added a decent showing within the airline sector offset some of the disappointment from jpmorgan whose numbers set the season off to a weak start as it reported a drop in quarterly profit hunter noted jpmorgan shares closed more than 3 lower on wednesday after the biggest us bank by assets said first quarter profit fell 42 from a year earlier to us 8 28 billion but analysts said banks reporting today such as citigroup morgan stanley nyse ms goldman sachs nyse gs and wells fargo may not go the way of jpmorgan the mood has lifted slightly as investors begin to assess the possibility that inflation could be nearing a peak hunter said while the overall inflation number continues to run hot core inflation which strips out food and energy prices saw gains which appear to be moderating in comparison to recent readings this in turn raises the question of whether much of the negative news has already been priced into stocks although the situation remains fluid however the performance of the main indices remains weak he noted with the dow jones industrial average losing 4 9 in the year to date the s p500 down 6 7 and the nasdaq 100 12

at 7 560 after closing more or less flat on wednesday fresh housing sector news from the royal institution of chartered surveyors provides some signs that demand may be cooling as real incomes are squeezed the rics report showed a net balance of surveyors reporting that house prices have risen over the last three months fell to 74 in march from 78 in february below the consensus 75 the latest rics survey data suggest that the housing market remained strong at the end of q1 but that rising mortgage rates and falling real incomes are starting to weigh on buyer demand said gabriella dickens at pantheon macroeconomics on top of the small fall in the house price balance she noted that new buyer enquiries balance dropped to a three month low of 9 from 16 in february this chimes with other signs that demand is cooling for instance google trends data show that searches for the three most popular property websites now are only 5 above their 2017 to 19 average level for the time of the year having consistently exceeded that average by 15 in previous months there are also tentative signs that the mismatch between supply and demand now is starting to ease indeed while the average estate agent had 38 homes on their books well below the long run average 55 the new sales instructions balance rose to a 12 month high of 8 from 1 nonetheless in the near term a dearth of supply still is cushioning the impact of slightly weaker demand on house price growth indeed the net balance of surveyors expecting house prices to rise over the next three months fell only marginally to 30 from 34 thereby remaining well above its 1 average level in the 2010s 6 47am tailwind expected from us us markets will give the market a bit of a tailwind with all three indices well up overnight and led

hey there people it s friday so it s time for the wwe machinery to turn another cog over wrestlemania backlash is starting to loom on the horizon and it seems like the brand split may be winding down raw tag team champions rk bro are likely to be on the episode in retaliation for the usos showing up on raw earlier this week we ve got a couple of matches announced ricochet will defend the intercontinental title against jinder mahal and we ve got a rematch between drew mcintyre and sami zayn we re seriously depressing drew s stock lately i guess the man should probably be up next for roman but instead he went from wasting 3 months on happy corbin straight into a sami zayn program speaking of undisputed wwe universal champion roman reigns we still don t really know who will be challenging him going forward last week we got a taste of shinsuke nakamura potentially getting bumped up into that spot in the wake of the injury to rick boogs and nakamura could be a fun stylistic opponent for roman but if that s the direction we re going they need to get that feud in gear charlotte flair will be here because what would the show be without poochie after last week there are several new faces around so we ll have to wait and see how any of them might factor into the goings on well that s all the preamble i can muster let s get to the action to open we get a recap of the usos showing up on raw and challenging rk bro only to be interrupted by the street profits that dive from montez ford was something else but ultimately the usos prevail now we go to live action up first here comes rk bro both men have mics but there s a pretty prolonged randy chant for orton riddle is happy to be back on smackdown especially with his best friend randy but they re here for a reason of course riddle is derailed by the history of worchester in both the usa and england orton saves us from that by reminding us that the usos showed up on their show and kicked him in the face they were challenged to a unification match and he tells the usos to come out and get the answer to their challenge riddle has nothing to add so here come the usos mics for the usos as well they feel compelled to remind us that rk bro is here who wrote this crap jey says rk bro is behind enemy lines jimmy the reminds us that they challenged rk bro to unify the belts this is painful the usos hype themselves up and remind us of all of their accolades then invite rk bro to leave their belts rather than get beat orton says he respects the family of the bloodline but calls jimmy and jey assholes all the usos do is yip the big dog let the little puppies off the leash orton reminds us of his resume then accepts the challenge to unify the tag team titles they circle and pose before the usos head out of the ring as riddle and orton pose jimmy and jey jump riddle then avoid orton and head back up the ramp in the back sasha banks and naomi talk but here come rhea ripley and liv morgan naomi claims the glow will always overcome the night mare to the ring and here comes naomi she ll take on rhea ripley after the break post break rk bro find adam pearce they want the unification match but the higher ups are still debating it riddle wants jimmy uso tonight and pearce makes that match back to the ring and here comes rhea ripley match 1 naomi w sasha banks vs rhea ripley w liv morgan they tie up and ripley overpowers naomi early ripley puts naomi on the top rope and pats her naomi then kicks her off shoulder block from ripley then she goes after the arm of naomi noami avoids a big boot then tosses ripley out of the ring kick from naomi as ripley was getting back in but ripley avoids a posting and slams naomi down ripley heads up top but naomi intercepts her with a kick and ripley falls to the floor naomi goes for a baseball slide but ripley avoids it and floors her with a clothesline as we head to break we come back to ripley working an overhook naomi fights back with a jawbreaker then a leg drop naomi heads up top and hits a cross body for a 2 count ripley lands a kick to the head naomi responds with a low drop kick and then spikes ripley from her knees for a 2 count next naomi grabs a full nelson ripley fights free and lands a headbutt then a northern lights suplex for a 2 count ripley heads up top again but again naomi intercepts with a forearm and climbs up with her they trade blows then ripley tries a top rope riptide but naomi kicks free only to eat a missile drop kick from ripley for another 2 count naomi catches ripley with a small package for 2 then a springboard gamengiri bubba bomb from naomi gets a near fall and ripley transitions into a riptide and pins to win official result rhea ripley won rating 3 stars this lacked some connective tissue as a match but both women not only worked hard they have pretty good chemistry kayla finds the usos in the back they ignore her and head into roman s locker room after this break we ll recap madcap moss turning on happy corbin last week post break we get a recap of moss turning on corbin last week after that megan welcomes happy corbin to the interview area backstage corbin is smiling he objects to calling madcap moss an associate he was just a minion or a lackey he kept moss around because he could laugh at him but moss became an anchor around his neck who cost him his undefeated streak now corbin is happy again and moss is trying to make a name for himself on his own he ll be even happier when moss falls flat on his face drew gulak has an interview at gorilla with madcap moss moss feels sorry for corbin because how bad is your personality if people liked you better as a bum he blames the terrible jokes on corbin because he had to tailor his jokes to the audience of a bald simple man who loves puns moving onto to tonight he s taking on humberto and tells humberto and angel they can put the kiss cam right on his ass not terrible stuff from moss and they even found a reasonable explanation for the terrible jokes moss heads to the ring he ll take on humberto after the break after the break here come los lotharios time for the kiss cam the plant is front and center per usual match 2 madcap moss vs humberto w angel angel distracts moss and humberto takes over with a flurry of strikes stomps from humberto then some cheap shots from angel as the ref is dealing with humberto moss starts fighting back but humberto grounds him with a side headlock takeover a body kick from humberto then he grabs a chinlock moss again fights back with body blows then runs the ropes and hits a shoulder block moss is fired up and catches a jumping humberto then hits a fall away slam angel moves humberto away from a charge and takes it himself but moss hits humberto anyway the punchline follows and moss pins to win official result madcap moss won rating 2 5 stars perfectly acceptable match humberto had enough offense to avoid a squash rating but this was a deliberate showcase for moss adam pearce is in the back and here comes charlotte flair charlotte wants to know who accepted the i quit match drew gulak interrupts to get notes on his job performance this annoys poochie i mean stephanie i mean charlotte who says he can interview her in the ring after the break post break we get confirmation of the tag team title unification match at wrestlemania backlash drew gulak is in the ring and brings out charlotte flair charlotte is asked about wwe management making the i quit match and if she s worried about what ronda brings to the table she didn t refuse the i quit match and in fact was trying to protect ronda with ronda s fragile ego things will go badly when she loses again she reminds us that she beat ronda at mania gulak points out that charlotte tapped out at mania charlotte claims she was just fixing her bra not tapping out she then plays with the crowd badly before asking gulak if he quit being a competitor to stand here and ask her stupid questions gulak must be used to quitting just like the fans she runs down the crowd as quitters but not charlotte the only thing in her dna is winning once again i wonder why vince only now found out about charlie sheen charlotte then tells gulak to get out of her ring before chop blocking him on the way out the figure 8 follows and gulak taps out charlotte wont let go until gulak says he quits gulak obliges referees show up to break this up well that was tedious we get a recap of sami zayn running away from drew mcintyre in their match last week that will bring out drew who will wrestle sami zayn in a rematch after this break post break the wwe congratulate themselves on the success of wrestlemania after that ludwig kaiser hypes up gunther back to the ring here comes sami zayn with a mic sami says his reputation has taken a major hit after wrestlemania now made even worse by the narrative that he ran away from drew last week he wasn t running away he s not afraid of drew or anything else he is the master strategist everything is calculated but the people don t understand that tonight sami wont run or hide he s going to beat drew and regain the respect he s owed drew could not possibly care less match 3 drew mcintyre vs sami zayn sami immediately runs out of the ring drew follows him and abuses him at ringside back in the ring sami runs again again drew follows him and sami runs even further and hides behind pat mcafee that doesn t work and drew slugs sami then sends him back into the ring sami gouges drew in the eyes and tries to lay in strikes before insisting he s not scared drew slams sami into a corner then tosses him across the ring with a belly to belly suplex headbutt from drew floors sami then drew sets for the claymore but again sami runs away again drew chases him drags him back into the ring but again sami runs after avoiding a claymore this time drew just seethes as sami flees and takes another loss official result drew mcintyre won via count out rating dud giant waste of time both men should be doing other things post match drew chases sami through the crowd and into the back kayla is at gorilla to interview ricochet ricochet only sees a tree trunk in jinder and he ll chop him down he s not perfect he just makes it look perfect that match will be up after the break post break sami zayn runs scared in the back he backs into adam pearce pearce says sami is making everyone look bad and he wont have it anymore next week sami will take on drew mcintyre again but this time in a lumberjack match back to the ring here comes jinder mahal match 4 intercontinental championship match c ricochet vs jinder mahal w shanky jinder overpowers ricochet early and grabs a chin lock some stomps from jinder and a slam off the ropes for a 2 count ricochet fights out of a neck crank but takes more strikes from jinder enziguri from ricochet then a shotgun drop kick ricochet with a springboard cross body then a standing moonsault for a 2 count jinder avoids a recoil tries the khallas but has to settle for a dirty cover for 2 ricochet hits the recoil but shanky pulls jinder away from the 630 splash so ricochet just dives onto both of them on the outside back into the ring ricochet hits the shooting star press and pins to win official result ricochet retained the ic title rating 2 stars solid match though every jinder match is pretty much the same so i give ricochet a lot of credit here megan is in the back and here comes the eastie boys of sheamus ridge holland and butch we throw to video of butch attacking ridge and sheamus after losing his match last week sheamus laughs it off they ve got bigger fights over the remote than that that said they ve had a discussion and butch needs to harness his aggression but butch realizes that they re not the enemy the enemy is new day butch storms off and for some reason despite this happening in full view of everyone ridge then says they ve lost butch that bit of inanity sends us to break post break new day are signing things and here comes butch in the wake of a g i jane remark and he jumps xavier woods a big pull apart follows michael cole reminds us that we had a video on lacey evans last week time for part 2 lacey talks about her father finding them in texas and talks about some of the physical and emotional abuse that followed eventually her father wound up dragging them away from legal trouble neither child protective services or law enforcement saved her or her family so she learned to rely on herself her ability to find the positive in the midst of so much negative is what made her who she is today unlike everyone else here she s comfortable at rock bottom and there s nothing they can do to threaten her nothing about who she is makes her better than anyone else but no one else is better than her shayna baszler and natalya mock the video and complain that wwe is turning into the island of misfit toys some new girl is leaving her stuff all over the place she s talking about raquel rodriguez who s literally sitting behind her they shake hands awkwardly then nataly and baszler head out back to the ring and here comes riddle for the main event which will be up after the break we come back and here come the usos match 5 riddle w randy orton vs jimmy uso w jey uso riddle out wrestles jimmy to begin then lands knees and a kick

riddle into the ring apron then tosses him into the ring steps riddle gets sent into the barricade then eats a super kick that sends him into the time keeper zone as we head to break riddle is fighting back with kicks as we come back to action then jimmy cuts him off with an enziguri riddle flips out of a back suplex and hits a rolling kick now riddle heats up with running strikes then an exploder suplex and a follow up senton then a punt kick go to sleep then a bridging german from riddle only gets a near fall riddle heads up top for the floating bro but falls onto the knees of jimmy then jimmy hits a pop up samoan drop for a near fall jey and randy start yelling at each other jimmy then blindsides orton with a baseball slide but eats a final flash from riddle riddle heads up top but the ref is distracted by orton so jey ties up riddle jimmy with a super kick to riddle and he goes for the splash but orton jumps jey and back suplexes him onto the announce table to distract

washington nytimes on friday april 15 twitter countered mr elon musk s offer to buy the company for more than us 43 billion s 58 billion with a corporate tool known as a poison pill a defensive strategy familiar to boardrooms trying to fend off takeovers but less known to everyday investors this defence mechanism was developed in the 1980s as company leaders facing corporate raiders and hostile acquisitions tried to defend their businesses from being acquired by another enterprise person or group what is a poison pill a poison pill is a manoeuvre that typically makes a company less palatable to a potential acquirer by making it more expensive for the acquirer to buy shares of the target company above a certain threshold the whole point of it is to make the offer from the board more attractive than the acquirer said associate professor of law carliss chatman of washington and lee university the strategy also gives a company more time to evaluate an offer and can give the board leverage in trying to force a direct negotiation with the potential acquirer what does a poison pill actually look like a poison pill is officially known as a shareholder rights plan and it can appear in a company s charter or bylaws or exist as a contract among shareholders there are different types of poison pills but usually they allow certain shareholders to buy additional stock at a discounted price said associate professor of law ann lipton of tulane university the only shareholder blocked from making these discounted purchases is the one who triggers the poison pill it is triggered when a person usually the acquirer hits a threshold for how many shares he owns if he hits that threshold the value of his shares is suddenly diluted as other shareholders make discounted purchases securities experts say that investors rarely try to break through a poison pill threshold though there are exceptions pizza chain papa john s adopted a poison pill in july 2018 in a rare instance of a company trying to block its founder from taking over the founder mr john schnatter exited after a report that he had used a racial slur in a conference call a statement he subsequently said in court had been mischaracterised he owned 30 per cent of its stock at the time the poison pill would have allowed shareholders to buy stock at a discount if mr schnatter his family members or friends raised their stake in the company to 31 per cent or if anyone else bought 15 per cent of the stock without the board s approval the dispute ended with a settlement in march 2019 in twitter s case the pill would flood the market with new shares if mr musk or any other individual or group working together bought 15 per cent or more of twitter s shares that would immediately dilute mr musk s stake and make it significantly more difficult to buy up a sizeable portion of the company mr musk currently owns more than 9 per cent of the company s stock
washington nytimes russia has sent a series of warnings to the biden administration including a formal diplomatic protest this week demanding that it halt shipment of advanced weapons to ukraine that could strike into russian territory or risk unspecified unpredictable consequences the diplomatic note called a demarche was sent through normal channels two administration officials said it was not signed by president vladimir putin or other senior russian officials but it was an indicator one administration official said that the weapons sent by the united states so far were having an effect it also suggested that the russians were concerned about the new tranche of more sophisticated offensive weaponry part of an us 800 million s 1 1 billion package that president joe biden announced the day after the russian embassy in washington delivered the demarche us officials said the tone of the note was consistent with a series of public russian threats including to target deliveries of weapons as they moved across ukrainian territory officials said the note did not prompt any special concern in the white house but it has touched off a broader discussion inside the pentagon and intelligence agencies about whether the unpredictable consequences could include trying to target or sabotage some of the weapons shipments while they are still in nato territory before they are handed off to the ukrainians for the final leg of their journey the delivery of the protest note was reported earlier by the washington post the weapons that biden authorised this week for transfer to the ukrainians include long range artillery that is suited for what us officials believe will be a different style of battle in the open areas of the donbas where russian forces appear to be massing for an attack in the coming days while pentagon officials were insistent in the run up to the war in february that the united states provide only defensive weaponry that would avoid escalation the nature of russia s attacks including direct attacks on civilians and nonmilitary targets appears to have muted that debate jake sullivan the president s national security adviser described in an interview at the washington economic club on thursday how he and general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had reviewed weapons requests they went over each item with their ukrainian counterparts talking about what the us had in its stocks and what it could deliver quickly reports by pro kremlin media have highlighted anti tank systems and other western weapons being used by ukrainian forces promoting the idea that russia is not at war with ukraine but with a us led alliance seeking to destroy russia biden and his aides have denied that saying that they were trying to stay out of direct conflict with russia and had no interest in us engineered regime change

twitter s board said they had unanimously adopted a poison pill defense in response to elon musk s bid for a hostile takeover he has made an offer to buy the social media platform for more than 43 billion social media giant twitter said on friday that its board of directors has unanimously adopted a poison pill defense as a response to tesla ceo elon musk s proposal to buy the company for more than 43 billion musk who is an avid user of the platform has made an offer to purchase 100 of its stock and take it private he was supposed to become a board member of the company but twitter ceo parag agrawal said earlier this week that elon has decided not to join our board musk has previously called twitter the world s de facto town square earlier this month musk became the social media platform s biggest shareholder owning 9 5 of shares after spending 2 9 billion the position on twitter s board would have limited him to owning no more than 14 9 of the company and would have obliged him to act only in the company s best interests musk had rallied for support on the platform and thanked people for backing him in a poll where 73 of people said he should buy twitter what is the poison pill move the poison pill move would allow existing twitter shareholders except for musk to buy additional shares at a lower rate thereby diluting his stake in the company this would make it harder for him to corral a majority of shareholder votes in favor of the acquisition the plan would take effect if musk s stake grows to 15 or more the plan will reduce the chances of any one person gaining control of the company without either paying shareholders or giving the board more time to evaluate offers such plans are made to prevent hostile takeovers of any corporation and protect shareholders rights can musk still take over twitter musk still has the option of taking over the company by waging a proxy fight in which shareholders vote to retain or dismiss the current board of directors the poison pill plan does not prevent the board from negotiating or accepting an acquisition proposal if it is considered in the company s best interests analyst dan ives told the afp news agency that the board s move would not be viewed positively by shareholders given both the potential dilution of stock and the signal it sends of hostility towards being bought he foresaw a likely court challenge musk revealed in recent regulatory filings that he had been buying twitter shares in almost daily batches starting january 31 the tesla co founder and ceo has already acknowledged he was not sure he would succeed in taking over twitter and noted a rejection would make him consider selling his existing shares some twitter investors have spoken out against the proposal including businessman and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal dw business america to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html5 video tg jsi afp ap reuters
washington even for the richest person on the planet buying twitter was always going to be a challenge a highly complex financial transaction now made even trickier by a defensive â poison pillâ move from the platformâ s board muskâ s 43 billion offer lays out the myriad potential pitfalls possible government approvals legal as well as regulatory due diligence negotiations of a final agreement and of course how to pay for it all then twitterâ s board on friday showed it wonâ t go quietly saying any acquisition of over 15 percent of the firmâ s stock without its ok would trigger a plan to flood the market with shares and thus make a buyout much harder â your move elonmusk â tweeted silicon valley journalist kara swisher the offer itself which musk said was final values twitter at 54 20 per share above the closing price ahead of his bid but below a high of 77 06 hit in february of last year even with a moderate and inflexible proposal which could help the board argue for rejection itâ s a fraught moment that could end in lawsuits from just about everyone involved to succeed in repelling muskâ s offer the twitter board will need to be on solid ground making an argument that the company is worth more said wharton school finance professor kevin kaiser shareholders who feel that the board is rejecting a profitable deal will be free to file lawsuits against twitter sidestep the board musk has the option of sidestepping the board and trying to buy shares directly from shareholders on the market but that could lead to tedious negotiations with some stock owners holding out for more money â the twitter board has limited ability under delaware law to stop a tender offer made directly to the shareholders which elon musk hasnâ t done but which he could do if he chose to â kaiser said â if he does this and if the shareholders elect to tender their shares then he can succeed without needing board support or approval â while the serial entrepreneurâ s net worth is estimated at 265 billion by forbes his fortune is not sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent musk said at a ted conference that he had â sufficient fundsâ to consummate the deal but financial analysts describe the situation as more complicated much of muskâ s wealth comes from shares of electric car maker tesla which he runs musk would need to turn a chunk of his tesla holding into cash either by selling shares or taking out loans with stock as collateral â the specifics of how musk would finance the deal will determine the ramifications for twitter â moodyâ s said in a note to investors moodyâ s estimated it would cost musk 39 billion to buy all the outstanding twitter shares and that there would be â a strong chanceâ he would have to repay or refinance the san francisco based companyâ s billions of dollars of existing debt that was before the poison pill move by twitter that ramps up the cost for musk musk tweeted a poll that hinted he might be thinking of taking his bid directly to shareholders he asked whether taking the company private for his offered price should be up to shareholders and not the board as the poll neared its close on friday more than 2 7 million votes had been cast with nearly 84 percent of them in favor of the idea selling a massive amount of shares in tesla to buy twitter would come with a large tax bill based on capital gains and could cause shares in the electric car company to sink as the market is flooded with stock for sale musk could keep hold of his shares and get a loan absorbing the interest payments or he could team up with a deep pocketed partner but that could come with the strong willed executive having someone to answer to regarding his decisions at twitter â afp

all racial ethnic and linguistic backgrounds are reaching the same conclusion life cannot continue in the old way fifty days after russia s invasion of ukraine protests are now taking place on every continent demonstrators defy states of emergency and respond to police repression with mobilizations of growing size and intensity initial protests in peru sudan and sri lanka are not only continuing but are now spreading to heavily populated and more urban countries in the major imperialist powers the same governments that plotted the present war crisis now confront growing strike movements that

removal of prime minister imran khan the diplomat wrote thursday that food prices have increased 15 percent over the last year and that like sri lanka and peru pakistan is the latest victim of political instability the existence of panic in the commodity and financial markets a global inflationary spiral rising food prices and a surge in protests especially in emerging markets shows that

inflation in the uk hit 7 percent last month the highest rate since 1992 the guardian noted on one projection one in three britons 23 5 million people will be unable to afford the cost of living this year in every country strikers and protesters are fighting over matters of life and death global food prices have risen 34 percent since last year russia s invasion of ukraine is brutal and reckless but who can believe the crocodile tears from nato governments and their corporate media propagandists when it is their prolongation of the war that is forcing billions to confront hunger at varying degrees of immediacy in impoverished west and east africa tens of millions face starvation in the middle east and north africa already low food reserves will run dry in a matter of weeks all of these are regions devastated by the impact of us wars of the past 30 years and as the war in ukraine drags on into the spring harvest crops that would have fed billions of people will now lie fallow in the months ahead cuts to fertilizer exports from russia and belorussia will reduce global staple crop yields by up to half last week the united nations published a stark warning of the emerging upsurge of the global working class the document titled global impact of war in ukraine on food energy and finance system states that the war in ukraine in all its dimensions is producing alarming cascading effects to a world economy already battered by covid 19 and climate change with particularly dramatic impacts on developing countries the un warned that 60 percent of governments in developing countries are so heavily indebted to the world s banks and corporations that they will be unable to provide subsidies to those affected by rising prices another key factor in the explosiveness of recent protests the un acknowledged is the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the working class which has produced great social and economic scarring what is now emerging the un wrote is a perfect storm of social discontent in an environment of already high levels of socioeconomic stress due to the impacts of covid 19 the rise in food prices threatens knock on effects of social unrest these nervous statements from the major institutions of capitalist rule show that the imperialist governments have failed in their effort to use war to deflect from growing domestic tensions on the contrary the escalating drive to world war is producing social explosions the spontaneous eruption of protests throughout the world is an objective process produced by the enormous crisis of the world capitalist system the transformation of this objective process into a conscious movement for socialism is a question of the building of the revolutionary leadership the international committee

the world s richest person might not have the money to buy twitter much of musk s wealth about us251 billion according to the bloomberg billionaire s index is tied up in tesla and spacex ownership companies where he serves as ceo according to a bloomberg analysis musk has about us3 billion in liquid assets leaving him about us40 billion short of his proposed purchase price still he has options to get the money said dan ives an analyst with wedbush securities musk could structure part of the money as debt financing and then use his tesla stock as collateral to get loans for the rest from banks ives said he could also sell tesla shares but selling too much could risk the stability of his companies stock prices i mean i could technically afford it musk said during a live interview at a ted conference on thursday a bloomberg intelligence note cast doubt on the deal this week musk s best and final us43 billion non binding offer has numerous conditions including completion of financing which we believe give it a low probability of success the note reads advertisement twitter is using a poison pill twitter deployed a so called poison pill plan on friday to try to stave off musk s takeover attempt the bitterly named plan which is actually called a shareholder s rights plan would allow shareholders other than musk to buy additional stock at a discounted price flooding the market with shares that would then trade at a premium that would make it difficult for musk who already owns more than 9 per cent of the company to get a much higher stake without spending a lot more money the poison pill only goes into effect if musk takes more than a 15 per cent stake in the company experts told the washington post that the plan makes it so that musk will need to either persuade the board to drop the pill provision or negotiate with them twitter s board is not sending welcoming signals the company has been less than eager to accept musk s offer the poison pill provision is a key sign of the board s reluctance though it did say in a statement that it would carefully review the offer as is its obligation to shareholders advertisement musk s offer price of us54 20 per share is a premium of about 18 per cent on twitter s stock price at closing on wednesday but still well below what the stock hit at the beginning of 2021 leading some experts to argue it might be too low the board also has to answer to shareholders and some have already expressed their displeasure at musk s bid employees are wary many employees within san francisco based twitter have expressed concern either online or during an all hands meeting with ceo parag agrawal about the billionaire owning the company some have questioned what that means for the company s moderation policies musk seems to favour a more lax approach and for the independent work culture one worker called musk s behaviour bullying in a tweet titter is currently trending because he decided like a playground bully pandering to his fanboy lackeys to make a joke at twitter s expense the employee wrote and we all know the joke is not really the point humiliation is twitter s board will have to consider the outcome of tension between a possibly disgruntled workforce and a new owner advertisement he already runs multiple companies musk is busy and some experts worry that taking on yet another company could stretch the entrepreneur too thin he already leads electric car company tesla space exploration company spacex tunnelling business the boring company and a brain microchip start up neuralink that perceived split in focus could concern investors and could hinder any attempt to wage a proxy war or replace board members with those favourable to the offer should his bid be rejected his plate is already pretty full with tesla and spacex david larcker a professor at stanford s graduate school of business told the post does he need another company to run musk said during the ted interview that he had a backup plan to buy twitter should this takeover bid fail but he did not offer any specifics next the board will need to announce their decision on musk s bid washington post

well that was weird on tuesday i wrote a column saying it was unlikely that elon musk will buy twitter inc on wednesday i left on a family vacation on thursday for my sins elon musk announced an offer to buy twitter for 54 20 per share in cash 420 is a weed joke i suppose this increased the probability that elon musk will buy twitter by a little yesterday twitter s stock managed to close down 1 7 at 45 08 suggesting that the market puts a somewhat lower probability on musk buying twitter after he formally proposed to buy twitter than it did before musk has some history here in 2018 he pretended that he was going to take tesla inc private he wasn t and eventually he settled fraud charges with the us securities and exchange commission ordinarily if a billionaire chief executive officer of a public company offers to buy a company the odds that he is kidding are quite low when it s elon musk the historical odds are like 50 50 he really bought solarcity by thursday afternoon musk went onstage at a conference honestly itself a weird thing to do in the middle of a hostile takeover or whatever and said words that i think a connoisseur of mergers and acquisitions or of elon musk will interpret to mean okay sure i was kidding a little i am not sure that i will actually be able to acquire it the billionaire entrepreneur said thursday at a ted event in vancouver musk said he has a plan b if twitter rejects his offer without offering more details musk said his intent is to retain as many shareholders as is allowed by the law in a private company when musk was pretending to take tesla private he pretended that he was going to let all of tesla s existing shareholders remain shareholders of the new private tesla this is not a thing and it was never going to work but it was a nice friendly promise for musk to make given that he was never going to take tesla private and now he s doing it again saying that he will take twitter private while also keeping as many existing shareholders as he can sure buddy one problem with musk s offer is that it is pretty low musk points out that 54 20 represents a 54 premium over where he started investing in twitter and a 38 premium over where the stock was before he announced his position but twitter was in the 60s in october and a lot of its big long term holders seem unlikely to be sellers at 54 20 no board in america is going to take that number said jefferies analyst brent thill to be fair to musk in this deal he is not pretending to have financing his offer to twitter s board is contingent on completion of anticipated financing and when musk answered questions at that conference yesterday one of the questions was of course do you have funding secured and his answer was i have sufficient assets which means no yes means yes i m really rich surely someone will give me the money means no one has yet now he s right that he s very rich so it s not at all impossible for him to finance this offer musk will need about 40 billion to buy the 91 of twitter that he does not currently own at 54 20 per share he owns about 172 6 million shares of tesla inc stock worth about 170 billion at yesterday s closing price plus more shares underlying stock options he has pledged about 88 million of those shares to secure personal loans but if he sold the other 84 ish million that would raise about 60 billion after tax more than enough to pay for twitter that would be a pretty extreme move though musk seems to enjoy tesla and dumping half his stock would both 1 drive the stock price down a lot and 2 signal to the market that he has found a new toy and lost some interest in tesla that seems impulsive even for him though he did sell about 10 of his tesla stock late last year sort of due to a twitter poll so it is certainly possible tesla s stock closed down yesterday i guess on the threat of massive sales there are other options a traditional leveraged buyout of twitter buy twitter with money borrowed against twitter s business seems implausible for reasons we discussed on tuesday twitter just doesn t have that much debt capacity it has a few billion dollars of bonds outstanding but those would have to be paid back at a premium if musk bought twitter further increasing the cash needed to do the deal enlisting an equity partner to write a big part of the check seems tough why be the junior partner on elon musk s whimsical trolling expedition in which he has said publicly that i don t care about the economics at all though the wall street journal reports that mr musk has heard from outside investors who may be interested in teaming up for his bid perhaps some equity partner will take a gamble on the possibility that at a private twitter musk will be in charge of memes and trolling and his partner will be in charge of like finances and strategy or perhaps he could get a league of libertarian billionaires together to buy twitter as their collective toy or musk could borrow more against his tesla stake tesla s own policies prohibit musk from borrowing more than 25 of the value of his shares which is barely enough to buy twitter even ignoring the fact that he has already used at least some of that capacity of course he s in charge of tesla and its board is famously deferential to him so i guess he could change those policies but that still requires finding a bank to lend him 40 billion against his tesla stake to finance this lark tesla s stock has quadrupled since mid 2020 if it fell back to mid 2020 levels say because its charismatic attention seeking ceo found a new toy then the loan would be underwater and selling out of a gigantic tesla margin loan does not seem like a lot of fun for a bank you can patch these things together some tesla margin borrowing some tesla sales some twitter leverage some equity partners etc and probably get to 40 billion but the financing seems tricky and when he was asked directly about it in public musk did not exactly try to reassure anyone he didn t say he had financing and he did say i am not sure that i will actually be able to acquire it that said his securities filing does say that he has hired morgan stanley as his financial adviser presumably they are aware of this like they are investment bankers and understand that if you sign a deal to pay 40 billion for a company you need to come up with 40 billion presumably they want to earn a fee which ordinarily only happens if you do a deal so they have some reason to be confident and some incentive to stretch to provide financing themselves lending the world s richest man a few billion dollars to earn an m a fee would not be all that weird a move for a bank to make and twitter has engaged goldman sachs group inc to evaluate his bid they also understand this and will you know ask still i imagine that twitter s bankers at goldman sachs will sit down with musk s bankers at morgan stanley and goldman will say so uh where s the financing coming from and morgan stanley will say oh the financing is in this can and hand goldman a can and goldman will open the can and a bunch of fake snakes will pop out aaahhh goldman will scream and then they will chuckle and say oh elon you got us again and everyone will have a good laugh because again uniquely among public company ceos elon musk has in the past pretended he was going to take a public company private with pretend financing i am not saying that he s joking now i am just saying he s the only person who has ever made this particular joke in the past bloomberg
courtneyk e via getty images things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear william shakespeare in today s report i reflect on the market highlights and data of the first quarter i ll also offer a few thoughts on which trends will continue which may slow and what trends might strengthen we turn the page and enter q2 my plans in preparation for the next couple of months haven t changed here s what made you money in q1 â will it continue it s hard to believe we are only a quarter of the way through 2022 so much has happened already and the year is just getting started investors watched risks rise sharply in the first quarter and overall leadership in the quarter had a more cyclical tilt on a relative basis this was the worst start to the year for growth stocks in decades growth gave back the entire covid p e premium in just a few short months it wasn t just the high pe stocks that were under pressure names like aapl 16 msft 21 goog 19 etc were all under pressure now that we ve seen the excesses wrung out of the growth names when it comes to valuation the playing field has leveled considerably an investor now has to make decisions based on a view this anti growth trend could start to at the very least moderate growth stocks tend to come back into favor as the narrative shifts from a focus on higher rates and higher inflation i e q1 to an awareness of slowing growth the stage might be set for quality profitable growth companies to reassert themselves after all in a slow growth environment do i want to own a company growing at 3 5 which has rising input costs that they may not be able to pass on to consumers or do i want to own a company growing 15 20 that has much fewer input costs innovating to keep costs down and their services and products will assist others in keeping costs in check of course valuation does come into play as well as does investor sentiment if a group is out of favor it may stay that way for a while the question you have to ask is are you willing to wait are you dealing with short term money 1 year or investing with a 3 5 year or more time horizon we ve seen more interest recently in the high pe growth areas arkk of the market as well but how long that continues is anyone s guess therefore their road back will a long and winding one at times like these we always see investors flock to the defensive names because they want to feel safe the problem is when we take a good hard look at valuation many of those stocks are well above their historical norms should a slow growth utility company trade at a multiple that is higher than the average stock in the s p that is a function of sentiment driving momentum but over the long haul i m not talking about 20 30 years they too will come back to reality all of these crosscurrents make this such a tricky environment now if an investor doesn t know themselves and doesn t know their strategy they are going to be under a lot of pressure in the coming months in 2021 i made adjustments to add cyclical and value exposure and that has worked out very well but there was a reason not to divest portfolios of the growth names simply because quality will always rise to the top taking a look at q2 we could start to see the recent hot momentum sectors energy etc start to cool off i don t think i m going out on a limb by saying that since at some point all hot trends cool off however cooling off doesn t mean ending and reversing the energy trade was up 37 commodities 25 in q1 so what i m trying to say is we shouldn t expect that type of performance in q2 we have to be aware that some or all commodity prices may have peaked for now but that doesn t mean a price crash is coming when looking at these sectors my advice lately has been to be more inclined to invest in dividend names if the trend slows you will be get paid to stay on board and with inflation at these levels i still believe it s prudent to remain in these trends slowdown yes recession no despite the energy and interest rate headwinds taking economic growth down my recession risk probability model does not see a downturn in 2022 however the recent price action in the financials transports semiconductors and small caps all give me pause all are signaling a slowdown in the economy and unless we see better price action to reverse these signals the recession forecast may have to be adjusted on top of that exogenous shocks e g covid ukraine remain unforecastable healthy consumers corporations friendly banks and lots of slack are at the moment offsetting the energy rate headwinds dominating headlines how long that solid eco backdrop remains will determine if fed tightening could tip the u s into recession we didn t get downturns when they tightened in 1984 1994 the last secular bull market for example but we did see mid cycle slowdowns which translated into growth scares for the market at the moment this market is in the midst of a growth scare but this growth scare has real teeth low corporate debt costs and easy lending standards also reinforce a no recession scene in the near term there is another wild card that will be difficult to forecast the severity of implications on the economy consumer confidence is at lows and it s something we ll have to watch very closely consumer trends with inflation remaining stubbornly high my view on the consumer and the prevailing trends has not changed consumers continue to shift activity to covid recovery sectors from covid benefited ones broadly paying for more services and fewer goods while the data suggests that trend is in place many of the stocks that should be beneficiaries have gone nowhere as a sector consumer discretionary was the second worst performer in q1 here is a trend that could reverse and pick up momentum as the next earnings season unfolds inflation amounts to a terrible form of tax on the lower to the middle income consumer food at home for households in the lowest income quintile accounts for about 11 of overall spending versus about 7 for the highest quintile by contrast expenditures on gasoline represent 2 3 of spending across the board lower end consumers are getting squeezed as is clear in the daily consumer confidence survey stimulus is long gone and inflation has taken away their real savings cushion high end merchandise is outperforming the lower end low end apparel stores are getting hurt by weak demand foot traffic as their customers suffer the most from high food gas prices foot traffic in the high end apparel retailers are outperforming while the overall view on the consumer has plenty of questions marks we should start to get some answers with this upcoming earnings season after the covid episode that has lasted 2 years there are plenty of consumers that are going to dine out travel and spend on services for themselves carnival cruise lines ccl just reported the busiest booking week in its history showing a double digit increase from the previous record speaking of earnings reports delta airlines recently stated with a strong rebound in demand as omicron faded we returned to profitability in march and the company is expecting strong free cash flow in the june quarter a consumer shift as the data published by mastercard recently shows total consumer spending in march at retail ex auto was 18 0 vs 2019 slightly higher than february and down from a bit of what appears to be a post holiday omicron spending binge in january spending at stores and restaurants rose to a new record in march i doubt this level of spending growth is sustainable in the long term but it does highlight the spending power of the consumer despite substantial investor fears following commodity spikes in late february early march however investors have not seen it that way as they jettisoned the transport group recently with fears of lower demand everywhere especially for freight transport while that fits with the theory that consumers will be shifting their purchasing dollars away from goods it may well be overdone the consumer is not leaving the purchasing scene entirely bottom line while we have issues to deal with i can t stress this observation enough a consumer under stress is not a consumer that is rapidly increasing discretionary purchases like restaurants airlines and lodging this is a consumer that is normalizing and moving back trend line services expenditures and away from goods without proactive pro business policies the question is how long does this last at the very least upper middle and high end consumers are going to lead the way that supports the idea that select consumer discretionary stocks could stage a big rebound in q2 a confusing backdrop i realize there are certain aspects of the conference board s index of consumer confidence that continue to send confusing signals for starters in the history of the survey us consumers have never had a more positive outlook on the jobs market as the jobs plentiful index rose to its highest level on record while sentiment towards jobs is so positive consumer expectations about the future are incredibly pessimistic with that reading at its lowest level since february 2014 this index experienced a brief uptick early in 2021 but it has quickly reversed over the last 12 months the fact that sentiment toward the jobs market is so strong while expectations are so weak is very uncommon but for now the fact that people are employed and are seeing wage growth with plenty of opportunities around dominates the present mindset in summary the fundamental backdrop in the near term is riddled with issues what makes this growth scare so different is these issues are real they aren t going away overnight and the macro scene will be impacted that is a new wrinkle that investors have not had to deal with for most of this bull market it s part of the new era the equity market has transitioned to this is why the technical picture must be respected and for the most part it also has to drive investment decisions similar to other growth scare periods 2015 2016 good stocks that won t be affected nearly as much are also being tossed away this is where the opportunity lies as i await q1 s earnings results before making any major changes to strategy the week on wall street the shortened trading week started with another case of the mondays for u s stocks as the major averages traded in negative territory all day with the nasdaq leading the way lower along with equities just about every other risk asset moved lower including bitcoin and crude oil bonds went down again as well while yields continue to surge in what has been one of the most relentless moves higher in yields that the market has seen in years given the widening lockdowns in china 23 cities and concerns of a broader economic slowdown oil prices came under pressure continuing a trend of weakness from last week wti traded below 94 per barrel and flirted with support levels the only positive was the dow transports stopped going down and bucked the trend with a small gain for the day the drop in crude oil prices was short lived as prices rebounded back above 100 barrel not so for the major indices however as the s p 500 2 djia and nasdaq 2 6 all lost ground in the shortened trading week the economy retail sales rose 0 5 in march and increased 1 1 excluding autos those follow respective gains of 0 8 and 0 6 in february and january most of the sales categories increased as expected there was a pop in gas station sales climbing 8 9 after the 6 7 surge previously general merchandise sales bounced 5 4 after february s 0 2 dip electronics sales jumped 3 3 sporting goods sales were up 3 3 as well clothing rose 2 6 sentiment on the part of small businesses deteriorated further in march as the nfib s small business optimism index dropped 2 5 points to 93 2 that took out the january 2021 level as the weakest point for the index since the start of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 nfib report www nfib com surveys small business economic trends expectations for the economy to improve and expectations for higher real sales came in at or close to record lows behind inflation cost and quality of labor are the next biggest issues with a combined 30 of businesses reporting those as their biggest problems government related issues were the next most frequently reported major concern the preliminary michigan sentiment report saw a bounce to 65 7 that ended three consecutive declines to 11 year lows despite the april rise michigan sentiment remains well below the early pandemic bottom of 71 8 in april of 2020 consumer and small business sentiment continues to be a problem that can eventually impact the macro scene inflation cpi climbed 1 2 in march but the core rate rose only 0 3 following gains of 0 8 and 0 5 respectively in february the former is a little hotter than expected with the latter a little softer those prints brought the 12 month headline up to 8 5 y y versus 7 9 previously the fastest rate since december 1981 the ex food and energy component rose to 6 5 y y versus 6 4 not seen since august 1982 the guts of the reports showed gains in nearly every component and in big ways energy prices surged 11 0 on the month versus 3 5 previously and are up 32 0 y y versus 25 6 y y gasoline jumped 18 3 from 6 6 and is at a 48 0 y y services prices increased 0 7 from 0 5 housing costs increased 0 7 as well from 0 5 with owners equivalent rent up another 0 4 continuing the string of like sized gains since september food beverages climbed 1 0 as it did in february transportation prices rose 3 9 with new vehicle prices edging up 0 2 while used prices fell by 3 8 real average hourly earnings posted a 2 7 drop versus 2 5 previously not a big surprise and the stock market is for the moment interpreting this as the peak i can go along with the peak theory for now but the sticky part that i expect will keep inflation higher than normal for an extended period is energy costs my conclusion is based on the simple fact that there are no proposals or aggressive actions initiated to bring those costs down investors received part two of the inflation data this week as well with the ppi report that included a 1 9 ppi surge that left a climb in the y y gauge to a 47 year high of 15 2 which marks the largest increase dating back to a 15 9 rise in january of 1975 back then it was the opec oil embargo this time around our energy woes are more of the self inflicted variety and at the very least the investing public can use the profits from owning energy companies to pay for their higher energy costs manufacturing the empire state manufacturing index bounced a hefty 36 4 points to 24 6 in april more than reversing the 14 9 point drop to 11 8 in march this is the strongest since december s 31 9 the all important prices paid also increased to 86 4 from 73 8 the global scene china china port congestion due to covid restrictions is leaving cargo stranded at their ports many areas around shanghai port have been effectively under lockdown judah levine head of research at freightos even with the world s largest port open the closure of many warehouses the drop in manufacturing and the serious disruption to trucking in out and within the city are expected to cause a significant drop in the availability of goods and port output political scene conversations among democrats remain ongoing on a potential 2022 reconciliation bill following signals from senator joe manchin that he is open to returning to the negotiating table on a bill targeting taxes prescription drug policy and climate energy investments this has focused markets on potential tax changes for 2022 picking up on where the build back better bill left off supporting increased attention on the 2022 tax agenda is president biden s recently proposed fy2023 budget which heavily leans on changes to individual and corporate taxes to fund policies and reduce the federal deficit prospects for a new reconciliation bill remain mixed with conflicting political objectives among key democratic lawmakers and a tight window to pass a bill before the focus shifts to midterm elections later this year we may continue to see tailwinds behind some of these talks driven by energy disruptions and a desire among democrats to advance political narratives on policy ahead of the midterm elections it would appear significant tax changes such as rate increases and new surtaxes are probably unlikely in an election year while the proposals are on the table as more time goes by they become more unlikely to be enacted in light of the economic situation that the country is facing today any increase in taxes would mean a total reassessment of the outlook for the economy and equities this tax and spend macro issue continues to be an overhang on confidence and the markets in general earnings the big banks kicked off the unofficial start of the 1q22 earnings season this week investors are questioning whether the s p 500 can continue its above average winning streak of gains as we distance ourselves from the pandemic the time of easy comparisons is over as the earnings environment is transitioning to a more normal environment this year but even as metrics moderate even a beat rate of 5 which would be in line with the historical average and could help the earnings growth forecast of 5 2 stretch into double digits a better than expected earnings season could allow corporate fundamentals to overshadow the macro headlines e g inflation fed tightening and help the equity market regain its positive momentum we ve heard analysts shout this before but in my view this time around forward guidance will be critical given that the worst of the omicron surge and russia s invasion of ukraine and the related commodity prices surges happened in the first quarter companies may blame disappointing results on these curveballs but longer term insights into expected sales growth margins supply chains capital expenditures hiring and more could confirm the expectation of robust corporate earnings growth will step up to the plate and keep stock prices resilient jpmorgan jpm kicked off earnings season on wednesday we remain optimistic on the economy at least for the short term consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation supply chain issues and the war in ukraine jamie dimon that s a good assessment of the economic situation and why the market is still struggling as it re prices this new era outlook an issue that has been highlighted for this entire year food for thought spending despite the hot inflationary backdrop we ve seen more efforts to increase government spending that is more than ever deemed as popular with the voting public after all who doesn t want a handout reducing spending is seen as political suicide especially in an election year so the proposals to spend remain a priority in my view that is financial suicide for the economy that takes the stock market and investors in the stock market and turns them into victims as well the dots are being connected and the jigsaw puzzle is slowly being completed the resulting picture is slowly taking shape and it appears to have an ominous cloud on the horizon there is no change in the anti business climate as some believe inflation is all about greedy corporations it s also good to know that other opinions state the facts what investors are hearing is quite disturbing in a capitalist society the strength of corporate america drives economic prosperity for all that wish to partake corporate greed isn t responsible for anything but what was just stated handcuff corporations and you handcuff the u s economy the stock market will continue to trend to the downside attack and destroy the wealth effect and you ve opened up a door that is going to reveal some nasty surprises sentiment sometimes we look at an indicator and just say whoa that was my reaction when i saw the latest sentiment survey from the american association of individual investors after dropping to an already depressed level of 24 7 last week this week s reading plummeted to 15 8 to find a lower reading you have to go back 30 years the last time there were fewer bullish investors in the survey was in september 1992 while 1992 through 1994 a sideways period in the last secular bull market wasn t the best period for the stock market it certainly wasn t the end of the road either the daily chart of the s p 500 spy aaii churn churn churn up down then up and down again all with a bias to the downside the directionless s p 500 continues to send a confusing picture s p 4 14 www freestockcharts com it s been the same way for a while now the index remains volatile in a very wide trading range that is being carved out that also means the next big move for the market will depend on what breaks first support or resistance investment backdrop defensives outperforming lately relative strength has come from the more defensive sectors lately consumer staples utilities real estate and health care this leadership is not ideal and provides caution technically beneath the surface supporting an overall view of likely choppy markets continuing in the shorter term risk on leadership lagging along the same lines the more risk on areas have seen some technical deterioration lately for example relative strength for high beta vs low volatility semiconductors equal weight consumer discretionary and transports are moving lower once again this is not an ideal leadership backdrop beneath the surface supporting a view that market choppiness will continue the four canaries that were highlighted last week financials semiconductors small caps and transports all were able to take a deep breath this week and eliminate some of the recent dizziness that had heads spinning however all remain on high alert status and are far away from issuing an all clear the 2022 playbook is open for business thank you for reading this analysis if you enjoyed this article so far this next section provides a quick taste of what members of my marketplace service receive in daily updates if you find these weekly articles useful you may want to join a community of savvy investors that have discovered how the market works bifurcated market the backdrop hasn t changed much recently what is working continues to work and what isn t continues to frustrate in the near term i see no reason to step out and try to be a hero by bottom fishing in the hope of catching a winner transports this group was decimated over fears that the shipping of goods is slowing to a crawl this week delta air lines dal did toss some cold water on the consumer end of the transport sector as their eps guidance and forecast couldn t be more upbeat march bookings were the highest in the company s history there are some babies in this group that have been tossed out with the bathwater but in this schizophrenic market my strategy dictates that i wait to hear what each company discloses before adding to this group the dow transports rallied and did hold the long term trendline that was being tested last week and that is a positive development small caps while the russell 2000 index iwm held its own this week the breathing remains quite shallow as the index remains below the long term bullish trend line it also is below all of the short term trend lines which are acting as resistance however so far in april the index has put in a higher low than march which posted a higher low than february that price action is something to build on sectors consumer discretionary the sector etf xly has given back 2 2 of its 4 2 march gain so far in april and remains in a bullish configuration i continue to like select opportunities in the dining and leisure space within this group the consumer looks like they are hell bent on having a good time in the next few months how long that lasts depends on how the inflation scene plays out for that reason my plays in this sector are all short term oriented that follows along with what mr dimon j p morgan reported during his conference call optimistic on the consumer in the short term but communications services at t t announced the long awaited spinoff of warner brothers discovery the new t shares yield 5 7 i still expect some disruptions as smaller investors adjust to the new dividend policy and the spinning out of shares in their accounts but i envision institutional interest rising as the complexity has diminished and the uncertainty around the timing and structure of the deal has been eliminated due to the above average yield low pe and a chance for price appreciation t represents a low beta income selection that fits very well in this uncertain market energy wti dipped back to support just under 95 and as quickly as it dropped it rebounded sharply to close the week at 102 as i ve stated this winning trade may pause from time to time but it isn t about to be reversed anytime soon i continue to add to an overweight position on dips in energy names that offer a base variable dividend based on their free cash flow this sector continues to work washington is trying to win the public relations battle concerning pain at the pump by blaming greedy oil companies and making it look like they re doing something to help provide relief releasing the strategic petroleum reserve waiving the federal rule on higher ethanol blends etc but unless the underlying issue is addressed not enough supply to meet demand energy costs will remain a problem for a while the oil and gas exploration etf xop hit more new highs on wednesday and thursday the energy etf xle and the oil services etf oih have followed along for one reason or another perhaps an anti fossil fuel bias i still don t believe most people are taking these moves serious enough there exists the potential for these groups to go much higher i ve been in this trade since february 2021 and i see no reason to leave this trend today financials a sector where sentiment is waning the financial etf xlf is down to the lower end of the trading range again the main street regional banks i follow are managing to hold support stocks like goldman sachs gs which reported stellar earnings are getting dragged down by the wall street banks and their issues since gs doesn t have those same issues it presents an opportunity gs now trades at 1 1x book value commodities this sector along with energy continues to work in this economic backdrop base metals precious metals rare earths and agriculture stocks are all having their day in the sun the ag complex made new highs this week mosaic mos 90 nutrien ntr 50 and the agribusiness etf moo 12 are all up significantly this year and they have helped the savvy portfolio and savvy investors ride out this uncertain market these kinds of gains will make up for plenty of the core underperformers that are in every portfolio i added more lithium exposure to the portfolio this week and i m looking at adding more rare earth exposure next week healthcare i ve been recommending investors stay engaged in the healthcare xlv group for a while and i remain bullish on the sector today after making a new all time high last week a slight pullback ensued but the short intermediate and long term trends are all positive in an uncertain economy i remain with an overweight rating for the sector this is a group where i don t mind adding new positions when i find a good candidate biotech this sector etf xbi continues to give me headaches the long term downtrend for the etf was broken in march and it appeared a rally was in order that call was premature as the group has instead moved into a sideways pattern after a mini 7 rally that has given back all of that quick gain so the price action is dictating that i remain patient and slowly accumulate select stocks for what i believe will be a solid rebound for the sector technology i don t want to blame all the woes of this group on the algos but there is a strong correlation today between the direction of the 10 year treasury and the tech sector xlk the 10 year treasury rises and the algos sell tech the 10 year falls and the algos buy tech investors then act like lemmings following the same strategy not realizing that growth won t be dead in a slowing economy it will be in demand the nasdaq nasdaq 100 and related technology etfs all present the poorest technical picture in the market today this canary needs to see a change in this backdrop and it needs to see that occur quickly cybersecurity a couple of weeks ago i highlighted this sub sector of technology as a theme with tailwinds this is a group that isn t on life support cybersecurity has a thriving market and is in demand now with growth potential cyber attacks are only likely to become an even greater threat used by terrorists criminals and sovereign powers the global cybersecurity etf bug is grinding higher up 4 5 since recommendation despite a weak market backdrop and now has the appearance of a potential breakout a nice way to play the group without the single stock risk semiconductors this canary is looking frail the semiconductor index soxx went lower for the 3rd straight week much of the weakness is all about sentiment toward the group taiwan semiconductor tsm beats eps estimates raises guidance and the stock sells off that s all an investor has to know about sentiment in this frustrating backdrop this sub sector falls into the what isn t working category they may not be in vogue today but semiconductor companies that are beating estimates and offering a rosy view need to be accumulated to build a diversified portfolio cryptocurrency a risk off mindset is pervasive now and it s showing up in the price action of bitcoin the week started on a sour note with btc dropping below support and trading in the 38 40k range from a strictly technical perspective bitcoin isn t trading well right now as the benchmark crypto asset has followed a similar playbook to stocks since late 2021 a major downtrend a failure to make new highs on the rebound and indeed an outright rejection at resistance and now another trip below the support bitcoin 4 12 www bespokepremium com a sloppy technical pattern that is similar to the equity market directionless final thought lately i hear the same rhetoric from some analysts and economists they are hoping inflation has peaked and they hope the fed won t have to raise interest rates too much plenty of investors find themselves hoping the u s can avoid a recession they hope that somehow someway energy policy will be changed to bring down the cost of what is driving inflation energy costs then there is the army of market participants that hope the spending and tax proposals come to an end they also are hoping the equity market trends that haven t worked for months in today s market somehow change so they can recover massive losses if you find yourself in this category of analysts and investors as the title of the article states you don t have a strategy you might want to start looking around at the facts regarding inflation energy policy political malfeasance et al they are real not imagined and those that continue to bury their head in the sand because of their bias are going to find themselves in quicksand best of luck to everyone enjoy the holiday weekend our prayers and thoughts should be focused on the plight of the ukrainian people who are under unimaginable

twitter adopts poison pill defense against musk 43 million buyout bid in this photo illustration a phone screen displays the twitter account of elon musk with a photo of him shown in the background on april 14 2022 in washington dc tesla chief elon musk has launched a hostile takeover bid for twitter insisting it was a best and final offer and that he was the only person capable of unlocking the full potential of the platform washington united states twitter moved friday to defend itself against elon musk s 43 billion hostile takeover bid announcing a poison pill plan that would make it harder for the billionaire to get a controlling stake musk s proposed buyout faces several hazards including possible rejection and the challenge of assembling the money but could have significant impacts on the key social media service if consummated twitter said its board unanimously adopted a so called shareholder rights plan also known as a poison pill which kicks in if an investor buys more than 15 percent in shares without the directors agreement musk holds nine percent the maneuver makes it harder for a buyer to build too big of a stake without board approval by triggering an option that allows other investors to buy more of a company s shares at a discount twitter said the plan which experts consider a potent tool against corporate raiders does not prevent discussing or even agreeing to an acquisition musk sent shockwaves through the tech world on thursday with an unsolicited bid to buy the company stating the promotion of freedom of speech on twitter as a key motive for what he called his best and final offer the world s richest person offered 54 20 a share which values the social media firm at some 43 billion in a filing with the securities and exchange commission he has not directly addressed the poison pill but tweeted after his bid was announced that the board would face titanic legal liability if it goes against the interests of shareholders in rejecting his offer analyst dan ives predicted that the board s move would not be viewed positively by shareholders given both the potential dilution of stock and the signal it sends of hostility towards being bought he foresaw a likely court challenge musk has already acknowledged he was not sure he would succeed and refused to elaborate on a plan b though in the filing he noted a rejection would make him consider selling his existing shares he also said he could technically afford the buyout while offering no information on financing though he would likely need to borrow money or part with some of his mountain of tesla or spacex shares frightened by musk ownership some investors had already spoken against the proposal including businessman and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal morningstar research analysts echoed that perspective saying while the board will take the tesla ceo s offer into consideration we believe the probability of twitter accepting it is likely below 50 percent twitter stock closed down nearly two percent thursday musk s move throws another curve into the roller coaster ride of his volatile relationship with the global social media service and raises many questions about what comes next he was offered a seat on the board but turned it down over the weekend musk s shock offer to buy twitter drew worries and some cheers over putting the platform in the hands of a mercurial billionaire who advocates generally for few limits on what users can post he provided some detail thursday on his vision saying he d like to lift the veil on the algorithm that runs on the platform even allowing people to look through it and suggest changes he also reiterated his support for a more hands off approach to policing the platform a thorny matter particularly in high profile cases such as donald trump who was banned after the assault on the us capitol last year critics argued that free speech absolutism on social media can be very messy in the real world i am frightened by the impact on society and politics if elon musk acquires twitter tweeted max boot a washington post columnist on thursday he seems to believe that on social media anything goes for democracy to survive we need more content moderation not less boot added still musk was rallying support on twitter where he has over 81 million followers for the fight ahead thanks for the support he tweeted in reply to a poll that overwhelming backed his bid

twitter has unveiled its counterattack against elon musk in a board statement issued friday it said it would adopt a poison pill measure in an attempt to block a takeover bid by the world s richest man developed to repel corporate raiders the strategy would flood the market with new shares if musk or any other individual or group working together bought 15 per cent or more of twitter s shares that would immediately reduce musk s stake and that of other shareholders hence the use of poison making it significantly more difficult to buy up a sizable potion of the company the tesla ceo currently owns more than 9 per cent of the company s stock in late trading twitter s nyse listed shares were down 1 7 per cent to us 45 08 for a us 34 4 billion market cap indicating some investors are now dubious a takeover can get over the line or fear the poison pill s dilutive effect musk has offered us 54 20 per share valuing the company at more than us 43b the goal of the poison pill is to force anyone trying to acquire the company to negotiate directly with the board investors rarely try to break through a poison pill threshold securities experts say with the caveat that musk rarely abides by precedent twitter said the move formally called a limited duration shareholder rights plan aims to enable its investors to realize the full value of their investment even with the poison pill provision in place musk could still take over the company with a proxy fight by voting out the current directors twitter said the plan doesn t prevent the board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if it s in the company s best interests twitter had revealed in a securities filing thursday that musk offered to buy the company outright for more than us 43 billion saying the social media platform needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with its users i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the filing i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form later on thursday during an onstage interview at the ted 2022 conference he went even broader having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization musk revealed in regulatory filings over recent weeks that he d been buying twitter shares in almost daily batches starting jan 31 ending up with a stake of about 9 per cent only vanguard group controls more twitter shares a lawsuit filed tuesday in new york federal court alleged that musk illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices after musk announced his stake twitter quickly offered him a seat on its board on the condition that he would limit his purchases to no more than 14 9 per cent of the company s outstanding stock but the company said five days later that musk had declined a poison pill path is a predictable defensive manoeuvre although it could be seen as a sign of weakness and viewed unfavourably on wall street wedbush securities analyst daniel ives said in an emailed note with reporting by ap
