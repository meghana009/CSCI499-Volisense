avalon make toyota segment sedan if you wanted to purchase a toyota avalon the last traditional full size sedan from the japanese giant that americans may see for the foreseeable future this window of opportunity may have passed we say traditional sedan because the all new crown that will soon replace the avalon is quite a different prospect with its hybrid powertrain and unconventional crossover style body the avalon is expected to bow out after the 2022 model year and carsdirect is now reporting that the sedan is sold out at the majority of dealerships along with claims that production of the avalon concluded in august it s obvious that the sedan has reached the end of the line numerous major car listing sites show that there are under 70 avalon models left in stock so finding one of those will not be easy although the 2022 avalon was still listed on toyota s website at the time of writing the brand has already begun phasing in 2023 models like the camry and sienna and we expect that the 2022 avalon will be removed from the site any day now last month toyota sold just 160 examples of the avalon in the usa 87 8 fewer than the same quarter a year ago another indication that the sedan is about to be retired completely but despite september s low figure over 12 000 people still bought an avalon this year and you won t easily find another non premium full size sedan attaining those numbers in 2022 if you are lucky enough to find an avalon at a dealership don t expect any discounts carsdirect says that incentives for the sedan have been non existent and in southern california a dealer incentive bulletin shows that all financing deals for the avalon were canceled by toyota there are no lease deals left either the 2022 avalon starts at 36 825 for the xle and goes all the way up to the limited hybrid at 44 150 one of our favorite examples was the avalon trd but sadly it didn t stick around for too long due to low sales the imminent demise of the avalon follows a bevy of large sedans that have exited the market in recent years including the chevrolet impala hyundai azera and kia cadenza chrysler s 300 was one of the last surviving sedans of its kind where a smooth large capacity engine provided power the avalon may not have a hemi v8 under the hood but its smooth ride and 301 horsepower v6 made it enjoyable to drive if you do manage to get hold of a new avalon before the end of the year consider yourself one of the lucky few

article america s employers slowed their hiring in september but still added 263 000 jobs a solid figure that will likely keep the federal reserve on pace to keep raising interest rates aggressively to fight persistently high inflation friday s government report showed that hiring fell from 315 000 in august to the weakest monthly gain since april 2021 the unemployment rate dropped from 3 7 to 3 5 matching a half century low the fed is hoping that a slower pace of hiring would eventually mean less pressure on employers to raise pay and pass those costs on to their customers through price increases a recipe for high inflation but september s job growth was likely too robust to satisfy the central bank s inflation fighters last month hourly wages rose 5 from a year earlier the slowest year over year pace since december but still hotter than the fed would want the proportion of americans who either have a job or are looking for one slipped slightly a disappointment for those hoping that more people would enter the labor force and help ease worker shortages and upward pressure on wages the jobs report was still likely too strong to allow fed policymakers much breathing room said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors likewise rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics said she didn t think september s softer jobs and wage numbers would stop the fed from raising its benchmark short term rate in november by an unusually large three quarters of a point for a fourth consecutive time and by an additional half point in december on wall street stocks tumbled friday morning a sign that investors foresee more aggressive fed rate hikes ahead the s p 500 index sank 1 9 in early trading and the yield on the 2 year treasury note which tends to track expectations for fed actions rose to 4 31 from 4 26 late thursday the public anxiety that has arisen over high prices and the prospect of a recession is also carrying political consequences as president joe biden s democratic party struggles to maintain control of congress in november s midterm elections in its epic battle to rein in inflation the fed has raised its benchmark interest rate five times this year it is aiming to slow economic growth enough to reduce annual price increases back toward its 2 target it has a long way to go in august one key measure of year over year inflation the consumer price index amounted to 8 3 and for now consumer spending the primary driver of the u s economy is showing resilience in august consumers spent a bit more than in july a sign that the economy was holding up despite rising borrowing rates violent swings in the stock market and inflated prices for food rent and other essentials fed chair jerome powell has warned bluntly that the inflation fight will bring some pain notably in the form of layoffs and higher unemployment some economists remain hopeful that despite the persistent inflation pressures the fed will still manage to achieve a so called soft landing slowing growth enough to tame inflation without going so far as to tip the economy into recession it s a notoriously difficult task and the fed is trying to accomplish it at a perilous time the global economy weakened by food shortages and surging energy prices resulting from russia s war against ukraine may be on the brink of recession kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund warned thursday that the imf is downgrading its estimates for world economic growth by 4 trillion through 2026 and that things are more likely to get worse before it gets better powell and his colleagues on the fed s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs there s currently an average of 1 7 openings for every unemployed american will steadily decline some encouraging news came this week when the labor department reported that job openings fell by 1 1 million in august to 10 1 million the fewest since june 2021 on the other hand by any standard of history openings remain extraordinarily high in records dating to 2000 they had never topped 10 million in a month until last year last month s decline in unemployment was widely shared across demographic groups the jobless rate for hispanics tumbled to 3 8 the lowest level in government records dating to 1973 unemployment for black americans also fell from 6 in august to 5 8 in september still above its record low of 5 1 in november 2019 in september restaurants and bars added 60 000 jobs as did healthcare companies state and local governments cut 27 000 jobs retailers transportation and warehouse companies reduced employment modestly many americans appear to have decided that there are still plenty of jobs available and that they can take their time accepting one among them is jenny savitscus of columbus ohio who recently earned a technology certificate at a program run by goodwill savitscus 45 who d like a job in high technology said she s willing to hold out for an employer that will offer flexible hours and work at home options there are opportunities out there she said employers and job seekers are trying to find the right balance between work and home life she said she can afford to wait for just the right position because she has two part time teaching jobs friday s government report underscored how resilient the job market remains even if it may be slowing the u s labor market continues to decelerate but there are no signs that it s stalling out said nick bunker head of economic research at the indeed hiring lab payroll growth is no longer at the jet speed we saw last year but employment is still growing quickly radial a company that powers the online businesses for lucky brands tommy hilfiger and calvin klein is one employer that is hiring more cautiously the company plans to hire 15 000 seasonal workers at its 25 warehouses 7 000 fewer than a year ago and 2 000 at its customer service centers said sabrina wnorowski chief human resource officer for radial based in king of prussia pennsylvania wnorowski said the company s more moderate approach to hiring reflects a renewed focus on adding workers closer to the peak of the holiday season to make them more productive she noted that online sales growth is slowing and that the tight job market appears to be weakening a bit peloton for example the maker of high end exercise equipment announced thursday that it is cutting 500 jobs 12 of its workforce yet some companies continue to plow ahead with hiring walt rowen president of susquehanna glass co in columbia pennsylvania said the company which makes decorative glass products needs around 15 seasonally workers along with a full time staff of 40 to 45 rowen has raised entry level pay from around 9 an hour before the pandemic to 14 an hour and yet still struggles to fill vacancies it s getting harder and harder he said you used to be able to interview 10 bring in five and keep three now we re interviewing 20 getting five and keeping one

china s recently implemented guidance for enterprise disclosure standards on environmental social and governance esg initiatives aims to establish a framework that officials say is more conducive to assessing risk and performance indicators for investors steeped in the domestic market the guidance draws on international developments in esg priorities but leans heavily towards priorities established by the chinese government such as the drive for common prosperity and social stability while a growing body of regulatory guidance for esg reporting has been emerging in china developments have been fragmented and some of the guidelines remain voluntary leading to skepticism over uniform adoption at the same time esg related enforcement remains a priority for regulators recent developments voluntary disclosure guidelines published in june by the china enterprise reform and development society cerds a think tank overseen by the state owned assets supervision administration commission aim to establish uniform disclosure practices that are uniquely tailored to china focused esg priorities developed in the context of laws and regulatory interpretation of policies established by the peoples republic of china the guidance for enterprise esg disclosure is meant to establish disclosure principles with a heavier emphasis on domestic esg priorities such as the long term initiative for common prosperity chinese regulators have promoted the guidance as a working solution to standardized corporate esg disclosure reporting in china that is more relevant to investors in the domestic market than standards based off practices in the united states of the european union of note the guidance considers compliance with chinese esg regulations along with data security and cybersecurity laws as an integral part of governance related disclosure the inclusion of disclosure obligations related to regulatory compliance is a departure from international practice the recent guidance is comprised of three tiers of indicators with corresponding metrics to each tier most of the indicators align with esg issues highlighted in international disclosure standards such as climate change and labor rights similar to disclosure requirements implemented in other jurisdictions the guidance sets out standards for the disclosure of quantitative data related to environmental sustainability such as greenhouse gas emissions and wastewater pollutants presently compliance with the guidance is voluntary and it is uncertain how widely it will be adopted by chinese businesses however the recent guidance adds to growing mandatory esg requirements that are applicable to organizations operating in china since 2018 listed companies in china have been encouraged to disclose esg information under the listed company governance code china s central bank the people s bank of china issued a pilot guideline to financial institutions in 2020 on environmental information disclosure in february new measures were implemented to impose annual esg reporting requirements on businesses that were considered to be major emitters of pollutants and publicly traded companies that had been penalized for environmental violations within the past 12 months in practice a growing number of companies are issuing esg reports and the trend is expected to continue a recent report published by the world economic forum and pwc china found that as of mid 2020 there were 1 021 companies listed on the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges that voluntarily had published annual esg reports compared with 371 companies in 2009 enforcement trends esg related enforcement activity has remained a priority for regulators in china as well especially in cases in which misconduct could pose a risk to social stability central level authorities including the supreme people s court and the national development reform commission issued mandatory guidance on working conditions and overtime following a spate of investigations and fines against e commerce and technology companies for labor violations that elicited public outrage on social media the national goal to transition to a lower emissions economy in china has further compelled regulators to step up their enforcement actions against environmental violations a previous revision of environmental protection laws in 2015 granted authorities more leeway to crackdown on violations resulting in year on year increases in total fines issued while there has been some speculation that the chinese government may ease up on environmental enforcement to facilitate economic recovery environmental compliance risk remains earlier this year the ministry of ecology environment issued plans to establish environmental law enforcement teams to strengthen inspection the formation of the teams is part of a broader five year plan to improve efficiency of enforcement activities by 2025 compliance considerations esg reporting by chinese companies is in its early stages and regulatory requirements are fragmented across industries and government agencies recently issued voluntary guidance on esg disclosure standards from cerds could form the basis for a china focused reporting regime and while these disclosure standards share some similarities with esg reporting regulations in other jurisdictions the guidance from cerds places heavy emphasis on compliance with chinese law and as such reporting requirements are likely to vary substantially from us or eu frameworks source thomson reuters

what people need to keep in mind in an event of a nuclear fall out what people need to keep in mind in an event of a nuclear fall out what people need to keep in mind in an event of a nuclear fall out miami president joe biden said thursday the risk of armageddon is at the highest level since the 1962 cuban missile crisis the comments follow russian president vladimir putin s threat to use tactical nuclear weapons the talk is serious enough that it has some thinking back to the time when local residents had to prepare for a possible nuclear fallout my father was trying to build a bomb shelter where some duct work would go kind sorta under the house joe harzinski said the cuban missile crisis was a vivid memory for harzinski he was a young kid at the time so he didn t feel stressed but he was aware that it was something that adults took seriously i remember there were drills if there was some kind of a bomb or whatever i knew there were drills and we had to get under the desk he explained dr paul george the resident historian for historymiami was 18 at the time it was a horrifying thing i can t think of anything else that would terminate human beings or life on this planet than a nuclear war george said because of miami s proximity to cuba some felt it was ground zero for a possible strike at that point we took it to be something serious literally overnight brought soldiers down here military vehicles were on our main highway and we had planes that were up in the air at any given time that had nuclear bombs in case we were hit with the surprise attack those planes would then deliver bombs george told cbs 4 to this day and like many municipalities miami dade county has a guidance for nuclear detonation it details a response for potential impact evacuation and medication as well as decontamination so there is the reality that even though we are many many miles away from russia there are other options available to those who want to do us harm stuart kaplan a former fbi special agent and kaplan sconzo global risk management founder said kaplan has worked to study and review how to plan for global threats for decades we hope it never ever happens better to be better prepared better informed he doesn t want people to panic but he said radiation pills and bunkers may not need to be a priority these days in the event of a disaster as much as making sure to stock up on the basics first those things include a plan to evacuate keep in mind infrastructure could become congested or impacted food and water supply to last 30 days methods of communication if cell towers are down such a message relay system
missoula mt kgvo am news with the startling announcement this week that opec will cut oil production by two million barrels a day the price of gas will rise to an undetermined level in the coming weeks and months kgvo reached out to patrick dehaan oil analyst for gas buddy who delivered the bad news for all missoula and montana consumers it s been an aggressive jump in prices and much of that is due to the market learning about the opec decision to cut oil production said dehaan and so very quickly the price of oil has escalated significantly and that s driven up gas prices in your neck of the woods and unfortunately i don t expect it to go a whole lot better anytime soon really dehaan said the move by opec is already affecting prices around the entire globe with opec cutting production that s going to push up the price of gasoline around the world by the tune of 10 to 30 cents a gallon here in the u s and potentially more abroad as the u s dollar continues to strengthen he said so certainly at a time when global inventories of oil remain tight it s rather surprising that opec pushed forward with this production cut as global inventories have continued to be depleted after president biden specifically called on opec to boost production dehaan said it was a slap in the face to the biden administration to do the exact opposite get our free mobile app well certainly seems a little bit more political in the timing he said president biden had having gone over to saudi arabia and the middle east and called on opec to increase production and then for them to do the exact opposite does feel political but only opec would know oil prices going up is good for the oil industry it likely will mean that they boost production if oil prices remain elevated oil stocks would likely do better because oil producers are still producing in the u s the same amount of oil they were before so for u s producers opec which controls a third of the world s oil supply cutting production is good news to them the big question everyone is asking is will gas prices spike at over five dollars a gallon as they did earlier in the year i certainly don t think we will see any record prices he said summer is over and demand is down while opec has cut production i don t necessarily think that we re going to see anything near record territory like we did earlier this year now having said that prices have moved up in montana already we re back over 4 00 a gallon and the average is 4 03 a week ago it was 3 94 so prices are up almost 10 cents in the last week we could see another 10 to 20 cent increase and that s primarily due to the opec production cut pushing oil prices up closer to home in missoula prices range from 4 09 to about 4 19 at most stations but that could increase here another 10 to 20 cents over the next couple of weeks dehaan said costco will always have the lowest prices due to their club membership advantage look see how much gasoline cost the year you started driving to find out more about how has the price of gas changed throughout the years stacker ran the numbers on the cost of a gallon of gasoline for each of the last 84 years using data from the bureau of labor statistics released in april 2020 we analyzed the average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline from 1976 to 2020 along with the consumer price index cpi for unleaded regular gasoline from 1937 to 1976 including the absolute and inflation adjusted prices for each year read on to explore the cost of gas over time and rediscover just how much a gallon was when you first started driving
hagerstown md with a month to go before critical midterm elections inflation continues to be a top issue for voters and a potential liability for the white house denting the confidence many democrats felt just days ago that abortion rights and other issues would power them to a strong electoral showing with republicans re energized in their efforts to link president biden to rising prices falling markets and growing recession fears biden has begun using presidential events to aggressively confront his republican detractors over their own economic policies in addition to touting the positive parts of his record and highlighting new manufacturing jobs around the country folks when it comes to the next congress this isn t a referendum it s a choice he said friday during a speech at a volvo plant in western maryland it s a choice between two very different ways of looking at the economy advertisement biden spoke just hours after the labor department reported that the economy added 263 000 jobs in september bringing the unemployment rate to 3 5 percent and suggesting that the labor market is cooling but remains strong biden called out republican officials by name and accused them of rooting against prosperity many of my republican friends are basically arguing that good news for the economy is bad news for america he said but even as the labor market continues to power along other parts of the economy have been an intractable concern for much of biden s presidency with chronically high inflation supply chain problems rising interest rates and a slowing housing market as biden spoke friday the stock market dropped precipitously on fears that the tight labor market would do little to bring down inflation advertisement the volatility has revived democratic fears that november s elections could be an expression of economic angst even after a supreme court ruling that eliminated abortion rights and a series of investigations of former president donald trump dominated headlines over the summer as those issues have faded somewhat from the headlines republicans have sought to highlight the economic head winds arguing that biden s policies are to blame for the rising prices and slowing growth don t be fooled by biden s words today tweeted sen marsha blackburn r tenn the reality of biden s economy is that inflation is crushing americans real wages are plummeting and gas prices are going up again donald schneider who served as a top aide to house republicans on the ways and means committee said the increasing cost of filling up the tank is putting the biden administration s energy policy under scrutiny at the worst possible time for democrats advertisement people are really dissatisfied with the economy and voters are placing a ton of weight on inflation schneider said this is the issue voters are most displeased with biden about the rise in gas prices accelerated after russia invaded ukraine in february a phenomenon that biden was quick to label putin s price hike but they dropped for nearly 100 consecutive days over the summer giving democrats some hope that inflation would fade as an issue but the trend has reversed over the past two weeks as the cost of fuel has begun rising again against that backdrop the decision this week by a coalition of oil producing nations led by russia and saudi arabia to reduce production by 2 million barrels per day was an especially heavy blow it has sparked concern among biden s aides that global energy costs will spike further hitting americans pocketbooks just as they prepare to cast votes in the midterm elections the sting was sharper because biden had visited saudi arabia in july despite criticism of its human rights record in an effort to improve u s saudi relations advertisement biden whose administration is now urgently looking for ways to blunt the impact of the production cut has said he was disappointed by the move i was able to bring gasoline down well over a dollar sixty but it s inching up because of what the russians and the saudis just did biden said friday before hinting that he was preparing a response i m not finished with that yet the president did not announce any new measures for curbing gas prices in his speech instead using his remarks to warn that the republicans attacking him over inflation would worsen the economy if granted power he accused republicans of supporting trickle down policies saying they would reverse job gains made under his presidency offer tax breaks to the wealthy and target social security and medicare for cuts he also attacked gop lawmakers who described his infrastructure legislation as socialism and then later sought funds from the bipartisan package for their districts advertisement i didn t know there are that many socialist republicans biden quipped friday after calling out lawmakers by name and accusing them of flip flopping on the infrastructure bill i was surprised to see so many socialists in the republican caucus share this article share the newly aggressive tone from the president comes as some democrats have sounded the alarm about the upcoming midterm races calling for biden to take his economic message on the road biden has increased his travel this week in an attempt to showcase the economic impact of legislation he has signed and he is expected to keep up a busy travel schedule in the weeks leading up to the nov 8 midterms on thursday biden visited ibm in poughkeepsie n y to tout a 20 billion investment that the company had announced last month he traveled to new albany ohio to celebrate a new 20 billion intel project that will include two giant semiconductor factories in each case biden has touted the passage of his infrastructure and computer chip bills and democratic lawmakers have joined biden at each stop advertisement on friday rep david trone d md spoke before biden s appearance in hagerstown calling on voters to be patient as much of the impact of the president s legislative record might not be felt immediately we don t see the roads yet we don t see the broadband we don t see the lower health care costs but that s all coming he said it s all coming in the next year three years five years but the crucial congressional elections are taking place next month that leaves democrats with the challenge of convincing voters that gop victories would be detrimental for the economy even though polls have shown republicans with a consistent advantage on economic issues americans have been concerned about inflation since the spring according to a monthly survey from gallup in september 17 percent named inflation or the high cost of living as the country s top problem second only to poor governmental leadership at 22 percent that figure has been largely consistent since april advertisement in contrast abortion issues were cited by 4 percent of americans as the country s top problem down from a high of 8 percent in july the potential resonance of the inflation issue despite the strength of other parts of the economy has not been lost on gop candidates republicans have spent more than 120 million on ads related to inflation this year more than triple the figure for democrats according to data from adimpact which tracks commercials across a wide range of races those messages could find a receptive audience among voters who are bearing the brunt of the stubbornly high costs joyce fox 43 was watching a fox news segment about the saudi russian decision to cut oil production when a reporter approached her outside the westminster calif motel where she is staying until she can get a place of her own sitting in the shade of a picnic table fox said she could barely afford her move across the country from ohio last month advertisement in ohio she said she paid about 3 50 a gallon then she stopped to fill up in nevada where average gas prices are more than 5 50 per gallon second only to california i realized i ve got 50 left in my pocket said fox who was staying at the hotel with her two children how am i going to get home she called her father who sent her some money through zelle and she said she started crying as she finished the drive to southern california the place she grew up when she got word she d been approved for increased benefits from the department of veterans affairs but fox worried that gas prices would spike even higher and she blames the biden administration s energy policy the rising cost at the pump is one of many reasons the staunch conservative says she will vote this fall for republicans even while they tout the passage of democratic or bipartisan bills aimed at helping ordinary americans from the covid relief package to the infrastructure bill to a measure aimed at drug costs democrats are also working to communicate that they too understand the problems that inflation poses for consumers california gov gavin newsom for example said friday he would be taking swift action to address the crisis in his state where average fuel costs have spiked in recent days to about 6 39 per gallon gas prices are too high he wrote on twitter on thursday 23 million californians will be receiving up to 1000 starting tomorrow this will be the largest state tax rebate in the country the rising costs have prodded some democrats to break with the president over economic policy sen mark kelly d ariz put distance between himself and national democrats during a debate against republican challenger blake masters on thursday saying he has told the president he was wrong about oil and gas policy in that debate masters dodged a question about election denialism by pivoting back to the economy is joe biden the legitimately elected president of the united states the moderator asked joe biden s absolutely the president responded masters who has baselessly denied election results i mean my gosh have you seen the gas prices lately

there are two candidates for san diego school board sub district c on the nov 8 ballot educator mom becca williams and educator parent cody petterson here are williams answers to a 16 question survey the san diego union tribune editorial board emailed candidates q why do you want this job what in your background makes you a good fit for this job advertisement a i m a good fit for this job because of my background in teaching and the formation of new schools having been a classroom teacher i know what it s like to interact with students teachers principals and parents the flow and rhythm of a well ordered school is something that i have firsthand experience in i also have a temperament that s fitting for deep collegial and respectful debate which has been lacking from political discourse in recent years opinion from our opinion team 2022 general election guide between now and early october when voting gets underway the san diego union tribune editorial board is planning to publish dozens of candidate q as and nearly two dozen commentaries connected to a handful of san diego city ballot measures and seven state propositions on the nov 8 election keep checking back as we fill in this voter guide advertisement i want this job because it s exciting and presents a challenge for me to give everything to something that s infinitely good and challenging i m certain that serving here would not lead to a boring or meaningless life on the contrary for me to have this job at this time as a true outsider at a large institution that desperately needs one would be a daring bold and endlessly compelling undertaking school board positions have been seriously underrated in terms of offices of service that dramatically affect the quality of life for many people i offer something san diego needs and i have the competence desire and integrity to carry things through not listed in my regularly published bio is the fact that from 2016 to 2019 i spent over 600 hours sitting in circle with a diverse group of hopeful leaders training under cutting edge group practices in northern california frequently i was tasked with truly and deeply listening to people i disagree with and many of those days i rank as the best of my life i know what it s like to delight in connecting with others whom i previously feared or misunderstood and to come to a deeper understanding of things previously unknown to me even as disagreements remain i also know what it s like to bring others to understand me and my line of thinking through clear communication i believe these abilities coupled with my educational background make me a rare fit for a political job of this nature q san diego city schools enrollment has fallen from 138 000 to 95 000 what should change as a result and at what point if ever would you consider closing or consolidating schools advertisement a i believe the number 95 000 is above the current enrollment for 2022 i anticipate that the real number is now well below 85 000 depending on whether you add 4 500 new transitional kindergarten students to the calculation sadly this ongoing dramatic drop in enrollment is symptomatic of widespread dissatisfaction for a range of causes in recent years district schools have been sheltered from funding decreases based on a reduction in enrollment that is set to expire and when it does the full force of declining enrollment will start to hit this institution in the form of a budget crisis given these developments the district will need to responsibly manage declining enrollment which should include consolidating campuses this will be painful and difficult but unfortunately years of mismanagement have put children at a disadvantage because of the mistakes of adults as a board member i would facilitate this transition in a way that is fully attentive to the hardships caused to students and their families from a need to close campuses q the pandemic caused some students to fall behind and exacerbated equity issues among students what would you do to address learning loss and improve the achievement gap advertisement a san diego unified s response to the pandemic was lacking in many aspects the current board maintained inconsistent guidelines and metrics and poorly communicated with families about the duration and rationale of lockdowns most troubling the pivot to virtual education exposed the dramatic inequities present in our education system that need to be addressed many nontraditional schools whether they be public charters or private schools had been improving distance education for years prior to the pandemic despite that known expertise san diego unified continued its monopolistic behavior and refused to accept any sort of innovation from the nontraditional schools that speaks to the heart of the achievement gap rather than seeking innovative solutions to the issues plaguing our district san diego unified has been rigid in its adherence to the status quo we need new leaders setting the direction at san diego unified who are willing to take risks challenge norms and adopt a renaissance of innovation to address the learning loss and improve the achievement gap q the pandemic affected the mental health of students staff and teachers how would you improve the mental health of those on campus advertisement a i hold that all children need to be affirmed as good exactly as they are without needing to prove themselves in the best situations this happens in the family as well as at school many mental health problems can be avoided when this basic affirmation is given from another and fully received by an individual prior to running for office i was immersed in a clinical mental health counseling program i found that counselors trained in cognitive behavioral therapy were particularly fit to remedy moderate issues quickly whereas deeper traumas required different techniques particular to each individual increasing access to counselors who can offer the range of services needed for students is needed on another note we are facing a mental health crisis on our campuses exacerbated by years of failed virtual learning if the pandemic taught us anything it should be that the social emotional needs of our students should be considered with equal importance as academics the pandemic policies of san diego unified including the reliance on virtual learning ignored the social emotional needs of our students and their mental health suffered as a result to the fullest extent possible under health guidelines we need to maintain access to in person learning environments and invest in additional counseling resources making sure that the well being of our students is a top priority advertisement q some teachers don t believe they are adequately supported with materials resources or training how would you address this a no teacher should have to use personal money to purchase materials and resources for their classrooms in california we are spending more per pupil on education than at any point in our history even when adjusted for inflation the fact that teachers are still having to pitch in their own money to adequately stock their classrooms is a testament to the poor financial planning and decision making of the district more funds need to be allocated to individual school sites where they can be spent quickly and easily at the discretion of individual principals on behalf of teachers we need to eliminate long bureaucratic processes that discourage teachers from having the district pay for materials q public schools are facing a severe teacher shortage how would you address it advertisement a many local charter schools have done incredible work bringing professionals from various industries into the teaching profession and allowing them to teach with the real world experience they bring to the table although the state of california and the commission on teaching credentialing does not make it easy i would be eager to see programs at san diego unified aimed at recruiting local professionals and partnering with local employers to have new and eager educators come on campus and experience the rewarding and fulfilling experience of teaching there is no reason why a qualified biotech researcher shouldn t be able to take a sabbatical to teach some biology courses or an aerospace engineer shouldn t be able to take on some high school math classes the opportunities are plentiful in san diego well beyond most cities if we look to minimizing the barriers to entry we have established around the teaching profession on another note teacher burnout is often a cause of many leaving the profession if you give teachers a set of tasks that are nearly impossible to fulfill they will feel defeated hopeless and uninspired the hard truth is that in many classrooms order is desperately wanting and teachers cannot unpack a curriculum because kids are not paying attention this problem flows into the question of a philosophy of discipline related to school culture many underperforming schools have culture problems which make it difficult for teachers to teach q how do you ensure equity in the availability of ap and honors classes at schools around the district advertisement a every school should have options on campus that allow students to challenge themselves and earn credit for doing so i fully support offering advanced placement or ap and honors courses in addition to looking into partnership programs with our local community colleges to allow high school students the time and ability to take college level courses while completing their k 12 education san diego unified has done an inadequate job of ensuring these options are available to all students and not just the most affluent i would work proactively on the board to change that dynamic given community pushback in the wake of cutting honors and ap courses at patrick henry high school another needed action would be to commit to keeping the courses that are currently offered in reference to the cutting of honors courses at patrick henry high superintendent lamont jackson said we re going to take another crack at this and we re going to do it collectively this language is unclear and makes it seems as though some other version of this will be attempted again in order to restore public trust and confidence it would be beneficial for the district to publicly declare that it will keep a range of courses that reflect the different needs and desires of students q do you think the school board is appropriately receptive and responsive to concerns from students and parents why or why not can you offer specific examples advertisement a absolutely not one of the core reasons i am running for school board is i have felt that the district has not operated in an accessible responsive and transparent way parents in the district have often felt voiceless when they have approached the district with concerns i believe strongly that parents must play an active and key role in our campus communities and as a board member i would seek to create an environment from the top down that emphasizes parental and student engagement i also believe strongly in taking additional concrete measures to ensure openness and transparency in san diego unified decision making as a trustee i would follow the letter and spirit of open meeting laws and insist on using closed session meetings as rarely as possible and only when explicitly permitted under state law i would also seek immediate policy changes to the public records request process at the district to ensure complete and broad compliance with the california public records act we should never face litigation from local publications as was the case in 2018 for failing to disclose records to the public q should the role of law enforcement on school campuses be reevaluated advertisement a the san diego police officers association has endorsed me because i support its presence and efforts to keep kids safe on campuses at this moment in time i believe police need to be reaffirmed as welcome valued and respected furthermore i believe keeping officers on campuses brings the opportunity for students and officers to realize the humanity of the other by virtue of sharing the same physical space i recently sat down with leadership of the san diego police officers association and mentioned the critique that uniformed officers intimidate students and perpetuate a negative vibe although sdpoa was familiar with this line of thinking its leaders sincerely believe that school campus officers develop friendships and mutual trust with students and that their presence reaffirms that campus safety officers are there for student and campus safety i believe in the presence of law enforcement on campuses because i hold that bringing people together is a cause of mutual respect and understanding furthermore its presence enables immediate response to new crises in an earlier interview my opponent said he would like police officers taken off campuses and relocated off site this type of thinking could prove dangerous as many incidents are de escalated quickly by campus safety officers advertisement q difficult questions persist about the may 24 school shooting in uvalde texas in which 19 students and two teachers died what if anything should local school campuses do to prevent the possibility of mass shootings and keep students safe a school shootings are a horror as they upend the basic safety of the most vulnerable in our society there remains much work to be done to prevent and stop mass murders the main variables in every incident include the weapon the shooter and the environment from the school board level trustees have the most say in the environment and potentially some say in the identification of a would be shooter at this moment san diego unified board trustees are called to allocate significant funding towards security contractors who submit the best most competitive and comprehensive contracts for bid the fact that the board is seeking additional funding for a similar list of security upgrades it requested after the sandy hook elementary school shooting in 2012 is an admission that the campuses in san diego are not safe and that previous funding allocations have not made them safe under the direction of current leaders i hope to allocate significant capital towards truly securing campuses in san diego to keep kids safe and bring peace including peace of mind advertisement what happened in uvalde appears to be a bad response with great failures q what is your philosophy about student discipline and how would you ensure all students are treated the same way a schools need to have a consistent culture where boundaries are clearly communicated and upheld regardless of race gender or class it s a primary responsibility of principals to communicate this consistency with teachers and for them to back teachers up in enforcing discipline when students move from one class to another they need to know the same expectations apply in each classroom for the most part when students understand this they feel safe and free to participate in an order where they know things are fair and just advertisement my philosophy is that discipline is rightly exercised in a relationship for the good of the community furthermore justice is fundamentally a restoration of an imbalance outside of an established relationship or in the case of excessive punishment discipline can become abusive however i m opposed to some contemporary disciplinary philosophies which hold punishment as inherently wrong or see it as an inevitable cause of trauma i don t believe you can separate punishment from the restorative aspect of justice ironically some proponents of restorative justice practices promote this separation and exclude punishment punishment is not about merely preventing future incidents as much as it is about restoring an imbalance in a manner that s fitting san diego unified has been spending millions on contracts with restorative justice trainers that miss this as it applies to school sites we are talking about things like suspensions recently i participated in a candidate forum with the naacp when a candidate running in a different district suggested that he would not suspend a student who racially targeted and discriminated against a student because the suspension would cause trauma to the perpetrator i disagree with this line of thinking and hold that bad philosophies show themselves to be unjust when practically applied in situations like this and are found wanting sadly the mother of the bullied student clearly wanted to see justice carried out in the form of a suspension and with a bad philosophy animating leaders this would continue to remain unresolved q san diego school board votes are often unanimous is there enough discussion or debate about major district policies at board meetings advertisement a no there is not adequate discussion on major policies one clear recent example is from one of the most recent board meetings which took place on july 26 board members voted unanimously to send a 3 2 billion property tax and spend package to the november ballot after less than 15 minutes of discussion this represents a late addition to the ballot for an item not widely understood by the public which is likely to pass because of crafty political language interestingly my opponent cody petterson took to the microphone first to voice his support of this item in public comment the goal of a functioning board is to achieve consensus which may be reflected in a unanimous vote this can only rightly happen in the case when public testimony was heard multiple perspectives were represented compromises were made and ideas were refined the board should move forward with something everyone can get behind given that i m a vocal critic of many current policies it would mean something if this board could pass things unanimously with a representative like me who brings a diverse perspective i m not running to make every vote 4 1 or to be antagonistic towards every policy the board currently stands for i m running to be one voice who moves polices as they are being formed with the desire to seek consensus in a healthy situation those in power should want someone like me on the board to restore public trust and confidence that when things do pass 5 0 knowing there was an outsider in there q san diego unified is the second largest school district in california should school trustee positions be full time advertisement a given that the board is the final arbiter in a budget exceeding 1 7 billion it would be prudent to make these five oversight positions full time trustees must ensure that approved budget items are not laced with fraud or bloat and are granted to the best companies in service of the interests of the community the five board positions represent the only elected positions in a public institution that has thousands of unelected positions ideally the board member position would involve holding regular office hours making regular trips to campuses holding public forums and town halls and being held accountable for responding to emails and calls from constituents within a reasonable amount of time it s evident that messages that need to be heard by this board fall through the cracks teachers district employees and parents sometimes find themselves teary eyed during public comment because they sense they have hit a brick wall with communication given this increasing the list of responsibilities and the amount of time trustees are dedicated to their service is fitting advertisement q what is your position on proposition 1 which would establish the rights for californians to an abortion and to contraceptives in the state constitution a to the great satisfaction or disappointment of many i anticipate that proposition 1 will pass with an overwhelming majority of californians voting yes in support of it i intend to use the platform i have running for school board to direct attention to other matters more directly related to the office i am seeking q what is your position on proposition 28 which would mandate state funding for arts and music education in all california public schools advertisement a music and arts programs are the kinds of things that make school campuses a center of joy and a staple of a community furthermore they are an integral part of educating the whole child in my journey through k 12 public schools i was presented with outstanding opportunities to play multiple instruments and participate in arts programs perhaps even well beyond my private school peers it s been a great mistake on the part of adults to cut these public programs in the hopes of servicing budgeting errors within large bureaucracies i support additional resources dedicated to increasing access to art and music education particularly in our disadvantaged schools where those programs don t exist at all however i also worry about the fiscal impact of proposition 28 imposing an additional budgetary mandate on state funding under then gov jerry brown the implementation of the local control funding formula moved state policy in the right direction in terms of letting school districts decide how to utilize funding in the ways that are most effective for their communities if we continue down the path of ballot box budgeting we may reverse course and create a web of obstacles for districts to deal with in spending state funds that being said i support proposition 28 and i m fully committed to spending those dollars effectively on their intended purpose of promoting art and music education q why should voters elect you over your opponent advertisement a i consider my opponent to be a kind man with a good heart who is animated by different ideas and philosophies and often arrives at conclusions that are different than mine while ideas are rightly the focus of elections this one is also about representation and fairness cody petterson s campaign has been excessively funded by the san diego education association pac and the teachers union already holds a 5 0 voice of power and dominance on this board it has moved over 250 000 into its pac for spending on this race meanwhile cody petterson s campaign filings indicate he had 4 000 cash remaining raised from public support which included financial support from current board members this type of spending is unethical for an oversight position intended to represent the entire community his election to the board would perpetuate this dominance and the current board culture of non transparency and non accountability the fact that he gave the district s handling of the pandemic a b letter grade emphatically confirms this in this vein he recently said he needs to wait and see a peer reviewed journal to judge whether 18 months of distance learning had a harmful effect on education outcomes it s helpful to recall that this is the board of trustees not the board of friendlies these members are entrusted with the great responsibility of passing a budget and holding the superintendent accountable to be sure collegial respectful and friendly dialogue is called for however choosing friends for seats of power and running their campaigns on their behalf is unethical and is a recipe for bad representation i humbly ask the voters of san diego to grant me the privilege of serving to bring a fresh qualified voice of change

news for wall street as stocks fell sharply friday on worries a still strong u s job market may actually make a recession more likely the standard poor s 500 ended 2 8 lower after briefly dropping 3 3 as traders weighed a government report showing employers hired more workers last month than economists expected the dow jones industrial average fell 2 1 and the nasdaq composite lost 3 8 wall street is worried the federal reserve could see that as proof the economy has yet to slow enough to get inflation under control that could clear the way for the fed to continue hiking interest rates aggressively a course of action that risks causing a recession if done too severely advertisement the employment situation is still good and that might be a little frustrating to the fed said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the fed thinks we need more people unemployed in order to make sure inflation comes down and stays down stocks have tumbled more than 20 from record highs this year on worries about inflation interest rates and the possibility of a recession the major indexes managed to notch a gain for the week thanks to a powerful but short lived rally monday and tuesday after some investors squinted hard enough at some weaker than expected economic data to suggest the fed may take it easier on rate hikes but friday s jobs report may have dashed such hopes for a pivot by the fed it s a pattern that has been repeated several times this year for a lot of this year there really has been a degree of false optimism among many investors that the fed would tap the brakes and pivot sooner than they ve been telling us they will for quite some time said bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the market is increasingly coming to terms with albeit gradually that the fed is highly unlikely to pivot in the near term as some have been hoping merz said employers added 263 000 jobs last month that s a slowdown from the hiring pace of 315 000 in july but it s still more than the 250 000 that economists expected advertisement also discouraging for investors was that the unemployment rate improved partly for the wrong reasons among people who aren t working fewer than usual are actively looking for jobs that s a continuation of a long standing trend that could keep upward pressure on wages and inflation we are not out of the woods yet but should be getting closer as the impact of aggressive policy starts to take hold said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors by raising interest rates the fed is hoping to slow the economy and job market the plan is to starve inflation of the purchases needed to keep prices rising even further the fed has already seen some effects with higher mortgage rates hurting the housing industry in particular the risk is that if the fed goes too far it could squeeze the economy into a recession in the meantime higher rates push down prices for stocks cryptocurrencies and other investments everything hinges on inflation at this point said peter essele head of portfolio management for commonwealth financial network we do think it s going to moderate over the next few quarters altogether many investors see friday s jobs data keeping the fed on track to hike its overnight rate by three quarters of a percentage point next month it would be the fourth such increase which is triple the usual amount and would bring the rate up to a range of 3 75 to 4 it started the year at virtually zero advertisement crude oil meanwhile

higher because big oil producing countries have pledged to cut production to keep prices up that should maintain the pressure on inflation which is still near a four decade high but hopefully moderating the jump in crude prices lifted stocks of oil related companies which were among wall street s very few to rise friday oil field services provider halliburton climbed 2 stocks of technology

corporate profits companies are contending with high inflation and interest rates eating into their earnings while the economy slows advanced micro devices fell 13 9 after it warned that revenue for

this highly regarded fuel save pro review was created by our team of reviewers after they found the fuel save pro fuel saving device you can learn everything you need to know about the product from this fuel save pro review before deciding whether to purchase it this post also tells you how to make a purchase so that you can be sure you are getting the authentic fuel save pro it s crucial to take your car s fuel consumption into account if your car has a high fuel consumption it will likely need more gasoline this could result in higher gas prices as well as other issues utilizing a vehicle that consumes too much fuel results in higher gas prices you might be spending a fortune on fuel alone due to the recent surge in gas prices thankfully there is a method for altering your car to use less petrol preventing you from having to pay expensive fuel rates not too long ago automobile owners who couldn t afford performance upgrades like larger turbos forged pistons and conrods or other upgrades had to settle for chipping their vehicles to give them more power the electronic control unit ecu of the vehicle had to be replaced most frequently with an aftermarket ecu that had been specially modified to increase overall performance due to its numerous downsides including a decreased vehicle performance and corrosion of the electronic controls this method quickly became outdated but over time this approach has evolved instead of modifying the ecu tuners may now remap the factory chip without really altering your car simply connect a laptop to the vehicle s onboard diagnostic port to increase the engine s output obd the factory software will be replaced by a customized version as a result the precise amount varies on a variety of factors but in general turbocharged engines can generate an additional 10 to 50 horsepower by only fiddling with the ecu only vehicle tuners with technical knowledge of automotive electrical systems could carry out this new approach of remapping the ecu if you or someone with little knowledge of automotive electrical systems attempts to remap the engine themselves by following youtube guidelines there are a lot of chances that something will go wrong the same goes for friends who are quasi tuners or gearheads who have a laptop and an obd connector the cost of hiring a skilled auto tuner was high a good tuner may charge you

nation obeys international framework and contributes to global food security china has been participating in high seas squid fishing under a regulatory framework and its aquaculture industry has made increasing contributions to global food security according to a fishery expert chen xinjun dean of the college of marine sciences at shanghai ocean university made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor leonardo dicaprio that china is depleting its own fish stock and that chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep sea fishing particularly near ecuador affecting local fish stocks in the south american nation he said china in fact participates in high seas squid fishing under the framework of the south pacific regional fisheries management organization also known as sprfmo and keeps close contact with coastal countries including ecuador also china s squid fishing operates far from the galapagos marine reserve which is about 1 000 kilometers off ecuador s coast he said china is the world s biggest exporter of aquatic products in terms of trade value while the united states is the world s biggest importer according to the state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2022 a report published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2020 total aquaculture production in china hit 49 6 million metric tons excluding seaweed making the nation the biggest producer in the world and accounting for 56 7 percent of the global volume the report said the per capita of aquatic products owned by chinese people is double the world s average it added chen said by developing aquaculture china has not only met domestic consumption needs but has also supplied high quality products for the global market through exports making positive contributions to global food security in the south pacific china mainly fishes the humboldt squid which is currently the most productive species of cephalopods according to figures from the sprfmo the members of the organization participating in the squid fishery include peru chile ecuador south korea china and china s taiwan moreover china s ocean squid fishing is environmentally friendly chen said disputing allegations that china is engaged in using trawling nets which kill more fish than fishermen are allowed to china s squid fishing on the high seas of the south pacific is a clean operation that has very little impact on marine ecology compared with the trawling nets used by other members of sprfmo chen said the hooks chinese fishermen use are specially designed for squid fishing without the risk of bycatch that threatens protected species such as sea birds he added chen said that fishing operations are far from the galapagos marine reserve which has a smaller range inside ecuador s exclusive economic zone even if the chinese deep sea squid fishing vessels are operating on the high seas near the outer limits of the galapagos islands exclusive economic zone the distance from the protected area is still more than 150 nautical miles he said how could such great distances affect the galapagos islands marine reserve and its biodiversity rather china has been contributing to the conservation of aquaculture resources in the south pacific he stressed the country has been strictly implementing the sprfmo convention furthermore it has adopted more stringent management measures such as facilitating hourly reports of fishing boats positions and imposing fishing moratoriums for the past two years china has launched three month fishing moratoriums on the high seas in key fishing grounds including in the southeast pacific squid resources are improving demonstrating the initial effect of the moratorium according to the monitoring of a scientific research team at shanghai ocean university china s ocean fishery is focused on green sustainable development and is committed to scientific conservation of fishery resources he said zhaoyimeng chinadaily com cn
rankings published by the kiel institute for the world economy show that france s 233 million euros of military aid to ukraine place it 11th in the world well behind the us 25 billion euros britain 4 billion euros and poland 1 8 billion euros paris says weak manufacturing capacity rather than a lack of political will is the root of the problem the rankings don t fully reflect reality the defence ministry told the afp news agency because they take into account what has been promised rather than what has actually been delivered to add to the confusion some countries report only arms deliveries as military aid while others include training and the cost of transporting ammunition defence minister sebastien lecornu this week praised paris relative discretion in aiding kyiv saying that france has been supporting ukraine since the beginning publicly known shipments include anti tank and anti aircraft missiles armoured personnel carriers fuel protective clothing for infantry and towed artillery cannons france has also sent 18 of its prized truck mounted caesar cannon which are able to set up fire a highly accurate volley at ranges of up to 40 kilometres and shift position before the enemy can locate them and fire back president emmanuel macron said on thursday at a european gathering in prague that france plans to deliver more of the mobile artillery pieces we need the weapons for our own protection sylvie matelly deputy director of france s institute for international and strategic studies iris has warned that the weapons we have here ready to use are the weapons supposed to ensure our national defence if we give them away if we tap into our reserves we re causing big headaches for ourselves she added the 18 caesar systems already delivered to kyiv constitute a quarter of the french fleet of the mobile artillery platforms macron hails nobel prize for unswerving defenders of human rights in europe french pm wants to continue sanctions on russia to make the cost of the war unbearable it s not a lack of political will perhaps it s political prudence about our own security our own defence several high ranking french officers have said that although paris has boosted military spending in recent years with the total set to reach 44 billion euros in 2023 national stocks of equipment remain limited washington has less need of weapons to defend its national territory matelly adds six billion euros needed two billion agreed modern military hardware is complex and difficult to manufacture especially when there are supply chain problems and a general penury of crucial raw materials sylvie matelly says that simply committing more cash is not an answer a french parliamentary report published in february found that six billion euros would be needed to replenish france s arsenals well above the 2 billion announced this week as total spending for 2023 macron has been pushing for greater defence integration among eu nations to limit the duplication of effort between member states armed forces and arms industries originally published on rfi
the russian army has stepped up the number of attacks by iranian made kamikaze drones aiming a dozen such devices at a town near kyiv on wednesday alone while their effectiveness is limited the drones offer a cheap alternative to missile strikes and allow russian forces to keep up the pressure on ukrainian cities located far from the frontline president vladimir putin s forces may be on the back foot in the east and south of ukraine but they still have the ability to strike deep into enemy territory such is the message delivered by iranian manufactured drones which the russian army has used over the past three weeks to strike artillery positions ammunition depots and civilian infrastructures on wednesday a swarm of twelve drones flew straight to bila tserkva a garrison town located about 90 kilometres south of kiev marking a first for an area that had so far been largely spared by the fighting six drones were shot down by ukrainian forces but the other half crashed into buildings causing extensive damage and injuring one soldier until then southern cities including odessa had been the main target of kamikaze drones and other flying devices capable of dropping bombs even if the russians know they will not take odessa they want to maintain the psychological pressure on the opposite camp and make clear that the war will go on including for the civilian population said general dominique trinquand a former head of the french military mission to the united nations iran s long range kamikaze drone kyiv and its allies had been expecting to face iranian made flying bombs as early as july the white house warned that tehran was delivering drones to russia according to the institute for the study of war a us based think tank moscow launched a satellite into orbit on behalf of iran in exchange for the weapons despite iranian denials ukraine decided last month to reduce its diplomatic representation in tehran in protest at these allegations meanwhile the us treasury announced sanctions against four iranian arms companies suspected of supplying the russian army until recently drone warfare was a weak spot in russian military operations in ukraine attempts to produce domestically built combat drones have suffered a series of setbacks and international sanctions have further hindered their development as a result the kremlin has turned to iran for its unmanned flying vehicles they include the mohajer 6 observation and attack aircraft and above all the shahed 136 kamikaze drones used by houthi rebels in yemen to damage oil installations in saudi arabia at 3 5 metres long and 2 5 metres wide the shahed 136 is a cheap and easy to use drone that can fly at up to 180 km h with a claimed range of 2 500 km it reaches its target by gps coordinates entered before take off it then flies autonomously at relatively low altitude and aiming for a fixed target pierre grasser a french researcher associated with the sirice laboratory told afp they make a lot of noise like a chainsaw or a scooter added nataliya gumenyuk a spokeswoman for the ukrainian military command claiming that their effectiveness is very low however what the drones lack in reliability they make up for in stealth allowing them to evade radar surveillance they are fast and keep low making it difficult to detect them early enough for anti aircraft defence to destroy them said general trinquand drone jammers exist but they would have to be spread out across the entire theatre of war which is very large the defence expert added in late september washington announced it was sending a dozen titan electronic jamming systems to help ukraine fight off russian drones the systems are considered to be particularly effective against the geran 2 the russian name for the shahed 136 a rapidly shrinking missile stockpile the iranian made shahed 136 is seen as a competitor to the turkish bayraktar tb2 which the ukrainian army has used to great effect in fending off russian assaults similarly the shahed 136 allows putin s forces to destroy logistical infrastructure far from the front line such as ammunition depots or railway junctions without endangering russian aviation military experts say russia has become more and more cautious with its fighter bombers in recent months due to the deployment of increasingly sophisticated anti aircraft systems on the ukrainian side the use of drones also allows moscow to compensate for its shortage of hugely expensive ballistic missiles like the kalibr type missiles which were used to a large extent at the beginning of the ukraine invasion and can cost several million euros apiece it s looking like their stock of precision missiles to use putin s words has reached the end said general trinquand overall their supply of high tech equipment is running very low and is hard to replace because many components come from the west while iranian drones flying over ukraine are cause for concern in kyiv they also signal russia s difficulties in maintaining the war effort after eight months of engagement above all the new weapons in moscow s depleted arsenal are unlikely to change the dynamics at work on the eastern and southern fronts where the ukrainian counter offensive has changed the face of the war this article was translated from the original in french originally published on france24

new york good news on the economy remains bad news for wall street as stocks fell sharply friday on worries a still strong u s jobs market may actually make a recession more likely the s p 500 ended 2 8 lower after briefly dropping 3 3 as traders weighed a government report showing employers hired more workers last month than economists expected the dow jones industrial average fell 2 1 and the nasdaq composite lost 3 8 wall street is worried the federal reserve could see that as proof the economy has yet to slow enough to get inflation under control that could clear the way for the fed to continue hiking interest rates aggressively something that risks causing a recession if done too severely the employment situation is still good and that might be a little frustrating to the fed said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the fed thinks we need more people unemployed in order to make sure inflation comes down and stays down stocks have tumbled over 20 from records this year on worries about inflation interest rates and the possibility of a recession the major indexes managed to notch a gain for the week thanks to a powerful but short lived rally monday and tuesday after some investors squinted hard enough at some weaker than expected economic data to suggest the fed may take it easier on rate hikes but friday s jobs report may have dashed such hopes for a pivot by the fed it s a pattern that has been repeated several times this year advertisement for for a lot of this a year there really has been a degree of false optimism among many investors that the fed would would tap the brakes and pivot sooner than they ve been telling us they will for quite some time bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the market is increasingly coming to terms with albeit gradually that the fed is highly unlikely to pivot in the near term as some have been hoping for employers added 263 000 jobs last month that s a slowdown from the hiring pace of 315 000 in july but it s still more than the 250 000 that economists expected also discouraging for investors was that the unemployment rate improved partly for the wrong reasons among people who aren t working fewer than usual are actively looking for jobs that s a continuation of a longstanding trend that could keep upward pressure on wages and inflation we are not out of the woods yet but should be getting closer as the impact of aggressive policy starts to take hold said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors by hiking interest rates the fed is hoping to slow the economy and jobs market the plan is to starve inflation of the purchases needed to keep prices rising even further the fed has already seen some effects with higher mortgage rates hurting the housing industry in particular the risk is that if the fed goes too far it could squeeze the economy into a recession in the meantime higher rates push down on prices for stocks cryptocurrencies and other investments advertisement everything hinges on inflation at this point said peter essele head of portfolio management for commonwealth financial network we do think its going to moderate over the next few quarters altogether many investors see friday s jobs data keeping the fed on track to hike its overnight rate by three quarters of a percentage point next month it would be the fourth such increase which is triple the usual amount and bring the rate up to a range of 3 75 to 4 it started the year at virtually zero crude oil meanwhile continued its sharp climb and is heading for its biggest weekly gain since march benchmark u s crude jumped 4 7 to settle at 92 64 per barrel brent crude the international standard rose 3 7 to settle at 97 92 they ve shot higher because big oil producing countries have pledged to cut production in order to keep prices up that should keep the pressure up on inflation which is still near a four decade high but hopefully moderating the rise for crude helped stocks of oil related companies to be among wall street s very few to rise friday oilfield services provider halliburton climbed 2 stocks of technology companies led the way in the opposite direction they ve been among the hardest hit by this year s rising rates which most hurt investments seen as the riskiest most expensive or

washington america s employers slowed their hiring in september but still added 263 000 jobs a solid figure that will likely keep the federal reserve on pace to keep raising interest rates aggressively to fight persistently high inflation friday s government report showed that hiring fell from 315 000 in august to the weakest monthly gain since april 2021 the unemployment rate dropped from 3 7 to 3 5 matching a half century low the fed is hoping that a slower pace of hiring would eventually mean less pressure on employers to raise pay and pass those costs on to their customers through price increases a recipe for high inflation but september s job growth was likely too robust to satisfy the central bank s inflation fighters last month hourly wages rose 5 from a year earlier the slowest year over year pace since december but still hotter than the fed would want the proportion of americans who either have a job or are looking for one slipped slightly a disappointment for those hoping that more people would enter the labor force and help ease worker shortages and upward pressure on wages the jobs report was still likely too strong to allow fed policymakers much breathing room said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors likewise rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics said she didn t think september s softer jobs and wage numbers would stop the fed from raising its benchmark short term rate in november by an unusually large three quarters of a point for a fourth consecutive time and by an additional half point in december on wall street stocks tumbled friday morning a sign that investors foresee more aggressive fed rate hikes ahead the s p 500 index sank 1 9 in early trading and the yield on the 2 year treasury note which tends to track expectations for fed actions rose to 4 31 from 4 26 late thursday the public anxiety that has arisen over high prices and the prospect of a recession is also carrying political consequences as president joe biden s democratic party struggles to maintain control of congress in november s midterm elections in its epic battle to rein in inflation the fed has raised its benchmark interest rate five times this year it is aiming to slow economic growth enough to reduce annual price increases back toward its 2 target it has a long way to go in august one key measure of year over year inflation the consumer price index amounted to 8 3 and for now consumer spending the primary driver of the u s economy is showing resilience in august consumers spent a bit more than in july a sign that the economy was holding up despite rising borrowing rates violent swings in the stock market and inflated prices for food rent and other essentials fed chair jerome powell has warned bluntly that the inflation fight will bring some pain notably in the form of layoffs and higher unemployment some economists remain hopeful that despite the persistent inflation pressures the fed will still manage to achieve a so called soft landing slowing growth enough to tame inflation without going so far as to tip the economy into recession it s a notoriously difficult task and the fed is trying to accomplish it at a perilous time the global economy weakened by food shortages and surging energy prices resulting from russia s war against ukraine may be on the brink of recession kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund warned thursday that the imf is downgrading its estimates for world economic growth by 4 trillion through 2026 and that things are more likely to get worse before it gets better powell and his colleagues on the fed s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs there s currently an average of 1 7 openings for every unemployed american will steadily decline some encouraging news came this week when the labor department reported that job openings fell by 1 1 million in august to 10 1 million the fewest since june 2021 on the other hand by any standard of history openings remain extraordinarily high in records dating to 2000 they had never topped 10 million in a month until last year last month s decline in unemployment was widely shared across demographic groups the jobless rate for hispanics tumbled to 3 8 the lowest level in government records dating to 1973 unemployment for black americans also fell from 6 in august to 5 8 in september still above its record low of 5 1 in november 2019 in september restaurants and bars added 60 000 jobs as did healthcare companies state and local governments cut 27 000 jobs retailers transportation and warehouse companies reduced employment modestly many americans appear to have decided that there are still plenty of jobs available and that they can take their time accepting one among them is jenny savitscus of columbus ohio who recently earned a technology certificate at a program run by goodwill savitscus 45 who d like a job in high technology said she s willing to hold out for an employer that will offer flexible hours and work at home options there are opportunities out there she said employers and job seekers are trying to find the right balance between work and home life she said she can afford to wait for just the right position because she has two part time teaching jobs friday s government report underscored how resilient the job market remains even if it may be slowing the u s labor market continues to decelerate but there are no signs that it s stalling out said nick bunker head of economic research at the indeed hiring lab payroll growth is no longer at the jet speed we saw last year but employment is still growing quickly radial a company that powers the online businesses for lucky brands tommy hilfiger and calvin klein is one employer that is hiring more cautiously the company plans to hire 15 000 seasonal workers at its 25 warehouses 7 000 fewer than a year ago and 2 000 at its customer service centers said sabrina wnorowski chief human resource officer for radial based in king of prussia pennsylvania wnorowski said the company s more moderate

missoula mt kgvo am news with the startling announcement this week that opec will cut oil production by two million barrels a day the price of gas will rise to an undetermined level in the coming weeks and months kgvo reached out to patrick dehaan oil analyst for gas buddy who delivered the bad news for all missoula and montana consumers it s been an aggressive jump in prices and much of that is due to the market learning about the opec decision to cut oil production said dehaan and so very quickly the price of oil has escalated significantly and that s driven up gas prices in your neck of the woods and unfortunately i don t expect it to go a whole lot better anytime soon really dehaan said the move by opec is already affecting prices around the entire globe with opec cutting production that s going to push up the price of gasoline around the world by the tune of 10 to 30 cents a gallon here in the u s and potentially more abroad as the u s dollar continues to strengthen he said so certainly at a time when global inventories of oil remain tight it s rather surprising that opec pushed forward with this production cut as global inventories have continued to be depleted after president biden specifically called on opec to boost production dehaan said it was a slap in the face to the biden administration to do the exact opposite get our free mobile app get our free mobile app well certainly seems a little bit more political in the timing he said president biden had having gone over to saudi arabia and the middle east and called on opec to increase production and then for them to do the exact opposite does feel political but only opec would know oil prices going up is good for the oil industry it likely will mean that they boost production if oil prices remain elevated oil stocks would likely do better because oil producers are still producing in the u s the same amount of oil they were before so for u s producers opec which controls a third of the world s oil supply cutting production is good news to them the big question everyone is asking is will gas prices spike at over five dollars a gallon as they did earlier in the year i certainly don t think we will see any record prices he said summer is over and demand is down while opec has cut production i don t necessarily think that we re going to see anything near record territory like we did earlier this year now having said that prices have moved up in montana already we re back over 4 00 a gallon and the average is 4 03 a week ago it was 3 94 so prices are up almost 10 cents in the last week we could see another 10 to 20 cent increase and that s primarily due to the opec production cut pushing oil prices up closer to home in missoula prices range from 4 09 to about 4 19 at most stations but that could increase here another 10 to 20 cents over the next couple of weeks dehaan said costco will always have the lowest prices due to their club membership advantage look see how much gasoline cost the year you started driving to find out more about how has the price of gas changed throughout the years stacker ran the numbers on the cost of a gallon of gasoline for each of the last 84 years using data from the bureau of labor statistics released in april 2020 we analyzed the average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline from 1976 to 2020 along with the consumer price index cpi for unleaded regular gasoline from 1937 to 1976 including the absolute and inflation adjusted prices for each year read on to explore the cost of gas over time and rediscover just how much a gallon was when you first started driving

nation obeys international framework and contributes to global food security china has been participating in high seas squid fishing under a regulatory framework and its aquaculture industry has made increasing contributions to global food security according to a fishery expert chen xinjun dean of the college of marine sciences at shanghai ocean university made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor leonardo dicaprio that china is depleting its own fish stock and that chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep sea fishing particularly near ecuador affecting local fish stocks in the south american nation he said china in fact participates in high seas squid fishing under the framework of the south pacific regional fisheries management organization also known as sprfmo and keeps close contact with coastal countries including ecuador also china s squid fishing operates far from the galapagos marine reserve which is about 1 000 kilometers off ecuador s coast he said china is the world s biggest exporter of aquatic products in terms of trade value while the united states is the world s biggest importer according to the state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2022 a report published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2020 total aquaculture production in china hit 49 6 million metric tons excluding seaweed making the nation the biggest producer in the world and accounting for 56 7 percent of the global volume the report said the per capita of aquatic products owned by chinese people is double the world s average it added chen said by developing aquaculture china has not only met domestic consumption needs but has also supplied high quality products for the global market through exports making positive contributions to global food security in the south pacific china mainly fishes the humboldt squid which is currently the most productive species of cephalopods according to figures from the sprfmo the members of the organization participating in the squid fishery include peru chile ecuador south korea china and china s taiwan moreover china s ocean squid fishing is environmentally friendly chen said disputing allegations that china is engaged in using trawling nets which kill more fish than fishermen are allowed to china s squid fishing on the high seas of the south pacific is a clean operation that has very little impact on marine ecology compared with the trawling nets used by other members of sprfmo chen said the hooks chinese fishermen use are specially designed for squid fishing without the risk of bycatch that threatens protected species such as sea birds he added chen said that fishing operations are far from the galapagos marine reserve which has a smaller range inside ecuador s exclusive economic zone even if the chinese deep sea squid fishing vessels are operating on the high seas near the outer limits of the galapagos islands exclusive economic zone the distance from the protected area is still more than 150 nautical miles he said how could such great distances affect the galapagos islands marine reserve and its biodiversity rather china has been contributing to the conservation of aquaculture resources in the south pacific he stressed the country has been strictly implementing the sprfmo convention furthermore it has adopted more stringent management measures such as facilitating hourly reports of fishing boats positions and imposing fishing moratoriums for the past two years china has launched three month fishing moratoriums on the high seas in key fishing grounds including in the southeast pacific squid resources are improving demonstrating the initial effect of the moratorium according to the monitoring of a scientific research team at shanghai ocean university china s ocean fishery is focused on green sustainable development and is committed to scientific conservation of fishery resources he said zhaoyimeng chinadaily com cn
good news on the economy remains bad news for wall street and stocks are falling sharply friday on worries a still strong u s jobs market may actually make a recession more likely new york ap good news on the economy remains bad news for wall street as stocks fell sharply friday on worries a still strong u s jobs market may actually make a recession more likely the s p 500 ended 2 8 lower after briefly dropping 3 3 as traders weighed a government report showing employers hired more workers last month than economists expected the dow jones industrial average fell 2 1 and the nasdaq composite lost 3 8 wall street is worried the federal reserve could see that as proof the economy has yet to slow enough to get inflation under control that could clear the way for the fed to continue hiking interest rates aggressively something that risks causing a recession if done too severely the employment situation is still good and that might be a little frustrating to the fed said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the fed thinks we need more people unemployed in order to make sure inflation comes down and stays down stocks have tumbled over 20 from records this year on worries about inflation interest rates and the possibility of a recession the major indexes managed to notch a gain for the week thanks to a powerful but short lived rally monday and tuesday after some investors squinted hard enough at some weaker than expected economic data to suggest the fed may take it easier on rate hikes but friday s jobs report may have dashed such hopes for a pivot by the fed it s a pattern that has been repeated several times this year for for a lot of this a year there really has been a degree of false optimism among many investors that the fed would would tap the brakes and pivot sooner than they ve been telling us they will for quite some time bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the market is increasingly coming to terms with albeit gradually that the fed is highly unlikely to pivot in the near term as some have been hoping for employers added 263 000 jobs last month that s a slowdown from the hiring pace of 315 000 in july but it s still more than the 250 000 that economists expected also discouraging for investors was that the unemployment rate improved partly for the wrong reasons among people who aren t working fewer than usual are actively looking for jobs that s a continuation of a longstanding trend that could keep upward pressure on wages and inflation we are not out of the woods yet but should be getting closer as the impact of aggressive policy starts to take hold said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors by hiking interest rates the fed is hoping to slow the economy and jobs market the plan is to starve inflation of the purchases needed to keep prices rising even further the fed has already seen some effects with higher mortgage rates hurting the housing industry in particular the risk is that if the fed goes too far it could squeeze the economy into a recession in the meantime higher rates push down on prices for stocks cryptocurrencies and other investments everything hinges on inflation at this point said peter essele head of portfolio management for commonwealth financial network we do think its going to moderate over the next few quarters altogether many investors see friday s jobs data keeping the fed on track to hike its overnight rate by three quarters of a percentage point next month it would be the fourth such increase which is triple the usual amount and bring the rate up to a range of 3 75 to 4 it started the year at virtually zero crude oil meanwhile had its biggest weekly gain since march benchmark u s crude jumped 4 7 to settle at 92 64 per barrel friday brent crude the international standard rose 3 7 to settle at 97 92 they ve shot higher because big oil producing countries have pledged to cut production in order to keep prices up that should keep the pressure up on inflation which is still near a four decade high but hopefully moderating the rise for crude helped stocks of

boise idaho u s officials are taking a big step involving a 1 200 mile 1 900 kilometer hiking trail stretching from the continental divide to the pacific ocean the u s forest service is accepting comments through oct 30 on a comprehensive plan for the pacific northwest national scenic trail which starts in glacier national park in montana crosses through northern idaho and finishes in olympic national park in washington the forest service wants to complete the plan by late 2023 it s a key document that will give state federal and tribal land managers a guide for developing the non motorized trail throughout its entire length currently about a third of the trail is on roads and some portions in remote areas require bushwhacking with no trail i love what it could be said jeff kish executive director for the pacific northwest trail association the bones are there but we still have to flesh it out the comprehensive plan he said gives us the opportunity to preserve what makes the trail so special the trail was first proposed and crossed in the 1970s with a handful of additional early adventurers making the trek in following years congress approved the trail as the pacific northwest national scenic trail in 2009 making it the 11th trail added to the national trails system that includes the pacific crest trail appalachian trail and continental divide trail kish who completed the pacific northwest national scenic trail in 2014 estimates that fewer than 1 000 hikers have finished the route that includes significant elevation gain and loss when going through mountainous areas in recent years he said about 75 people annually have attempted to complete the route though not all are able to finish completion and approval of the comprehensive plan and potential changes along the trail as a result could boost hiker numbers the plan would look at how many hikers the trail can handle and such things as locating campgrounds kish noted that currently many hikers might choose not to try the trail because so much of it is along roads the forest service will use the comments to develop a draft comprehensive plan and environmental assessment this winter that will be made public in the summer of 2023 the agency by december 2023 wants to sign a decision notice for the trail and implement the comprehensive plan the comments will also help the agency determine what type of experience hikers want trail conditions and future management portions of the hiking trail are also open to cycling and the use of pack and saddle animals according to the forest service the trail now includes 576 miles crossing land it manages 237 miles of private land 217 miles of national park service land and 89 miles of state land the private land poses a challenge because private land can change owners and landowners can cut off access about 700 miles of the trail are cross country on hiking trails or walking along beaches the trail uses 438 miles of existing road with 135 miles of that on paved roads but the road sections would have to be replaced with non motorized trails to meet the goals for a national scenic trail with a finished comprehensive plan land managers would have a document aiding in that process in northern idaho there s a 7 mile 11 kilometer gap where hikers have to bushwhack across forest service land and land managed by the idaho department of lands the comprehensive plan could also help with those types of areas among the objectives the forest service said in its scoping document for the comprehensive plan is to complete and maintain a non motorized trail along the entire length that will maximize the outdoor recreation potential of the pacific northwest trail by providing premier settings and a nationally significant opportunity for long distance hiking that complement or enhance opportunities for other compatible trail uses particularly pack and saddle stock use and bicycling where appropriate in all the trail crosses seven national forests three national parks and portions of the colville reservation and swinomish reservation in washington from the continental divide in montana hikers who manage to finish eventually end up on the beach in olympic national park you spend the summer walking west until you literally can t take one more step west kish said

by zhao yimeng china daily updated 2022 10 08 07 34 nation obeys international framework and contributes to global food security china has been participating in high seas squid fishing under a regulatory framework and its aquaculture industry has made increasing contributions to global food security according to a fishery expert chen xinjun dean of the college of marine sciences at shanghai ocean university made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor leonardo dicaprio that china is depleting its own fish stock and that chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep sea fishing particularly near ecuador affecting local fish stocks in the south american nation he said china in fact participates in high seas squid fishing under the framework of the south pacific regional fisheries management organization also known as sprfmo and keeps close contact with coastal countries including ecuador also china s squid fishing operates far from the galapagos marine reserve which is about 1 000 kilometers off ecuador s coast he said china is the world s biggest exporter of aquatic products in terms of trade value while the united states is the world s biggest importer according to the state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2022 a report published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2020 total aquaculture production in china hit 49 6 million metric tons excluding seaweed making the nation the biggest producer in the world and accounting for 56 7 percent of the global volume the report said the per capita of aquatic products owned by chinese people is double the world s average it added chen said by developing aquaculture china has not only met domestic consumption needs but has also supplied high quality products for the global market through exports making positive contributions to global food security in the south pacific china mainly fishes the humboldt squid which is currently the most productive species of cephalopods according to figures from the sprfmo the members of the organization participating in the squid fishery include peru chile ecuador south korea china and china s taiwan moreover china s ocean squid fishing is environmentally friendly chen said disputing allegations that china is engaged in using trawling nets which kill more fish than fishermen are allowed to china s squid fishing on the high seas of the south pacific is a clean operation that has very little impact on marine ecology compared with the trawling nets used by other members of sprfmo chen said the hooks chinese fishermen use are specially designed for squid fishing without the risk of bycatch that threatens protected species such as sea birds he added chen said that fishing operations are far from the galapagos marine reserve which has a smaller range inside ecuador s exclusive economic zone even if the chinese deep sea squid fishing vessels are operating on the high seas near the outer limits of the galapagos islands exclusive economic zone the distance from the protected area is still more than 150 nautical miles he said how could such great distances affect the galapagos islands marine reserve and its biodiversity rather china has been contributing to the conservation of aquaculture resources in the south pacific he stressed the country has been strictly implementing the sprfmo convention furthermore it has adopted more stringent management measures such as facilitating hourly reports of fishing boats positions and imposing fishing moratoriums for the past two years china has launched three month fishing moratoriums on the high seas in key fishing grounds including in the southeast pacific squid resources are improving demonstrating the initial effect of the moratorium according to the monitoring of a scientific research team at shanghai ocean university china s ocean fishery is focused on green sustainable development and is committed to scientific conservation of fishery resources he said zhaoyimeng chinadaily com cn

even as fentanyl overdoses among young people have skyrocketed in recent years health education remains optional in most california schools with some students receiving comprehensive education on the dangers of substance use and other students receiving scant if any instruction on the topic that is our no 1 complaint said dareen khatib co chair of the california health education community of practice a coalition of health educators from throughout california prevention is not always prioritized it s not consistent and it s not offered to all children i know there are schools out there that unfortunately offer very little or nothing in the way of health education only two thirds of middle and high schools in california offer a dedicated class in health education according to the california department of education and in most cases the course is optional unfortunately right now it s very siloed and piecemeal khatib said ideally we want every student in california to have access to this the state s health education framework includes substance use prevention for students of all ages starting with general lessons for the youngest students about the importance of putting healthy things in one s body and resisting peer pressure eventually leading to detailed lessons for older students on the effects of illicit drugs on adolescent brain development the idea is to connect health with life skills such as critical thinking decision making setting goals and developing positive relationships some districts hire outside instructors to teach units on drugs nicotine and alcohol and others weave the curriculum into biology or physical education classes some such as los angeles unified even stock naloxone a nasal spray used to prevent opioid overdoses on campuses and most districts have counselors who can help students struggling with substance use or refer them to outside agencies but in light of the surge in drug overdoses and deaths some parents and health educators say schools need to do much more more than 770 californians under age 24 died of fentanyl overdoses last year a 21 fold increase since 2016 even as overall drug use among teenagers has declined hospitalizations and deaths have soared driven largely by the prevalence of fentanyl a synthetic opioid that s more than 50 times stronger than morphine fentanyl overdoses accounted for more than 80 percent of all drug related deaths among california s young people in 2021 some of those victims sought out fentanyl for its potency but most ingested it accidentally thinking they were using something less dangerous a 15 year old girl in hollywood died at school last week after she took a percocet pill she likely did not know was laced with fentanyl fentanyl is my worst nightmare there s so much misinformation and there s such a deadly and immediate risk said stephan lambert prevention coordinator for the orange county department of education but schools can play an important role in fighting this providing nonthreatening nonjudgmental information to help students stay safe schools should respond to the needs of their local communities he said in areas with high rates of drug use for example schools should pay close attention to students needs students might be living with a parent who s struggling with addiction or illegal drugs are so commonplace that students are far more likely to be exposed at very young ages in california rates of drug use and overdoses vary widely across regions mendocino humboldt and san francisco counties for example have some of the state s highest rates of opioid related overdose deaths kern lake and butte counties had high rates of deaths related to methamphetamine and other psychostimulants affluent areas tend to have higher rates of alcohol and drug use among youth according to the california healthy kids survey a confidential anonymous survey the state department of education gives to students annually in marin county about half of 11th graders said they d used drugs or alcohol in the past month and 80 percent say drugs and alcohol are easy to obtain according to the most recent survey a 2020 report commissioned by the county health and human services department described it as an endemic problem in piedmont unified another wealthy enclave in the bay area drug and alcohol use among 11th graders neared 60 percent the state average is 19 percent an exception is redondo beach in los angeles county the coastal community south of santa monica has one of the state s lowest rates of youth drug and alcohol use possibly due to the school district s comprehensive health and drug and alcohol prevention program in redondo beach unified all seventh graders get 16 lessons on drugs and alcohol prevention and four booster lessons in eighth grade in ninth grade they learn more about the topic in biology class every thursday the district sends out emails with social emotional tips including information about avoiding drugs and alcohol the district regularly sends advice to parents and hosts information nights on the topic but perhaps most effective is the wellness center at redondo union high school staffed by five counselors the center offers daily help for students who want to quit drinking vaping smoking or engaging in other harmful behaviors or have been referred by their parents or teachers students can get substance use counseling individual or group therapy mental health support and other services with a focus on helping not punishing students our message is we don t want you to do drugs because your brains are still developing said rachel andrews a counselor at the school our goal is to get students to adulthood in the healthiest possible way which we know can reduce mental health problems later on help them go to college and launch careers and reach their goals the program appears to be working in the 2021 healthy kids survey only 18 percent of 11th graders said they d used alcohol or drugs in the past month about half the rate in comparable districts long beach unified recently expanded its substance use counseling services opening wellness centers at every middle and high school in the district the centers offer general social emotional support as well as referrals to outside agencies for help with drugs and alcohol use in addition the district offers comprehensive health education starting in kindergarten but for brenda villanueva a junior at long beach polytechnic high school even that s not enough too many students aren t getting the message that drugs can harm brain development and lead to other problems she s seen too many peers lives derailed by drug or alcohol use including a cousin whose substance use has caused a rift in their relationship she worries about him as well as the school environment her three younger sisters will face it s an issue she encounters almost daily she said i feel like a lot of people want help but they don t ask because they feel like they re going to be judged or punished she said schools need to be nonjudgmental and listen to students and give them help before suspending them at many schools punishment is interwoven with education about drugs possessing illegal drugs on campus is illegal under the california education code and some schools will suspend students after their second or third violation students are often referred to counselors after their first offense last year there were only 3 200 drug related suspensions in california schools making up about 20 percent of all suspensions righetti high school in santa maria is one of the rare schools that require students to take a health class which includes several units on drugs tobacco and alcohol to graduate the district also contracts with a local nonprofit called fighting back santa maria to provide further substance use education counseling and classes for students who need it the approach seems to be working drug and alcohol use in the district has been falling steadily with just 14 percent of students in 2021 saying they d used drugs or alcohol in the past month because it s anonymous and confidential the california healthy kids survey is generally an accurate reflection of actual substance use at a school according to the california department of education our message is that students should avoid it but we also look at the underlying issues that are leading them to take drugs or alcohol said eric blanco a counselor at righetti high do they need mental health support better coping skills does their family need support we try to look at everything for lauren koehler s stepdaughter kaitlin all it took was one bad day the bright outgoing 21 year old who aspired to be a counselor for abused women had not used drugs in two years when she fatally overdosed on fentanyl while visiting her grandmother near modesto in 2021 she might have known she was taking fentanyl koehler said but she definitely did not know it could kill her i understand kids are curious but i don t think they really get that this will take your life koehler said what s happening right now is horrifying people are dying it s destroying families lives our lives will never be the same comprehensive drug education in middle and high school might just might have saved her her stepmother said kaitlin had struggled with drug use and depression since she was 13 and her family has a history of addiction she had bounced around schools and might not have understood the risks of illicit drugs despite the interventions of her family koehler said in april

stocks lose more ground on fears a recession may be looming new york ap good news on the economy remains bad news for wall street as stocks fell sharply friday on worries a still strong u s jobs market may actually make a recession more likely the s p 500 ended 2 8 lower after briefly dropping 3 3 as traders weighed a government report showing employers hired more workers last month than economists expected the dow jones industrial average fell 2 1 and the nasdaq composite lost 3 8 wall street is worried the federal reserve could see that as proof the economy has yet to slow enough to get inflation under control that could clear the way for the fed to continue hiking interest rates aggressively something that risks causing a recession if done too severely the employment situation is still good and that might be a little frustrating to the fed said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the fed thinks we need more people unemployed in order to make sure inflation comes down and stays down stocks have tumbled over 20 from records this year on worries about inflation interest rates and the possibility of a recession the major indexes managed to notch a gain for the week thanks to a powerful but short lived rally monday and tuesday after some investors squinted hard enough at some weaker than expected economic data to suggest the fed may take it easier on rate hikes but friday s jobs report may have dashed such hopes for a pivot by the fed it s a pattern that has been repeated several times this year for for a lot of this a year there really has been a degree of false optimism among many investors that the fed would would tap the brakes and pivot sooner than they ve been telling us they will for quite some time bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the market is increasingly coming to terms with albeit gradually that the fed is highly unlikely to pivot in the near term as some have been hoping for employers added 263 000 jobs last month that s a slowdown from the hiring pace of 315 000 in july but it s still more than the 250 000 that economists expected also discouraging for investors was that the unemployment rate improved partly for the wrong reasons among people who aren t working fewer than usual are actively looking for jobs that s a continuation of a longstanding trend that could keep upward pressure on wages and inflation we are not out of the woods yet but should be getting closer as the impact of aggressive policy starts to take hold said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors by hiking interest rates the fed is hoping to slow the economy and jobs market the plan is to starve inflation of the purchases needed to keep prices rising even further the fed has already seen some effects with higher mortgage rates hurting the housing industry in particular the risk is that if the fed goes too far it could squeeze the economy into a recession in the meantime higher rates push down on prices for stocks cryptocurrencies and other investments everything hinges on inflation at this point said peter essele head of portfolio management for commonwealth financial network we do think its going to moderate over the next few quarters altogether many investors see friday s jobs data keeping the fed on track to hike its overnight rate by three quarters of a percentage point next month it would be the fourth such increase which is triple the usual amount and bring the rate up to a range of 3 75 to 4 it started the year at virtually zero crude oil meanwhile had its biggest weekly gain since march benchmark u s crude jumped 4 7 to settle at 92 64 per barrel friday brent crude the international standard rose 3 7 to settle at 97 92 they ve shot higher because big oil producing countries have pledged to cut production in order to keep prices up that should keep the pressure up on inflation which is still near a

the yield on the 10 year treasury which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans climbed to 3 88 from 3 83 late thursday the two year yield which more closely tracks expectations for fed action

article america s employers slowed their hiring in september but still added 263 000 jobs a solid figure that will likely keep the federal reserve on pace to keep raising interest rates aggressively to fight persistently high inflation friday s government report showed that hiring fell from 315 000 in august to the weakest monthly gain since april 2021 the unemployment rate dropped from 3 7 to 3 5 matching a half century low the fed is hoping that a slower pace of hiring would eventually mean less pressure on employers to raise pay and pass those costs on to their customers through price increases a recipe for high inflation but september s job growth was likely too robust to satisfy the central bank s inflation fighters last month hourly wages rose 5 from a year earlier the slowest year over year pace since december but still hotter than the fed would want the proportion of americans who either have a job or are looking for one slipped slightly a disappointment for those hoping that more people would enter the labor force and help ease worker shortages and upward pressure on wages the jobs report was still likely too strong to allow fed policymakers much breathing room said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors likewise rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics said she didn t think september s softer jobs and wage numbers would stop the fed from raising its benchmark short term rate in november by an unusually large three quarters of a point for a fourth consecutive time and by an additional half point in december on wall street stocks tumbled friday morning a sign that investors foresee more aggressive fed rate hikes ahead the s p 500 index sank 1 9 in early trading and the yield on the 2 year treasury note which tends to track expectations for fed actions rose to 4 31 from 4 26 late thursday the public anxiety that has arisen over high prices and the prospect of a recession is also carrying political consequences as president joe biden s democratic party struggles to maintain control of congress in november s midterm elections in its epic battle to rein in inflation the fed has raised its benchmark interest rate five times this year it is aiming to slow economic growth enough to reduce annual price increases back toward its 2 target it has a long way to go in august one key measure of year over year inflation the consumer price index amounted to 8 3 and for now consumer spending the primary driver of the u s economy is showing resilience in august consumers spent a bit more than in july a sign that the economy was holding up despite rising borrowing rates violent swings in the stock market and inflated prices for food rent and other essentials fed chair jerome powell has warned bluntly that the inflation fight will bring some pain notably in the form of layoffs and higher unemployment some economists remain hopeful that despite the persistent inflation pressures the fed will still manage to achieve a so called soft landing slowing growth enough to tame inflation without going so far as to tip the economy into recession it s a notoriously difficult task and the fed is trying to accomplish it at a perilous time the global economy weakened by food shortages and surging energy prices resulting from russia s war against ukraine may be on the brink of recession kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund warned thursday that the imf is downgrading its estimates for world economic growth by 4 trillion through 2026 and that things are more likely to get worse before it gets better powell and his colleagues on the fed s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs there s currently an average of 1 7 openings for every unemployed american will steadily decline some encouraging news came this week when the labor department reported that job openings fell by 1 1 million in august to 10 1 million the fewest since june 2021 on the other hand by any standard of history openings remain extraordinarily high in records dating to 2000 they had never topped 10 million in a month until last year last month s decline in unemployment was widely shared across demographic groups the jobless rate for hispanics tumbled to 3 8 the lowest level in government records dating to 1973 unemployment for black americans also fell from 6 in august to 5 8 in september still above its record low of 5 1 in november 2019 in september restaurants and bars added 60 000 jobs as did healthcare companies state and local governments cut 27 000 jobs retailers transportation and warehouse companies reduced employment modestly many americans appear to have decided that there are still plenty of jobs available and that they can take their time accepting one among them is jenny savitscus of columbus ohio who recently earned a technology certificate at a program run by goodwill savitscus 45 who d like a job in high technology said she s willing to hold out for an employer that will offer flexible hours and work at home options there are opportunities out there she said employers and job seekers are trying to find the right balance between work and home life she said she can afford to wait for just the right position because she has two part time teaching jobs friday s government report underscored how resilient the job market remains even if it may be slowing the u s labor market continues to decelerate but there are no signs that it s stalling out said nick bunker head of economic research at the indeed hiring lab payroll growth is no longer at the jet speed we saw last year but employment is still growing quickly radial a company that powers the online businesses for lucky brands tommy hilfiger and calvin klein is one employer that is hiring more cautiously the company plans to hire 15 000 seasonal workers at its 25 warehouses 7 000 fewer than a year ago and 2 000 at its customer service centers said sabrina wnorowski chief human resource officer for radial based in king of prussia pennsylvania wnorowski said the company s more moderate approach to hiring reflects a renewed focus on adding workers closer to the peak of the holiday season to make them more productive she noted that online sales growth is slowing and that the tight job market appears to be weakening a bit peloton for example the maker of high end exercise equipment announced thursday that it is cutting 500 jobs 12 of its workforce yet some companies continue to plow ahead with hiring walt rowen

sun lijun and fu zhenghua formerly powerful ministers in china s state security apparatus have been sentenced to death with a two year reprieve for corruption and other crimes such sentences are typically commuted to life in prison without parole the timing of the verdicts and the allegation that sun led a political clique that was disloyal to xi jinping place the two cases squarely in the shadow of the upcoming 20th party congress which opens later this month a host of less senior police chiefs were also convicted in connection with sun and fu s cases the associated press reported on sun s sentencing sun was convicted by the court in the northeastern city of changchun of collecting 646 million yuan 91 million in bribes china central tv reported on its website sun was charged with using his official position in 2018 to manipulate stock trading to help a trader avoid losses he also was accused of selling official jobs and abandoning his post during the covid 19 outbreak the ruling party s anti corruption agency accused sun last year of having extremely inflated political ambition it said he engaged in unspecified superstitious activities in a state produced anti graft documentary released earlier this year sun who was behind bars at the time recalled receiving annual gifts of boxed seafood from a provincial official which were actually filled with 300 000 in cash totalling 15 million over the years sun was also involved in corruption in the united states earlier this year the justice department sued casino mogul steven wynn alleging that he has acted as a foreign agent for the chinese government sun allegedly lobbied him to call for billionaire guo wengui s placement on a no fly list in 2017 guo wengui leveled unverified claims of corruption against sun and others a host of other officials have fallen alongside sun accused of participating in his clique at the south china morning post william zheng reported on former minister of justice fu zhenghua s sentencing fu was convicted of accepting 117 million yuan us 16 6 million in bribes and using his position to cover up his brother s crimes cctv reported wang was found guilty of accepting more than 440 million yuan in bribes and for covering up triad activities and forging identity documents the court said fu zhenghua had admitted all charges shown remorse and provided information to investigators on other corruption cases but it said there would be no further commutation or parole granted after fu s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment following the two year reprieve due to the serious harm caused to the country and society the court described the bribes received by fu as particularly large the circumstances of his crimes as particularly serious and their social impact particularly severe the central commission for discipline inspection the party s anti corruption watchdog said fu had lost his party spirit and principles and accused fu of colluding with sun the former vice minister of public security who in july pleaded guilty to taking bribes manipulating the securities market and illegal possession of firearms the former police chiefs of shanghai chongqing and shanxi province were also convicted on corruption charges and accused of colluding with sun lijun state media labeled them two faced people liu yanping who led the party s anti graft arm within the ministry of state security was expelled from the party in september for his alleged involvement with sun his expulsion paves the way for a lengthy prison sentence wan like the provincial official who gifted sun the boxes of seafood mentioned above was also convicted of corruption and handed a suspended death sentence xi has warned that the stubbornness and danger of corruption has not subsided despite the decade long campaign against it yet the extraordinary raft of corruption charges tied to an alleged political clique do not appear to be simply a matter of graft at the financial times edward white interviewed experts on chinese politics about the political implications of the latest corruption crackdown this clearly was a warning against overt acts of factionalism and disobeying xi jinping diktats in the run up to the 20th party congress and beyond said victor shih professor of chinese political economy at the university of california san diego yuen yuen ang an expert on china s political economy at the university of michigan said it was hard to believe the latest cases were routine given the sensitivity of the timing sometimes corruption crackdowns are about curtailing graft and other times they are a political instrument she said as leninist regimes are ruled by man not laws any new leader overwhelmingly must rely on a purge of his rivals and promotion of loyalists within the regime to consolidate power and to implement his programmes said wu guoguang ironically fu zhenghua s sentencing coincided with the release of his former law school classmate zhou shifeng a human rights lawyer imprisoned for seven years on charges of subversion zhou was one of 300 lawyers arrested as part of the 2015 709 crackdown on human rights lawyers wang quanzhang zhou s friend and a former human rights lawyer also imprisoned in the crackdown spoke with zhou and relayed his comments to the south china morning post zhou reckons that the 709 crackdown is a major historical political and legal event lawyers and human rights defenders involved in this event are important contributors in the history of the rule of law and human rights protection in china wang added that zhou greeted fu conviction with relief

missoula mt kgvo am news with the startling announcement this week that opec will cut oil production by two million barrels a day the price of gas will rise to an undetermined level in the coming weeks and months kgvo reached out to patrick dehaan oil analyst for gas buddy who delivered the bad news for all missoula and montana consumers it s been an aggressive jump in prices and much of that is due to the market learning about the opec decision to cut oil production said dehaan and so very quickly the price of oil has escalated significantly and that s driven up gas prices in your neck of the woods and unfortunately i don t expect it to go a whole lot better anytime soon really dehaan said the move by opec is already affecting prices around the entire globe with opec cutting production that s going to push up the price of gasoline around the world by the tune of 10 to 30 cents a gallon here in the u s and potentially more abroad as the u s dollar continues to strengthen he said so certainly at a time when global inventories of oil remain tight it s rather surprising that opec pushed forward with this production cut as global inventories have continued to be depleted after president biden specifically called on opec to boost production dehaan said it was a slap in the face to the biden administration to do the exact opposite get our free mobile app get our free mobile app well certainly seems a little bit more political in the timing he said president biden had having gone over to saudi arabia and the middle east and called on opec to increase production and then for them to do the exact opposite does feel political but only opec would know oil prices going up is good for the oil industry it likely will mean that they boost production if oil prices remain elevated oil stocks would likely do better because oil producers are still producing in the u s the same amount of oil they were before so for u s producers opec which controls a third of the world s oil supply cutting production is good news to them the big question everyone is asking is will gas prices spike at over five dollars a gallon as they did earlier in the year i certainly don t think we will see any record prices he said summer is over and demand is down while opec has cut production i don t necessarily think that we re going to see anything near record territory like we did earlier this year now having said that prices have moved up in montana already we re back over 4 00 a gallon and the average is 4 03 a week ago it was 3 94 so prices are up almost 10 cents in the last week we could see another 10 to 20 cent increase and that s primarily due to the opec production cut pushing oil prices up closer to home in missoula prices range from 4 09 to about 4 19 at most stations but that could increase here another 10 to 20 cents over the next couple of weeks dehaan said costco will always have the lowest prices due to their club membership advantage look see how much gasoline cost the year you started driving to find out more about how has the price of gas changed throughout the years stacker ran the numbers on the cost of a gallon of gasoline for each of the last 84 years using data from the bureau of labor statistics released in april 2020 we analyzed the average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline from 1976 to 2020 along with the consumer price index cpi for unleaded regular gasoline from 1937 to 1976 including the absolute and inflation adjusted prices for each year read on to explore the cost of gas over time and rediscover just how much a gallon was when you first started driving

if the squabbling ever stops over elon musk s renewed bid to buy twitter experts say he still faces a huge obstacle to closing the 44 billion deal keeping his financing in place earlier this week musk reversed course and said he d go through with acquiring the social media company under the same terms he agreed to in april but after months of tweetstorms and legal barbs there are scars and suspicions on both sides experts say that behind the scenes banks could be scrambling to find buyers for 12 5 billion in debt from the deal and musk is trying to hold together a group of equity investors that is pitching in billions more the erratic billionaire is on the hook for the rest get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters the fighting continued thursday when musk s attorneys said twitter is refusing to accept his revived bid to buy the company they sought to delay an upcoming trial on twitter s lawsuit that could force him to complete the deal but twitter s attorneys said it s musk who is holding everything up and his effort to put the trial on hold is an invitation to further mischief and delay in the end a judge agreed to give musk more time to close the deal but said the trial will go ahead in november if he doesn t musk is even more on the hook to complete the deal than he was in april because he s now made the commitment to a judge not just twitter that he has the financing and just needs more time said zohar goshen a law professor at columbia university now the judge is in a position to say fair or not fair i don t care you bring the money goshen said but with so much at play here s what could throw the deal off track again bank financing a group of banks including morgan stanley and bank of america signed on to loan 12 5 billion of the money musk needs for the deal in thursday s court motion musk alleges that twitter doesn t want to set the lawsuit aside because of a baseless fear that musk could fail to get the bank financing no such failure has occurred to date the motion said counsel for the debt financing parties has advised that each of their clients is prepared to honor its obligations the banks are essentially cemented to the deal by solid contracts wedbush analyst dan ives said but the debt market has changed dramatically since april the stock market has tumbled inflation is high and interest rates are up as the federal reserve tries to slow the economy banks would sell the debt to institutional investors but there s not much appetite now to take part in takeovers that saddle companies with big debts banks could be on the hook to make loans themselves the banks would be really happy to not to have to take the risk of funding these loans said erik gordon a law and business professor at the university of michigan the agreements seem to be very strong but i think the banks have their lawyers pulling all nighters trying to get them out of it if they can elon musk announced thursday morning that he wants to buy twitter what would his purchase of the social media platform mean for our society and what does it say about the growing power and influence of the billionaire class in our world equity investors investors who would get equity in twitter are supposed to kick in billions ives estimates they had agreed to 15 billion to 16 billion but some investors may be skittish about staying in given the market changes and musk s repeated accusations against twitter about the number of bots on the platform qatar s sovereign wealth fund declined comment this week on the 375 million its subsidiary pledged in may several other investors didn t respond to requests for comment on whether they were still chipping in musk s equity commitments including 1 billion from musk s friend and oracle co founder larry ellison are on shakier ground if any in that diverse group of backers have changed their minds said kevin kaiser an adjunct finance professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school nobody knows i don t know anyway what their commitment is kaiser said so are they able to back out because if they re able to back out he is on the hook musk s money musk the world s richest person with a net worth of 231 billion according to forbes has to kick in his own money but just how much depends on how many equity investors stay in most of his wealth is tied up in stock of the electric car company that he runs tesla inc since april he has sold more than 15 billion worth of tesla stock presumably to pay his share if any equity investors drop out though musk will either have to replace them or throw in more money fueling speculation that he might have to sell more tesla shares musk s share of the original

as developing countries confront a new era of elevated inflation rising interest rates a stronger dollar and capital outflows some governments stand to benefit from a little noticed bonanza during the great moderation that preceded the covid 19 pandemic years of low inflation led to the growth of sovereign debt issued at fixed interest rates and long maturities now two years of unexpected inflation in the united states have effectively diluted this debt according to our calculations the us government s own inflation windfall is substantial in october 2019 the international monetary fund s world economic outlook forecast that us inflation would be 2 4 in 2021 and 2 3 in 2022 but us inflation clocked in at 4 7 in 2021 and the imf now expects a rate of 7 7 this year the size of what we call the unexpected inflation shock over 2021 22 is thus 7 7 the sum of the actual inflation rates minus the projected rates under such conditions the biggest winner will be the largest issuer of dollar debt uncle sam at the end of 2020 the us government s long term fixed rate debt was nearly 21tn and the us monetary base which includes the amount of currency in circulation was about 5 2tn while the full brunt of 2021 22 inflation 12 4 falls on the monetary base its unexpected component 7 7 reduces the value of the us government s debt because debt holders are compensated with interest for expected inflation the us treasury thus nets an enormous 2tn reduction nearly 11 of gdp in the real value of its 26tn in inflation exposed liabilities netting out the us federal reserve s holdings of long term treasuries brings the figure down to 9 of gdp according to the conventional wisdom it is primarily developing countries that resort to inflating away their debts but the current period of high us inflation serves as a reminder that developed countries have also often relied on unconventional strategies like the inflation tax to deal with their liabilities long term us treasury securities totalling about 6 6tn are held by foreign entities such as central banks and pension funds and the fed estimates that nearly 1tn of dollar cash is also held by non residents by diminishing the real value of these holdings high us inflation has essentially transferred 568bn to the us government from non residents meaning that about one quarter of the us inflation tax over the last two years has been paid abroad two of the biggest holders of long term us treasuries are japan 1 2tn and china 862bn which together have paid for nearly one third of the gains to the us aside from china and large cash holders like argentina which is losing an amount equal to 3 of gdp owing to the reduced value of dollar cash held by residents most of the biggest inflation tax payers abroad are developed economies but america is not the only winner many emerging markets are also benefiting because a significant chunk of their debt is issued in dollars since foreign investors have been unwilling to bear the risk that governments will try to dilute the real value of their obligations by printing money and sparking inflation many governments have tied their own hands by issuing dollar denominated debt bondholders were thus able to assure themselves that inflation in the domestic currency would not adversely affect the value of their holdings or so they thought the theory of relative purchasing power parity tells us that all countries nominal gdp when measured in us dollars will eventually grow at the rate of us inflation high inflation in the us thus means that the real burden of dollar denominated debt will decline netting a substantial gain to other sovereigns excluding the us total outstanding dollar denominated long term fixed rate debt in 2021 was 1 3tn according to the bank for international settlements thus to obtain a conservative estimate of the size of the gain to non us governments conservative because us inflation might exceed forecasts or persist beyond this year we can apply 7 7 of unexpected inflation to the 1 3tn implying savings of roughly 100bn owing to the dilution of their debt turkey indonesia mexico saudi arabia and brazil each effectively get a one time transfer that exceeds 4bn at the expense of their creditors other big winners in relative terms include developing countries like lebanon venezuela jamaica and mongolia whose governments similarly benefit to the tune of 2 of gdp or more to be sure these astronomical sums will cause creditors to demand higher rates of interest on new debt issues but higher interest rates do not affect the plummeting real value of the existing stock of long term debt for some countries the effect of this transfer may also take time to be felt because the dollar has recently strengthened relative to other currencies but the recent inflation shock in the us is a monetary shock implying that nominal exchange rates will eventually move with the inflation differential across countries in line with the theory of relative purchasing power parity once they do the gdp of other countries when measured in dollars will also grow at the us inflation rate ensuring that the real burden of sovereign debt falls commentaries on the perils facing developing countries tend to focus on the risks posed by higher interest rates and depreciating currencies for governments however us inflation also comes with a silver lining bondholders pay the price while inflation whittles away a towering stock of sovereign debt project syndicate gautam nair is assistant professor of public policy at harvard university s

when it was announced on september 13 that the consumer price index a key measure of inflation in the united states had increased more than expected in august stock prices plunged and the us dollar appreciated sharply markets knew that this would spur the us federal reserve to announce another significant interest rate hike and that is exactly what happened but the pain of monetary tightening is just beginning the fed is not alone in raising interest rates soaring inflation which has reached double digits in the european union and the united kingdom has spurred the european central bank and the bank of england to do the same though many economists still accuse all three monetary authorities of being behind the curve central banks in indonesia south korea and thailand also raised their policy rates by 25 basis points and the philippine central bank by 50 basis points in august inflation stood at 7 9 in thailand 6 3 in the philippines 5 7 in south korea and 4 7 in indonesia the same month one asian economy that is not struggling with skyrocketing prices is china with inflation running at 2 5 the central bank lowered its key interest rates last month for china the bigger challenge and the main reason inflation has not spiked is slumping economic growth largely owing to the government s zero covid policy the slowdown is putting the overleveraged real estate market under severe pressure then there is japan after years of below target inflation and even deflation rising energy and food prices drove up core consumer inflation to 2 8 in august the fastest annual increase in eight years but if one excludes fresh food and energy the inflation rate was just 1 6 in august still below the 2 target this explains why the bank of japan boj has yet to abandon negative interest rates the overnight interbank rate remains at 0 1 or yield curve control capping the ten year bond rate at 0 25 as the interest rate differential between japan and the us has increased so has the yen dollar exchange rate swung sharply toward yen depreciation with the yen having depreciated by almost 30 in the last 12 months the dollar exchange rate now stands at around 144 a level last seen in 1998 during the asian financial crisis japan cannot maintain loose monetary policy forever in fact it should already be preparing for tightening and interest rate hikes are not the only way to pursue this objective central banks can also shrink their balance sheets which have expanded significantly since the 2008 global financial crisis when monetary authorities began purchasing huge amounts of long term bonds under their quantitative easing qe programmes one means of achieving this is to let maturing bonds roll off balance sheets rather than reinvesting them there is a risk here before a central bank has cleared its balance sheet of enough long term bonds rapidly rising interest rates will reduce the bonds mark to market value even as the liability value remains unchanged this could push a central bank into technical insolvency with the mark to market liability value exceeding the mark to market asset value by more than the sum of capital and any buffer accumulated retained earnings japan may be particularly vulnerable on this front given that it has long maintained a near zero long term interest rate the average maturity of bonds on the asset side of the boj s balance sheet is estimated to be 6 5 years and their average return is extremely low yet in reality a technical insolvency would be a non event unrealised losses are not a problem for a central bank that almost always holds bonds to maturity but central banks may confront another problem as they raise interest rates a central bank earns its revenues from the interest on its assets mainly government bills and bonds and pays interest on remunerated reserves the fed started to pay interest on excess reserves in october 2008 owing to its balance sheet expansion the boj followed suit the next month this was not a problem at the time because the interest paid on reserves is basically equal to the policy rate which has been near zero while interest rates for treasury bills and bonds or japanese government bonds have been positive albeit trending downward the interest differential between the asset and liability sides earned the central banks large profits known as seigniorage which are transferred to the government large and rapid interest rate hikes cut into these profits as the interest paid on the liability side rises in line with policy rates but most treasuries have fixed rates if policymakers are not careful interest payments can exceed revenues and even consume any buffers the central bank may be holding the result is so called negative seigniorage which requires the government to provide subsidies to the central bank which could pose a political problem for the boj to avoid negative seigniorage it must not rush the roll off process moreover it must allow the long term interest rate to rise by lifting the cap on 10 year bonds before moving slowly to raise the policy rate the question is whether economic and financial developments over the next few years will allow for this approach when central banks launched qe the risks of technical insolvency and negative seigniorage were widely recognised but governments stood behind monetary authorities the fed s balance sheet was supposed to be backed by an implicit government guarantee the uk government s guarantee was more explicit and japan s government allowed the boj to accumulate retained earnings as monetary tightening progresses however these commitments might be tested crucially if negative seigniorage does arise governments must refrain from turning it into a political issue project syndicate
