democratic lawmakers are acknowledging that rising inflation is becoming a significant political problem that is adding to the difficulty of reviving president biden s agenda senate democrats are discussing the possibility of trying to resuscitate the build back better act or major parts of it as soon as next month but that timeline is now in more doubt than ever after a new report showed that inflation is rising faster than expected the bureau of labor statistics reported thursday that prices have risen 7 5 percent over the past year and 0 6 percent from december to january exceeding expectations that annual inflation and month to month inflation would come in at 7 2 percent and 0 4 percent respectively the price indexes for food and energy rose at an even faster clip 0 9 percent sen joe manchin d w va on thursday said the latest numbers are all the more reason democrats shouldn t turn back to the negotiations over biden s build back better agenda anytime soon right now inflation should get everyone high alert he told reporters before a vote the market can t handle it you can t keep throwing fuel on the fire you just can t do it asked to confirm whether he s informed colleagues that he doesn t want to return to negotiations over build back better he said i ve been very clear about everything other senate democrats acknowledge that rising inflation is becoming a bigger political problem that doesn t bode well for biden s plan to pass another spending package that would be well in excess of 1 trillion clearly we d like to see that go down i think the fed s got to act said sen mark warner d va as for what inflation means for build back better he replied nothing comes easy obviously the inflation numbers don t make it easier he added sen jon tester d mont said the possibility of dramatically shrinking the size of biden s climate and infrastructure spending package is always on the table to respond to inflation fears but he also pointed out that might not be necessary if democrats can successfully make the case that build back better will address inflation by helping middle income americans lower their costs there are things that can help reduce inflation in bbb childcare housing those kind of things but i do think we need to look at it from how we can help reduce costs for families he said anytime you have inflation numbers that are high that s an issue we need to take seriously he said rising inflation has also fueled talk among centrist democrats about setting aside a portion of the money raised by tax increases on deficit reduction instead of using it to spend on new social programs i think it would be a good idea to cut the deficit tester told reporters on tuesday senate republicans see rising prices as a major issue heading into the midterm elections that will help their candidates and hurt democrats it turns out inflation this past year hasn t been seven percent it s been seven and a half percent in other words if you haven t personally gotten a pay raise of eight percent or more in the last year then democrats policies have given you a pay cut senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky said on the senate floor in a sign that vulnerable democrats are feeling pressure to respond to surging prices sens maggie hassan d n h and mark kelly d ariz on thursday announced a proposal to suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year that would knock 18 4 cents off the cost of a gallon of gas until january sen catherine cortez masto d who also faces a tough race in nevada cosponsored the legislation i m committed to finding solutions that bring our families some much needed relief at the pump and help them get ahead she said in a statement cortez masto was peppered by questions from reporters after lunchtime thursday about whether build back better would add to inflation she argued that build back better couldn t be blamed for the latest numbers because it didn t pass and instead pointed to the pandemic that we re dealing with right now and supply chain issues asked if she saw build back better as something that could fuel more inflation she asserted there are some anti inflationary measures in that citing the compromise to lower some prescription drug costs sen tim kaine d va said the latest inflation reading will put pressure on democrats to limit whatever package they advance to proposals that will lower the cost of living for average americans such as a proposal to empower medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices something that biden touted thursday at an appearance in culpepper va i think it will pass in a pared down version he said he said the legislation will likely include provisions addressing climate change a scaled down proposal to lower prescription drug costs funding for expanded access to childcare and pre kindergarten and workforce development funding he said the rising inflation numbers impacts the content of the bill that may shape what makes the final cut he added the items that really have cost reduction capacity on the things that really hit people s pocketbooks are probably going to rise to the top of the to do list that makes it all but impossible to include a proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on state and local tax deductions a top priority of senate majority leader charles schumer d n y and house members from new york and new jersey democratic senators say kaine said the proposal to raise the salt cap has never been my priority biden argued during a visit to virginia s 7th congressional district which is represented by vulnerable rep abigail spanberger d that his climate and social spending agenda would bring down the cost for average families and he insisted that it will not increase the debt but claims by the white house and democratic leaders that build back better will lessen the impact of inflation isn t persuading manchin who has repeatedly warned about the impact of rising prices on middle class and lower income families in his state manchin in a statement thursday warned that inflation is draining the hard earned wages of every american and it s causing real and severe economic pain that can no longer be ignored we all have a responsibly to do all that is possible to roll back inflation and manage our debts because the longer we or the federal reserve waits to act the more economic pain will be caused he said

washington inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades hammering american consumers wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the federal reserve s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy the labor department said thursday that consumer prices jumped 7 5 percent last month compared with a year earlier the steepest year over year increase since february 1982 when measured from december to january inflation was 0 6 percent the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected prices rose 0 7 percent from october to november and 0 9 percent from september to october shortages of supplies and workers heavy doses of federal aid ultra low interest rates and robust consumer spending combined to send inflation leaping in the past year and there are few signs that it will slow significantly anytime soon wages are rising at the fastest pace in at least 20 years which can pressure companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs ports and warehouses are overwhelmed with hundreds of workers at the ports of los angeles and long beach the nation s busiest out sick last month many products and parts remain in short supply as a result the latest inflation data suggested to some economists that the fed could raise its key rate in march by one half a percentage point rather than its typical quarter point hike advertisement james bullard the president of the st louis federal reserve bank told bloomberg news that he supported a sharp increase of a full percentage point in the benchmark short term interest rate by july over time higher rates will raise the costs for a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto and business loans that could cool spending and inflation but for the fed the decision to steadily tighten credit could also trigger another recession federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled two weeks ago that the central bank would likely raise its benchmark short term rate multiple times this year stock prices declined after the inflation report was released and fell further after bullard s remarks the broad s p 500 index fell 1 3 percent in afternoon trading the yield on the 10 year bond jumped to 2 03 percent a sign that investors see more fed rate hikes ahead prices for a broad range of goods and services accelerated from december to january and not just for items directly affected by the pandemic apartment rental costs rose 0 5 percent in january the fastest pace in 20 years electricity prices surged 4 2 percent in january alone the sharpest rise in 15 years and are up 10 7 percent from a year earlier last month household furniture and supplies rose 1 6 percent the largest one month increase on records dating to 1967 food costs driven by pricier eggs cereal and dairy products increased 0 9 percent in january new car prices which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips were unchanged last month but are up 12 2 percent from a year ago the surge in new car prices has in turn accelerated used car prices they rose 1 5 percent in january and are up a dizzying 41 percent from a year ago advertisement just as price pressures in some areas ease inflation in other parts of the economy is picking up said sarah house an economist at wells fargo the upshot is that inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high the steady rise in prices has left many americans less able to afford food gas rent child care and other necessities more broadly inflation has emerged as the biggest risk factor for the economy and as a serious threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats as midterm elections loom later this year among the americans who are struggling with pricier food and gas is courtney luckey who has changed her shopping habits and taken on additional work shifts at a grocery store in charlotte north carolina where she lives luckey 33 used to be able to fill up a grocery cart for 100 now she said 100 barely fills half the cart tomatoes have reached nearly 5 a pound which i think is ridiculous luckey has switched to canned tomatoes and has begun using coupons for family dollar and food lion to help pay bills she s also picked up more hours at a harris teeter grocery store but the store is 30 minutes from her house so she s had to spend more on gas all her forced additional spending has caused luckey to pull back on the family activities such as bowling with her daughter her brother and his two sons those outings now typically happen once a month rather than every week or two advertisement in the past year sharp increases in the costs of gas food autos and furniture have upended many other americans budgets too in december economists at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school estimated that the average household had to spend 3 500 more than in 2020 to buy an identical basket of goods and services small businesses have also struggled to deal with higher costs for supplies and labor julio ortiz the owner of gaspachos which sells fruit cups smoothies and coffee in sacramento said he had to raise prices by about 6 percent on average in november for some items prices rose 10 percent we ve seen a spike in pricing for fruits vegetables cups and plates he said his company uses compostable packaging but much of it comes from overseas and has been stuck on ships that haven t been unloaded even excluding volatile food and energy prices so called core inflation jumped 0 6 percent from december to january and 6 percent from a year ago many large corporations in conference calls with investors have said they expect supply shortages to persist until at least the second half of this year advertisement chipotle said it s increased menu prices 10 percent to offset the rising costs of beef and transportation as well as higher employee wages and the restaurant chain said it will consider further price increases if inflation keeps rising we keep thinking that beef is going to level up and then go down and it just hasn t happened yet said john hartung the company s chief financial officer executives at chipotle as well as at starbucks and some other consumer facing companies have said their customers so far don t seem fazed by the higher prices levi strauss co raised prices last year by roughly 7 percent above 2019 levels because of rising costs

business development ramps on strength of new freeform optics and other new product platforms for lidar ar vr and space applications orlando fl accesswire february 10 2022 lightpath technologies inc nasdaq lpth lightpath the company or we a vertically integrated provider of engineered solutions for the global photonics industry today announced financial results for its fiscal 2022 second quarter ended december 31 2021 management overview technology highlights commenting on the second quarter of fiscal 2022 lightpath s president and chief executive officer sam rubin stated the company s performance in the second quarter demonstrated significant progress in the expansion of our product portfolio and business development pipeline as we implement our new strategic direction at the same time we are delivering with operational discipline as we invest in growth opportunities while our financial recovery takes longer than anticipated following the leadership transition of our business in china our new strategic plan which we began implementing approximately one year ago is delivering the intended results with the company transforming itself into a leading global provider of engineered solutions with a highly differentiated product platform serving as the foundation for the new lightpath during the second quarter our business development pipeline throttled forward on the strength of our new freeform optics and other technological innovations since introducing freeform optics in october 2021 we have been engaged in an increasing number of opportunities for the development of custom solutions which include non recurring engineering nre revenue and other programs which could lead to valuable volume production orders at present we have a total of 8 such high volume projects in development or going through the customer qualification process this is an increase of 5 projects during the second quarter with each of these opportunities ranging from 1 million to 5 million in potential annual revenue and staggered start dates over the next 24 months aided by the substantial completion of investments in manufacturing coating and finishing that are integral to our strategic plan we are excited for what may materialize for growth in revenues and profitability recent activities supporting lightpath s continued focus on growth innovation and value added engineering included new freeform optics gaining traction within ar vr lidar and defense markets increasing number of engagements including the initiation of number of nre projects for the development of new custom freeform optics and assemblies large projects increased to 8 from 3 during the second quarter won the prestigious 2022 spie prism award for developing manufacturing technology for freeform optics secured exclusive optical usage license for the infrared patent portfolio from the united states navy s u s naval research laboratory nrl to access several multi billion dollar markets including infrared imaging and multispectral imaging received funding by european space agency to commercialize materials for use in space awarded renewal of annual supply agreement valued at over 4 2 million for commercial ir vision lens elements completed coating operations expansion in riga facility with volume production underway workforce realignment toward strategic focus on higher value longer term engineered solutions programs and customer relationships m a strategy on course to supplement engineered solutions fiscal 2022 first quarter highlights revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 of 9 2 million total backlog at december 31 2021 of 21 9 million net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 1 1 million which includes additional expenses associated with the management changes in chinese subsidiaries ebitda for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was a loss of 41 000 cash and cash equivalents of 5 1 million as of december 31 2021 total debt including finance leases of 4 7 million as of december 31 2021 capital expenditures of 118 000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 insiders execute open market purchases of class a common shares during quarter ended december 31 2021 this press release includes references to non gaap financial measures please see the heading use of non gaap financial measures below for a more complete explanation additional management comments mr rubin s comments continued lightpath s second quarter financial results were negatively impacted by expenses associated with the management and employee transition in our chinese subsidiaries and the significant decrease in orders from a key telecommunications customer in china which was unrelated to the management transition having rebuilt our management and sales leadership team in china over the past two quarters we are contending with economic and pandemic related conditions in that country which are making our financial recovery take longer than expected the expense and efforts to build us back in china did not derail us from executing on our overall strategic plan success of which we see evident in the growing number of customer engagements on potentially large scale projects we believe that the most challenging aspects of our transition in china are now behind us for the most part and we are on a trajectory for longer term growth and profitability on a global scale simultaneous with our efforts in china we completed the addition of our coating facilities in europe during the second quarter with vertically integrated processes and manufacturing capabilities on 3 continents we are increasingly being sought after by customers and industry partners alike which position us to benefit from the recent broadening of our product portfolio and to address some of the most prominent growth sectors of the economy including lidar ar vr and space technologies the industry s response to our introduction of freeform optics for high volume production has been nothing short of overwhelming there is significant interest in our capabilities for designing systems that use freeform optics last week we announced that our new freeform optics technology had won the 2022 prism award for manufacturing the prism awards is an annual international competition that honors the best new optics and photonics products on the market we now have underway a growing number of nre projects for the development of new custom freeform optics and assemblies as well as other new products growth in our nre programs is the result of customers wanting priority access to freeform technology among our expanding platform of proprietary materials and manufacturing processes nre projects which represent revenue in the form of engineering and development that is paid for by customers with the resulting intellectual property owned by lightpath are expected to lead to production orders that require a series of lenses or assemblies which would substantially increase the company s current manufacturing volumes once in production through separate contracts the proprietary nature of such non commoditized orders suggest that the higher revenue generation associated with the greater volumes also will deliver an improvement in gross margins as compared with the company s existing product lines as such we are delivering on the strategic objective of transitioning into a value added engineered solutions partner for large global customers as they pursue next generation technologies on other operating performance measures revenues for the second quarter and backlog at the end of the period increased from the first quarter we ended the second quarter by increasing our cash balance and reducing total debt and inventories as compared to the end of the first quarter backlog grew to 21 9 million at the end of the second quarter an increase of over 13 from the end of the first quarter following a renewal of a large annual ir supply agreement valued at 4 2 million capital investments were modest at about 118 000 for the second quarter which is within our budget for the year as we had completed a significant increase in manufacturing capacity expansion last year in accordance with our strategic plan while our product portfolio has made great strides and now addresses some very exciting growth markets our spending on research and development remained at under 600 000 for the quarter this spending is in addition to development costs associated with nre projects grants and partnerships which also serve as a testament to our leading expertise in photonics we are pleased to have been selected by the european space agency and space florida to work toward the commercialization of materials to be used for optics in space a key objective of our strategic plan is to move up the value chain in targeted areas based on the technology and engineering capabilities that we have today as well as what our presence in the industry can deliver to us to this end we were honored to have been selected for an exclusive optical usage license to manufacture products using the infrared patent portfolio developed and owned by the united states navy s u s naval research laboratory we are receiving very strong market feedback on our nrl licensing which reaffirms our assumptions that such materials provide significant value the culmination of our research efforts our partnerships and our overall product expansion is a migration to higher end engineered solutions that afford us with exposure to large customers and accelerating growth markets which are expected to lead to increased profitability particularly since it is unlikely we would face the same commoditization and competitive issues of some of our more mature product lines representative of this continued progress and outlook for growth lightpath s leadership made open market purchases of class a common stock during both the fiscal first and second quarters financial results revenue revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was approximately 9 2 million a decrease of approximately 679 000 or 7 as compared to 9 9 million in

period of the prior fiscal year as discussed in recent prior quarters the decrease in sales of pmo products was a result of both the company s largest telecommunications customer decreasing its orders and a temporary decrease in domestic sales in china due to the transition of the company s management team in china these decreases were partially offset by increases in sales through catalog and distribution channels as well as increases in sales to customers in the industrial and medical industries sales in china improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 contributing to the company wide sequential growth of 30 in pmo sales for those periods and pmo sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 maintained a similar level as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in china the sequential pmo sales increase has been driven in part by other telecommunications customers as well as increased sales to customers in the commercial industrial and medical industries revenue generated by specialty products was approximately 406 000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 an increase of approximately 34 000 or 9 compared to

decrease of approximately 54 000 or 6 compared to 862 000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year this decrease is primarily related to sales of custom specialty products during the first half of

the same period of the prior fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 30 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 37 for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the mix of products sold in each respective period infrared products which typically have lower margins than pmo products comprised 55 of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 48 of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in addition infrared product sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily consisted of non molded infrared products which typically have lower margins than molded infrared products infrared product margins also reflect increased costs associated with the completion of the coating department in the company s riga latvia facility the riga facility which will improve over time as that facility works through the qualification stages and begins to produce at volume gross

of fiscal 2021 gross margins for newer infrared products have begun to improve in comparison to prior periods as we move past some of the traditional start up inefficiencies of new lenses moving into the volume production stage the yield issues previously experienced in connection with bd6 coatings were resolved during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 which has begun to decrease our costs for those products we continue to see progress toward bringing manufacturing efficiencies on these new products to a level similar to existing products particularly as the new coating chambers added to the riga facility are further utilized operating expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 total operating expenses were approximately 3 8 million an increase of 206 000 or 6 as compared to 3 6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year selling general and administrative sg a costs increased by approximately 184 000 or 7 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year while new product development costs remained relatively consistent the increase in sg a costs is primarily due to approximately 153 000 of expenses incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 associated with the previously described events that occurred at the company s chinese subsidiaries including legal and consulting fees in addition it was determined that one of the chinese subsidiaries is obligated to pay 248 000 in vat and related taxes from prior years which was accrued during the three months ended december 31 2021 the remaining increase in sg a costs as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year is due to increases in personnel related costs and a moderate increase in travel expenses as covid 19 restrictions are reduced these increases were partially offset by the absence of approximately 400 000 of non recurring additional compensation to the company s former chief executive officer which was included in sg a for the second quarter of fiscal 2021

adverse to the interests of the company including efforts to misappropriate certain of the company s proprietary technology diverting sales to entities owned or controlled by these former employees and other suspected acts of fraud theft and embezzlement the company s chinese subsidiaries are involved in certain ongoing legal proceedings with the terminated employees knowing that such transitions in international subsidiaries can lead to lengthy legal proceedings that can interrupt a subsidiary s ability to operate compounded by the fact that the company s officers could not travel to china to oversee the transitions because of the travel restrictions imposed by covid 19 the company chose to enter into severance agreements with certain of the employees at the time of transaction pursuant to which the company s subsidiaries agreed to pay such employees severance of approximately 485 000 in the aggregate to be paid out over a six month period after the execution of the severance agreements the company discovered additional wrongdoing by the terminated employees and as a result the company s subsidiaries have not yet paid the severance payments and have disputed the employees rights to such payments currently there are ongoing civil actions in china in connection with the subsidiaries refusal to pay these severance amounts due to the employees non compliance however based on the likelihood that the courts in china will determine that the subsidiaries will ultimately be obligated to pay these amounts these payments were accrued for as of june 30 2021 and remain accrued as of december 31 2021 other income expense interest expense net was approximately 50 000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 55 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year for the first half of fiscal 2022 interest expense net was approximately 96 000 as compared to 114 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates and a reduction in total debt of 18 as of the quarter ended december 31 2021 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 lightpath recognized net foreign currency

estimated chinese withholding taxes associated with intercompany dividends declared by lpoiz and payable to lightpath as the parent company in the u s the decrease is primarily due to lower taxable income in that jurisdiction lightpath has net operating loss nol carry forward benefits of approximately 61 million available to apply against taxable income as reported on a consolidated basis in the u s outside of the u s income taxes are attributable to the company s wholly owned subsidiaries in china income generated by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in latvia is subject to distribution

same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in cash flows from operations during the first half of fiscal 2022 is due to the decrease in net income and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by a reduction in inventory the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the previously described events that occurred at the company s subsidiaries in china for which certain expenses were accrued as of june 30 2021 many of which were paid during the first half of fiscal 2022 as well as payment of certain bonuses earned by executive officers and other employees during fiscal 2021 and the first installment payment of payroll taxes deferred in fiscal 2020 under the cares act the company expended approximately 1 3 million for investments in capital equipment during the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to 2 2 million in the same period prior fiscal year the majority of capital expenditures during the first half of fiscal

in stockholders equity during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is made up of the net loss plus adjustments for stock based compensation for which the expense is offset in additional paid in capital and net foreign currency translation adjustment losses which are included in other comprehensive income sales backlog as of december 31 2021 lightpath s total backlog was 21 9 million an increase of 3 as compared to 21 3 million as of june 30 2021 the increase in backlog during the first half of fiscal 2022 was largely due to the renewal of a large annual contract for infrared products during the second quarter which the company will begin shipping against in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 after shipments against the previous contract are completed the timing of this renewal is similar to prior fiscal years the timing of other contract renewals may not be as consistent and may substantially increase backlog levels at the time the orders are received backlog will subsequently be drawn down as shipments are made against these orders the company s annual and multi year contracts are expected to renew in future quarters the large contract renewal and other new contracts were partially offset by fewer new orders from a large telecommunications customer during the first half of fiscal 2022 which orders were historically renewed each quarter use of non gaap financial measures to

i ll turn the call back over to barry port our ceo barry barry port chief executive officer thanks chad and again thank you for joining us today we are pleased to announce yesterday another record quarter these results demonstrate yet again that our local leaders and their teams continue to be the examples of post acute excellence as they wade through the evolving landscape in each of their markets as they ve done so we have again achieved record results in spite of the continued challenges related to the pandemic and the accompanying disruption in their labor markets remarkably despite the impact of the delta surge in the early part of the quarter and omicron in the late part of the quarter we saw continued improvement in occupancy skilled revenue and managed care revenues we were particularly pleased that we achieved sequential growth in our overall occupancy for the fourth consecutive quarter and managed care census has grown sequentially six quarters in a row we were amazed by the commitment of our caregivers and their continued endurance and strength as evidence of the medical community s confidence in our local operators clinical capabilities we saw marked improvement in patient volumes especially with higher acuity patients as we saw another sequential increase in medicare and managed care census of 5 5 and 4 7 in our same store and transitioning portfolios respectively this continued improvement in our admissions trend not only gives us great confidence that we can continue to perform well as the pandemic stubbornly persists in many of our largest markets but it also shows that we are in an excellent position to see occupancies continue to normalize to pre pandemic levels over time even while the pandemic continues to impact our operations our staff and our patients in spite of the unprecedented challenges the pandemic has forced us to become stronger and more agile while allowing us to develop strategic local advantages that will continue to bear fruit even when the pandemic eventually subsides we continue to work closely with our hospitals government agencies and managed care partners to care for patients with increasingly demanding medical needs in doing so our operations are solidifying their position as providers of choice and are increasingly seen as critical partners in the healthcare continuum as an essential cost effective setting for these complex patients moreover as the pandemic has continued to put pressure on the labor markets our operations have discovered new methods for attracting healthcare professionals into our workforce while also strengthening their ability to retain and develop existing staff as we have focused on being the employer of choice in our communities while we would never have wanted this pandemic to occur it has revealed the strength of frontline professionals and caused us to become better clinically and operationally than ever before we also continue to benefit from sequestration suspension and improved medicaid funding in certain states we are grateful that the federal government has extended the state of emergency to april 2022 which keeps in place many of the regulatory and other forms of assistance helpful to patient care based on recent covid trends we anticipate that this additional funding will continue into the second half of this year but to the extent that covid trends or political climates changed throughout the year we are confident in our ability to make operational adjustments take advantage of an attractive acquisition environment and lean on our overall help to continue our path of performance we are very proud of what we re able to accomplish in 2021 while dealing with so many unusual challenges but we also know we can still do much better and are excited about the enormous potential within our portfolio as we continue to apply our proven locally driven healthcare model we are issuing our annual 2022 earnings guidance of 4 01 to 4 13 per diluted share and annual revenue guidance of 2 93 billion to 2 98 billion the new midpoint of this 2022 earnings guidance represents an increase of 12 over our 2021 results and is 30 higher than our 2020 results we are excited about the upcoming year and are confident that our teams will continue to manage and innovate through the lingering challenges on the labor front when we consider the current health of our organization combined with our culture and proven local leadership strategy we are well positioned to have another outstanding year in 2022 but before i turn it over to chad to discuss our growth and real estate efforts i just want to take a minute to recognize our incredible team members facility leaders field resources clinical partners and service center support staff i can t emphasize enough how incredibly honored and grateful we are to work alongside them and witness their amazing sacrifice effort and outcomes they have taken great care to ease the impact that these last two years have had on our residents and one another they have focused relentlessly on the safety and well being of those they serve their ownership in serving their communities has blessed the lives of so many it s absolutely astounding to witness and an honor to be a part of that effort while we most certainly expect some challenges ahead we are excited about our future and look forward to continuing to show our dedication to all those that have entrusted us with the care of their loved ones next i ll ask chad to discuss our recent growth chad chad keetch chief investment officer thank you barry as we announced yesterday as of january 3rd 2022 we completed the formation of a new captive reit standard bearer healthcare reit inc or standard bearer this new real estate company will enable us to build upon our established real estate investment platform which is comprised of high quality assets and very healthy operational fundamentals we carefully selected the name standard bear which in military tradition is the person that has the honor of carrying the colors as you all know ensign means a standard or a flag ensign s mission is to raise a flag or to be a symbol of a new higher standard in post acute care that mission drives each and every aspect of our organization and is something we care about deeply therefore it is very important for us to ensure that everything the reit is about is to support that mission we understand and will always recognize that the true value in our real estate is derived by the loving service provided by our local teams in each location they serve the real estate while obviously an important element of the care we provide only does well if the operations do well and so standard bearer s mission will be to do its part in finding the right opportunities and acquiring those opportunities in a way that supports and sustains the hundreds of ensign affiliates and other like minded operators as they seek to provide exceptional post acute care into the markets they serve while our real estate strategy has always been an important part of our dna we believe this new organizational structure allows us to take the next step with our already thriving real estate business we ve already begun evaluating transactions which include healthcare properties that will be operated by ensign affiliates and other third party operators we look forward to establishing new partnerships with other outstanding operators and to working together to help further underline the importance of post acute care providers within the continuum at the same time this new strategy will open up new doors to growth that we haven t pursued in the past allowing us to accelerate ensign s strategy of acquiring and operating both performing and underperforming operations as a reminder there are many benefits to our stakeholders in this new organizational structure in addition to providing us with additional acquisition opportunities standard bearer will be able to leverage the knowledge and experience of our exceptional field leaders as they assist the reit and its efforts to create additional value through real estate investing also unlike a transaction that involves a onetime benefit to our stakeholders the captive reit and the accompanying periodic valuations will show an ongoing and accurate look at the substantial value of our real estate assets we are happy to now disclose our real estate portfolio s value as determined by a third party appraiser in our 10 k with an initial valuation of approximately 1 billion when compared with the book value of approximately 720 million which includes the purchase price that we paid at the time of acquisition plus all additional capital improvements this represents an increase of approximately 40 over time we expect that this continued disclosure will shine a brighter light on the value we have created and will continue to create in these and future assets in addition this structure fully preserves the option to do a spin out or other transactions in the future without duplicating efforts most of all by keeping our real estate strategy in house we will retain the cultural connection between the real estate business and the most important part of our business is obviously the care and service that occurs in these operations on a daily basis we are always happy to be operators first and the health of each operation will be paramount in every deal we consider so just to summarize this new structure gives us more flexibility to grow in new ways without triggering significant capital gains tax and other inefficiencies provides us with additional flexibility and deployment of capital and gives us full visibility into the growing value of our real estate plus we are not limiting ourselves in any way to pursue other structures in the future and just to be clear we will obviously still continue to grow by leasing new operations we very much value our relationships with all of our existing and future landlords leases have been and will continue to be an essential part of our growth story for example during the quarter and since we added 6 new operations including two operations in texas totaling 248 beds one operation in idaho with 80 beds one operation in arizona with 161 beds and two operations in california with 218 beds five of which are new long term triple net leases and one real estate purchase just a few months ago we acquired the real estate for five skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in arizona california and kansas which had previously been operated by ensign and pennant group affiliates for a number of years as this recent activity illustrates the ratio between leased and owned will vary depending on the circumstances when it makes sense and pricing is right we will opportunistically purchase the real estate when attractive leases come our way we ll do those two as we ve shown over our 22 year history there will be many opportunities to do both in total during the year and since we ve added 20 operations to our organization and we are very excited about this year the pipeline for our typical turnarounds including real estate acquisitions and leases is very strong and improving we have done we have a dozen new additions that we are working toward closing in the coming months and are seeing a significant increase in the number of opportunities for both leased and owned portfolios as we mentioned in our release yesterday we have significant capacity with over 340 million in available capital and very eager capital partners ready to help us grow and with that i ll turn the call back over to barry barry barry port chief executive officer thanks chad next we d like to highlight some examples of the successes our local teams have seen this quarter while external circumstances have been difficult our partners continue to defy the odds and produce remarkable outcomes clinically culturally and financially pandemic has added complexity to our operational landscape and in some ways it has also reinforced the simple fundamentals that allow operations to be successful regardless of circumstances these fundamentals such as clinical confidence stable and consistent leadership and partnership with healthcare continuum providers have allowed many of our facilities including legend west a skilled nursing facility in san antonio texas to thrive in the midst of unprecedented clinical challenges reimbursement changes regulatory oversight and staffing pressures despite the constant pressures throughout 2021 ceo robert gray and coo monica sanford and the team at legend west which has been together for many years have continued to strengthen clinical and financial results quarter after quarter because of the stability and leadership the team continued to execute a very successful managed care strategy working together with local managed care plans they increase clinical capabilities through specialized trainings and streamlined processes to meet the needs of both the plans and their patients and at the same time the legend west team has relentlessly improved quality metrics and maintained an overall five star rating from cms as well as preferred status from multiple managed care networks and the veterans administration as a result occupancy and revenues have consistently grown quarter after quarter and year after year for example during the fourth quarter of 2021 skilled mix increased by 30 compared to the prior year quarter while managed care patient days increased by 39 in 2021 over prior year this has led to a 27 improvement in total managed care revenues and contributed to 2021 being the highest ebit year ever for the facility these continued improvements by legend west demonstrate that there will always be a strong demand for top quality skilled nursing and rehabilitation services as the pandemic continues staffing challenges have hit all sectors but has been particularly difficult for rural healthcare facilities however many of our operations are finding ways to thrive despite the challenges one example of this is pinnacle nursing rehabilitation in price utah a small community in the eastern part of the state where ceo seth anderson and coo lindsey callahan have led their team staffing efforts in some very innovative ways recognizing that the easiest way to successfully staff a facility is to prevent employee turnover the pinnacle team has been obsessed with taking care of their existing staff and becoming the employer of choice in the community this positive culture has not only resulted in staff turnover rates that are less than a third of the national average but also has created a pipeline of referrals from employees encouraging their friends and family to join the pinnacle team pinnacle staffing success goes beyond just great culture the facility has also pioneered an in person and virtual cna training program and strategically partnered with the local community college nursing program to ensure a consistent inflow of talented clinicians as expected the successful culture at pinnacle continues to produce exceptional clinical outcomes including a five star rating overall for quality measures similarly the facility increased revenues occupancy and skilled mix throughout 2021 which resulted in a 31 ebit growth over 2020 s record financial performance although pinnacle has been an ensign affiliate for over a decade it continues to meaningfully improve year after year demonstrating the incredible potential for growth latent in even established same store operations we hope that these examples are helpful in illustrating the different levers our local operators have to pull in order to quickly adjust to the needs and the feedback of their healthcare partners with that i ll turn the time over to suzanne to provide more detail on the company s financial performance and our guidance and then we ll open it up for questions suzanne suzanne snapper chief financial officer thank you barry and good morning everyone detailed financials for the year are contained in our 10 k and press release filed yesterday some additional highlights include the following for the year gaap diluted earnings per share was 3 42 representing a 12 increase and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 3 64 an increase of 16 consolidated gaap and adjusted revenues were both 2 6 billion an increase of 10 for the quarter gaap diluted earnings per share was 0 86 representing a 5 increase and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 97 an increase of 21 transitioning in same store occupancy increased by 6 8 and 3 respectively in addition sequential transitioning and same store occupancy increased by 1 7 and 40 basis points respectively other key metrics as of december 31st include cash and cash equivalents of 262 million cash flow from operations of 276 million and 343 million of availability on a revolving line of credit we continue to delever our portfolio achieving a lease adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio of 2 13 times a decrease of 0 29 times from last year we also own 101 assets 77 of which are unlevered with significant equity value that provide us with even more liquidity as of the year ended december 31st 2021 and since we repurchased 265 000 shares of common stock for 20 million completing our october 2021 stock repurchase program we also announced yesterday that the board approved a new stock repurchase program for 2022 in the amount of 20 million given the stock s recent performance our liquidity and confidence in near and long term results we believe this additional share buyback to be a very wise use of our capital as we ve said before share buybacks are one of the many levers we have to deploy capital to benefit our shareholders in mid january the public health emergency was extended for another 90 days to april 16th 2022 with this extension the federal government will continue to provide various waivers and fmap funding as barry mentioned we anticipate that this additional funding will continue into the second half of the year additionally it was announced that the suspension of the 2 sequestration would continue through april 1st 2022 and then would be 1 through june 30th 2022 after which the full 2 sequestration will be back in place the suspension has and will continue to have a positive impact on our revenue depending upon how the pandemic affects our medicare census we are providing our 2022 annual earnings guidance of 4 01 to 4 13 per diluted share and annual revenue guidance of 2 93 billion to 2 98 billion the midpoint of this 2022 earnings guidance represents an increase of approximately 12 over our 2021 results and 30 over our 2020 results our 2022 guidance is based on diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 57 3 million a tax rate of 25 the inclusion of acquisitions closed in the first half of 2022 the exclusion of losses associated with start up operations which are not yet stabilized the inclusion of anticipated medicare and medicaid reimbursement rate increases net of provider tax and with the primary exclusion coming from stock based compensation additionally other factors that could impact quarterly performance include variations in reimbursement systems delays and changes in state budgets seasonality in occupancy and skilled mix the influence of the general economy census and staffing the short term impact of acquisition activities variations in insurance accruals surge in covid 19 and other factors and with that i ll turn it back over to barry barry barry port chief executive officer thanks suzanne we want to again thank you for joining us today and express our appreciation to our stakeholders for their confidence and support we know that this year will not be without some unique challenges however we are encouraged by our operational strength in our core business but also this new growth lever that we have in the standard bearer to help accelerate our mission to change post acute care with ensign operations as its primary tenant it s a perfect launching pad to create significant real estate value as we follow our proven model while aligning with others in our industry as chad pointed out earlier we believe that little to no value is being assigned to our real estate by our investors when in fact the value is approximately 1 billion we re going to grow that value and take advantage of opportunities that we previously would have passed on and leverage our best in class field leadership team to help attract and partner with other great providers in our space speaking of our talented field leaders we recognize them for their heroic efforts along with those of our nurses therapists and other frontline care providers who continue to provide an industry leading example of life enriching service to our residents coworkers and communities we re also appreciative to our colleagues here at the service center who are working tirelessly to support our operations enabling us to succeed in spite of the challenges we faced thank you for making us better every day with that we ll turn the time over the q a portion of our call gigi can you instruct the audience on the q a procedure questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of tao qiu from stifel your line is now open tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning could you help me understand the building blocks of the 12 5 revenue guidance for 2022 at the midpoint in terms of occupancy outlook rate and skilled mix on the existing portfolio the contribution from recent acquisitions and in terms of state support i think you have recognized 75 million of the fmap funding in 2021 and based on your comments do you expect half of that level for 2022 thanks barry port chief executive officer great questions tao we ll i ll let suzanne get into the kind of the revenue piece of your question as far as state support goes through the fmap program our assumptions is and we don t have a crystal ball on this but sometime in the second half of 2022 we expect that that support from the federal government through the states will likely end and again our best guess is somewhere in the middle of the second half of the year and that s based on the state of emergency potentially subsiding obviously what could change that is if we covid continues to have different variants and outbreaks that support might continue but we re taking a guess that it will likely end sometime this year as for occupancy and skilled mix again what we ve typically seen is that as we have surges in the community that we kind of take a step sideways or backwards in overall occupancy and our skilled mix increases as we see sicker patients but what we have seen in spite of those surges both with delta and omicron is that our pace overall over especially over the long term when you look at the course of 2021 is that there s kind of a steady return to our pre covid occupancy numbers and we expect that to continue through 2022 suzanne anything to add to that suzanne snapper chief financial officer yeah i would just say on that obviously we don t have a crystal ball but what we did do and have done kind of similar to last year really modeling that census and skilled mix growth two ways one way of looking at it with regards to gosh maybe a little bit lighter covid impact year with heavier census overall growth and a strong skilled mix but not as strong as we ve seen over the last year and then when we kind of go to the other part of it and we look at what the overall gosh if we had a lot of covid and had a high skilled mix but maybe not as much census growth so we ve modeled it both ways and get to the overall number of both ways looking kind of acquisition versus overall organic growth the vast majority of the growth is focused on the organic growth kind of historically looked at the bucket from our skilled nursing at the same store transition and recently acquired and have really taken a look back and had the opportunity to grow each one of those buckets in the same store really in that mid single digit to high single digit growth transitioning in the mid to high single digit growth and then the acquisitions at a double digit growth and so with that huge portion of our revenue coming from that same store bucket which is very large we expect that to continue to enhance and grow tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst yeah that s very helpful just looking at the 2021 experience covid certainly had an expected impact on the revenue side relative to the initial guidance while you guys were able to pull ahead on the earnings side in that context how should we think about the 2022 guidance any lingering impact you are building into the guidance and what s the level of conservatism in particular in the 2021 experience suzanne snapper chief financial officer yeah i mean i think what you saw and we had this happen in q4 where we had a really heavy covid at the very beginning and at the very end you did see the overall revenue come down but the margins stay up and i think that that s kind of what we would anticipate again we re really looking to not just focus on that revenue growth but really overall we re concentrating on how we re earning how we re creating overall earnings and the bottom line and so i think that s when you think back about our model and look at how we project really that is our focus is how we actually continue to grow we re not going to just try to make that revenue number and that revenue target but really look at the overall and so i think if we had a lot of surges again of covid maybe we wouldn t get to the revenue number per se but we would have higher acuity higher skilled mix which would result in a stronger earnings margin tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst gotcha and one more question on the captive side if i may i think in 10 q you guys called out the ensign s rental revenue at 54 million plus the 60 million that s 70 million in terms of year one rental revenue does that include a straight line rent as well suzanne snapper chief financial officer yes so yeah it s not a straight line per se because all of our rents are cpi based and with the cpi based rent you actually don t straight line that amount and so we would continue to project that cpi increase if you re looking at how to look at that on a go forward basis had that cpi actually built up in there chad keetch chief investment officer cpi would cap they typically have a cap on the 2 5 to 3 typically tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst gotcha so it s the same as cash right now so just curious on the debt balance right on day one i think the debt to assets is about 25 any plan to lever it up as you ramp up investments suzanne snapper chief financial officer i think your question is on the captive reit would we lever up the captive reit over time tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst that s right suzanne snapper chief financial officer yes absolutely i mean as we re looking at acquisitions you would actually increase that leverage on it obviously you re going to get additional rent stream but as you do an acquisition through the reit then you would have additional leverage that would occur chad keetch chief investment officer yeah we always talk about sort of our net debt to ebitda ratio and we re obviously very cognizant of making sure we stay very healthy and have a lot of room there and like i said in my in the prepared remarks we have eager capital partners that are excited and anxious to help us do that tao qiu stifel financial corp analyst got it thank you guys for taking my questions suzanne snapper chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott fidel from stephens your line is now open scott fidel stephens inc analyst hi everyone thanks and first of all i appreciate the additional disclosures now in the 10 k on the valuation of the real estate assets a couple of questions for you and first just interested chad maybe if you want to talk about the conversations that are underway now around deals and sort of the tempo of that and i know that you already highlighted that you ve got at least a dozen operations that look to be in the pipeline to close relative to the near term i m just thinking about the bigger picture i know you ve talked about really sort of during the pandemic that a lot of the sellers have had pretty elevated valuation expectations just given all of the additional relief funding from the pandemic just interested in terms of how that sentiment is evolving at this point are you starting to see some softening of those expectations and more attractive opportunities starting to open up or is it still relatively consistent with what you ve been telling us about over the last 12 18 months or so chad keetch chief investment officer yeah thanks scott so it s been interesting i think we re still seeing some folks holding on to really high expectations but that said i think just the supply and the number of acquisition opportunities opening up are going to just have a natural impact on that we ve seen an uptick just even in the last three weeks as we ve entered into this new year and as barry mentioned there s not a whole lot of visibility in terms of some of those programs that the federal government has had in place and so i think there s certainly been a lot of additional deals that have been coming and we definitely get the sense that prices have at least in the ones we re doing of course have been a lot more realistic so we re excited about that scott fidel stephens inc analyst got it and second question just following back up on the state relief funding and i guess how to help for us to factor that into the modeling for last year i think that you booked around 75 million overall in that state relief funding and obviously i know it s very difficult to forecast exactly what would play out for 2022 just interested though directionally how you re thinking about that would you think about that type of revenue that you re looking to be relatively consistent in 2022 or do you think that there will probably be a material relatively material drop off in that obviously with what s left a bit more weighted to the first half suzanne snapper chief financial officer great question i think maybe just as a reminder of how we actually even look at those dollars coming in we really do reflect the every fmap dollar against a covered related expense and so obviously the heavier the covid is in a particular quarter even with the funding you re probably going to get a little bit heavier covid revenue or if covid experience in a particular quarter is lighter than that covid revenue would trim down so just remembering that the revenue isn t recognized until we have a covid expense and then when we kind of look through the year we know it s all the way through april like we said in the prepared remarks and what we are hearing and fill and have built into the guidance is that definitely we go through july based upon everything that s out there and then kind of teetering off toward the second half of 2022 so they re not as strong because as we ve seen every state has their own way of dealing with fmap dollars so it s not this consistent amount that we re getting from every state but as every state goes through the analysis they re actually putting money out there maybe on a daily basis or putting money out there in lumpsum and so kind of set teetering out through that second half of 2022 barry port chief executive officer yes i mean scott to suzanne s point i mean we utilized the covid related fmap funding heaviest in q4 of this last year we had two surges covid and delta or sorry omicron and delta in one quarter and so naturally those expenses are going to be higher so and we see omicron starting to taper we see that in our numbers both in staff cases and resident cases and so our expectation is we re still going to have some higher expenses in the first quarter but again we re hopeful and optimistic that things will start to taper throughout the year and as they do not only will fmap eventually go away which it s bound to and it should but hopefully our dependence on that for covid related expenses will also taper scott fidel stephens inc analyst understood that s helpful yes because i think there s a perception among some investors i think out there that those fmap funds the enhanced funds have been bolstering margins and if those go away you could see some compression in margin i think it sounds like the point that you re trying to make is that that s more margin neutral because you re booking costs against those revenues but maybe i just want to give you a chance to address that directly in terms of how those fmap funds flow through margins and whether there would be any compression or not if those funds were to go away barry port chief executive officer yeah and that s a great point scott and that s precisely why we re pointing out that we re using the funds only to the extent that we have covid related expenses and so again our assumption is that as a lot of these expenses go away the need for fmap will also go away and so we re predicting that the pandemic will evolve this year but again it s really hard to say certainly if it doesn t our expectation is that the government program will continue because i think the intent of the program is to help offset the higher covid related expenses but certainly we expect to reduce our dependency regardless of whether or not the pandemic persists our focus this year is on really kind of returning to fundamentals after having so much time and focus and energy on the kind of the pandemic related issues that come up both with regulatory and staffing and all the other challenges that come our focus is making sure that we really kind of return to our efficient operating model and have some of the kind of covid related distractions subside scott fidel stephens inc analyst understood and then just one last one for me if you could talk about what type of wage inflation you re building into the 2022 budget and how that compared to 2021 and that s it for me thanks barry port chief executive officer so we re not necessarily prepared with exact numbers on how much wages have gone up we ve indicated in the past that we certainly saw an acceleration of the need for some structural wage increases toward the second half of last year and we expect those to remain in place certainly you can look at kind of our run rate from third and fourth quarter but even there our expectation is that we re going to be better at managing our overall labor in spite of higher wages that we see in place we re seeing some success with that as we again like i mentioned return to a focus on fundamentals suzanne snapper chief financial officer yeah and i would just remind you like there s some natural offsets that we have with regards to wage inflation so i think we i think we ve said it s higher than it historically has been usually we re in the very low 2 to 3 and we re at mid single digits on that for this year on the wage inflation but there are offsets and those other offsets include just our overall incentive plans that are tied to the overall profitability of each operation as well as from all the markets as well as one of the biggest factors that we have out there is agency and that the agency amount that was the highest we ve ever experienced in q4 and so we ve got a continued push and focus with regards to getting that agency amount down and when you don t have huge surges of covid we believe that s possible because of all the additional programs that we ve introduced over the last year including cna schools and other things that we ve talked to you guys about barry port chief executive officer and look we point out agency is a big issue for us and certainly we know compared to a lot of our peers because we re open about this we talk about it we re talking about agency usage that represents maybe 5 of our overall nursing expense which we know is much lower than most of our competitors but that said it s still it s a big expense even though it s only maybe a small percentage of your overall labor costs it s still significant for us and one that we re focused on reducing because it not only improves patient care it s a burdensome expense that we don t expect will continue and the evidence of that is seen in our acceleration and our ability to hire we ve seen a massive increase in our hires over the past two quarters and we re seeing more evidence of that into the first quarter which is a really good lead indicator that we re starting to see light at the end of the staffing tunnel scott fidel stephens inc analyst ok very helpful thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ben hendrix from rbc capital markets your line is now open ben hendrix rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks guys just a real quick one for me anything when you re talking about the waiver programs and medicaid is there anything that we need that you can call out regarding your assumptions around the texas medicaid waiver and the dsrip program suzanne snapper chief financial officer yeah i mean there s nothing unique that we haven t guided in there with regard to that program i think just for us we ve really taken texas since it s going to continue to have the supplemental program that exists there for 2022 in a form that s similar to how it exists today ben hendrix rbc capital markets analyst ok are you we ve noticed a lot of providers kind of taking it out of first quarter guidance but then including it in the latter three is that the right way to think about it or do you guys just have it in there continuing just throughout the whole year suzanne snapper chief financial officer i think when you re i think the program that you re talking about it doesn t impact us as much the program that impacts us the most is the qipp program so i think that that s the one where really that has the biggest impact on us and that we ve really kept that flat year over year based upon what s going on in that program as a supplemental provider ben hendrix rbc capital markets analyst ok thank you very much operator at this time i m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to bob port for closing remarks barry port chief executive officer thanks gigi and we ll go ahead and wrap up our q a and i would like to thank everyone for joining us today operator duration 48 minutes call participants chad keetch

article inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades hammering america s consumers wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the federal reserve s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy the labor department said thursday that consumer prices jumped 7 5 last month compared with 12 months earlier the steepest year over year increase since february 1982 shortages of supplies and workers heavy doses of federal aid ultra low interest rates and robust consumer spending combined to send inflation accelerating in the past year when measured from december to january inflation was 0 6 the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected prices rose 0 7 from october to november and 0 9 from september to october shortages of supplies and workers heavy doses of federal aid ultra low interest rates and robust consumer spending combined to send inflation leaping in the past year and there are few signs that it will slow significantly anytime soon wages are rising at the fastest pace in at least 20 years which can pressure companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs ports and warehouses are overwhelmed with hundreds of workers at the ports of los angeles and long beach the nation s busiest out sick last month many products and parts remain in short supply as a result prices for a broad range of goods and services accelerated from december to january and not just for items directly affected by the pandemic apartment rental costs rose 0 5 in january the fastest pace in 20 years electricity prices surged 4 2 in january alone the sharpest rise in 15 years and are up 10 7 from a year earlier last month household furniture and supplies rose 1 6 the largest one month increase on records dating to 1967 food costs driven by pricier eggs cereal and dairy products increased 0 9 in january air fares rose 2 3 new car prices which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips were unchanged last month but are up 12 2 from a year ago the surge in new car prices has in turn accelerated used car prices they rose 1 5 in january and are up a dizzying 41 from a year ago just as price pressures in some areas ease inflation in other parts of the economy is picking up said sarah house an economist at wells fargo the upshot is that inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high the steady rise in prices has left many americans less able to afford food gas rent child care and other necessities more broadly inflation has emerged as the biggest risk factor for the economy and as a serious threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats as midterm elections loom later this year among the americans who are struggling with pricier food and gas is courtney luckey who has changed her shopping habits and taken on additional work shifts at a grocery store in charlotte north carolina where she lives luckey 33 used to be able to fill up a grocery cart for 100 now she said 100 barely fills half the cart tomatoes have reached nearly 5 a pound which i think is ridiculous luckey has switched to canned tomatoes and has begun using coupons for family dollar and food lion to help pay bills she s also picked up more hours at a harris teeter grocery store but the store is 30 minutes from her house so she s had to spend more on gas all her forced additional spending has caused luckey to pull back on the family activities such as bowling with her daughter her brother and his two sons those outings now typically happen once a month rather than every week or two even excluding volatile food and energy prices so called core inflation jumped 0 6 from december to january and 6 from a year ago stocks fell in morning trading after the release of the report with the broad s p 500 index down 0 6 the yield on the 10 year bond jumped to nearly 2 a sign that investors see more fed rate hikes ahead in the past year sharp increases in the costs of gas food autos and furniture have upended many other americans budgets too in december economists at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school estimated that the average household had to spend 3 500 more than in 2020 to buy an identical basket of goods and services thursday s report will intensify pressure on the fed and its chair jerome powell to tighten credit to try to slow the economy enough to cool inflation powell signaled two weeks ago that the central bank would likely raise its benchmark short term rate multiple times this year with the first hike almost surely coming at its next meeting in march with the latest inflation data some economists expect the fed may decide to raise its key rate in march by one half a percentage point rather than its typical quarter point hike over time those higher rates will raise the costs for a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto and business loans that could cool spending and inflation but for the fed the risk is that in steadily tightening credit it could trigger another recession last week the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage jumped to 3 69 the highest level in more than two years according to mortgage buyer freddie mac higher loan rates will elbow some would be home buyers out of the market many large corporations in conference calls with investors have said they expect supply shortages to persist until at least the second half of this year companies from chipotle to levi s have also warned that they will likely raise prices again this year after having done so in 2021 chipotle said it s increased menu prices 10 to offset the rising costs of beef and transportation as well as higher employee wages and the restaurant chain said it will consider further price increases if inflation keeps rising we keep thinking that beef is going to level up and then go down and it just hasn t happened yet said john hartung the company s chief financial officer executives at chipotle as well as at starbucks and some other consumer facing companies have said their customers so far don t seem fazed by the higher prices levi strauss co raised prices last year by roughly 7 above 2019 levels because of rising

announcing a record quarter with revenue of 110 5 million and 357 6 million for the full year an increase of 47 and 73 compared to the same period last year crossing the 100 million dollars quarterly

non gaap basis in the full year of 2021 net income reached 165 million on a gaap basis and 176 3 million on a non gaap basis as a result of our strategy to focus on selling more system globally sales of capital equipment represent 89 of our total revenue in the fourth quarter sales from consumable and services increased significantly and reached record volume every quarter these sale accounted for 11 of total in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2021 by launching new platforms and innovative modalities and growing our install base in the u s and globally we expect consistent growth in consumable revenue will become a more significant part of our revenue mix i would like to highlight the ongoing growth from our minimally invasive and ablative technologies which now account for 73 of our revenue compared with 65 last year hands free devices generated 17 of our revenue and non invasive rf and laser platforms were present the remaining 10 the product line mix for the full year was 72 for minimally invasive 20 for hands free and 8 for non invasive rf and laser platforms looking in the international side of the business fourth quarter sales outside the u s accounted for 36 3 million a 69 increase compared to the same quarter last year full year results reached 120 3 million a 112 increase compared to 2020 these figures represent 34 of our total revenue of all 2021 and 33 of our total revenue for the fourth quarter inmode currently operates in 71 countries having added 17 countries more in 2021 we also expanded our existing operation in italy by establishing a subsidiary there we see most of the growth coming from region where we are already involved yet there was opportunity in the new territories furthermore despite facing serious global supply chain obstacle in 2021 we successfully delivered every system within 10 days of receiving an order we would not have done that without our hardworking and dedicated employees and partners we value their contribution and thank them for it as for 2022 we re continuing to evaluate the impact of the omicron and the ba 2 covid variant on our business that we do in every territory we hope that current wave of covid will pass and will be the last one so that business across the world will return to normal soon now i would like to turn the call over to shakil our president in north america shakil shakil lakhani president north america thanks moshe and everyone for joining us inmode ended the fourth quarter and 2021 with another record performance and the successful launches of the evolvex and empowerrf platforms sales from capital equipment were the main contributor to our quarterly revenues with 98 6 million in q4 and 318 2 million for all of 2021 with an install base of 11 600 units additionally as moshe mentioned as our install base grows and our systems are used more frequently the number of disposables continues to reach new records as well the u s remains the leading market and was the biggest contributor to our topline with the total fourth quarter sales amounting to 74 2 million compared to 53 7 million in the same quarter of 2020 a 38 increase despite new covid variants causing another surge across north america physician offices in the fourth quarter were the busiest they ve been in all of 2021 demand for minimally invasive technologies has been steadily increasing supporting our growth in the u s and globally with the launch of empowerrf we ve seen significant interest by physicians in the women s health space currently our focus is on north america however we will gradually expand to the rest of the world we plan to continue hiring new sales staff for the north american market which will increase top line growth as proven in previous years we re very grateful to our team and their continued commitment we would not be as successful as we are without each and every individual i will now hand over the call to yair for a review of the financial results in more detail yair yair malca chief financial officer thanks shakil and good day everyone now i d like to break down the numbers for the quarter and the year in greater detail total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 47 year over year to 110 5 million with a gross margin of 85 on a gaap basis for full year 2021 revenue totaled 357 6 million an increase of 73 compared to 2020 sales of minimally invasive and subdermal ablative technologies in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 64 year over year the geographical revenue mix in q4 was 67 in the u s and 33 internationally compared to 71 and 29 for the same quarter in 2020 respectively international sales increased year over year by 69 capital equipment in the fourth quarter accounted for 89 of our revenue and consumable and service revenues represented the remaining 11 identical to the ratio for the full year gaap operating expenses in the first quarter were 39 5 million and 136 5 million for the full year of 2021 a 35 and 33 increase year over year respectively sales and marketing expenses increased 40 in q4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and 38 for the full year 2021 compared to last year this is a result of the improvement in the covid status in certain countries and regions around the world especially in the u s where we saw an increase in in person marketing events share based compensation decreased to 3 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 3 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to 12 million for all of 2021 from 12 8 million in all of 2020 on a non

flow front the company generated 52 9 million from operating activities for the fourth quarter and 174 9 million for all of 2021 i will now turn over the call back to moshe moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you everybody i believe we now open the q a session operator questions answers operator our first question today comes from matt taylor with ubs please go ahead matt taylor ubs analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question so i wanted to start off you mentioned omicron in the press release and in your comments and i guess i just wanted to get some thoughts from you about how disruptive that has been in q1 has that had any impact on your views for the rest of the year and just any color on recent moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah this is moshe hi matt well i cannot answer what would be the effect on the full year but one thing i can tell you that right now there are some countries which are totally closed and we have some slowdown for example in china i m sure you know that they have adopted zero cases program they don t allow people to travel even within their territory they don t allow people to travel between cities so our salespeople in china right now are very limited in the way they can do business they try to overcome it also in europe there are countries under lockdown like netherlands and austria where hopefully soon they will get out of it i believe that sometime in february or maybe early march business will go back to normal but we continue as i said to evaluate the situation country by country territory by territory you know we are lucky that it is not affecting the united state as of now but you know with the omicron and the new variant that just came which create another feel in some countries we will see what will happen matt taylor ubs analyst ok thanks moshe just to clarify i mean you guys are now in dozens of countries you just mentioned a few you know what percentage of your revenue base in these that are actually having more severe lockdowns moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well china is a grower is one of our growth engine and i believe that in the first quarter we will do less than what we did on the fourth quarter hopefully not much less i would say that 10 of the countries where we sell will be some effect other than that we need to wait and see what will happen in the next few weeks matt taylor ubs analyst ok great no thanks for that and then i just want to ask one about margins and supply chain it seems like you ve been doing a good job managing through these challenges keeping your margins really high here is there anything that investors should be concerned about in terms of disruption or increased costs and how conservative are you being on your margin guidance for 2022 moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well we managed very well the situation in 2021 as we go through the supply chain i m sure you know that you know some we have we have established a red team in israel but every time we had a problem with component and with subassembly we managed to overcome it because we have more than one suppliers per each component and each subassembly things are not getting better that s something that i can tell you right away the supply chain is not improving i don t say it will it s getting worse but as we see now the beginning of 2022 we still see some difficulties and we foresee that during 2022 it will continue i can give you an example of logistic a container formation to north america used to cost 3 500 now the cost is 12 000 but we managed to overcome it by doing some kind of special shipping in the low cost well i believe we will overcome the supply chain like we did in 2021 and we deliver everything within a week or 10 days of every order we do our best but i know from some of our competitors and some of other companies in the medical field that they are giving now delivery time to customers of six or nine months we did not do that but yeah we re flexible and i would say that hopefully it will not affect us matt taylor ubs analyst ok maybe just ask one more i d like to ask one on the pipeline and more of a clinical i mean for spero we d just left with thoughts on empower if you re still feeling like 20 million or 25 million i think you ve talked about is a good number for 22 and maybe talk about some of the data that you re generating around it and whether that could develop into you know more kind of medical applications from empower in the future spero theodorou chief medical officer i ll let moshe handle the first part of that question or shak moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well if the question is whether or not we will do what we anticipated for 2022 which is worldwide 20 million i think yes i think we will do it north america and we intend to introduce the platforms in other parts or other territories as well but i think spero what matt asked is about the clinical data spero theodorou chief medical officer sure thank you matt great question we re always very conservative when we re discussing female health and wellness because obviously the standards there as regard as opposed to aesthetics are a little different however you know we did do a soft launch and we re getting feedback continuously across the country from a number of urogynecologist and gynecologist as you know urogynecologist are the group that is probably the most critical and the toughest group to penetrate just as was in plastic surgery and this is where we started and because we believe we have a product that has a lot of staying power and we wanted them to buy in and adopt and help us and sort of guide us through this process and i can tell you right now that the results have been very very encouraging they re extremely excited we have ways to go absolutely but the preliminary data that s coming back is pretty remarkable typically we look at a number of treatments and some of the data that shows that we go one to three treatments typically for what this new device is doing especially as it regards to vaginal intravaginal microneedling and we want to see how far we can push things just with one treatment and we saw that the results are very very strong and we re very very happy to see that our preliminary results are coming back in this fashion now as you know matt this is not this is a marathon and we re always very conservative on the way we look at our data and the way we present it but i can tell you right now the excitement is palpable and i m very very happy to say that and shak can probably reiterate the same thing that feedback and the excitement across the board is something that we re very very happy to have and i ll leave it at that for now but because a lot of the things that we re doing in their midst of publication as you know so everything we do is peer reviewed everything we try to put out there is going to be published and our adoption rate for kols is we always take the hard way first as you know and that pays us in dividends so urogynecologist toughest group we have some of the top kol leaders in the country and we re just continuing doing studies with them and opening the doors with this group and i can tell you right now they re very excited so i can leave it at that matt taylor ubs analyst thank you very much guys spero theodorou chief medical officer great operator the next question comes from kyle rose with canaccord please go ahead kyle rose canaccord genuity analyst great thank you for taking the questions moshe you talked and yair you talked a lot about the growth in the consumable side and with the install base you have expectations for that to continue to grow can you maybe just kind of help us flush that out a little bit more i mean does that mean you expect to see consumables and service revenues go from 11 to 12 next year does that mean could we see it you know move closer toward 15 just trying to really understand what that looks like now that you ve got you know over 11 000 systems placed globally moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i can tell you that hi this is moshe i can tell you that in the last quarter we sold 132 000 disposables compared to the third quarter where we sold only 94 000 so this is growing but as long as we continue to install or to enlarge our install base and by the way in the fourth quarter we sold more than 1 300 system so it went up from 10 to 11 with the install base of 11 600 system that s what we have right now on the market we have something like i would say close to more than 500 000 disposable every year and don t forget not all the system that we sell need the disposable i would say that a little bit more than 50 or 55 maybe 60 are using disposable and go all the way to the subdermal set as we grow all of our new platforms are designed to have disposable we will not design additional platforms without any disposables so in the future once the install base will get i would say to 20 000 or 25 000 i assume that the disposable will grow to a neighborhood of i would say 14 15 of the total revenue but again i would like to say it again we re not a laser laser blade company we do not sell the system for less or do not give the system for free just to charge high price for disposable we know that some companies in the medical aesthetic did it in the past and they failed and therefore we charge for the system and we price the disposable in a reasonable price in order to encourage doctors to use more and more and to have more treatment i think this is the right approach and the right philosophy and this is basically our strategy kyle rose canaccord genuity analyst great i appreciate the color there and i think we ve already gotten you know some good insights on empower maybe i m wondering if we could get some commentary around the launch of evolvex and just what you re seeing there whether it s you know upgrades from existing customers or continued penetration from new customers there maybe just a commentary on that launch would be helpful moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer shakil can you answer that shakil lakhani president north america yeah sure absolutely so we ve actually seen some you know the combination of rf and ems type of device we re basically seeing a very it s not i know you had mentioned that if it was existing customers or not you know there are some that are we re going to be doing some upgrades for some of our existing customers so they have the latest and greatest technology but in terms of the newer business with the market we have an extremely aggressive plan put in place for as you know a spero even just mentioned with empower and also evolve we always kind of slow boat things to make sure that things are ready to excel from an efficacy standpoint a safety standpoint and also from a result standpoint so now that we re very comfortable with that although we use the word launches for both empower and for evolvex now we re going into the hard launch phase which we feel pretty optimistic about both from you know the business perspective for our customers and also from our standpoint as well so we do see we ve seen some excitement the results so far have been you know spero can elaborate a little more but the results so far have been very impressive safety has been very impressive so overall we re feeling pretty good about it moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer spero do you want to talk a little bit spero theodorou chief medical officer yeah i mean sure look when you look at incontinence in these things and you look at the standard that s been up to now sort of if you could get a 50 improvement at three months i think that benchmark is quite low and it s just a function of what technology is out there currently 50 improvement being like you know a woman that loses urine and does these things that s what she can expect and i think that if we took that as a goal and we went after that as a goal to hit that sort of 50 benchmark in three months i don t think we would have been in business you know we re taking everything that we do from the aesthetics and mishka will also say the following that we will not go to market unless we have something that could produce 85 90 clinical results because simply put the people will not pay cash for it and we re in the cash business so we re taking all that model we re taking all that sort of thought process and we re applying it to the female health and wellness sector so we need to and i can tell you right now our preliminary results are blowing past that number so past the 50 of three months which is currently out there so we re very very encouraged in that respect but that is our standard we need to be able to say if someone s coming in for a clinical treatment that is not currently covered by insurance and is paying cash for it that patient needs to be able to say ok i have an 80 to 90 improvement and i can tell you right now that s the area we re looking at and that s what we re getting right now as a feedback from our doctors and we re looking at the data and we re very excited that we re actually blowing past that benchmark i m very cautious always because these things are numbers but so far that s the range that we re getting it s really high it s comparable to what we get in aesthetics and excited to keep on moving this direction so we thank moshe for the support he s giving us but that is our benchmark and we want to redefine the way things are being addressed in this space in female health and wellness and i think we re well off on the road to do that moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer great kyle rose canaccord genuity analyst spero can you talk a little bit about evolvex spero theodorou chief medical officer sure so i mean it s important to understand that when it comes to radio frequency and heating and muscle and all that sort of thing we were the first to actually look at that space and i can tell you this much shak and i were talking about this and he was like well you know how about we are preheating the muscle just as you work out and there s a whole history of heating the muscle and rehabilitation for athletes and injured athletes so the ability to be able to preheat the muscle and then activate it with ems is something that we started doing early on and we did that because it s a function of our different hand pieces right we have rf hand piece we have ems hand piece so taking that ability and bring it over to evolvex and saying ok now we have a hand piece that can do both at the same time is great but you can also uncouple it what does that mean well everybody is different everyone s requirement is different so having the ability to change things around to be able to come and say well what do you want you want your muscles bigger or you want the fat gone because there are people who say ok i don t need the fat all this fat or i don t want to lose volume in my but for example so all these things the more any device or any platform that respects the individuality and the change in the body habitus of every patient and you re able to change things around like that is great because everyone is sort of unique transform and evolvex does that so i could do rf with ems preheat the muscle and then activate it i could do ems on itself i could do rf in itself so that is sort of the way we look at things in plastic surgery when we do minimally invasive and invasive surgery and we brought that over to noninvasive and that ability to change things around to couple uncouple is sort of something that mishka was great at delivering and we find a big resonance in our customer base to be able to do that as well because it s mimicking real life in the way clinical results are being addressed kyle rose canaccord genuity analyst thank you very much for taking the questions spero theodorou chief medical officer not at all operator next question comes from michael matson with needham company please go ahead mike matson needham and company analyst yeah thanks i wanted to ask about the eps guidance you know by my math it seems to i understand there s a tax rate headwind but it does seem to imply that there s an operating margin decline in 2021 or sorry from 2021 if my math is correct so is there any reason to expect that or is it just being conservative on your part moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer so we always try to be conservative as you know in addition we do plan to invest more in a sales and marketing and some more marketing activities as well as clinical studies and so this year we expect to have a slightly higher operating expenses but overall we re looking at 48 operating margin it s still quite remarkable and add into that around 2022 going to be the first year as you know that we start paying taxes after a 10 years break and that would come out to be around 10 we estimated at this point at least and as i mentioned we always tend to be conservative when we can mike matson needham and company analyst ok got it and then your cash balance continues to grow here the stock has pulled back quite a bit you know arguably overvalued sorry undervalued maybe when you look at it on pe basis so would you be open to doing a share repurchase moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well mike we did so far we did close to 1 5 million shares that we bought back in the last i would say less than a year we still have a way to go the board of directors give us the permission to continue to buy back shares and we will continue i m not saying that we will spend 200 million for that but we ll do it we ll do it on a daily basis yes you re right we have more than 400 million in cash close to 420 million in cash we are exploring some opportunities for m a but we did not find anything that will fit our portfolio yet one thing i can tell you as we said before we will not buy a laser company because laser is becoming a commodity in the medical aesthetic we need to find something that will complement our portfolio either in technology marketing sales network something that will two plus two will equal five but nowadays it is very difficult to find something within a reasonable price but yet we have a very robust r d pipeline close to 15 project and we re releasing two projects every year so the organic growth will continue to be the most i would say growth engine for inmode at least in the next two years mike matson needham and company analyst ok got it and then just looking at the different product categories the hands free looks like it s been down year over year for two quarters in a row i mean i would assume that s mainly just due to the comps from covid where that was kind of benefiting back in 2020 and conversely non invasive has been strengthening recently they ve got a similar issue in kind of the opposite direction just easier comps but i was just curious if there s anything else going on there aside from the comps in those two you know categories moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well the hands free when we came up with the hands free to the market we knew that this is not going to be more than 20 of our business our main category is minimally invasive and ablative where we can take operations from the surgical from the full surgery and the full anesthesia and bring it to the doctor office this is exactly what the empower is doing and the empower is minimally invasive because you basic penetrate the skin and you do some fractional rf as well and we will continue to develop products that will have on one hand will be more surgical than non surgical and on the other hand we ll have some disposable as well so the hands free is a complementary technology for us it is not going to be 50 of our business the noninvasive rf and the laser which i call it as a commodity category we have a lot of competition for many companies this is not the main category for us and it is good because it s a very competitive market with very low gross margin with overcapacity with you know price per unit which is much lower than what we can charge without any ip protection laser are invented you know 40 something years ago there was no ip protection anymore and therefore we try to concentrate on where we have competitive advantage and this is basically the surgical part of our business and i believe that we re very happy with the breakdown of the category we re more than 70 in the area where we can protect the technology and get nice prices for the system 20 will be there hands free and i hope it will continue we re going to bring to the market second generation of the hands free devices and the laser and the regular rf the noninvasive rf will continue to be between 8 to 10 of our business that s kind of breakdown we ll be continue in the future mike matson needham and company analyst ok got it thank you operator next question comes from jeff johnson with baird please go ahead jeff johnson robert w baird and company analyst thank you good morning guys maybe just a couple clarifying or follow up questions on things that have been discussed so far so moshe just your comments there on the hands free i mean and trying to put that together with i think with shak s comments on evolvex as evolvex hopefully ramps some this year does hands free continue to decline year over year for the next couple quarters until we kind of anniversary through those four really really tough comps and just how to think about the year over year performance of hands free just in the next couple few quarters moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer no we did not say that this will go down the only thing that i said it will remain something like between 18 to 20 of our total business but as the business will grow the hands free also will grow i mean the transform and evolvex is the second generation of the evolve and hopefully in 2022 we will bring second generation for the evolve for the face hands free as well just to maintain the competitive advantage i mean the fact that we came up with ems and rf combined in the same modality give us a major competitive advantage vis a via all the other companies in the hands free currently so i don t think the hands free will go down it will continue to be a complementary technology for the doctors but to tell you that that will be more than 20 of our total business i will say i don t think it will be it will maintain the same level and the same i would say percentage as part of the total portfolio jeff johnson robert w baird and company analyst ok that s helpful thank you and just going back on empower you know look i understand you guys are a cash paid business it s a fantastic place to be from a consumer facing standpoint things like that but if some of those urinary incontinence and urinary loss or urine loss numbers are as good as they are and even if the path might be extended you know a couple few years it would take to get actual reimbursement would there ever be a reason to go down the path of trying to get a reimbursement code it would seem like it would open the market up so much more and if the effect is so strong it would seem like it would be good for the patient as well so just how to think about reimbursement you know commercial pay government pay versus cash pay for something like an empower procedure and ui moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer let me try to answer and i will hand it out to spero maybe who will elaborate more we re not against reimbursement we never said that i mean in the future we will continue to develop some indication for women health which might need reimbursement as of today the empower with the four modalities the formav the morpheus8v the vtone and aviva we feel like private money is the best i would say business model for this platform to tell you that in the future we will not go into reimbursement indication we might go and we re developing some indication like that today spero theodorou chief medical officer moshe that s a great question by the way so a lot of companies will spend a lot of time going down the reimbursement pathway and not having any revenue at all and at one point hoping that at some point after you burn through all that cash but at some point you re able to go down that route and whether and getting breakthrough designation as we all know is very hard to do but i can tell you this much that absolutely we want to change the way women s health is being done and we have we re in a unique position to have to be to have cash based procedures that to support our research to support indications to support fda all those things that we can do this in parallel that s a unique position to be in all this data that we re collecting everything that we re looking at the types of kols we re bringing aboard the types of academic establishments that we re engaging it s all building the foundation for them in the future so yes we re not opposed on the contrary wanted to be able to open the market but we re in a unique position to be able to do these things with a cash based foundation which is quite different than most companies out there it s sort of a pass or fail as far as when they re doing these sorts of things does that answer your question jeff johnson robert w baird and company analyst it does thank you that s helpful spero theodorou chief medical officer ok jeff johnson robert w baird and company analyst and then last one i promise just on the competition side moshe i mean i totally agree with you docs do not like to obtain click fees or per use fees i think the model as much as investors want to see more recurring revenue i totally get the model of charging a full you know market price for the system itself and lower price for the consumable that s surely what those doctors appreciate but on the competitive side you know there is some noise out there from a company that has some good skin tightening data but they are charging a very high consumable price as well so one you know just kind of help us understand the competition in mi skin tightening right now you know with this newer competitor that has good skin tightening data but the consumables are high moshe mizrahy chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i assume you talk about thermage which is with solta they just announced that they re going public and they released their prospectus and in their prospectus yes they have three quarters something like i don t know 75 disposable and 25 platforms but don t forget thermage is a 25 years old company they re on the market for long time we are on the market only five or six years 20 of the time of the 25 years that they are so they have a bigger install base and they sell less platforms and they sell more consumable i think that one day we will sell more consumable and it will be much higher than 10 but it s take time to build the install base worldwide once the install base will be much larger than what we have today and i assume thermage has much more than 10 000 systems worldwide installed especially in asia where they re very strong 70 of the business is in asia i believe that we will also see some that our disposable proportion of the total revenue will be higher but right now we re still young company and as a young company with only 11 000 system installed i mean the revenue coming from the disposable is growing and it s growing it s went from 10 to 11 but don t expect that to go to 20 over three quarters it will it will go slowly but it will go nicely we see more and more treatments are being done we see more and more disposable are being bought from us but in the same time we see a lot of new platforms that we install in the market and the new doctors need some time before they start doing 10 cases per week so this is a learning curve we are all wide on the learning curve and one day we will be not i don t want to say like solta and like thermage but the disposable will be a bigger part of our revenue jeff johnson robert w baird and company analyst thanks and maybe we can take it offline in the follow up call moshe i was actually referring to a different company the renuvion helium procedure but again maybe in the interest of time we can just talk offline thank you spero theodorou chief medical officer we re happy to send you an article where we did a comparison study with them so it just got published last week jeff johnson robert w baird

business development ramps on strength of new freeform optics and other new product platforms for lidar ar vr and space applications orlando fl accesswire february 10 2022 lightpath technologies inc nasdaq lpth lightpath the company or we a vertically integrated provider of engineered solutions for the global photonics industry today announced financial results for its fiscal 2022 second quarter ended december 31 2021 management overview technology highlights commenting on the second quarter of fiscal 2022 lightpath s president and chief executive officer sam rubin stated the company s performance in the second quarter demonstrated significant progress in the expansion of our product portfolio and business development pipeline as we implement our new strategic direction at the same time we are delivering with operational discipline as we invest in growth opportunities while our financial recovery takes longer than anticipated following the leadership transition of our business in china our new strategic plan which we began implementing approximately one year ago is delivering the intended results with the company transforming itself into a leading global provider of engineered solutions with a highly differentiated product platform serving as the foundation for the new lightpath during the second quarter our business development pipeline throttled forward on the strength of our new freeform optics and other technological innovations since introducing freeform optics in october 2021 we have been engaged in an increasing number of opportunities for the development of custom solutions which include non recurring engineering nre revenue and other programs which could lead to valuable volume production orders at present we have a total of 8 such high volume projects in development or going through the customer qualification process this is an increase of 5 projects during the second quarter with each of these opportunities ranging from 1 million to 5 million in potential annual revenue and staggered start dates over the next 24 months aided by the substantial completion of investments in manufacturing coating and finishing that are integral to our strategic plan we are excited for what may materialize for growth in revenues and profitability recent activities supporting lightpath s continued focus on growth innovation and value added engineering included new freeform optics gaining traction within ar vr lidar and defense markets increasing number of engagements including the initiation of number of nre projects for the development of new custom freeform optics and assemblies large projects increased to 8 from 3 during the second quarter won the prestigious 2022 spie prism award for developing manufacturing technology for freeform optics secured exclusive optical usage license for the infrared patent portfolio from the united states navy s u s naval research laboratory nrl to access several multi billion dollar markets including infrared imaging and multispectral imaging received funding by european space agency to commercialize materials for use in space awarded renewal of annual supply agreement valued at over 4 2 million for commercial ir vision lens elements completed coating operations expansion in riga facility with volume production underway workforce realignment toward strategic focus on higher value longer term engineered solutions programs and customer relationships m a strategy on course to supplement engineered solutions fiscal 2022 first quarter highlights revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 of 9 2 million total backlog at december 31 2021 of 21 9 million net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 1 1 million which includes additional expenses associated with the management changes in chinese subsidiaries ebitda for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was a loss of 41 000 cash and cash equivalents of 5 1 million as of december 31 2021 total debt including finance leases of 4 7 million as of december 31 2021 capital expenditures of 118 000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 insiders execute open market purchases of class a common shares during quarter ended december 31 2021 this press release includes references to non gaap financial measures please see the heading use of non gaap financial measures below for a more complete explanation additional management comments mr rubin s comments continued lightpath s second quarter financial results were negatively impacted by expenses associated with the management and employee transition in our chinese subsidiaries and the significant decrease in orders from a key telecommunications customer in china which was unrelated to the management transition having rebuilt our management and sales leadership team in china over the past two quarters we are contending with economic and pandemic related conditions in that country which are making our financial recovery take longer than expected the expense and efforts to build us back in china did not derail us from executing on our overall strategic plan success of which we see evident in the growing number of customer engagements on potentially large scale projects we believe that the most challenging aspects of our transition in china are now behind us for the most part and we are on a trajectory for longer term growth and profitability on a global scale simultaneous with our efforts in china we completed the addition of our coating facilities in europe during the second quarter with vertically integrated processes and manufacturing capabilities on 3 continents we are increasingly being sought after by customers and industry partners alike which position us to benefit from the recent broadening of our product portfolio and to address some of the most prominent growth sectors of the economy including lidar ar vr and space technologies the industry s response to our introduction of freeform optics for high volume production has been nothing short of overwhelming there is significant interest in our capabilities for designing systems that use freeform optics last week we announced that our new freeform optics technology had won the 2022 prism award for manufacturing the prism awards is an annual international competition that honors the best new optics and photonics products on the market we now have underway a growing number of nre projects for the development of new custom freeform optics and assemblies as well as other new products growth in our nre programs is the result of customers wanting priority access to freeform technology among our expanding platform of proprietary materials and manufacturing processes nre projects which represent revenue in the form of engineering and development that is paid for by customers with the resulting intellectual property owned by lightpath are expected to lead to production orders that require a series of lenses or assemblies which would substantially increase the company s current manufacturing volumes once in production through separate contracts the proprietary nature of such non commoditized orders suggest that the higher revenue generation associated with the greater volumes also will deliver an improvement in gross margins as compared with the company s existing product lines as such we are delivering on the strategic objective of transitioning into a value added engineered solutions partner for large global customers as they pursue next generation technologies on other operating performance measures revenues for the second quarter and backlog at the end of the period increased from the first quarter we ended the second quarter by increasing our cash balance and reducing total debt and inventories as compared to the end of the first quarter backlog grew to 21 9 million at the end of the second quarter an increase of over 13 from the end of the first quarter following a renewal of a large annual ir supply agreement valued at 4 2 million capital investments were modest at about 118 000 for the second quarter which is within our budget for the year as we had completed a significant increase in manufacturing capacity expansion last year in accordance with our strategic plan while our product portfolio has made great strides and now addresses some very exciting growth markets our spending on research and development remained at under 600 000 for the quarter this spending is in addition to development costs associated with nre projects grants and partnerships which also serve as a testament to our leading expertise in photonics we are pleased to have been selected by the european space agency and space florida to work toward the commercialization of materials to be used for optics in space a key objective of our strategic plan is to move up the value chain in targeted areas based on the technology and engineering capabilities that we have today as well as what our presence in the industry can deliver to us to this end we were honored to have been selected for an exclusive optical usage license to manufacture products using the infrared patent portfolio developed and owned by the united states navy s u s naval research laboratory we are receiving very strong market feedback on our nrl licensing which reaffirms our assumptions that such materials provide significant value the culmination of our research efforts our partnerships and our overall product expansion is a migration to higher end engineered solutions that afford us with exposure to large customers and accelerating growth markets which are expected to lead to increased profitability particularly since it is unlikely we would face the same commoditization and competitive issues of some of our more mature product lines representative of this continued progress and outlook for growth lightpath s leadership made open market purchases of class a common stock during both the fiscal first and second quarters financial results revenue revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was approximately 9 2 million a decrease of approximately 679 000 or 7 as compared to 9 9 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year sales of infrared ir products comprised 55 of the company s consolidated revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 48 of consolidated revenue in the same period of the prior fiscal year visible precision molded optics pmo product sales represented 41 of consolidated revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 48 in the same period of the prior fiscal year specialty products continue to be a small component of the company s business representing 4 of consolidated revenues in the both the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and the second quarter of fiscal 2021 revenue generated by ir products was approximately 5 1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 an increase of approximately 267 000 or 6 as compared to approximately 4 8 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue from sales of ir products is primarily driven by sales to customers in the industrial and defense markets revenue generated by pmo products was approximately 3 8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 a decrease of approximately 980 000 or 21 as compared to approximately 4 7 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year as discussed in recent prior quarters the decrease in sales of pmo products was a result of both the company s largest telecommunications customer decreasing its orders and a temporary decrease in domestic sales in china due to the transition of the company s management team in china these decreases were partially offset by increases in sales through catalog and distribution channels as well as increases in sales to customers in the industrial and medical industries sales in china improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 contributing to the company wide sequential growth of 30 in pmo sales for those periods and pmo sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 maintained a similar level as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in china the sequential pmo sales increase has been driven in part by other telecommunications customers as well as increased sales to customers in the commercial industrial and medical industries revenue generated by specialty products was approximately 406 000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 an increase of approximately 34 000 or 9 compared to 372 000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year this increase is primarily due to nre projects for customers in the commercial and defense industries during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for the first half of fiscal 2022 revenue was approximately 18 3 million a decrease of approximately 1 1 million or 6 as compared to 19 4 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year sales of ir products comprised 54 of the company s consolidated revenue in the first half of fiscal 2022 as compared to 49 of consolidated revenue in the same period of the prior fiscal year visible pmo product

company s business representing 4 of consolidated revenues in the both the first half of fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2021 revenue generated by ir products was approximately 10 0 million in the first half of fiscal 2022 an increase of approximately 430 000 or 5 as compared to approximately 9 5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue is primarily driven by sales to customers in the industrial market revenue generated by pmo products was approximately 7 6 million for the first half of fiscal 2022 a decrease of approximately 1 5 million or 16 as compared to approximately 9 0 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year as previously discussed pmo sales for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022 demonstrate partial recovery as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the decreases in telecommunications and other domestic sales in china were partially offset by an increase in sales through catalog and distribution channels as well as increases in sales to customers in the industrial and commercial industries revenue generated by specialty products was approximately 808 000 in the first half of fiscal 2022 a decrease of approximately 54 000 or 6 compared to 862 000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year this decrease is primarily related to sales of custom specialty products during the first half of fiscal 2021 which orders did not repeat in the first half of fiscal 2022 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in nre projects for customers in the commercial and defense industries particularly in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 cost of sales and gross margin gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was approximately 2 8 million a decrease of 23 as compared to approximately 3 6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year total cost of sales was approximately 6 4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 6 3 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 30 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 37 for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the mix of products sold in each respective period infrared products which typically have lower margins than pmo products comprised 55 of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 48 of revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in addition infrared product sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily consisted of non molded infrared products which typically have lower margins than molded infrared products infrared product margins also reflect increased costs associated with the completion of the coating department in the company s riga latvia facility the riga facility which will improve over time as that facility works through the qualification stages and begins to produce at volume gross margin in the first half of fiscal 2022 was approximately 6 0 million a decrease of 20 as compared to approximately 7 5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year total cost of sales was approximately 12 4 million for the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 12 0 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 33 for the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to 38 for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the mix of products sold in each respective period infrared products which typically have lower margins than our pmo products comprised 54 of revenue for the first half of fiscal 2022 as compared to 49 of revenue for the first half of fiscal 2021 gross margins for newer infrared products have begun to improve in comparison to prior periods as we move past some of the traditional start up inefficiencies of new lenses moving into the volume production stage the yield issues previously experienced in connection with bd6 coatings were resolved during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 which has begun to decrease our costs for those products we continue to see progress toward bringing manufacturing efficiencies on these new products to a level similar to existing products particularly as the new coating chambers added to the riga facility are further utilized operating expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 total operating expenses were approximately 3 8 million an increase of 206 000 or 6 as compared to 3 6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year selling general and administrative sg a costs increased by approximately 184 000 or 7 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year while new product development costs remained relatively consistent the increase in sg a costs is primarily due to approximately 153 000 of expenses incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 associated with the previously described events that occurred at the company s chinese subsidiaries including legal and consulting fees in addition it was determined that one of the chinese subsidiaries is obligated to pay 248 000 in vat and related taxes from prior years which was accrued during the three months ended december 31 2021 the remaining increase in sg a costs as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year is due to increases in personnel related costs and a moderate increase in travel expenses as covid 19 restrictions are reduced these increases were partially offset by the absence of approximately 400 000 of non recurring additional compensation to the company s former chief executive officer which was included in sg a for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and previously disclosed in the current report on form 8 k filed with the sec on november 18 2020 for the first half of fiscal 2022 total operating costs were approximately 7 4 million an increase of 611 000 or 9 as compared to 6 7 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year sg a costs increased approximately 612 000 or 12 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year while new product development costs remained relatively the same the increase in sg a costs is primarily due to approximately 481 000 of expenses incurred associated with the previously described events that occurred at our chinese subsidiaries including legal and consulting fees in addition sg a costs for the first half of fiscal 2022 include the aforementioned 248 000 of vat and related taxes owed by one of our chinese subsidiaries from prior years the remaining increase in sg a costs as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year is due to increases in personnel related costs associated with a moderate increase in headcount these increases were partially offset by the absence of approximately 400 000 of non recurring additional compensation to our former chief executive officer which was included in sg a for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and previously disclosed in the current report on form 8 k filed with the sec on november 18 2020 regarding the events that occurred in our chinese subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the company terminated several employees of its chinese subsidiaries after determining that they had engaged in malfeasance and conduct adverse to the interests of the company including efforts to misappropriate certain of the company s proprietary technology diverting sales to entities owned or controlled by these former employees and other suspected acts of fraud theft and embezzlement the company s chinese subsidiaries are involved in certain ongoing legal proceedings with the terminated employees knowing that such transitions in international subsidiaries can lead to lengthy legal proceedings that can interrupt a subsidiary s ability to operate compounded by the fact that the company s officers could not travel to china to oversee the transitions because of the travel restrictions imposed by covid 19 the company chose to enter into severance agreements with certain of the employees at the time of transaction pursuant to which the company s subsidiaries agreed to pay such employees severance of approximately 485 000 in the aggregate to be paid out over a six month period after the execution of the severance agreements the company discovered additional wrongdoing by the terminated employees and as a result the company s subsidiaries have not yet paid the severance payments and have disputed the employees rights to such payments currently there are ongoing civil actions in china in connection with the subsidiaries refusal to pay these severance amounts due to the employees non compliance however based on the likelihood that the courts in china will determine that the subsidiaries will ultimately be obligated to pay these amounts these payments were accrued for as of june 30 2021 and remain accrued as of december 31 2021 other income expense interest expense net was approximately 50 000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 55 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year for the first half of fiscal 2022 interest expense net was approximately 96 000 as compared to 114 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates and a reduction in total debt of 18 as of the quarter ended december 31 2021 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 lightpath recognized net foreign currency transaction losses due to changes in the value of the chinese yuan and euro against the u s dollar in the amount of approximately 14 000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to net foreign currency transaction gains of 77 000 for same period of the prior fiscal year during the first half of fiscal 2022 lightpath recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of 40 000 as compared to 21 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year these foreign currency transaction amounts had no impact on basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented income taxes during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 income tax expense was approximately 35 000 compared to approximately 241 000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year during the first half of fiscal 2022 income tax expense was approximately 165 000 as compared to 676 000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year income tax expense is primarily related to income taxes from our operations in china including

liabilities partially offset by a reduction in inventory the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the previously described events that occurred at the company s subsidiaries in china for which certain expenses were accrued as of june 30 2021 many of which were paid during the first half of fiscal 2022 as well as payment of certain bonuses earned by executive officers and other employees during fiscal 2021 and the first installment payment of payroll taxes deferred in fiscal 2020 under the cares act the company expended approximately 1 3 million for investments in capital equipment during the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to 2 2 million in the same period prior fiscal year the majority of capital expenditures during the first half of fiscal

in stockholders equity during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is made up of the net loss plus adjustments for stock based compensation for which the expense is offset in additional paid in capital

as compared to 21 3 million as of june 30 2021 the increase in backlog during the first half of fiscal 2022 was largely due to the renewal of a large annual contract for infrared products during the second quarter which the company will begin shipping against in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 after shipments against the previous contract are completed the timing of this renewal is similar to prior fiscal years the timing of other contract renewals may not be as consistent and may substantially increase backlog levels at the time the orders are received backlog will subsequently be drawn down as shipments are made against these orders the company s annual and multi year contracts are expected to renew in future quarters the large contract renewal and other new contracts were partially offset by fewer new orders from a large telecommunications customer during the first half of fiscal 2022 which orders were historically renewed each quarter use of non gaap financial measures to

momentum in the house but some republicans in the senate are raising early red flags arguing that some of the leading proposals go too far or would be too difficult to implement senate republicans are also voicing concerns that restricting stock ownership will put the most burden on colleagues with less money and could dissuade otherwise well qualified candidates from running for office sens chuck grassley r iowa roger wicker r miss roy blunt r mo and susan collins r maine are among the lawmakers that expressed skepticism about the proposal sen josh hawley r mo who introduced his own bill to ban congressional stock trading lamented that while most republican voters support the measure that popularity isn t reflected in the senate gop conference those comments come after speaker nancy

inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades hammering american consumers wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the federal reserve s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy the labour department said tuesday that consumer prices jumped 7 5 per cent last month compared with a year earlier the steepest year over year increase since february 1982 when measured from december to january inflation was 0 6 per cent the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected prices rose 0 7 per cent from october to november and 0 9 per cent from september to october shortages of supplies and workers heavy doses of federal aid ultra low interest rates and robust consumer spending combined to send inflation leaping in the past year and there are few signs that it will slow significantly anytime soon wages are rising at the fastest pace in at least 20 years which can pressure companies to raise prices to cover higher labour costs ports and warehouses are overwhelmed with hundreds of workers at the ports of los angeles and long beach the nation s busiest out sick last month many products and parts remain in short supply as a result the latest inflation data suggested to some economists that the fed could raise its key rate in march by one half a percentage point rather than its typical quarter point hike james bullard the president of the st louis federal reserve bank told bloomberg news that he supported a sharp increase of a full percentage point in the benchmark short term interest rate by july over time higher rates will raise the costs for a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto and business loans that could cool spending and inflation but for the fed the decision to steadily tighten credit could also trigger another recession federal reserve chair jerome powell signalled two weeks ago that the central bank would likely raise its benchmark short term rate multiple times this year stock prices declined after the inflation report was released and fell further after bullard s remarks the broad s p 500 index fell 1 3 per cent in afternoon trading the yield on the 10 year bond jumped to 2 03 per cent a sign that investors see more fed rate hikes ahead prices for a broad range of goods and services accelerated from december to january and not just for items directly affected by the pandemic apartment rental costs rose 0 5 per cent in january the fastest pace in 20 years electricity prices surged 4 2 per cent in january alone the sharpest rise in 15 years and are up 10 7 from a year earlier last month household furniture and supplies rose 1 6 per cent the largest one month increase on records dating to 1967 food costs driven by pricier eggs cereal and dairy products increased 0 9 per cent in january new car prices which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips were unchanged last month but are up 12 2 per cent from a year ago the surge in new car prices has in turn accelerated used car prices they rose 1 5 per cent in january and are up a dizzying 41 per cent from a year ago just as price pressures in some areas ease inflation in other parts of the economy is picking up said sarah house an economist at wells fargo the upshot is that inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high the steady rise in prices has left many americans less able to afford food gas rent child care and other necessities more broadly inflation has emerged as the biggest risk factor for the economy and as a serious threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats as midterm elections loom later this year among the americans who are struggling with pricier food and gas is courtney luckey who has changed her shopping habits and taken on additional work shifts at a grocery store in charlotte north carolina where she lives luckey 33 used to be able to fill up a grocery cart for 100 now she said 100 barely fills half the cart tomatoes have reached nearly 5 a pound which i think is ridiculous luckey has switched to canned tomatoes and has begun using coupons for family dollar and food lion to help pay bills she s also picked up more hours at a harris teeter grocery store but the store is 30 minutes from her house so she s had to spend more on gas all her forced additional spending has caused luckey to pull back on the family activities such as bowling with her daughter her brother and his two sons those outings now typically happen once a month rather than every week or two in the past year sharp increases in the costs of gas food autos and furniture have upended many other americans budgets too in december economists at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school estimated that the average household had to spend 3 500 more than in 2020 to buy an identical basket of goods and services small businesses have also struggled to deal with higher costs for supplies and labor julio ortiz the owner of gaspachos which sells fruit cups smoothies and coffee in sacramento said he had to raise prices by about six per cent on average in november for some items prices rose 10 per cent we ve seen a spike in pricing for fruits vegetables cups and plates he said his company uses compostable packaging but much of it comes from overseas and has been stuck on ships that haven t been unloaded even excluding volatile food and energy prices so called core inflation jumped 0 6 per cent from december to january and six per cent from a year ago many large corporations in conference calls with investors have said they expect supply shortages to persist until at least the second half of this year chipotle said its increased menu prices 10 per cent to offset the rising costs of beef and transportation as well as higher employee wages and the restaurant chain said it will consider further price increases if inflation keeps rising we keep thinking that beef is going to level up and then go down and it just hasn t happened yet said john hartung the company s chief financial officer executives at chipotle as well as at starbucks and some other consumer facing companies have said their customers so far don t seem fazed by the higher prices levi strauss co raised prices last year by roughly seven per cent above 2019 levels because of rising costs including labour and plans to do so again this year even so the san francisco based company has upgraded its sales forecasts for 2022 right now every signal we re seeing is positive ceo chip bergh told analysts by christopher

significant trends we are working to deliver safe reliable and innovative energy solutions that create value for customers communities employees and investors this includes bridging our history as a regulated utility safely providing low cost and reliable service with our future as a globally aware company offering a broader array of services performed by highly adaptable and skilled employees we seek to deliver value to our customers by providing high reliability and customer service and an environmentally sustainable generation mix at an affordable price the energy landscape is changing and we are committed to meeting the changing demands of our customers through continued investment to enhance reliability security and safety grid modernization and integrate even more renewables while meeting our growing demand for capacity we are focused on delivering long term shareholder value through infrastructure investment focused on a stronger and smarter grid to improve the customer experience while enhancing grid reliability and safety this includes automation in distribution and substations that enables the use of changing technology integrating supply resources that balance reliability cost capacity and sustainability considerations with more predictable long term commodity prices continually improving our operating efficiency financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized return on invested capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet stable cash flows and quality credit ratings we expect to pursue these investment opportunities and manage our business in a manner that allows us to be flexible in adjusting to changing economic conditions by adjusting the timing and scale of the projects significant trends and regulation electric resource planning montana a shortage of critical 24 7 power capacity resources is jeopardizing reliability in the western united states the accredited capacity of our montana portfolio of owned and long term contracted electric generation resources covered approximately 70 percent of our 2021 peak electric requirements with the remaining capacity shortfall covered through market purchases a significant number of base load generation facilities in the state and region have been retired or are scheduled to be retired in the next several years which may impair grid reliability and increase volatility in market prices accordingly our continued exposure to market purchases is an increasing risk to the availability and affordability of service for our montana customers future integrated resource planning we expect to submit an updated integrated resource plan by the end of 2022 or early 2023 followed by an all source competitive solicitation request for capacity available in 2026 due to the significant impact of our ownership in colstrip unit 4 to the capacity available in our portfolio the outcome in the arbitration amongst the co owners may affect the timing of the submission of this plan we remain concerned regarding an overall lack of capacity in the region and our resource adequacy deficit in the near term based on our projections of load by 2025 as a risk to customer reliability and affordability as such in addition to the 300 megawatts mws of accredited capacity additions 325 mw nameplate resulting from the prior integrated resource plan as discussed below we have reduced our exposure to our projected 725 mw shortfall of accredited capacity by 2025 through a combination of executing short and medium term cost competitive agreements for 225 mws of existing capacity in the region we also expect to have an incremental 200 mws of capacity resource additions in this period through a combination of new and renewed qf contracts and increases to the forecasted capacity accreditation of existing intermittent resources this reduction of risk in the near term allows for clarity on the colstrip arbitration further development in the western markets and ongoing technological changes january 2020 request for proposal to help meet our critical power capacity and peak demands as a result of our all source competitive solicitation request for long term capacity resources we entered into contracts for 325 mws of dispatchable capacity resources these contracts include a 5 year power purchase agreement for 100 mws of firm capacity and energy products originating predominately from the british columbia hydro system starting in january 2023 powerex transaction a 20 year agreement to purchase capacity and ancillary services produced from the 50 mw beartooth battery project near billings montana expected to be online by late 2023 or early 2024 and contracts for the construction of a nameplate capacity 175 mw natural gas fired generation plant in yellowstone county montana at a cost of approximately 275 million including allowance for funds used during constructions afudc which we will own we initially filed an application with the montana public service commission mpsc for advanced approval to construct the 175 mw generation plant in montana we subsequently made the difficult decision to withdraw our application in order to meet the targeted commercial operation date of the plant the upheaval in the construction market and specifically timely availability of critical components and escalating labor and construction costs due to the covid 19 pandemic necessitates the flexibility to expend capital and make commercial decisions in advance of the timeline established by the mpsc approval docket the schedule is expected to allow the plant to serve our montana customers during the 2023 2024 winter season on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality and us alleging the environmental review of our yellowstone county plant site project was unlawful this lawsuit could delay the project if the montana state court were to require a full environmental impact study regarding the project set aside the air quality permit granted for the yellowstone county project or determine that the underlying environmental statute violates the montana constitutional guarantee of a clean and healthful environment on december 21 2021 we filed an application with the mpsc for preapproval of the beartooth battery agreement as a new capacity resource this agreement is contingent upon mpsc approval of our application it is also subject to the risk of the district court agreeing with the plaintiffs in the litigation challenging the constitutionality of the preapproval statute the mpsc has not yet established a procedural schedule in this docket but we anticipate an mpsc decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 electric resource supply south dakota construction on our new bob glanzer generating station is nearing completion the 58 mw natural gas plant in huron south dakota is expected to be online early in the second quarter of 2022 with total construction costs of approximately 80 million 77 8 million incurred through december 31 2021 during the third quarter of 2021 we discontinued our plans to build a 30 40 mw natural gas plant near aberdeen south dakota originally expected to be a 60 million project to be in service early in 2024 we were experiencing significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges as a result of the project discontinuance we recorded a 1 6 million pre tax charge for the write off of preliminary construction costs our energy resource plans continue to identify portfolio requirements including potential investments resulting from a completed competitive solicitation process in south dakota we expect to file an updated integrated resource plan in late 2022 impact of fuel and purchase power costs montana pccam in april 2021 we submitted a filing with the mpsc requesting approval to increase the pccam base forecasted costs used to develop rates for the recovery of electric power costs by approximately 17 million or potentially a greater increase to reflect current market prices and new capacity contracts on june 29 2021 the mpsc approved our request for interim rates reflecting the 17 million increase subject to refund the montana consumer counsel mcc filed a motion arguing that the pccam base cannot be updated except in a general rate case and asked the mpsc to dismiss the application on october 5 2021 the mpsc voted to grant the mcc s motion to dismiss and on december 2 2021 the mpsc issued a final order dismissing our application in 2021 pccam costs exceeded base revenues by approximately 54 1 million which are allocated 90 to montana customers and 10 to shareholders as a result we deferred 48 7 million of costs during 2021 to be collected from customers 90 of the costs above base and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 5 4 million 10 of the variance these increased costs are not reflected in customer bills and recovered until the subsequent power cost adjustment year adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity we expect to address an adjustment to the pccam base in our upcoming montana electric general rate filing regulatory update general rate filing rate cases are necessary to cover the cost of providing safe reliable service while contributing to earnings growth and achieving our financial objectives we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate relief in each state in which we provide service we anticipate making a montana electric general rate filing 2021 test year in mid 2022 ferc financial audit we are subject to federal energy regulatory commission s ferc jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates the issuance of certain securities and incurrence of certain long term debt among other things the division of audits and accounting in the office of enforcement of ferc has initiated a routine audit of northwestern corporation for the period of january 1 2018 to the present to evaluate our compliance with ferc accounting and financial reporting requirements we have responded to several sets of data requests as part of the audit process an audit report has not yet been received from ferc but is expected during the first quarter of 2022 management is unable to predict the outcome or timing of the final resolution of the audit supply chain challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations see electric resource supply south dakota section above for discussion of supply chain challenges that have already impacted our business activities also as we developed our forecast of capital expenditures we estimate that these supply chain challenges have thus far increased our 2022 capital spend by approximately 2 percent and it may go higher financing activities we anticipate financing our ongoing maintenance and capital programs with a combination of cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures regulatory outcomes internal cash generation market conditions and other factors fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we are proactively seeking to mitigate wildfire risk through development of a comprehensive fire mitigation plan addressing four key areas situational awareness operational practices system assessment repair and hardening programs and public safety and communications this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past several years including our transmission and distribution system infrastructure programs and our hazard tree removal program because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we expect to include a request for costs associated with the plan in our

press release includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this

by matt egan red hot inflation is raising pressure on the federal reserve to take drastic action to get control of prices james bullard the president of the st louis federal reserve bank told bloomberg news thursday he has become dramatically more hawkish and now supports raising interest rates by a full percentage point by july 1 given that there are only three fed meetings before then that implies the fed would have to raise interest rates by a half a percentage point in a single meeting instead of the more typical quarter percentage point moves the fed hasn t executed a half point rate hike since 2000 investors are now pricing in a 99 chance that the fed raises interest rates by 50 basis points in march according to the cme group s fedwatch tool up from just 24 on wednesday in fact markets are now pricing in a very tiny chance of a three quarters of a percentage point hike in march the shift comes after a new report showed consumer prices soared by 7 5 in january the fastest 12 month gain since 1982 not only that inflation unexpectedly accelerated month over month the risks are growing for a 50 basis point rate hike alexander lin us economist at bank of america told cnn on thursday none of this is sitting well with the stock market the dow fell 425 points or 1 2 on thursday hitting session lows following bullard s comments the fact that investors fed officials and wall street banks are even contemplating such an aggressive rate hike is telling just a few months ago the debate was whether the fed would raise rates two or three times this year now there is a growing sense march alone will amount to a double hike peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group told cnn it would be weird to have consumer prices rising by 7 5 and the fed s initial response to be just a small rate hike if you want to get back control of your credibility and reputation you should be more inclined to raise 50 than 25 boockvar said bank of america had been calling for seven rate hikes this year implying a quarter point move at each meeting starting in march but after thursday s gloomy inflation report lin said a more aggressive step may be needed to get inflation under wraps the goal is to engineer a soft landing in the economy lin said that means pushing back on the economy just enough to get growth below where they think the trend is at the same time the fed wants to avoid raising interest rates so aggressively that it panics investors now accustomed to rock bottom rates the fed doesn t want to surprise markets lin said the fed likes for things to be fully priced in the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

president joe biden visited culpeper on thursday to discuss ongoing efforts to lower prescription drug costs for virginians at germanna community college s culpeper county campus biden and seventh district congresswoman abigail spanberger were joined by several virginians who have been negatively impacted by rising drug prices as well as u s secretary of health and human services xavier becerra among those in attendance was joshua davis a 12 year old boy with type 1 diabetes from midlothian who introduced president biden today one in four americans who need prescription drugs struggle to afford them one in four biden said nearly 30 percent have skipped doses of essential drugs they re supposed to take others have simply not filled prescriptions that the doctor had given them tried to use over the counter drugs or pills cut in half because they can t afford the cost of their prescription this is the united states of america for god s sake that s just wrong biden said it s simply wrong especially since it doesn t cost the drug companies nearly nearly nearly nearly as much to make the drug or the research that went into them between 2012 and 2017 the average annual cost of prescription drug treatments in virginia increased by nearly 60 percent while the annual income for virginians only increased by 8 5 percent during her remarks spanberger highlighted why she has long focused on lowering drug costs for virginia families she also spoke about her commitment to capping insulin prices for virginians with diabetes her continued efforts to give medicare the power to negotiate drug prices and the need to actually deliver drug cost focused legislation to the president s desk today is about bringing renewed focus and more importantly urgency to lowering drug prices spanberger said since i first ran for congress this issue has been top of mind for my constituents they are outraged that in the united of states of america they have to pay 10 times as much or more as what patients in other countries pay for the same medication for our neighbors with common health conditions like diabetes heart disease or cancer i consistently hear about how skyrocketing drug prices are making it harder to stay ahead and harder to plan for the future spanberger said i hear about delayed payments on rent or the mortgage i hear about parents sitting at the dining room table and deciding whether they should drain their child s education fund to help pay for their child s medication and i hear from seniors who are skipping a meal because they cannot afford the medication they need to survive these are the personal experiences of virginians of the virginians i represent but if you were to throw a dart anywhere on a map of the united states you would hear these exact same stories spanberger said part of our recovery means stopping these stories from remaining a common refrain in congress i welcome any effort that can deliver lower drug prices to the people i serve it is worth our time story by chris graham
following the 2008 2013 financial and debt crisis the ecb introduced new monetary policy instruments including large scale securities purchase programmes to support price stability and economic growth these tools have also been in active use during the covid crisis these policies have raised concerns in the public debate that central banks securities purchase programmes could have disproportionately benefited wealthy households due to increased asset prices however a monetary expansion that stimulates aggregate demand also benefits low income households through an improvement in their employment prospects and wage growth given this ambiguity over the net equality effects of monetary policy the topic has become a lively area of research and policy debate e g coibion et al 2015 ilzetzki 2021 in a recent study mäki fränti et al 2022 we pursue this question using finnish data the advantage of looking at a small open economy member state is that it is arguably free from the perennial endogeneity problems when identifying the causal effects of monetary policy and naturally the effects of monetary policies are unconfounded by exchange rate considerations main channels monetary stimulus supports economic growth which then boosts employment and supports wage growth at the household level the effects of monetary policy depend on how strongly the policies are reflected in household income and employment in different income brackets low income households in particular benefit from the creation of new jobs as unemployment is typically more prevalent than average among such households in this respect accommodative monetary policy may reduce income inequality an increase in wages on the other hand mainly benefits those already employed and the employment situation is typically better among highly educated upper income households in this way accommodative monetary policy may increase income inequality in addition to labour income monetary policy also has an impact on households financial income on one hand low deposit rates reduce interest income at the same time faster economic growth supports the growth of dividends and rental income equity and fund shares owned by households are mostly held by wealthy households for example according to the household finance and consumption survey hfcs conducted by statistics finland the wealthiest decile of households owned about 80 of listed shares and 60 of investment fund shares in finland in 2016 the financial assets of households in lower wealth quintiles if any consist mainly of deposits figure 1 the numbers are qualitatively similar in other developed economies in this respect expansionary monetary policy may increase income inequality on the other hand the share of financial income in total income may be small even among high income households except for the very wealthiest as in the finnish case for this reason an increase in financial income may not significantly affect the distribution of income across households as a whole when it comes to household wealth monetary policy affects it through asset price movements low interest rates on mortgages increase the demand for housing which in turn leads to higher house prices figure 1 residential property comprises most of households wealth in finland source statistics finland household finance and consumption survey 2016 and authors calculations in the case of finland benefits from the increase in house prices are potentially widespread as about 70 of finnish households owned real estate property in 2016 according to the hfcs real estate property comprises a large share of total assets in all net wealth quintiles and it constituted 66 of the total value of the assets of finnish households in 2016 figure 1 however benefits from house price increases may be unevenly distributed due to regional divergence in the development of house prices house prices may react to shocks most strongly in metropolitan areas where housing supply is relatively scarce and slow to respond to growth in demand e g glaeser et al 2012 expansionary monetary policy also increases the value of shares and other financial assets by increasing demand for various securities and lowering discount rates on the financial markets households with significant financial wealth typically the wealthiest households benefit most from this for example while almost all households in finland in 2016 held deposits only 41 of households held listed shares or shares in investment funds impact on finnish economic growth we look at the effects of both the ecb s interest rate policy and its securities purchase programmes on the finnish economy and finnish households the research design seeks to isolate the causal effect of an unexpected monetary policy shock on the aggregate economy a monetary policy shock is defined as an unexpected change in the key policy rate whereas a qe shock is an unexpected and unsterilized change in a securities purchase programme for comparability we standardize both shocks in that the monetary policy shock reduces the short term rate by 25 basis points while the qe shock reduces the long term rate by 25 basis points we start by examining the macroeconomic effects of the ecb s accommodative monetary policy on finland in terms of economic growth inflation unemployment and developments in nominal wages as well as stock and house prices we then distribute these aggregate impacts across individual households using household level data that contains detailed information on household income and wealth and the labour market status of its members finally we assess the effects of monetary policy shocks on income and wealth inequality figure 2 a reduction of the ecb policy rate by 25 basis points stimulates the economy in finland source mäki fränti et al 2022 and authors calculations note the figure depicts the average impact on finnish macroeconomic variables of a 25 basis point ecb policy rate reduction the presented impact is two years after the interest rate reduction the change in unemployment rate is presented as a percentage point change from its initial level according to our results there are no major differences between the reduction in the ecb s key policy rate and the securities purchase programmes in terms of their macroeconomic impact reducing the key policy rate by 25 basis points increases gdp in finland by about 1 within a two year horizon unemployment declines and nominal wages rise although the former responds rather weakly monetary stimulus also raises both housing and stock prices the effects are clearly larger on the stock market than the housing market figure 2 the effects of the ecb s monetary policy on economic growth and inflation in finland are quite similar to those found for the large euro area member states as reported by for example lenza and slacalek 2021 however the effects of economic growth on the labour market are reflected in finland somewhat differently in finland the employment effects of monetary policy remain modest compared with the large euro area countries while the effects on household earnings are greater small impact on income and wealth inequality in finland all households benefit from the monetary stimulus as lowering the key policy rate by 25 basis points reduces unemployment and increases gross income within every income group unemployment declines most in the bottom income quintile however gross income grows most in the upper income quintiles due to the increase in the nominal wage level figure 3 the central bank s securities purchase programmes have similar effects the value of households net wealth the value of assets less the value of liabilities also increases in all net wealth quintiles except for the bottom quintile where the initial net wealth is on average zero figure 3 the value of gross wealth increases most among the wealthiest households in terms of net wealth leverage plays a significant role in the distribution of the effects of monetary policy across households as a result of a policy rate decrease net wealth increases the most in the second poorest quintile of households these households often have significant housing wealth but also large mortgages figure 3 even a small increase in house prices and asset values will significantly improve the net asset position of these indebted households as the nominal value of their debt remains constant to the extent that large outstanding mortgage debt is typical for younger households this result concurs with bielecki et al 2022 the central bank s purchase programmes have a similar effect on net wealth in different wealth brackets to a reduction in the key interest rate overall the impact of monetary policy on income and wealth inequality is nevertheless limited the value of the gini coefficient on gross income increases by 0 05 of a percentage point and that on net wealth by 0 2 of a percentage point within two years after the reduction in the key policy rate the effects of securities purchase programmes on the gini coefficients are of a similar magnitude the impacts are also small relative to the overall historical developments in the gini coefficients in finland over the past few decades finally we also look at the relative development of income and wealth among the best off households by comparing the top income and wealth deciles with the respective medians these measures of inequality convey a similar message figure 3 a policy rate reduction lowers the unemployment rate and increases gross income in all income quintiles source mäki fränti et al 2022 and authors calculations note the figure depicts the average impact of a 25 basis point ecb policy rate reduction on gross income and net wealth quintiles the change in unemployment rate is presented as difference in percentage points the diamonds represent point estimates of the impact and the vertical lines represent 68 intervals of the identified set the presented impact is two years after the interest rate reduction conclusions in the case of the euro area the overall message from the literature is that while the impact of the ecb s accommodative monetary policy on economic growth has been significant the changes in income and wealth disparities have been on average small ampudia et al 2018 lenza and slacalek 2021 samarina and nguyen 2022 according to our study these conclusions broadly apply to finland as well nevertheless our results suggest that the precise channels through which monetary policy affects inequality may differ across countries in particular they may depend on the structure and elasticity of the labour market as well as the initial composition and ownership structure of assets in the

article no doubt you ve heard or read a lot of news lately about how inflation is hitting the united states and much of the world pretty hard in recent months so what exactly is inflation chances are you already understand what inflation is even if you don t know the formal definition that s because inflation has already affected your level of spending you ve noticed that filling up your car costs more you ve been shocked by spiking utility bills you ve shaken your head at the grocery store checkout line inflation some working definitions simply put inflation is a measure of how much more goods and services cost over a certain period usually a year this translates into how much your cost of living is rising with you doing nothing differently but can also be more narrowly calculated for certain goods such as food or for services such as a haircut for example according to an article in finance and development a magazine published by the international monetary fund whatever the context inflation represents how much more expensive the relevant set of goods and or services has become over a certain period most commonly a year government agencies measure inflation by surveying households to identify what is called a basket of common goods and services and tracking the cost of that basket over time in the united states the largest component of the basket the biggest piece of the spending pie are housing expenses such as your rent or mortgage according to the international monetary fund the u s bureau of labor statistics measures the change in the cost of this basket relative to a base or reference year as the consumer price index or cpi then the percentage change in the cpi over a certain period is called consumer price inflation a k a the most widely used metric of inflation we ll get back to cpi in a minute here is another way to look at inflation it is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time according to a definition of inflation from investopedia the rise in the general level of prices often expressed as a percentage means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods investopedia states so your dollar indeed your entire paycheck won t go as far that 1 pizza slice in manhattan is now 1 50 and may even have a bit less sauce right you ll pay as much for a quart of milk as you did for a half gallon a few years ago the consumer price index cpi the bureau of labor statistics bases the cpi on the cost of food clothing shelter gas transportation medical and dental services and other goods and services that urban consumers buy for everyday living urban consumers include professionals people who are self employed unemployed individuals and retired people as well as urban wage earners and clerical workers the cpi does not factor in the spending habits of people who reside in rural communities individuals in the armed forces and farming families according to the bls the bureau s 2021 cpi year in review revealed some stark statistics about cost of living increases for americans consumer prices for all items rose 7 from december 2020 to december 2021 the largest december to december percent change in 40 years over the year food prices increased 6 3 but the prices of the subset of food that includes meat fish poultry and eggs shot up 12 5 during that time the price of clothes rose 5 8 household furnishings and operations increased 7 4 and piped gas service soared a whopping 24 1 chart adapted from u s bureau of labor statistics what causes inflation an increase in the supply of money which can happen in different ways leads to the loss of purchasing power for example the government can print more money and inject it into the economy by making stimulus payments to individuals lending new previously nonexistent money through the banking system or legally devaluing its currency why is inflation happening now in the spring of 2020 lockdowns due to the covid 19 pandemic triggered a collapse of the u s economy americans stayed home businesses closed or reduced hours factories shuttered employers shed workers by the millions airlines flew empty planes companies stopped investing retailers reduced their stock a recession took hold however instead of a long lasting economic downturn government stimulus spending and the federal reserve bank s emergency moves fueled an economic comeback consumers even ones who were still staying at home wanted to spend money but many businesses had trouble meeting the demand because of shortages in labor and materials as business rebounded u s and foreign ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic and the global supply chains got entangled the ap reported so with all this pent up demand and a dearth of supply costs rose and many of us the consumers have found ourselves paying for those higher costs in the form of bulging price tags and consumers shouldn t expect a letup anytime soon many large companies have told their investors that they expect supply problems to continue into at least the second half of 2022 with the associated press and fox tv digital team references more reading
by christopher rugaber inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades hammering american consumers wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the federal reserve s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy the labor department said thursday that consumer prices jumped 7 5 last month compared with a year earlier the steepest year over year increase since february 1982 the acceleration of prices ranged across the economy from food and furniture to apartment rents airline fares and electricity when measured from december to january inflation was 0 6 the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected prices rose 0 7 from october to november and 0 9 from september to october shortages of supplies and workers heavy doses of federal aid ultra low interest rates and robust consumer spending combined to send inflation leaping in the past year and there are few signs that it will slow significantly anytime soon wages are rising at the fastest pace in at least 20 years which can pressure companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs ports and warehouses are overwhelmed with hundreds of workers at the ports of los angeles and long beach the nation s busiest out sick last month many products and parts remain in short supply as a result prices for a broad range of goods and services accelerated from december to january and not just for items directly affected by the pandemic apartment rental costs rose 0 5 in january the fastest pace in 20 years electricity prices surged 4 2 in january alone the sharpest rise in 15 years and are up 10 7 from a year earlier last month household furniture and supplies rose 1 6 the largest one month increase on records dating to 1967 food costs driven by pricier eggs cereal and dairy products increased 0 9 in january air fares rose 2 3 new car prices which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips were unchanged last month but are up 12 2 from a year ago the surge in new car prices has in turn accelerated used car prices they rose 1 5 in january and are up a dizzying 41 from a year ago just as price pressures in some areas ease inflation in other parts of the economy is picking up said sarah house an economist at wells fargo the upshot is that inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high the steady rise in prices has left many americans less able to afford food gas rent child care and other necessities more broadly inflation has emerged as the biggest risk factor for the economy and as a serious threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats as midterm elections loom later this year among the americans who are struggling with pricier food and gas is courtney luckey who has changed her shopping habits and taken on additional work shifts at a grocery store in charlotte north carolina where she lives luckey 33 used to be able to fill up a grocery cart for 100 now she said 100 barely fills half the cart tomatoes have reached nearly 5 a pound which i think is ridiculous luckey has switched to canned tomatoes and has begun using coupons for family dollar and food lion to help pay bills she s also picked up more hours at a harris teeter grocery store but the store is 30 minutes from her house so she s had to spend more on gas all her forced additional spending has caused luckey to pull back on the family activities such as bowling with her daughter her brother and his two sons those outings now typically happen once a month rather than every week or two even excluding volatile food and energy prices so called core inflation jumped 0 6 from december to january and 6 from a year ago stocks fell in morning trading after the release of the report with the broad s p 500 index down 0 6 the yield on the 10 year bond jumped to nearly 2 a sign that investors see more fed rate hikes ahead in the past year sharp increases in the costs of gas food autos and furniture have upended many other americans budgets too in december economists at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school estimated that the average household had to spend 3 500 more than in 2020 to buy an identical basket of goods and services thursday s report will intensify pressure on the fed and its chair jerome powell to tighten credit to try to slow the economy enough to cool inflation powell signaled two weeks ago that the central bank would likely raise its benchmark short term rate multiple times this year with the first hike almost surely coming at its next meeting in march with the latest inflation data some economists expect the fed may decide to raise its key rate in march by one half a percentage point rather than its typical quarter point hike over time those higher rates will raise the costs for a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto and business loans that could cool spending and inflation but for the fed the risk is that in steadily tightening credit it could trigger another recession last week the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage jumped to 3 69 the highest level in more than two years according to mortgage buyer freddie mac higher loan rates will elbow some would be home buyers out of the market many large corporations in conference calls with investors have said they expect supply shortages to persist until at least the second half of this year companies from chipotle to levi s have also warned that they will likely raise prices again this year after having done so in 2021 chipotle said it s increased menu prices 10 to offset the rising costs of beef and transportation as well as higher employee wages and the restaurant chain said it will consider further price increases if inflation keeps rising we keep thinking that beef is going to level up and then go down and it just hasn t happened yet said john hartung the company s chief financial officer executives at chipotle as well as at starbucks and some other consumer facing companies have said their customers so far don t seem fazed by the higher prices levi strauss co raised prices last year by roughly 7 above 2019 levels because of rising costs including labor and plans to do so again this year even so the san francisco based company has upgraded its sales forecasts for 2022 right now every signal we re seeing is positive ceo chip bergh told

sec proposes extensive regulation of private fund advisers the sec proposed extensive new regulation of private fund advisers under the advisers act the sec stated that it recognizes the important role private funds and their advisers play in the financial markets and that the purpose of the amendments as outlined in the sec rule proposal and fact sheet is to expand the regulation of private fund advisers proposed new rules and amendments the proposed new rules and amendments would require the following quarterly statement rule the proposal would require investment advisers to distribute quarterly statements to private fund investors including information related to i fees and expenses ii compensation to the adviser or its related persons and iii fund performance there would be different requirements for liquid funds versus illiquid funds private fund audit rule the proposal would require financial statement audits i at least annually or ii upon liquidation and in each case delivered to private fund investors promptly after completion adviser led secondaries rule private fund advisers would be required to receive independent fairness opinions related to adviser led secondary transactions this requirement would act as a conflicts of interest check prohibited activities rule the proposal would prohibit i charging certain fees and expenses to a private fund or its portfolio investments such as fees for unperformed services or fees associated with the examination or the investigation of the adviser ii seeking reimbursement indemnification exculpation or limitation of certain adviser liabilities iii reducing potential clawbacks for taxes iv charging fees or expenses related to portfolio investment on a non pro rata basis and v receiving an extension of credit from a private find client preferential treatment rule regulation of side letters side letters i could not provide preferential terms to certain investors related to redemptions from the fund or transparency and ii other preferential treatment would be subject to a disclosure requirement books and records rule amendments the amendments to the books and records rule would help increase the sec s ability to determine whether an adviser has complied with the proposals compliance rule amendments the amendments to the compliance rule under the advisers act would require all registered advisers to document their annual reviews comments on the proposal will remain open for 60 days following publication of the proposing release on the sec s website or for 30 days following publication in the federal register whichever period is longer commissioner statements sec chair gary gensler supported the proposed requirements stating that it would help investors in private funds on the one hand and companies raising capital from these funds on the other he also noted that the private industry currently has approximately 18 trillion in gross assets sec commissioner caroline a crenshaw supported the proposal explaining how it would help private fund investors better assess the adviser s performance and decide whether to remain invested in a particular private fund how to invest other assets and whether to invest in private funds managed by the adviser in the future sec commissioner hester m peirce opposed the proposal stating that represents a sea change warning that these changes represent a meaningful recasting of the sec s mission she cautioned that the proposal i raises questions on the rationale for dividing retail from accredited investors ii would divert examinations and enforcement resources away from the mission of retail investor protection and iii could hinder capital formation commentary by dorothy mehta this proposal may be viewed as a point of inflection for the private funds industry private funds are important to the capital markets with aum at north of 18 trillion and continuing to grow investors include not only significant institutions but every major pension plan private wealth from high net worth individuals to family offices is attracted to the management and returns moreover private funds roles are not limited to vehicles for passive investment private funds can lend extend credit change the direction of public companies and influence policies in climate change or esg the significance of private funds is for better or worse recognized by the sec in this proposal while more regulation is generally not welcomed the practical takeaway is that private funds have attracted the sec s focus and that focus is not likely to diminish advisers must therefore focus on the specifics of each of the proposed new requirements consider which are reasonable and which will impose burdens beyond their expected benefits cftc chair behnam testifies on regulation of digital assets in testimony before the u s senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry the committee cftc chair rostin behnam reviewed the agency s regulatory oversight of digital assets mr behnam pointed to regulatory gaps presented by innovations in the financial markets and said there is not a viable substitute for a functional regulatory oversight regime for the cash digital asset market he described the cftc s fraud and enforcement authority powers for addressing misconduct in the regulation of cash markets through i oversight and surveillance programs and ii other means including whistleblower tips or referrals he stated however that no one regulator has sufficient visibility in this area to be able to police conflicts of interest and deceptive trading practices mr behnam said that while the cftc s main role is to regulate the commodity derivatives market there are some characteristics of the digital asset commodity cash market that distinguish it from other cash commodity markets these characteristics include the following the digital asset cash market is largely composed of retail investors who are mainly engaged in price speculation speculative fervor around digital assets has led investors to take on a lot of leverage leading to price volatility and complexities around securing and transacting in digital assets have resulted in platforms losing funds to hacks mr behnam emphasized the need for additional resources to address issues surrounding digital assets and decentralized financial technologies he stated that the cftc is properly positioned to conduct oversight in this area as its flexible approach to ensur market integrity and vibrancy while also ensuring individual customer protections allows it to evolve along with the derivatives markets with respect to the size of the digital asset market he highlighted that 13 to 14 of americans are invested in digital assets and that the largest u s digital asset exchange reported an increase from 2 1 million to 7 4 million monthly users in 2021 additionally in a letter to the committee mr behnam reiterated the difficulties that could arise while regulating the digital asset market stressing the differences between digital assets and traditional commodities and how that could affect future regulation mr behnam asserted the necessity of taking large coordinated federal measures whether that includes working with the sec or contributing to the president s working group project on stablecoins to properly regulate the digital asset commodity market he anticipated that subsequent changes in this area will extend beyond the scope of the commodity exchange act commentary by steven lofchie the sec s approach to the regulation of utility tokens is fundamentally flawed in that it effectively disallows a product that has potentially very significant economic value see cabinet commentary the securities law treatment of utility tokens while the cftc does not seem the obvious regulator of these products as opposed to the sec perhaps congress will decide that it is better to empower a regulator to oversee digital assets rather than one that seems inclined to outlaw many of them sec proposes buy side cybersecurity rules the sec proposed cybersecurity risk management and reporting requirements that would be applicable to registered investment advisers registered investment companies and business development companies the sec also proposed amendments to certain rules that govern investment adviser and fund disclosures the proposed requirements are meant to i address concerns relating to advisers and funds cybersecurity preparedness and to reduce cyber risk ii improve adviser and fund disclosures and iii improve the commission s ability to assess systemic risks resulting from cyber incidents the proposed rules would require advisers and funds to adopt and implement written policies reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks advisers to report significant cybersecurity incidents to the sec on proposed form adv c and advisers and funds to create cybersecurity related books and records the proposal also expands adviser and fund disclosures relating to cybersecurity risks and incidents commissioner statements sec chair gensler supported the proposed rules and amendments stating that he proposed rules and amendments are designed to enhance cybersecurity preparedness and could improve investor confidence in the resiliency of advisers and funds against cybersecurity threats and attacks sec commissioner caroline a crenshaw supported the proposed rules and amendments stating that robust cyber hygiene practices are critical both to safeguard investor money entrusted to firms and advisers and to guard against market wide instability she noted the importance of investors having relevant information with regard to cybersecurity in order to inform their investment decisions and commented that proposal would require advisers and funds to tell investors about the cybersecurity risks they anticipate how they would handle those threats and the nature and scope of any significant cybersecurity incidents that occurred in the past two years sec commissioner allison herren lee supported the proposed rules and amendments noting that they include important investor protections designed to address cybersecurity risks in a comprehensive way she further stated that our efforts today acknowledge that cybersecurity threats can have a profound impact on the financial system and establish the groundwork for a more collective and collaborative approach among a variety of parties including the adviser the fund board and others commissioner hester m peirce opposed the rules and amendments suggesting cybersecurity prescriptions could be an easy hook for enforcement even if a firm makes reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements she further stated that the proposed rules and amendments are not grounded in the correct section of the investment adviser s act stating entral to my opposition to the investment adviser rule proposal is that we have chosen to ground it in section 206 the investment adviser act s anti fraud provision just as we regrettably did in 2003 when we established a general compliance rule for registered advisers we cite section 206 4 as the authority allowing us to impose cybersecurity policies and procedures this approach does not make sense sec proposes to shorten securities trade settlement cycle the sec proposed to shorten the standard settlement cycle for broker dealer transactions from two business days after the trade date t 2 to one day after the trade date t 1 in order to facilitate the t 1 settlement cycle the proposal would require broker dealers and investment advisers to accelerate the process of confirming and affirming trade information necessary to prepare a transaction for settlement so that it is completed by the end of the trade date certain clearing agencies would be required to facilitate straight through processing the sec stated that the proposal is designed to reduce the credit market and liquidity risks in securities transactions faced by market participants and u s investors proposed amendments the sec s proposed amendments include among other things amending sec rule 15c6 1 settlement cycle to establish a settlement cycle of t 1 for broker dealer transactions the sec would i eliminate the t 4 settlement cycle for new issues repealing rule 15c6 1 c for certain firm commitment offerings and ii adopt new rule 15c6 2 requiring broker dealers to complete the allocation confirmation and affirmation processes no later than the end of the trade date to complete the settlement within the required timeframes under rule 15c6 1 a facilitate straight through processing clearing agencies would be required to establish implement maintain and enforce procedures to facilitate straight through processing for transactions under proposed rule 17ad 27 under this proposed rule a central matching service provider also will have to generate and submit a report every 12 months concerning i its current policies and procedures for facilitating straight through processing ii its progress in facilitating straight through processing during the 12 month period covered by the report and iii the steps the clearing agency intends to take to facilitate and promote straight through processing during the 12 month period that follows the period covered by the report comments on the proposed amendments will remain open for 60 days following publication of the proposing release on the sec s website on april 11 2022 or for 30 days following publication of the proposing release in the federal register whichever is later commissioner statements sec chair gary gensler supported this release saying it could lower risk to the financial system and drive greater efficiencies in the markets he also stated that the release would i shorten the standard settlement cycle which should reduce the amount of margin that counterparties would need to post with clearinghouses and would lower risk to and promote greater efficiency in the highly interconnected financial system ii require trade affirmations confirmations and allocations to occur on trade date t 0 which further lowers risk in the system and iii require clearing agencies that provide central matching services to have procedures to facilitate straight through processing sec commissioner allison herren lee supported the proposal asserting that a reduction in the time that it takes to settle transactions also reduces risk she stated that such a risk reduction would result in cost savings throughout the system as less margin is required by clearing agencies she also added that a shorter timeframe i reduces the volume and market value of unsettled trades ii reduce clearing agency margin requirements and iii enables investors to have access to their funds and securities sooner sec commissioner caroline a crenshaw supported the proposal she noted that the increasing pace of technological advancements is a reason for which shortening the standard settlement cycle may be desirable and feasible she also stated that longer settlement periods could lead the way for other types of risk including counterparty default risk market risk liquidity risk credit risk and overall systemic risk sec commissioner hester m peirce supported the proposal she said that shortening the settlement cycle should reduce settlement risks and clearing costs when there is high volume and volatility commentary by steven lofchie in theory reducing the time periods for which a trade is open and unsettled cuts risk in practice whether this is operationally feasible is the question the various market participant organizations all seem to be supportive so presumably it can be done three states adopt continuing education requirements for investment advisers based on nasaa model rule maryland mississippi and vermont adopted continuing education requirements for investment adviser representatives based on the north american securities administrators association nasaa model rule nasaa stated that these states were the first to require state registered and federal covered

market reserve bank of australia governor phillip lowe is currently addressing the house of reps and has warned of the impact of other countries raising interest rates quicker than expected in response to inflation a broader uncertainty is the extent to which other central banks will have to increase interest rates to return inflation to lower rates central banks and financial markets expect that a decline in inflation to target can be achieved without real policy interest rates returned to positive territory it s entirely possible that countries with higher inflation rates will need a bigger adjustment in interest rates than currently anticipated and if so this could result in abrupt changes in financial conditions around the world including here in australia lowe said that the sharp rise in inflation in the us came as a surprise the sharp pickup inflation in parts of the world especially in the united states has come as a surprise and it s an additional source of uncertainty about the outlook for the first time in several decades inflation has become a major issue in the global economy however lowe did say that australia will continue its cautious approach and rebuked bond market hawks who have priced in five rate rises in 2022 i recognise that there is a risk to waiting but there is also a risk to moving too early we have the opportunity to secure a lower rate of unemployment than was thought possible just a short while ago moving too early could put this at risk investor warning russel chesler has warned that due to rising inflation investors need to be careful when allocating assets in their portfolios chesler vaneck s head of investments and capital markets said investors should look at assets that are better at protecting against the corrosive effect of rising prices companies with good earnings growth for example should be able to maintain their margins and profits by raising their prices value companies tend to be more mature and often enjoy pricing power and therefore are more resilient in the face of rising inflation chesler said also energy companies and commodity companies such as the iron ore miners could do well over the year as they are linked to the economic recovery from the covid 19 pandemic and rising commodity prices gold miners could offer value in this environment investors should follow a prudent investment strategy focussing on the fundamentals and value and quality assets rather than chase visionary growth companies many of whom are not profitable and may experience further losses this year us markets with inflation jumping to a four decade high and concerns over how the federal reserve may move on interest rate the us market turned down us consumer prices rose by 7 5 over the last 12 months levels not seen since february 1982 a 50 point basis hike is now on the table the market isn t just concerned about inflation it is also concerned about the fed s response to inflation td ameritrade nasdaq amtd chief market strategist jj kinahan said the cpi data released by the labor department yesterday has defied hopes by president joe biden s administration that the wave of price increases would decelerate in january biden acknowledged that inflation is elevated but forecasters continue to project inflation easing substantially by the end of 2022 and fortunately we saw positive real wage growth last month and moderation in auto prices which have made up about a quarter of headline inflation over the last year he said driving up inflation are the fed s pandemic money policies supply chain issues component shortages and robust demand from american consumers twitter earnings twitter announced its first earnings report under its new ceo here is etoro analyst josh gilbert s take twitter announced its q4 earnings today of us 0 33 per share on revenue of us 1 57 billion compared to analyst expectations of us 0 32 per share on revenue of us 1 58 billion this was twitter s first quarterly report under the command of its new ceo parag agrawal and it was a pretty modest one with strong user growth but weaker advertising revenue than wall street analysts expected however the good news for investors is that twitter s sales haven t been hurt by apple s privacy changes twitter s user engagement trends are building momentum with daily active users climbing 13 year over year the company has also experienced growth from q3 of 211 million to 217 million something its rival facebook couldn t achieve in its q4 earnings this number has continued to be a focus for investors as accelerated growth has historically been a main drawcard for advertisers the company has positioned itself well for emerging trends such as nfts and crypto after it recently launched nft profile verification and bitcoin tip payments on the platform in addition twitter continues to benefit from indirect exposure to both industries through influencers that have seemingly settled with twitter as the platform of choice as a result this has organically drawn new users to the site and it s expected that twitter s management will look to explore ways to capitalise on these growing trends for the meantime investors will be focused on how twitter s new ceo will improve monetisation on the platform given its growing popularity and us 7 5 billion revenue goal by the end of 2023 parag agrawal is also looking to address its lofty valuation with the announcement of its us 4 billion share buyback program up from the us 2 billion it announced a few years ago european markets were mixed yesterday

jump in response for decades there had always been a clear split between the two big big banks and the two small big banks but now the hierarchy has shifted as of yesterday nab is the second biggest australian bank by market cap surpassing westpac wbc the release lit a fire under the asx200 at least for 40 minutes the index peaked at a gain of 68 points but by lunchtime was flat again likely taking a cautious approach ahead of last night s us cpi release smart move it was a mixed bag otherwise on the earnings result front yesterday with releases from asx asx agl energy agl and downer edi dow landing all of them in the top five losers list topped by cimic cim which fell 7 1 bucking the trend was amp amp up 5 9 by contrast the top five winners list included bapcor bap up 10 0 and megaport mp1 up 7 6 both of which had reported on wednesday and had been sold down initially broker opinions contrasted with market opinions and there was a hint of a takeover offer for bapcor the winning sector on the day was technology up 2 6 given block sq2 jumped back 9 7 having rallied in the us different story today more below financials provided the counter 0 9 thanks to nab while materials 0 5 was the only other sector to close in the green staples industrials healthcare and utilities all fell 0 8 given the index closed up 20 points the asx200 s market cap concentration issue is stark there s only a small number of stocks reporting earnings today insurance australia group iag being one but we re set for a rough ride following wall street s overnight panic having smashed through 7300 yesterday briefly we ll be on our way back towards 7200 today with the futures down 55 the one percenter the suggestion on wall street was that if last night s us cpi number came in below the consensus 7 2 forecast the market would take off if it came in above 7 2 the market would likely not panic as the fed is already well set to start hiking before the opening bell the number came in at 7 5 the highest annual inflation rate in 40 years the dow opened down 260 points but sure enough an hour later it was back into the green everything was hunky dory until st louis fed president and fomc voting member james bullard opened his mouth at lunchtime to say he is backing a full 100 basis point hike by july 1 there are only three meetings before july 1 which means three hikes by then and one has to be 50 points the alternative is one hike in between meetings before bullard spoke wall street had considered a 50 point hike in march a possibility but ascribed less than a 50 50 chance now those odds are priced at better than 60 wall street lost its bottle the us ten year yield jumped 10 basis points to 2 03 but that was nothing compared to the two year yield which jumped 22bps given the market already assumed a 25 point hike in march a 22 point gain in the two year implies a 50 point hike is now the expectation the response on wall street it is suggested was not just about the speed of fed hikes potentially but what that speed implies the fed got it wrong very wrong and now they have to play catch up suggesting a risk they overreact the other way and send the economy into recession the biggest contributors to higher prices in january were used cars by quite a margin energy and then food the used car issue relates back to shortages of computer chips meaning the stalling of new car production used car prices in australia are through the roof too us service sector inflation is not nearly as hot as goods inflation but it s still higher wages have also grown strongly but while goods inflation can eventually come down once supply shortages ease service eg rents and wage inflation will not in other news us bnpl leader affirm reported earnings last night and

a tv it feels more powerful and capable than my chromecast 4k my inbuilt google tv operating system and leaves me with a better impression than its closest rival the chromecast with google tv what criticisms i ve built up around the fire tv stick 4k max are menial which i m very happy to say considering i ve been pretty disappointed with my tv s inbuilt google tv it s a bit slow and freezes often when i put the fire tv stick 4k max beside alternatives like the chromecast with google tv 99 the chromecast 3rd gen 60 and the apple tv 4k 32gb 249 the fire tv stick 4k max is the clear winner the fire tv stick 4k max what is it amazon s latest 4k tv streaming dongle price 99 like terrific and fast ai no like no binge no kayo needs sound calibration less apps than google tv this stick is on fire i love the fire stick i look forward to using it when i stream something on my tv but let s go back to the beginning setting up the fire stick was easy it includes the small stick module where all the magic happens which attaches via an hdmi port in the side of your tv if it can t exactly fit in there like with my tv you also get a small extension cable about 10cms the fire stick is powered externally via a wall socket and a micro usb connection it s odd seeing micro usb again in 2022 but it s not a bad thing in this case setting up the fire stick was also easy requiring you to sign in with an amazon account fine by me it runs through some calibration stuff with your tv in setup and asks you what apps you d like installed from the getgo i selected netflix stan disney twitch and youtube also when setting up it asks you what your tv model is for better integration i use a tcl with integrated google tv so i selected tcl which was near the bottom of a drop down menu which listed hundreds of tvs this took a minute or two to scroll through it didn t set me up for a terrific ui experience but i was soon impressed i signed into all of my most used apps and with the tv ready to go i booted up disney and started watching the book of boba fett with nbn 50 internet the fire stick had a few buffering delays but loaded much faster when i upgraded to nbn 100 however it did have a sound delay this was quickly fixed by going into the settings of the fire stick if you encounter a similar issue be it from the fire stick itself or the fault of your tv just know that the streaming dongle has an inbuilt system to compensate for the sound delay also just quickly there s a really annoying tick noise that occurs whenever you move from one tile to another it s super annoying but it s easily disabled tell me what you want to watch although the chromecast has a similar feature the fire stick s take on it is more accurate at least in my experience if you hold down the big blue button on the fire stick s remote you can ask for the show you want to watch i tested the witcher the book of boba fett the expanse and don t look up with it all giving me correct responses except for thinking i meant reacher instead of the witcher i ll also take this moment to talk about the user interface it rules made up of rectangular tiles similar to the apple tv home menu and the google tv browsing menu with less clutter like the google tv the fire stick merges all of your collected streaming services together letting you cycle through content irrespective of the platform it even lets you do this while sorting through genres like action fantasy or anime it does however focus a great deal on amazon prime video content which is noticeably what you re always prompted with when you start the fire stick understandably given it s amazon when searching through the content in the filters too your mixed streaming shows will be limited to one section to search through whereas amazon prime video content and additional paid and rental content make up the rest of the searching section not egregious especially when you can directly search for something but not the perfect experience i ll also touch on the tv remote and integration very quickly remember when i said that it asks for your type of tv that was because the remote can actually act as your tv remote except for controlling tv and apps outside of the fire stick the fire stick remote can control tv volume and can turn it on and off it can also quick launch prime netflix disney and amazon music via a dedicated button without even being on the fire stick channel i love it getting the mean things out of the way i ve had such a good experience with the fire stick that it s hard to talk about the bad things so let s just get that out of the way firstly binge doesn t exist on this device well it does just not australia s binge the binge that s there is an american app that provides content of its own but not the content on the australian streaming service to all our customers in australia this is not binge the australian video streaming but another us based entertainment app the app reads kind of funny but it s sad that one of australia s biggest streaming apps is simply not present binge s sports oriented sister streaming service kayo is also not present if you really wanted to you could sideload these apps but it sucks that they re not available natively apart from the sound calibration issue i mentioned earlier the only other problem i had with the fire stick is that it does lack the breadth of apps that google tv has unfortunately another app i ve been having a play with on my google tv steam link is also not present if you re coming from a google tv streaming device you ll notice there are fewer apps that s not exactly a bad thing but i think it s notable in case you use a lesser known app for certain purposes the fire stick is great competition for google it doesn t make a whole lot of sense to me for a streaming device to cost 249 looking at you apple tv so when we cut the price down by 150 we re left with two very strong contenders the chromecast with google tv and the amazon fire tv stick 4k max while the chromecast has the ability to project your phone and has some great technology inside of it supported by the strength of the google play store it s also a bit cluttered and slow the amazon fire tv stick 4k max surprised me providing what seems like a solid chromecast rival with less clutter and a faster operating system but also less apps it s a tough choice and it s tough for me to not love a google product especially considering that i like the google nest the google pixel and don t have a bad mind for google tvs like my tcl but i think i prefer the amazon fire tv stick 4k max this article has been updated since it was published

chinese leaders new priority for 2022 is to defend 5 growth macquarie s chief china economist larry hu said in a note late wednesday that means peak anti monopoly peak property tightening and peak decarbonization are all behind us that does not mean the end of regulation which has swept across internet technology real estate and other industries in the last year but signals fewer major changes ahead the analysts said they pointed to many official statements in the last few months including the past week that indicate a softer stance from beijing beijing the worst of china s regulatory crackdown is over as beijing shifts its focus to supporting growth economists said that does not mean the end of regulation which has swept across internet technology real estate and other industries in the last year but signals fewer major changes ahead the analysts said china s economy slowed to 4 year on year growth in the fourth quarter despite expanding by 8 1 for the full year sluggish consumer spending dragged down growth while a slew of regulatory developments added to businesses uncertainty on top of the coronavirus pandemic get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters chinese leaders new priority for 2022 is to defend 5 growth macquarie s chief china economist larry hu said in a note late wednesday that means peak anti monopoly peak property tightening and peak decarbonization are all behind us peak regulation means fewer and less intensive regulation changes this year as the focus on regulation last year has given way to a focus on growth hu added in an email put differently it means that the worst is over but not a reversion to the past in 2021 beijing cracked down on alleged monopolistic behavior by internet giants such as alibaba real estate property developers high reliance on debt and regional failures to reduce carbon emissions abrupt changes disrupted business notably in factory power cuts and mass job losses at after school tutoring centers but in the last few months official statements point to a softening in beijing s stance analysts said as one senior official han wenxiu said in december the government will refrain from launching policies that have negative impact on economic growth zhiwei zhang chief economist at pinpoint asset management said in an email thursday president xi also published an article which reiterated the importance of digital economy i d expect the government to focus on economic stability this year zhang doesn t anticipate a reversal of regulations just fewer major changes his question is how and when the government will implement the policies they already announced last year such as the property tax pilot program and the registration based ipo reform announcements this week added to signals on how beijing would reduce its rigidity top leaders in december had already removed references to anti monopoly property policy and carbon neutrality from a list of economic tasks for 2022 macquarie s hu said steelmakers get another five years to reduce emissions then on monday china s top economic planning agency and two ministries delayed the target year for the steel industry to reach peak carbon emissions by five years to 2030 the extra five years can reduce the burden on steelmakers by allowing them to spread out investments in decarbonization and avoid large capital expenditures in the short term moody s analysts said in a note wednesday they don t expect the change to affect the nation s goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 the government will continue to implement strict control over steel capacity and production while encouraging environmentally friendly projects the analysts said such efforts along with the extension will also help support stability in steel supply and prices on tuesday the people s bank of china announced loans for affordable rental housing would not count toward the limited amount banks can lend to the property sector freeing up more capital to support the real estate industry more communication with markets that same day the chinese communist party s official newspaper people s daily published an editorial stating that while rules on the use of capital are needed to reduce monopolistic behavior among others the economy still needs capital for growth beijing s crackdown on alleged monopolistic behavior has particularly targeted internet technology companies like alibaba that are listed in the u s this and other policy developments since chinese ride hailing company didi listed in new york in late june have given international investors pause on putting money into the country the people s daily article suggests regulatory curbs on the internet sector will stay in place but will likely become more rules based with fading uncertainty as the regulatory framework takes shape bruce pang head of strategy and macro research at china renaissance said in a note tuesday regulation in line with political themes such as common prosperity moderate wealth for all rather than a few and sustainable development will remain pang said but we think the authorities have begun to carefully manage the pace and intensity of the regulatory campaign in order to complete major economic and social development targets set for the next 5 10 years he noted how chinese officials have started to communicate better with the market about the motives and reasons for regulation as well as areas of future government scrutiny investor concerns may be driven less by the substance of proposed regulations and more by communication he said the shanghai composite is up more than 3 this week the first trading week of the month due to a holiday after falling by more than 7 5 in january the hang seng index is up more than 4 this month after gains of 1 7 in january kraneshares csi china internet etf kweb a u s listed exchange traded fund that includes chinese stocks listed abroad plunged by more than 50 last year amid regulatory uncertainty the etf is up 5 4 so far in 2022 not the end of regulation peak regulation is certainly not the end of regulation macquarie s hu said in his report he pointed to a similar regulatory peak at the end of 2018 which served as a turning point for a sell off in mainland chinese stocks even though local governments and businesses continued to act china s government system often means local authorities vie for beijing s attention through sometimes extreme implementation measures official language from central government directives then often warns against blindly shutting down a line of business for 2022 beijing has emphasized stability above all in the second half of the year the ruling chinese communist party is set to hold a meeting for determining top leadership positions including the expected extension of president xi jinping s term beyond that of his predecessors the political pressure for stability comes after a year in which the party celebrated its 100th anniversary the country meanwhile had an economy bouncing back fast enough from the pandemic to withstand what analysts have called painful but necessary changes to address longstanding problems now growth is slowing as china also tackles fresh coronavirus outbreaks the regulatory wave in 2020 21 brought many unintended consequences hu said for instance business confidence weakened the property sector plunged and commodity prices surged the consequence of campaign style is that things could easily be overdone as the result top leaders would have to fine tune from time to time decide the time to claim victory and move on to the next campaign hu said it happened so many times over the past one hundred years and will continue to happen in the future

critical 24 7 power capacity resources is jeopardizing reliability in the western united states the accredited capacity of our montana portfolio of owned and long term contracted electric generation resources covered approximately 70 percent of our 2021 peak electric requirements with the remaining capacity shortfall covered through market purchases a significant number of base load generation facilities in the state and region have been retired or are scheduled to be retired in the next several years which may impair grid reliability and increase volatility in market prices accordingly our

such in addition to the 300 megawatts mws of accredited capacity additions 325 mw nameplate resulting from the prior integrated resource plan as discussed below we have reduced our exposure to our projected 725 mw shortfall of accredited capacity by 2025 through a combination of executing short and medium term cost competitive agreements for 225 mws of existing capacity in the region we also

existing intermittent resources this reduction of risk in the near term allows for clarity on the colstrip arbitration further development in the western markets and ongoing technological changes january 2020 request for proposal to help meet our critical power capacity and peak demands as a result of our all source competitive solicitation request for long term capacity resources we entered into contracts for 325 mws of dispatchable capacity resources these contracts include a 5 year power purchase agreement for 100 mws of firm capacity and energy products originating predominately from the british columbia hydro system starting in january 2023 powerex transaction a 20 year agreement to purchase capacity and ancillary services produced from the 50 mw beartooth battery project near billings montana expected to be online by late 2023 or early 2024 and contracts for the construction of a nameplate capacity 175 mw natural gas fired generation plant in yellowstone county montana at a cost of approximately 275 million including allowance for funds used during constructions afudc which we will own we initially filed an application with the montana public service commission mpsc for advanced approval to construct the 175 mw generation plant in montana we subsequently made the difficult decision to withdraw our application in order to meet the targeted commercial operation date of the plant the upheaval in the construction market and specifically timely availability of critical components and escalating labor and construction costs due to the covid 19 pandemic necessitates the flexibility to expend capital and make commercial decisions in advance of the timeline established by the mpsc approval docket the schedule is expected to allow the plant to serve our montana customers during the 2023 2024 winter season on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality and us alleging the environmental review of our yellowstone county plant site project was unlawful this lawsuit could delay the project if the montana state court were to require a full environmental impact study regarding the project set aside the air quality permit granted for the yellowstone county project or determine that the underlying environmental statute violates the montana constitutional guarantee of a clean and healthful environment on december 21 2021 we filed an application with the mpsc for preapproval of the beartooth battery agreement as a new capacity resource this agreement is contingent upon mpsc approval of our application it is also subject to the risk of the district court agreeing with the plaintiffs in the litigation challenging the constitutionality of the preapproval statute the mpsc has not yet established a procedural schedule in this docket but we anticipate an mpsc decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 electric resource supply south dakota construction on our new bob glanzer generating station is nearing completion the 58 mw natural gas plant in huron south dakota is expected to be online early in the second quarter of 2022 with total construction costs of approximately 80 million 77 8 million incurred through december 31 2021 during the third quarter of 2021 we discontinued our plans to build a 30 40 mw natural gas plant near aberdeen south dakota originally expected to be a 60 million project to be in service early in 2024 we were experiencing significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges as a result of the project discontinuance we recorded a 1 6 million pre tax charge for the write off of preliminary construction costs our energy resource plans continue to identify portfolio requirements including potential investments resulting from a completed competitive solicitation process in south dakota we expect to file an updated integrated resource plan in late 2022 impact of fuel and purchase power costs montana pccam in april 2021 we submitted a filing with the mpsc requesting approval to increase the pccam base forecasted costs used to develop rates for the recovery of electric power costs by approximately 17 million or potentially a greater increase to reflect current market prices and new capacity contracts on june 29 2021 the mpsc approved our request for interim rates reflecting the 17 million increase subject to refund the montana consumer counsel mcc filed a motion arguing that the pccam base cannot be updated except in a general rate case and asked the mpsc to dismiss the application on october 5 2021 the mpsc voted to grant the mcc s motion to dismiss and on december 2 2021 the mpsc issued a final order dismissing our application in 2021 pccam costs exceeded base revenues by approximately 54 1 million which are allocated 90 to montana customers and 10 to shareholders as a result we deferred 48 7 million of costs during 2021 to be collected from customers 90 of the costs above base and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 5 4 million 10 of the variance these increased costs are not reflected in customer bills and recovered until the subsequent power cost adjustment year adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity we expect to address an adjustment to the pccam base in our upcoming montana electric general rate filing regulatory update general rate filing rate cases are necessary to cover the cost of providing safe reliable service while contributing to earnings growth and achieving our financial objectives we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate relief in each state in which we provide service we anticipate making a montana electric general rate filing 2021 test year in mid 2022 ferc financial audit we are subject to federal energy regulatory commission s ferc jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates the issuance of certain securities and incurrence of certain long term debt among other things the division of audits and accounting in the office of enforcement of ferc has initiated a routine audit of northwestern corporation for the period of january 1 2018 to the present to evaluate our compliance with ferc accounting and financial reporting requirements we have responded to several sets of data requests as part of the audit process an audit report has not yet been received from ferc but is expected during the first quarter of 2022 management is unable to predict the outcome or timing of the final resolution of the audit supply chain challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations see electric resource supply south dakota section above for discussion of supply chain challenges that have already impacted our business activities also as we developed our forecast of capital expenditures we estimate that these supply chain challenges have thus far increased our 2022 capital spend by approximately 2 percent and it may go higher financing activities we anticipate financing our ongoing maintenance and capital programs with a combination of cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures regulatory outcomes internal cash generation market conditions and other factors fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we are proactively seeking to mitigate wildfire risk through development of a comprehensive fire mitigation plan addressing four key areas situational awareness operational practices system assessment repair and hardening programs and public safety and communications this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past several years including our transmission and distribution system infrastructure programs and our hazard tree removal program because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we expect to include a request for costs associated with the plan in our

gaap as well as other financial measures such as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe

crazyface pelosi a crowd of actors also in western wear runs down a litany of stock republican lines voicing them with exaggerated cartoonish drawls one actor sitting on a horse drawn stagecoach hollers about gas prices the good people of arizona have had enough of you it s time for a showdown lamon says in his best western drawl with a closeup showing a smirk the democratic figures their faces mostly blocked by handkerchiefs draw their weapons the actor playing kelly pulling a pistol pelosi raising a large knife over her head and the stand in for the president wielding a shotgun and lamon fires at them disarming each by shooting the weapons out of their hands sending them awkwardly running away along with lamon the ad also includes pinal county sheriff mark lamb and brandon judd head of the union for border patrol agents who has routinely lent himself out as a campaign surrogate including an appearance in an ad for texas gov greg abbott both lamb and judd were also kitted out in stereotypical western sheriff duds the ad prompted a backlash online as people linked lamon s commercial with the violent attack on giffords and demanded the candidate apologize shannon watts founder of gun control group moms demand action called the ad disgusting meanwhile a former executive director of the arizona republican party brian murray who is now championing one of lamon s rivals as a political consultant called lamon s ad the most pathetic yet i think when he loses he should start producing used car commercials he s perfect for that and that ain t no bull murray wrote kelly s campaign refused to respond to questions about the ad writing in an email to tucsonsentinel com simply we re going to pass on commenting thanks last month lamon s knowledge of arizona was questioned when he incorrectly spelled the name of a major southern arizona city as tuscon in a tweet he responded to arizona daily star journalist tim steller s noting the bungle by calling it mickey mouse crap and apparently blocking others who tweeted about the mistake thursday s video isn t the first time lamon has released a provocative ad as he attempts to bolster his campaign in mid january he released an ad called let s go that included the phrase let s go brandon a shibboleth among republicans that stands in for fuck joe biden among those reluctant to directly voice that sentiment that lamon ad was rejected by yahoo who told his campaign that it would only accept the digital ad if they removed the phrase polling from oh predictive insights show that lamon is in the middle of the pack among the five republican candidates for senator polling far behind arizona attorney general mark brnovich and the former head of the arizona national guard maj gen michael mcguire among the republicans brnovich remains the frontrunner said mike noble ohpi s head pollster however that could change if gov doug ducey steps into the fray or former president donald trump decides to endorse a candidate it makes a lot of sense now why republican leadership has been actively pursuing ducey to run in the arizona senate contest noble said at the same time kelly has to navigate a reelection campaign in a political environment where voters are turning their frustrations with president biden to other democratic leaders and candidates noble said however at this time the freshman senator has a narrow lead against a generic republican running at 42 percent while the republican polls at 38 percent and while most republican and democratic voters say they will support their party s nominee noble said that 35 percent of non party independent voters are unsure of how they plan to vote in november s election according to a poll conducted among republicans last month by ohpi lamon would receive just 7 percent of the vote far behind brnovich who could pick up 25 percent of the vote and mcguire who polls around 11 percent this puts lamon just barely ahead of peter thiel darling blake masters and justin olson a member of the arizona corporation commission lamon s campaign has also struggled to much headway with funding having raised just over 556 000 in individual contributions however lamon lent his campaign 8 million according to campaign finance reports meanwhile brnovich has raised about 1 7 million in individual contributions while mcguire has received about 662 000 in individual contributions and lent his campaign 249 500 overall lamon has around 5 9 million in cash far more than his competitors because of his personal loans meanwhile lamon has benefited from the sale of his company depcom power to koch industries for an undisclosed sum lamon has claimed his company a scottsdale based solar company was worth around 1 billion but it s unclear how much of that sale landed in the former ceo s pockets giving him funds to dump into his campaign for new ads lamon has said his campaign would refuse funding from political action campaigns and special interests meanwhile kelly has a war chest of nearly 27 million for his campaign already including over 25 million in individual contributions while lamon s campaign founders the former ceo also faces an investigation by the u s house select committee which is investigating the jan 6 2021 insurrection at the u s capitol when thousands smashed their way into the building to stop the senate from counting arizona s votes lamon was also one of 11 arizona republicans who signed a document falsely claiming they were electors and could cast a ballot for president donald trump in the 2020 election while the ex president lost arizona by over 10 000 votes lamon and 10 others signed the document and sent it by certified mail to the u s senate claiming they were the established electors lamon has defended the document as a contingency plan and that he was one of arizona s official electors if the election was decertified the republican electors put forth a valid document that said in the event that the election was overturned there would be no excuse not to recognized those electors lamon claimed however the document does not include such language and instead calls lamon and the others the duly elected and qualified electors for the state as the arizona republic reported as ducey certified the results lamon and the others met at the arizona republican headquarters and signed the document sending it to the u s senate despite the lack of a procedure that even allows arizona s election results to be decertified based on lies that democrats somehow tampered with the election results to give biden the margin of victory to become the president
inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades hammering american consumers wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the federal reserve s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy the labor department said thursday that consumer prices jumped 7 5 last month compared with a year earlier the steepest year over year increase since february 1982 the acceleration of prices ranged across the economy from food and furniture to apartment rents airline fares and electricity a dealership sign is seen outside of a honda certified used car dealership in schaumburg ill thursday dec 16 2021 when measured from december to january inflation was 0 6 the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected prices rose 0 7 from october to november and 0 9 from september to october wages are rising at the fastest pace in at least 20 years which can pressure companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs ports and warehouses are overwhelmed with hundreds of workers at the ports of los angeles and long beach the nation s busiest out sick last month many products and parts remain in short supply as a result prices for a broad range of goods and services accelerated from december to january and not just for items directly affected by the pandemic apartment rental costs rose 0 5 in january the fastest pace in 20 years electricity prices surged 4 2 in january alone the sharpest rise in 15 years and are up 10 7 from a year earlier last month household furniture and supplies rose 1 6 the largest one month increase on

air fares rose 2 3 new car prices which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips were unchanged last month but are up 12 2 from a year ago the surge in new car prices has in turn accelerated used car prices they rose 1 5 in january and are up a dizzying 41 from a year ago just as price pressures in some areas ease inflation in other parts of the economy is picking up said sarah house an economist at wells fargo the upshot is that inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high the steady rise in prices has left many americans less able to afford food gas rent child care and other necessities more broadly inflation has emerged as the biggest risk factor for the economy and as a serious threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats as midterm elections loom later this year among the americans who are struggling with pricier food and gas is courtney luckey who has changed her shopping habits and taken on additional work shifts at a grocery

s report will intensify pressure on the fed and its chair jerome powell to tighten credit to try to slow the economy enough to cool inflation powell signaled two weeks ago that the central bank would likely raise its benchmark short term rate multiple times this year with the first hike almost surely coming at its next meeting in march with the latest inflation data some economists expect the fed may decide to raise its key rate in march by one half a percentage point rather than its typical quarter point hike over time those higher rates will raise the costs for a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto and business loans that could cool spending and inflation but for the fed the risk is that in steadily tightening credit it could trigger another recession last week the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage jumped to 3 69 the highest level in more than two years according to mortgage buyer freddie mac higher loan rates will elbow some would be home buyers out of the market many large corporations in conference calls with investors have said they expect supply shortages to persist until at least the second half of this year companies from chipotle to levi s have also warned that they will likely raise prices again this year after having done so in 2021 chipotle said it s increased menu prices 10 to offset the rising costs of beef and transportation as well as higher employee wages and the restaurant chain said it will consider further price increases if inflation keeps rising we keep thinking that beef is going to level up and then go down and it just hasn t happened yet said john hartung the company s chief financial officer executives at chipotle as well as at starbucks and some other consumer facing companies have said their customers so far don t seem fazed by the higher prices levi strauss co raised prices last year by roughly 7 above 2019 levels because of rising costs including labor and plans to do so again this year even so the san francisco based company has upgraded its sales forecasts for 2022 right now every signal we re seeing is positive ceo chip bergh told analysts
chinese leaders new priority for 2022 is to defend 5 growth macquarie s chief china economist larry hu said in a note late wednesday that means peak anti monopoly peak property tightening and peak decarbonization are all behind us that does not mean the end of regulation which has swept across internet technology real estate and other industries in the last year but signals fewer major changes ahead the analysts said they pointed to many official statements in the last few months including the past week that indicate a softer stance from beijing beijing the worst of china s regulatory crackdown is over as beijing shifts its focus to supporting growth economists said that does not mean the end of regulation which has swept across internet technology real estate and other industries in the last year but signals fewer major changes ahead the analysts said china s economy slowed to 4 year on year growth in the fourth quarter despite expanding by 8 1 for the full year sluggish consumer spending dragged down growth while a slew of regulatory developments added to businesses uncertainty on top of the coronavirus pandemic get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters chinese leaders new priority for 2022 is to defend 5 growth macquarie s chief china economist larry hu said in a note late wednesday that means peak anti monopoly peak property tightening and peak decarbonization are all behind us peak regulation means fewer and less intensive regulation changes this year as the focus on regulation last year has given way to a focus on growth hu added in an email put differently it means that the worst is over but not a reversion to the past in 2021 beijing cracked down on alleged monopolistic behavior by internet giants such as alibaba real estate property developers high reliance on debt and regional failures to reduce carbon emissions abrupt changes disrupted business notably in factory power cuts and mass job losses at after school tutoring centers but in the last few months official statements point to a softening in beijing s stance analysts said as one senior official han wenxiu said in december the government will refrain from launching policies that have negative impact on economic growth zhiwei zhang chief economist at pinpoint asset management said in an email thursday president xi also published an article which reiterated the importance of digital economy i d expect the government to focus on economic stability this year zhang doesn t anticipate a reversal of regulations just fewer major changes his question is how and when the government will implement the policies they already announced last year such as the property tax pilot program and the registration based ipo reform announcements this week added to signals on how beijing would reduce its rigidity top leaders in december had already removed references to anti monopoly property policy and carbon neutrality from a list of economic tasks for 2022 macquarie s hu said steelmakers get another five years to reduce emissions then on monday china s top economic planning agency and two ministries delayed the target year for the steel industry to reach peak carbon emissions by five years to 2030 the extra five years can reduce the burden on steelmakers by allowing them to spread out investments in decarbonization and avoid large capital expenditures in the short term moody s analysts said in a note wednesday they don t expect the change to affect the nation s goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 the government will continue to implement strict control over steel capacity and production while encouraging environmentally friendly projects the analysts said such efforts along with the extension will also help support stability in steel supply and prices on tuesday the people s bank of china announced loans for affordable rental housing would not count toward the limited amount banks can lend to the property sector freeing up more capital to support the real estate industry more communication with markets that same day the chinese communist party s official newspaper people s daily published an editorial stating that while rules on the use of capital are needed to reduce monopolistic behavior among others the economy still needs capital for growth beijing s crackdown on alleged monopolistic behavior has particularly targeted internet technology companies like alibaba that are listed in the u s this and other policy developments since chinese ride hailing company didi listed in new york in late june have given international investors pause on putting money into the country the people s daily article suggests regulatory curbs on the internet sector will stay in place but will likely become more rules based with fading uncertainty as the regulatory framework takes shape bruce pang head of strategy and macro research at china renaissance said in a note tuesday regulation in line with political themes such as common prosperity moderate wealth for all rather than a few and sustainable development will remain pang said but we think the authorities have begun to carefully manage the pace and intensity of the regulatory campaign in order to complete major economic and social development targets set for the next 5 10 years he noted how chinese officials have started to communicate better with the market about the motives and reasons for regulation as well as areas of future government scrutiny investor concerns may be driven less by the substance of proposed regulations and more by communication he said the shanghai composite is up more than 3 this week the first trading week of the month due to a holiday after falling by more than 7 5 in january the hang seng index is up more than 4 this month after gains of 1 7 in january kraneshares csi china internet etf kweb a u s listed exchange traded fund that includes chinese stocks listed abroad plunged by more than 50 last year amid regulatory uncertainty the etf is up 5 4 so far in 2022 not the end of regulation peak regulation is certainly not the end of regulation macquarie s hu said in his report he pointed to a similar regulatory peak at the end of 2018 which served as a turning point for a sell off in mainland chinese stocks even though local governments and businesses continued to act china s government system often means local authorities vie for beijing s attention through sometimes extreme implementation measures official language from central government directives then often warns against blindly shutting down a line of business for 2022 beijing has emphasized stability above all in the second half of the year the ruling chinese communist party is set to hold a meeting for determining top leadership positions including the expected extension of president xi jinping s term beyond that of his predecessors the political pressure for stability comes after a year in which the party celebrated its 100th anniversary the country meanwhile had an economy bouncing back fast enough from the pandemic to withstand what analysts have called painful but necessary changes to address longstanding problems now growth is slowing as china also tackles fresh coronavirus outbreaks the regulatory wave in 2020 21 brought many unintended consequences hu said for instance business confidence weakened the property sector plunged and commodity prices surged the consequence of campaign style is that things could easily be overdone as the result top leaders would have to fine tune from time to time decide the time to claim victory and move on to the next campaign hu said it happened so many times over the past one hundred years and will continue to happen in the future

headlines in the us leveraged loan issuance for 2021 reached us 1 4 trillion a 63 increase year on year the high yield bond market in the us was relatively flat rising from us 428 3 billion in 2020 to us 429 7 billion in 2021 in comparison in 2021 the leveraged loan market in western and southern europe increased by 28 year on year to 289 7 billion the region s high yield bond market during that period was up 47 year on year to 148 billion 63 the increase in leveraged loan issuance in the us in 2021 year on year in western and southern europe it rose by 28 after moving broadly in lockstep through the past 12 months differences are emerging between the us and european leveraged finance markets moving into 2022 both jurisdictions saw year on year growth in leveraged loan and high yield bond issuance in 2021 but with inflation tracking higher a divergent monetary policy response stands as a key departure point for the two markets with implications for leveraged finance activity the us federal reserve will almost certainly raise interest rates at some point in 2022 1 in december 2021 the chair of the us federal reserve jerome powell made it clear that the fed will end its bond buying programme in march 2022 rather than in june as originally planned thus opening the door to lift interest rates from near zero 2 in the uk however the monetary policy committee voted to increase interest rates from 0 1 to 0 25 in december 2021 whether there will be more rate rises in 2022 remains to be seen one issue for the mpc seems to be the potential impact of the omicron variant 3 until there is more data the committee may feel compelled to hold off on any further rate rises in the short term european central bank ecb president christine lagarde by contrast has said it is very unlikely that the ecb will up rates in 2022 4 if the us does raise rates in 2022 and europe does not leveraged finance patterns in the two markets could diverge in a higher us rate environment lender appetite for floating rate leveraged loans could be greater in america than in europe while european lenders may find fixed rate bond products more attractive if the ecb leaves rates unchanged higher rates could also impact the ability of us borrowers to service debt although this will be dependent on the size of any rate increases sofr versus sonia a gap between the us and europe is also emerging as global financial markets transition away from the libor interest rate benchmark to an alternative overnight borrowing rate writing in the financial times at the end of 2021 tal reback who heads up the global libor transition programme for kkr noted that libor s successor sonia the sterling overnight index average had seen significant adoption in europe but the take up of the us s libor alternative the secured overnight financing rate sofr has been sluggish 5 uk and european regulators compelled the market to stop entering into new libor linked deals after march 2021 smoothing the transition for market participants in the us however significant sofr transfer risk remains according to s p at the start of october 2021 only 14 173 us loans issued had been documented using sofr posing material risks for issuers and investors as the liquidity of libor linked debt products becomes harder to predict as libor phases out 6 the us is also weighing up whether to apply forward looking term sofr unlike benchmarks such as sonia which are backward looking and based on prior day interest rates forward looking sofr is linked to interest rate predictions in derivatives markets if term sofr is adopted across the us it will be interesting to see whether the trend migrates to the eu and whether european cfos and treasurers fall into line with their peers in the larger us market and look for a sonia term rate in the european debt markets closing the esg gap the us and europe have also moved at different speeds when it comes to esg linked debt issuance according to analysis from mckinsey europe s asset management industry has more funds that can be considered sustainable than any other jurisdiction with the region s esg bond volume double that of the us and asia combined 7 according to bloomberg meanwhile a fifth of the debt raised by european issuers in 2021 was linked to esg initiatives several times higher than proportions in the us 8 in the first year of president joe biden s administration the us has made firm pledges and investment towards reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 this will give much needed impetus to esg linked debt issuance as the us tries to make up for lost ground ratings agency fitch has called for the introduction of legislation in the us to accelerate sustainability linked debt issuance across the pond meanwhile the eu s sustainable finance disclosure regulation sfdr which lays out tightly defined criteria for what qualifies as an environmental and social asset is already gaining widespread uptake from fund managers and investors it remains to be seen whether us managers will start defaulting to sfdr linked benchmarks or whether a dual track system for overseeing esg debt issuance emerges in the event of us regulators implementing their own regime view full image us versus europe leveraged loan issuance by value 2017 2021 pdf view full image us versus europe high yield bond issuance by value 2017 2021 pdf pricing and terms distinctions in addition to moving on distinctive tracks with respect to interest rates esg and libor pricing and documentation trends have also diverged loan documentation has been generally aligned but in the high yield market european documents continue to be more bespoke than their us counterparts and frequently include more aggressive terms offering more flexibility to sponsors and borrowers particularly recently around asset sales and dividends pricing trends have also begun to trend in different directions with loan and bond pricing in the highly competitive us market dropping through the year while european prices moved higher margins have stayed within similar bands in both jurisdictions but after a surge in european covid 19 cases through the late summer and into early autumn a more cautious lender approach and rising number of flexes in syndications have pushed prices upwards in addition us leveraged finance activity has been characterised by a higher volume of jumbo deals than in europe according to s p the largest buyout syndication in the us in 2021 saw medline secure a us 14 32 billion loan and bond package to fund its buyout while in europe the largest buyout syndication only totalled 3 75 billion for a loan and bond offering to fund the purchase of t mobile netherlands 9 european markets however could see mega deal volumes catch up with the us in 2022 from the 5 4 billion debt financing for the take private of supermarket chain morrisons to the potential buyouts of bt and telecom italia should those deals progress the impact of electronic trading the us has also forged ahead of europe in the uptake of electronic bond trading and adopted protocols that support higher trading volumes and liquidity according to a study by coalition greenwich an analytics and benchmarking platform electronic investment grade and high yield trading in the us climbed by more than 100 between 2017 and 2020 more than a third faster than the 61 growth rate in europe 10 the study put the difference down to a willingness in the us to accept anonymous request for quote trades and all for all trading which allows buy and sell side traders to transact with asset managers anonymously regardless of their firm type over the long term however the liquidity advantages of these protocols are expected to gain more traction in europe and see the two markets move closer together differences aside when it comes to securing maximum liquidity and the most efficient deal execution european and us markets are always likely to be aligned 1 u s to

local fishermen this week denounced a new effort that urges thousands of restaurants stores and distributors to avoid selling lobster to consumers the sharp reaction came in response to a draft report released by the monterey bay aquarium seafood watch program thatproposed adding the u s lobster fishery to its influential red list as a result of the fishery s impacts on critically endangered right whales the list guides purchasing and menu choices for more than 25 000 businesses including whole foods red lobster disney and aramark food service that seek to avoid seafood that are caught or farmed in ways that have a high risk of harming wildlife or the environment beth casoni executive director of the massachusetts lobstermen s association said the state s commercial lobster fishery doesn t belong on the aquarium s red list my reaction is like are you kidding me she said the draft report specifically recommends avoiding american lobster caught by trap from the southern new england stock due to population depletion risks to the critically endangered north atlantic right whale and insufficient measures for reducing these risks it also recommends red listing lobsters caught from atlantic canadian lobster fisheries georges bank and the gulf of maine casoni who said she was greatly concerned by the proposed move argued that the massachusetts state fishery shouldn t be lumped in with the entire northeast lobster fishery because commercial lobstermen in massachusetts adhere to seasonal fishing closures and gear marking rules also they re using weak ropes that are designed to break when a whale gets entangled new federal requirements will require maine lobstermen to adopt similar weak rope rules later this spring massachusetts is doing more than anyone in the world period for right whale conservation and has been for the last 30 years casoni said recent studies have shown 85 percent of north atlantic right whales bear scars of entanglement and scientists estimate that only 336 of the animals are alive today experts point to trap pot fishing gear as major contributors to those statistics though it s often extremely difficult to identify where a right whale became entangled which causes many commercial lobstermen to question the heavy regulations and point fingers at other fisheries and marine industries gib brogan a program manager with the conservation group oceana said he could empathize with the massachusetts state lobster fishery massachusetts has been going above and beyond to be a leader on whale conservation he said but overall the protections aren t there for the right whales i m hopeful that if the proposed red list goes through that this will apply pressure to the management of the lobster fishery to change the strategy of the federal government and ultimately expedite the timeline to get the protections in place that are needed to bring back right whales in the past he noted seafood watch assessments and recommendations have been powerful motivators for fisheries to improve their practices and upgrade to yellow or green status in 2015 after the louisiana shrimp fishery was red listed because of impacts on sea turtles it worked to change state law and improve protections for the animals to regain market access the fishermen specifically said we need to sell in whole foods and red listing is keeping us out of whole foods brogan said this is a powerful tool and it can change people s attitudes and behaviors and louisiana shrimp is as iconic a species as lobster is in new england it s not yet clear how local restaurants and food distributors will respond to the draft report on wednesday steve clark a spokesperson for the massachusetts restaurant association said he had only just learned of the issue as such i don t think we will be able to offer comment until i know more clark wrote in an email casoni though is calling for consumers to stand by the massachusetts fishery for any consumer listening she said if you really want to support the right whale conservation buy your lobsters from a local massachusetts lobsterman the monterey aquarium also released about a dozen other draft assessments for fisheries that pose risks to the survival of the endangered north atlantic right whale those include the jonah crab fishery and other trap pot and gillnet fisheries the seafood watch program is accepting public comments on the assessments until feb 28 after that it will issue a final report casoni said her association will submit a comment asking for the aquarium to help the massachusetts lobster fishery retain market access by putting it on the yellow list which urges consumers to buy but be aware there are concerns
intra arterial thrombolysis after reestablishing flow with mechanical thrombectomy improved outcomes in acute ischemic stroke according to a small randomized trial although its premature termination may mandate another for confirmation the combination strategy increased the chances of an excellent 90 day outcome as indicated by a modified rankin scale score of 0 1 by an adjusted absolute 18 4 compared with thrombectomy with intra arterial placebo 59 0 vs 40 3 p 0 047 safety outcomes were at least as good with intra arterial alteplase use in the trial angel chamorro md phd of the hospital clinic of barcelona spain reported at the american stroke association s international stroke conference isc held virtually and in person in new orleans and simultaneously online in jama these remarkable findings may add stock to a provocative theory that micro occlusions that persist in the capillaries after gross revascularization cause damage through edema vasoconstriction and inflammation noted pooja khatri md msc of the university of cincinnati in ohio in an accompanying editorial at the late breaking clinical trial session chamorro pointed to mechanistic support from the trial s finding of benefits in neurologic outcomes despite no significant impact on angiographic flow improvements 9 expanded tici score improvement in the intra arterial alteplase group versus 8 in the placebo group five vs four patients the clinical versus angiographic mismatch stresses the limitations of cerebral angiography to predict stroke outcomes and highlights the relevance of the microcirculation to improve the clinical efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy chamorro concluded however because of study limitations these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication the researchers cautioned the trial reached only 60 of the enrollment it had been planned and powered for before their placebo reached its shelf life expiration the supplier informed the researchers in march 2020 when the covid pandemic began that the placebo could not be restocked khatri pointed to the wide 95 confidence intervals in the primary endpoint and the small sample size of the trial that had provided power to detect a 21 effect size which is larger than that observed in pivotal trials of intravenous thrombolysis khatri noted the researchers also acknowledged that trials with early termination risk overestimating the treatment effect their initial chemical optimization of cerebral embolectomy choice trial randomized 121 patients with large vessel occlusion with

intra arterial alteplase may in whole or in part simply be replacing the withheld intravenous alteplase another concern was an imbalance in the groups as the intra arterial alteplase group had 40 minute faster onset to study drug initiation which khatri wrote could be an especially important confounder given the well established strong time dependence of the benefit of angiographic reperfusion on clinical outcome this difference could contribute to a 5 to 10 higher rate of excellent outcome but for a phase iib trial the signal of efficacy was there and more importantly the safety no

there s been a quantum shift in the relationship between the world s two largest authoritarian powers said former australian prime minister kevin rudd the shift is represented by the 5 300 word joint statement by china s xi jinping and russia s vladimir putin outlining their intended collaboration to redistribute global power former us national security advisor stephen hadley who joined rudd at an atlantic council front page event co hosted by the asia society and the council s global china hub called the statement a manifesto for their global leadership warning that russia and china are making the case for taking charge of the international system assuming a role they believe the united states has abdicated but as the crisis in eastern europe continues just how far is china willing to go to help russia are there parallels between ukraine and taiwan and what should the united states do about this hadley and rudd dove into those challenging questions at thursday s event moderated by susan glasser of the new yorker here are more highlights from the discussion depends on your definition of democracy three aspects of the joint statement jumped out to rudd first by coming out against nato expansion it is the first time that china has issued direct commentary on the topic second it amounts to an explicit china russia position opposing the aukus defense pact that will send nuclear powered submarines to australia third it includes china s endorsement for russia s proposed long term legally binding security guarantees in europe taken together the repositioning represents china becoming a global security actor in a way which i personally have not seen them do before said rudd hadley noted that contrary to public perception the countries claim they are supporters of the international order as defined by the united nations and even claim that they are democratic it shows the power of the democratic principle that even russia and china have to say that they embrace it he explained arguing that while they certainly have a different definition of democracy than the west they don t plug authoritarianism as the new or better global model while the partnership has good running room according to hadley china and russia are going to bump up against ultimately some constraints over the arctic central asia and nuclear capability where their interests conflict rudd agreed but warned that it would be wrong to assume that this will not get bigger and broader in scope over time and that it behooves the west to see this as being enduring and consequential for foreign policy reading the ukraine tea leaves hadley believes that if russia were to invade ukraine china will not formally endorse it because it recognizes the ukrainian government and largely opposes foreign interventions but hadley predicted that in such a scenario china would blame the united states and blame the west for provoking it and for failing to take into account russia s legitimate security interests and if the united states and europe slap on sanctions hadley said that china will likely help russia circumvent or avoid or overcome them rudd agreed saying that putin s principal concern with china is to build financial support and access to financial markets if it is removed from the swift international banking transaction system hadley gave the biden administration credit for being very public about what putin is doing and for the way rallied the allies but he wished the united states had left more ambiguity about the possibility of a military response for ukraine he also said he thought the united states should have moved heavier equipment earlier is a russian invasion even likely putin is not a bluffer hadley said he may gradually pull back but he s pretty far out on this one hadley added that the sheer magnitude of russia s troop movements makes it very difficult for to back down tracking taiwan rudd noted that china is not looking to ukraine for a template of what it can achieve in taiwan we shouldn t overread the significance of actions or non actions vis à vis the ukraine scenarios in xi s calculations on taiwan china will wait until they nationally believe they are militarily ready rudd said which would require the people s liberation army to certify to xi that its forces will defeat the us and taiwanese militaries in a taiwan crisis in which washington intervenes probable is not a word that xi jinping wants to hear rudd said he wants to hear definitely win according to rudd that isn t likely in the next year or even decade it lies in the 2030s until then china will be watching global crises like the one over ukraine to update their analysis about american power and rudd added that he was concerned about the aggregation of any perception of american lack of strategic resolve long term friends and foes hadley explained that when russia invaded georgia in 2008 the view in the george w bush administration was tomorrow will be ukraine and the day after it will be the baltic states so we threw us russia relations in the toilet he added now russia and china have a better relationship with each other than either of them has with the united states and that is our problem but that isn t attributable to anything the united states did hadley argued what really brings them together is a common threat not by what america did but in some sense what america is their narrative is the united states does not accept the legitimacy of either regime and that they need to resist america and its democratic proselytization while addressing these strategically aligned partners the united states will have to be wary of the real challenge as hadley put it overstretching if we have to be engaged in a substantial way in europe asia and the middle east the only way we re going to manage is to do it with friends and allies he said katherine walla is an assistant director of editorial at the atlantic council further reading related experts katherine walla and stephen j hadley image russian president vladimir putin attends a meeting with chinese president xi jinping in beijing china on february 4

of trading on the new york and toronto stock exchanges the latter of which still represents the largest tech ipo in canadian history to the successful integration of our game changing ai services acquisitions each one of us across our entire organization brought their very best to deliver on our growth strategy in 2021 despite the challenges of operating during a prolonged global pandemic as our business continues to evolve what has remained a constant is our team s unwavering commitment to service excellence for our clients and by extension to their customers equally important is our commitment to the care of our team members around the world after all it is these highly engaged and talented individuals that breathe life into the innovative solutions we design build and deliver for our more than 600 global clients our financial results reflect the success of our team s efforts with total revenue of 2 2 billion in 2021 this represents an impressive 39 growth rate versus 2020 our profitability also remains robust with a 38 year over year increase in annual adjusted ebitda and an annual ebitda margin of 24 6 in 2021 given the backdrop of the broader macroeconomic environment including possible rising interest rates and continued pandemic uncertainty we believe ti offers an attractive destination for capital and delivers real value to shareholders through our long standing commitment to profitable growth and focus on cash flow our global sales team ended the year on a high note adding several new marquee clients in q4 and with a replenished sales funnel once again comfortably in excess of 2 billion some of the exciting brands we welcome to telus international in the fourth quarter include a top u s wireless carrier a rapidly growing australian software company a large manufacturer for the global pc gaming market and a pioneer in modern computer graphics and a leading american software developer for marketing sales and customer service we also expanded the scope and breadth of our engagements with many existing clients including the world s largest e commerce company the world s largest technology company one of the top american cryptocurrency exchange platforms a digital banking services company and one of the world s largest consumer electronics companies these represent high quality multimillion dollar longer term growth opportunities with expected revenues ramping up throughout 2022 and beyond i am so pleased to see that our team s consistent delivery is being rewarded with even more share of wallet from these large global brands further solidifying our relationships with these valuable clients i ll now turn to one of my favorite parts of these calls sharing some specific examples that better illuminate and bring to light how we serve our clients i ll begin with one of our clients where we started our relationship on the cx support side but which has since evolved to include other services across our end to end design build delivery continuum this particular project involves the enablement of database automation for a leading healthcare app that tracks the subscriber s food intake and exercise habits our team is helping to automate the client s nutrition information data by building a bot platform that enhances the search process for retrieving accurate nutritional data values for a variety of food items we re also embedding an ai powered categorization of each food item as per our client s predefined food groupings and we set up automation tools to remove redundant food items from data queues we also continue to partner with this client on our premium customer care support services encompassing several regions and languages across our global team member base meeting this client s increasing demand for high value support as they grow their business another engagement that i ll highlight was for a large western canadian utility company that required advisory services and support to manage its transition to a modernized microsoft exchange platform and in particular an upgraded email application the client was seeking a partner that could ensure the stability and security of their technology infrastructure transformation while augmenting technical support in the process our team managed this project end to end transitioning the client s environment to a hybrid of exchange online office 365 and exchange on prem in total our team successfully migrated over 13 000 mailboxes while concurrently managing the registration of nearly 6 000 users to mobile solutions unlocking an enhanced user experience for their team members all while leveraging microsoft s modernized technology platform i d also like to share some recent examples of our ai powered solutions in action one of our clients is the leading flood mapping platform designed to protect the world s most climate vulnerable communities the client s in house machine learning team built complex 2d and 3d semantic segmentation data sets to detect water bodies in urban areas with the satellite imagery collected using multiple sensors like radar and camera and in differing weather conditions the original images collected by the client lacked consistency due to varying time stamps and included many distortions from sensors detecting water bodies and clouds our solution for this client included setting up data pipeline integrations via api connectors with the 2d and 3d sensor outputs uploaded to our proprietary labeling platform we then provided real time human in the loop data labeling delivering faster and more accurate results with our high precision 2d and 3d tools we also ensured there were advanced quality process controls at each step in total our team accurately classified 100 000 documents in six months labeled and transcribed 116 000 fields and helped automate 80 of the process as an outcome our advanced quality control tools and expedient feedback mechanisms ensured 95 accuracy for all data labeling outputs we re also supporting several ai focused projects for the world s largest e commerce company tapping into our ai community of more than 1 million individuals to collect quality data for our clients to train its ai algorithms one example involves our collection of ultrasound waves for audio and video data in participating homes across multiple countries we use highly advanced and confidential hardware and software to capture sound waves in different scenarios such as the noise from vacuum cleaners air conditioners blenders and different kinds of music or radio while participants perform common domestic actions like moving around their homes and cooking a meal this is a very fast paced project with many moving parts all managed by our team from the logistics sourcing and training efforts to set up and management of collection spaces onboarding and training of local teams data management and quality assurance for each country in scope our team successfully recruits and trains local teams and once the project starts nearly every collection session requires a new technical setup as the type of home device and its positioning needs to be carefully managed to achieve quality data collection of very specific background noises for the client s database this is a project that requires extreme attention to detail to ensure we meet the clients requirements for collection and delivery of high quality data to help power our clients machine learning systems for another client one of the world s most popular video focused social networking services we transcribe and annotate short audio clips in multiple languages the client uses our ai data as a critical input to train its transcription algorithms to improve the user experience on its network to promote transparency and safety as it relates to the network s content and to mitigate the risk of being banned in certain countries or regions due to content regulations that are continuously evolving while this client has several partners within its ecosystem we re particularly proud of the fact that our team continues to set the bar for quality extremely high as we ve consistently received feedback that we are this client s top performing partner for this program in terms of quality productivity and brand reputation management as the challenging pandemic environment persists we continue to enable the vast majority of our team members to work remotely at the end of 2021 approximately 75 of our global team members continued to work safely and productively from home for many organizations the pandemic brought to light the critical importance of building a support of resilient workplace with a focus on the wellness and safety of employees i m very proud to say that at telus international this has always been top of mind since our inception over many years we ve developed a unique and thoughtful approach to prioritizing the well being of our team members driven by

international dr rattrie is a leading chartered psychologist researcher and author and she is a key contributor to ensuring telus international continues to keep ahead of our commitment to team members and enables us to arm them with all the tools and support they need to remain successful in their critical roles through an annual employee survey conducted by kincentric a third party organization with decades of experience in employee engagement our company s global score in 2021 was over 80 marking the eighth consecutive year that we are ranked in the top quartile of all organizations of comparable size and global footprint we see the benefits of an engaged team shine through in the impressive results we ve achieved to date despite the unprecedented conditions we ve been operating within since early 2020 i believe this is due to many years of hard work building and fostering our caring culture on that note i want to sincerely thank our team members for their enduring commitment to our organization and for their contributions to yet another highly successful year at telus international for our customers and for our communities where we live work and serve indeed harnessing our team s minds hearts and hands to make a difference on our planet s biggest challenges while partnering with clients who feel the same way is the basis of our environmental social

adhering to principles of strong corporate governance telus international will continue to be driven by esg priorities and principles and i look forward to progressing our holistic and strategic

first principles and technologies among other capabilities to transform their clients customer experience moreover in december telus international was named a leader on idc s worldwide digital customer care services 2021 to 2022 marketscape again external validation of our team s focus on and passion in delighting our clients with that i ll now pass the call over to our chief financial officer vanessa kanu to take you through our financial results and then as always i ll be back on the line to answer your questions vanessa over to you vanessa kanu chief financial officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today as jason mentioned at the start of the call some of the items i will review this morning are non gaap measures for descriptions and a reconciliation of our gaap to non gaap measures please see our earnings release from earlier this morning to echo what jeff said 2021 was indeed a great year for telus international with revenue growth of 39 for the full year reflecting strong contributions from organic business growth and acquisitions adjusted ebitda increased 38 and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41 year over year these robust double digit growth rates are toward the high end of our previously raised outlook and demonstrates consistent execution on our growth strategy this was in spite of euro related foreign exchange headwinds in the second half of the year and in q4 in particular headwinds that were not assumed in our original outlook let me now expand upon some components of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year revenues for q4 were 600 million up 36 year over year our organic revenue growth was 15 or 17 in constant currency as our q4 results included foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 2 when compared to the same period in the prior year driven by the euro to u s dollar exchange rate this strong organic growth reflects increasing demand for our services provided to new and existing clients alike prior acquisitions contributed revenue growth of 21 year over year and related to our acquisition of what is now called telus international ai data solutions on a full year basis we delivered a record 2 2 billion in revenue reflecting growth of 39 as i mentioned earlier with organic revenue growth of 268 million or 17 we have executed on our strategic goal of targeting sustainable organic revenue growth in the mid to high teens on a full year basis the annual organic growth included a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 2 looking at revenue by geographies in the fourth quarter revenues grew 49 year over year in north america 39 in europe 35 in asia pacific and 12 in central america for the full year we achieved revenue growth of 45 in each of north america and europe with asia pacific coming in at 35 while central america grew at 20 again these are solid results correlated with the increase in client demand for our end to end digital solutions from an industry verticals perspective we once again saw growth across all key verticals in both the fourth quarter and for the full year our largest vertical tech and game grew 62 year over year in the quarter and also in the full year with telus international ai data solutions as a key driver of growth in this vertical we continue to see strong momentum in the ecommerce and fintech vertical with revenues up 49 year over year in the quarter and 51 on a full year basis driven again by strong demand for digital transformation and next gen solutions and customer experience finally our communications and media vertical showed healthy growth of 9 for the quarter and 12 for the full year while all other verticals including travel and hospitality and healthcare similarly posted strong double digit growth year over year looking across our verticals we increased exposure to the higher growth tech and games and ecommerce and fintech clients which collectively contributed 58 of total revenue in 2021 compared with 50 in the prior year so we have not only meaningfully expanded our revenue base but our growth is more skewed to high growth digital native clients moving on to operating expenses salaries and benefits expense in the fourth quarter was 332 million up 28 due to the growth in our customer facing team member base to support increased client demand and higher average employee salaries and wages for the full year salaries and benefits increased 29 to 1 22 billion with the same drivers as for the quarter our goods and services purchased were 125 million in the quarter an increase of 70 million over the same period last year for the full year goods and services purchased were 432 million an increase of 188 million from the prior year this increase was largely driven by our acquisitions in particular tiai s crowdsource contractors which are recognized in goods and services purchased and higher software recruitments and other administrative costs to support the growth in our business share based compensation expense in the fourth quarter was 9 million compared to 12 million in the prior year on a full year basis share based compensation expense was 75 million compared to 29 million in the prior year the increase on a full year basis was due to the vesting of share based compensation awards and mark to market adjustments on historical cash settled awards due to the increase in the share price acquisition integration and other charges for the fourth quarter were 5 million a decrease of 80 from the same quarter a year ago primarily due to transaction costs incurred in the lionbridge ai acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the full year acquisition integration and other charges declined by 61 to 23 million primarily due to lower costs for integration in 2021 compared with the transaction and integration cost incurred in the prior year related to the acquisitions of ccc and lionbridge ai this decrease was partially offset by costs associated with the secondary offering of our subordinate voting shares in the third quarter of 2021 looking at interest expense in the fourth quarter our interest expense was 8 million a decline of 27 year over year and for the full year interest expense was 44 million a decline of 4 from the prior year due primarily to our lower debt balance and lower interest rate triggered by our improved net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio throughout the year income tax expense in the fourth quarter was 21 million 62 higher compared with the same quarter last year our effective tax rate decreased from 38 2 to 36 8 primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible items that were incurred in the quarter on a full year basis our effective tax rate increased from 31 6 to 45 1 primarily due to an increase in withholding and other taxes and an increase in nondeductible items a portion of the nondeductible items were results of our ipo earlier in 2021 and we expect them to be nonrecurring the change in income mix among different jurisdictions resulted in a lower weighted average statutory income tax rate for the year as a reminder our etr which is income tax expense as a percentage of accounting net income before tax can vary period over period due to factors including but not limited to the jurisdiction mix of our earnings in any given period and the tax deductibility of certain expenditure items moving on to profitability in q4 our adjusted ebitda was 143 million at the top end of our guidance range and up 12 from a tough compare in the same quarter in the prior year on a full year basis adjusted ebitda was 540 million up 38 our full year adjusted ebitda margin of 24 6 was in line with the prior year reflecting our consistent profitable revenue growth strategic business mix shift and ongoing technology driven efficiency gains adjusted net income for the quarter was 75 million up 14 on a per share basis this translated into adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter of 0 28 which was consistent with the prior year for the full year we achieved adjusted net income of 267 million an increase of 67 year over year and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 reflecting growth of 41 from the prior year turning over to the balance sheet we closed the year with a very healthy balance sheet ample liquidity and improved leverage cash and cash equivalents were 115 million as of december 31 2021 our total available liquidity grew to approximately 831 million meaningfully higher than the 285 million at the prior year end this also includes available capacity under our revolving credit facility of 760 million we continue to maintain meaningful capacity for potential strategic acquisitions at the appropriate time in the fourth quarter we continued to reduce our leverage reducing our net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio as defined per our credit agreement to 2 1 an improvement from 2 2 last quarter and a meaningful improvement from december of last year when we were approximately four times after the acquisition of lionbridge ai as an ongoing reminder we view the two to three zone as a good steady state amount of leverage and we do have the flexibility to go beyond this range for the right type of acquisition our free cash flow in q4 was 29 million compared to 70 million in the same quarter last year and for the full year free cash flow was 181 million 4 lower than the prior year driven by a few factors first higher income tax payments in the quarter and in the year along with higher share based compensation payments from our historically granted cash settled equity awards as a reminder all of our new awards granted in 2021 and beyond are equity settled and will not impact cash flow there were also higher outflows from working capital driven mainly by the increase in receivables that was tied to revenue growth finally capital expenditures also increased in the form of it investments and site expansions in north and central america including our first site outside of metro manila in the philippines to support continuing business growth now turning to our team members in the fourth quarter we added over 3 600 net new team members to our telus international family the current labor market is indeed more challenging than in 2020 but despite this complexity in 2021 as a whole we added nearly 12 000 net new team members an increase of 23 year over year bringing our global talented team to over 62 000 strong supporting our business growth and client ramps across key segments and geographies as you heard jeff say we take pride in our continuing top quartile engagement scores and our differentiated caring culture clearly enables us to attract and retain high quality global talent now on to our outlook for 2022 we expect to continue growing at solid double digit rates for both revenue and profitability for the full year we expect revenues in the range of 2 55 billion to 2 60 billion reflecting an increase in the range of 16 2 to 18 5 on a reported basis and 18 to 20 on a constant currency basis this assumes that the euro in which over one third of our revenues are derived remains at an average exchange rate of 1 13 to the u s dollar for reference the average exchange rate for the euro to u s dollar in 2021 was 1 18 also note that consistent with previous practice our guidance does not include the potential impact of material m a we anticipate adjusted ebitda margin to be approximately 24 reflecting planned wage increases and continued investments in sales marketing and product development to support our organic growth we expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of 1 18 to 1 23 which reflects growth of 18 to 23 over last year this assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 270 million in each of the quarters while we do not provide quarterly guidance from a seasonality perspective we expect revenue seasonality of 47 in the first half and 53 in the second half a reminder that q1 is typically our lowest seasonal revenue and adjusted ebitda quarter with volume ramps throughout the year from a cost perspective unlike in 2021 where our wage increases largely took effect in july this year in response to the current labor market dynamics our annual wage increases are planned to come into effect earlier in the first half of 2022 given the typical revenue seasonality with stronger revenues in the second half coupled with planned investment in our team members and in our business early in the year we expect adjusted ebitda margins to be lower in the first half building up through the second half with a full year average margin of approximately 24 as i just indicated as we enter 2022 we look forward to building upon a strong operational foundation established in 2021 and long before and capitalizing on the momentum that we continue to see throughout the business we pride ourselves on delivering on our commitments and look forward to another exciting year of growth for telus international with that we will now open the line for questions as usual i would kindly ask you to please keep it to one question at a time so that everyone can participate jonathan over to you questions answers operator thank you ms kanu our first question comes from the line of paul steep from scotia capital your question please paul steep scotiabank analyst great good morning jeff could you talk a little bit about how the mix of bookings flowed in in terms of the build to other areas of the business like build and design and how you ve seen maybe those projects sort of roll over into deliver and then i ve got one quick clarification for vanessa thank you jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks for the question paul nice to hear your voice you know i think what we saw through the fourth quarter and what we re anticipating through 2022 is really a continuation of what we saw through the latter half of 2020 and most of 2021 i think a combination of sort of macro dynamics in the marketplace more broadly where folks continue to recognize the critical importance of enabling a virtual relationship with their end users is driving more adoption around automation and that in conjunction with our telus international s expanding capability set and more awareness of our extensive capabilities and the quality of that capability is sort of creating more opportunity for ti to be invited in not just sort of the traditional deliver element of our framework but indeed more design and more build opportunities candidly i wish we got even more of them and we continue to invest meaningfully in our direct sales channel and in marketing efforts and then continuing of course to rely on word of mouth to surface more and more of those design and build opportunities one of the nice current dynamics we re seeing is more and more comprehensive engagements where although we may have started in that deliver dynamic with an existing customer they are now coming to us more frequently than before for design and or build in connection with their own evolution of their environments again i think a consequence of their recognition of the need to do so and their recognition of ti s ability to be successful in enabling them in that regard so i m expecting more and more of that prospectively and we re going to continue to build our capability to ensure that we can continue to take share in that regard paul steep scotiabank analyst great a quick clarification vanessa just the assumption baked into the guidance can you just clarify how you re thinking about we ll just call it net head count growth into the current or the upcoming fiscal year relative to last year should we be thinking sort of a similar pace to sort of what s baked into the implied guide thank you vanessa kanu chief financial officer thanks paul so we don t guide on head count numbers obviously but i do think that directionally you re right we expect to see a similar pace as we saw in 2021 even though we have had obviously macrowide supply challenges we ve done a really good job through 2021 adding to our team member count and we certainly expect to continue to do so prospectively into 2022 so i think you should expect a similar pace and perhaps even slightly more accelerated as you may have noted our constant currency revenue growth is also accelerated from 2021 we re about 15 constant currency organic growth in 2021 our guide is implying 18 to 20 constant currency growth in 2021 so i think you should expect that piece to factor into your thoughts there as well paul steep scotiabank analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan perlin from rbc your question please matt roswell rbc capital markets analyst yes yes it s actually matt roswell sitting in for dan following up on that sort of head count growth question are you willing to discuss sort of how much pressure wage cost and hiring is having on the ebitda margin in 22 and somewhat related to that you mentioned that you re also investing in the sales force and the sales pipeline that sounded strong so again how much sort of incremental investment are you thinking about for 22 and what sort of win rates are you seeing jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks for the question matt please give dan our regards i don t know how much detail i can offer you other than and i ll invite vanessa to top up as you ve heard both we discussed on previous earnings calls late last year and candidly the market more broadly i think we are all trying to find a way to navigate this interesting labor dynamic interesting in the sense that it has always been a challenge to attract and retain engage and inspire one s fair share of talent but i think admittedly in this post pandemic or near hopefully post pandemic world the great resignation as some people are referring to it folks are seeing a slight evolution a change in the relative negotiating leverage between employees and employers and one needs to be sensitive to that we ve seen a little bit of pressure obviously reflected in our results here we think as i said in my earlier remarks that our investment in creating a destination for talent that is not merely providing them with employment opportunities but career opportunities has inoculated us to a large extent from some of the challenges around attrition and wage inflation but not entirely so i think what you re seeing reflected in our fourth quarter results and captured in our guidance for 2022 is a belief that that dynamic will persist certainly for the first half of 2022 and i guess right now it s anybody s guess at what point that pendulum perhaps swings back such that and perhaps driven off of the decline or extinguishment of government subsidies or otherwise labor sort of settles into the new normal we ll find out what return to office may or may not look like in terms of proportions how many people just are not willing to come back into a traditional office setting and expectations around wages working from their home and avoiding commutes etc net net we think we ve done historically a very good job certainly better than most in terms of continuing to mitigate the inflationary dynamics of wage inflation as well as the challenges associated with elevated attrition levels given the impact on not just the cost to rerecruit retrain and wait for those new team members to get to proficiency and higher levels of productivity and profitability but also the ongoing challenges of keeping team members engaged and wanting to be part of sort of growing their careers with the business we ll see how it goes through the balance of the year but i think we re doing reasonably well there vanessa kanu chief financial officer i think the only thing i would top up to that jeff is just as a reminder i think we can also acknowledge that our adjusted ebitda margins today and also our guide of approximately 24 is already among the highest in our industry so i think we can acknowledge that we do have some headroom there relative to many and as to jeff s point our outlook for margin it seems that some of the sort of macro supply side constraints continue at least into the first half of 2022 but to address your other question there we are continuing to invest in organic growth through sales and marketing we ve talked quite a bit about that during 2021 we actually do think that we re seeing the payoffs in terms of an increase in the constant currency organic growth rate and we will continue making those investments through 2022 and that s been baked into our guide as well matt roswell rbc capital markets analyst ok thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tien tsin huang from jpmorgan your question please tien tsin huang jpmorgan chase and company analyst thank you thank you good morning i wanted to ask just on the revenue growth outlook it is higher than what you did in 21 here like you just mentioned vanessa earlier so what s driving the acceleration is it more coming from existing or is it from the back book that s the backlog that s converting and i m curious about just visibility in general how does it stand today versus same time last year thanks jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks tien tsin i guess it s from a number of sources as we shared in prior calls we signed a number of large marquee engagements that are now starting to hit their stride and even more recently in q4 as i just alluded to in my prepared remarks even more so both net new as well as growth to existing so i think we feel rather fortunate that things are now sort of firing on all cylinders a combination of those investments late in 2020 early in 2021 on the sales and marketing front they are materializing in newer bigger engagements net new as well as growth to existing so our optimism our confidence is fueled by that and given the nature of these engagements we have some meaningful visibility through the balance of 2022 and indeed beyond that as well and then as again i mentioned earlier i think the macroeconomic environment where businesses across the entire landscape continue to recognize the criticality of they themselves embracing technology driven solutions to give them the ability to differentiate against their peers continue to serve their clients in an online automated enabled fashion in order to stay ahead i just think right now there s sort of a confluence of events for us that is giving us a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver against this accelerated revenue growth profile it feels a bit candidly frustrating sometimes tien tsin when we re criticized on occasion like after our third quarter results where our revenue miss is nominal and i think ostensibly because of foreign exchange headwinds but we do well on ebitda and outperform and then when we put up the inverse where we re pretty much right down the fairway on ebitda and we re anticipating pretty significant acceleration on revenue growth and yet now we re being not quite as well recognized for sort of fulfilling the audience s expectations it s a bit of a thankless task candidly but i think where we are is in the right space tien tsin huang jpmorgan chase and company analyst great thanks jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks tien tsin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of maggie nolan from william blair your question please unknown speaker william blair analyst hey this is ted on for maggie thanks for taking our questions so it looks like north america and europe grew nicely quarter over quarter could you provide color regarding what drove that growth was there a particular service line that picked up in those delivery geographies vanessa kanu chief financial officer hi ted it s vanessa we did see as i kind of mentioned in my remarks the growth that we saw was across pretty much all verticals if we re looking at north america and europe specifically a large number of our clients in those particular geographies or if we start from those geographies are in fact in the tech and games and ecommerce and fintech spaces so i think you do see some of that reflected and then in terms of sort of key service lines that drove that growth we re seeing continuing very healthy better than market organic growth in the content moderation space we re also seeing increased organic growth as well in our digital cx services and so i think it is more broad based than one particular thing but as we look at those specific regions those would be the key drivers unknown speaker william blair analyst all right great thank you very much vanessa kanu chief financial officer thanks ted operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi your question please ryan potter citi analyst hi it s ryan potter on from ashwin and thanks for taking the questions looking at your ai data solutions business it seemed to improve and kind of accelerate through 2021 so i was wondering if there are any significant factors to call out that s driving this acceleration and also how much of this improvement is being driven by the cross sell along with the content moderation jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks ryan good question we haven t provided that much sub segmented detailed disclosure on this that may change in the fullness of time but just sort of high level indeed the latter half of the year we saw continued acceleration in terms of the performance of that portfolio for us and i think it s a consequence of a number of factors not just obviously macro customer demand but also admittedly inside telus international we re finally getting better aligned and progressed on the integration front so that we could really bring a more compelling integrated synergized customer offerings across both our ai content moderation and digital it capabilities and so the customers that we inherited through the ai acquisitions in particular both former lai and playment i think recognizing and embracing the enhanced value that ti could deliver to them as a consequence of this more progressed integrated offering i think was finally starting to take hold and improve performance and through 2022 and beyond we re excited about the continued acceleration and adoption of those combined capabilities ryan potter citi analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of stephanie price from cibc your questions please stephanie price cibc world markets analyst hi good morning i just wanted to touch on customer dynamics here so a large social media firm reported a drop in daily users this quarter just curious if you could talk a bit of the potential read through to ti from potential slower growth at clients and remind us how you incorporate your client growth into the guidance jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks very much stephanie i mean i guess a couple of things worth noting the first is ti is a value driving partner for that social media client we provide i think unique solutions that are really critically important to their continued growth and success and we do it more effectively and with higher efficiency than if they were to do it themselves in house and given that we re stack ranked regularly to their other partners and we outperform those other third parties as well we just don t anticipate to be on the call it the cost cutting end of things to the extent that they decide that in order to address that macro situation that s the route we want to take to the contrary i think that represents incremental upside for us the other thing i think worth noting there is the related market commentary about those challenges also reference the elevated level of competition and possible market share user base shifts away from their base to their competitors and their competitors are also our clients and so i think that just sort of reinforces the benefit of our well diversified client base and having a number of these platforms in our top 10 client roster serving some of these highest not just high growth tech companies so we re feeling reasonably comfortable that notwithstanding those challenges there s still continued upside opportunity for ti stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ramsey el assal from barclays your questions please ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my questions good morning i wanted to ask about the m a environment i know your balance sheet is at a point now where you have some nice dry powder to consummate deals i m just wondering whether the environment now with kind of tech valuations having really come in has that kind of opened the aperture or increased the sort of opportunity set for you what are you seeing out there at this point jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks ramsey that s a great question and as i think you know i ve been sort of chomping at the bit to see if we can progress this thesis in our growth strategy for some time now i mean the primary driver of accessing the public markets at first instance was to have a transaction currency to amplify and accelerate our progress in that regard i don t know that the call it the rotation in valuation is what s driving my excitement and enthusiasm around this i think the opportunities are probably as robust today as they were three months ago six months ago but indeed i m parsimonious i m desirous of not overpaying and we ve had to be disciplined as we ve always been in terms of what assets we thought were worth acquiring i think historically one has seen if one overpays at first instance one then just naturally pursues i think unfortunate dysfunctional efforts around synergy realization to try and compensate for the overpayment on the purchase price at first instance and then it s just a it s a disaster all the way around so i m encouraged by what i m seeing in terms of perhaps a slightly more rational valuation environment for potential assets that we might pursue and again as vanessa mentioned in her prepared remarks we do believe that we are well positioned given as you say the dry powder levels that we are currently experiencing so when if the right opportunity comes along and that s not just a consequence of the purchase price it s also obviously a consequence of the capability that this asset will enable for us the transaction structure the integration road map i think you should absolutely expect us to see us exploiting our opportunities in that regard ramsey el assal barclays analyst got it ok thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of richard tse from national bank financial your question please richard tse national bank financial analyst yes thank you wondering if you could talk about your ability to pass on wage inflation in the prices is there like a six month lag a 12 month lag and is it fair to say that any sort of compression in margins is really temporary when you think about it from that context jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks richard i think you may recall we sort of addressed the same question last quarter as well it s a bit of a mixed bag we don t have sort of a comprehensive cola language in all of our customer engagements such that we can indeed be fully inoculated from these wage inflation dynamics but we do absolutely have a disciplined approach across the business not new post pandemic but frankly since our inception and part of our telus heritage to be focusing on profitable growth and on engagements that are perceived by both our client and we as high value so we have been aggressively actively looking for areas of opportunity to indeed share the challenges of this labor inflation with our customers and that will be a continuing effort indefinitely and as i said before this is not new post pandemic this has always been our approach to try and mitigate the inexorable challenges around wage inflation and cost inflation that always sort of challenge margin yield and i think our history has demonstrated we ve been laser focused on margin yield not just growth but profitable growth so you should expect us to continue to do that and in as many cases as possible we ll indeed look to share those challenges with our customers i think prospectively we ll see if there s going to be a change to the landscape i think we re going to be in good shape here i really do do i think this comes to an end i m not sure but like i say this has always been when you re in technology services you ve got to find ways to mitigate these challenges and forgive me i think you had a second part of your question and i just have lost it richard tse national bank financial analyst no it was sort of related to that in that whether you would think the impact of those inflationary pressures are kind of temporary and that the margins would snap back but i think you kind of answered it jeff puritt president and chief executive officer yes i mean the only thing i would add to that is remember one of the other things that we re focused on is the mix of the services that we re providing so we re working toward an outcome and this again is a journey not a destination where the nature of the work we provide to our customers is more complex more high value and it too will carry some margin expansion attributes that we can also rely upon to mitigate the wage inflation margin dilution implications of our business and again that s not new and this has been what we ve been working toward for many many years and i think that s going to be ongoing as well richard tse national bank financial analyst great thanks jeff i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith bachman from bmo your question please keith bachman bmo capital markets analyst many thanks and good morning jeff and vanessa i wanted to ask about the growth for cy 22 indeed i would echo a comment previously it seems like a fairly impressive growth outlook how do you think about the growth algorithm between new logos contributing to that growth versus upsell from existing customers is there any way i would assume the vast majority from existing customers but if you could just define that a little bit and vanessa if i could just sneak a clarification in on the growth outlook how much is organic i assume that we ve anniversary ed most of the deals but how much is organic in terms of the overall growth because i think playment came in july 22 so maybe a little bit of help there but if you could just clarify many thanks vanessa kanu chief financial officer thanks keith so maybe i ll just start with the first part of your question which is how much of the growth is coming from new logos versus goes to existing so typically in any given year new clients contribute say less than 15 of revenue for that year and that s to be expected because typically with new client acquisitions new client additions what tends to happen is they start small and then they expand over a period of time and so the real growth in any given year tends to be from the expansion of clients that were won in the previous year or the previous few quarters so the revenue contribution from those new client acquisition builds up over time so as a result of that the way we look at things internally in terms of new logos versus goes to existing the vast majority of our growth in any given year is goes to existing however as we continue with the new client wins who will ultimately become existing clients continue to expand from a revenue growth perspective and then the second part of your question with respect to the outlook it s all organic keith so ai has now lapped into one year so that s definitely within our organic growth metric playment was an immaterial acquisition as you know frankly that was a technology based acquisition the financials were immaterial so that has really not much to do with the guide the guide is really more around the strong organic growth and ai is a big part of that as we continue to ramp that business i think somebody noted earlier the strong performance in q4 we also saw that as well in q3 and we expect that momentum to continue keith bachman bmo capital markets analyst yes that s terrific i thought it was mostly organic but thanks for the clarification it s certainly a positive outlook many thanks vanessa kanu chief financial officer thank you keith operator thank you this does conclude the question and answer session of today s program i d like to hand the program back to jeffrey puritt for any further remarks jeff puritt president and chief executive officer thanks jonathan and thank you everyone for your questions in closing 2021 was a transformational year for telus international and i could not be more proud of our highly engaged team for their passion focus and unwavering commitment to service excellence the outlook we shared today reflects the momentum from 2021 and our confidence into this year and we are so excited to embrace the challenges and opportunities ahead we look forward to connecting with you all at our next quarterly update taking place in may and before that we hope to see you during conferences vanessa and i plan to attend perhaps unfortunately still in a virtual

renaissance said in a note tuesday regulation in line with political themes such as common prosperity moderate wealth for all rather than a few and sustainable development will remain pang said but we think the authorities have begun to carefully manage the pace and intensity of the regulatory campaign in order to complete major economic and social development targets set for the next 5 10 years he noted how chinese officials have started to communicate better with the market about the motives and reasons for regulation as well as areas of future government scrutiny investor concerns may be driven less by the substance of proposed regulations and more by communication he said the shanghai composite is up more than 3 this week the first trading week of the month due to a holiday after falling by more than 7 5 in january the hang seng index is up more than 4 this month after gains of 1 7 in january kraneshares csi china internet etf kweb a u s listed exchange traded fund that includes chinese stocks listed abroad plunged by more than 50 last year amid regulatory uncertainty the etf is up 5 4 so far in 2022 not the end of regulation peak regulation is certainly not the end of regulation macquarie s hu said in his report he pointed to a similar regulatory peak at the end of 2018 which served as a turning point for a sell off in mainland chinese stocks even though local governments and businesses continued to act china s government system often means local authorities vie for beijing s attention through sometimes extreme implementation measures official language from central government directives then often warns against blindly shutting down a line of business for 2022 beijing has emphasized stability above all in the second half of the year the ruling chinese communist party is set to hold a meeting for determining top leadership positions including the expected extension of president xi jinping s term beyond that of his predecessors the political pressure for stability comes after a year in which the party celebrated its 100th anniversary the country meanwhile had an economy bouncing back fast enough from the pandemic to withstand what analysts have called painful but necessary changes to address longstanding problems now growth is slowing as china also tackles fresh coronavirus outbreaks the regulatory wave in 2020 21 brought many unintended consequences hu said for instance business confidence weakened the property sector plunged and commodity prices surged the consequence of campaign style is that things could easily be overdone as the result top leaders would have to fine tune from time to time decide the time to claim victory and move on to the next campaign hu said it happened so many times over the past one hundred years and will continue to happen in the future

chief executive officer thank you david good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us i m pleased to report another solid quarter and full year of operational and financial performance for verisign throughout 2021 we delivered strong financial results while continuing to strengthen our critical internet infrastructure we complied with the high operational standards required by our icann agreements and extended our record of com and net dns availability to over 24 years i would like to thank our team for their dedicated efforts and expertise which enabled us to realize these results the critical infrastructure we operate provides the domain name system navigation service which people around the world increasingly depend on for commerce education healthcare and person to person connection for the full year 2021 we processed 44 6 million new registrations and delivered revenue of 1 328 billion while generating free cash flow of 754 million during the full year of 2021 we repurchased 3 3 million shares for 700 million effective today the board of directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of verisign common stock by approximately 705 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which has no expiration our financial and liquidity position remained stable with 1 2 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter we continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases at the end of december the domain name base in com and net totaled 173 4 million consisting of 160 million names for com and 13 4 million names for net with a year over year growth rate of 5 looking at fourth quarter operational results we processed 10 6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1 37 million names although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 will be approximately 74 8 this preliminary rate compares to 73 5 achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 75 in the third quarter as we look to 2022 we expect the domain name base to grow at a rate of between 2 5 and 4 5 as announced in today s earnings release we have given notice of a price increase of 0 58 to the annual wholesale price for com domain names which raises the price from 8 39 to 8 97 effective september 1 2022 i should point out that anyone can register a com domain at any time before september 1 for up to 10 years and lock in that price for the full term of up to 10 years turning to web we noted last time that afilias had filed an application for reconsideration of the may 2021 final decision which as a reminder rejected their request to be awarded web since we last spoke with you the significant development in december was that afilias application for reconsideration was also rejected and further afilias was sanctioned for filing it because the arbitration panel found that it was frivolous since then in mid january icann s board of directors directed one of its standing committees to review the panel s final decision and provide the board with its findings with the rejection of afilias application and the reaffirmation of the panel s final decision those roadblocks are now out of the way and icann looks to be moving forward with making the decision on the delegation of web and we will be monitoring their process as we have said before we continue to look forward to becoming the web registry operator and establishing yet alongside com and net as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide and now i d like to turn the call over to george george kilguss executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim and good afternoon everyone for the year ended december 31 2021 the company generated revenue of 1 328 billion up 4 9 and delivered operating income of 867 million up 5 2 from 2020 operating expense totaled 461 million and was up 4 5 from the prior year the full year 2021 operating margin was 65 3 and free cash flow was 754 million for the fourth quarter revenue came to 340 million up 6 3 from the same quarter in 2020 with operating income of 222 million up 8 6 from 205 million in the same quarter a year ago operating expense totaled 118 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 113 million in the third quarter and 116 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 the sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing spend in the quarter the operating margin in the quarter was 65 3 compared to 66 2 in the third quarter and 63 9 for the same quarter of 2020 net income totaled 330 million compared to 157 million a year earlier which produced diluted earnings per share of 2 97 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 1 38 for the same quarter of 2020 as noted in our earnings release today net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 included the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit related to a restructuring of two of our international subsidiaries which involve the transfer of certain non u s intellectual property between these subsidiaries the recognition of this deferred income tax benefit increased net income by 165 5 million and increased diluted earnings per share by 1 49 in the quarter net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 included a recognition of 12 4 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits which increased diluted earnings per share by 0 11 as we noted in the fourth quarter of 2020 earnings release for 2022 we expect our gaap effective tax rates to be between 21 and 24 operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was 206 million net free cash flow was 193 million compared with 195 million and 189 million respectively for the fourth quarter of 2020 starting with our first quarter financial statements we will combine our sales and marketing and general and administrative operating expense lines into one sg a line to better align with peer company reporting in addition any significant fluctuations in sales and marketing will continue to be disclosed within our new sg a section of our md a contained in our filings i ll now discuss our full year 2022 guidance revenue is expected to be in the range of 1 420 billion to 1 440 billion this revenue range reflects the domain name base growth expectation of between 2 5 and 4 5 as jim mentioned earlier as well as the impact of the com price increase announced today the operating margin is expected to be between 64 5 and 65 5 interest expense and non operating income net is expected to be an expense of between 70 million to 75 million capital expenditures are expected to be between 40 million and 50 million as mentioned the gaap effective tax rate is expected to be between 21 and 24 we expect the cash tax rate for 2022 to also be within the same guidance range in summary verisign continued to demonstrate solid financial performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 and we look forward to continuing our focused execution now i ll turn the call back to jim for his closing remarks jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer thank you george before we open the call for your questions i d like to update you as i ve done in previous quarters on some of our activities in the field of corporate citizenship under our verisign cares program which aims to make a positive and lasting impact on the global internet community and the communities in which we live and work during the fourth quarter we once again joined forces with food banks in the areas where we have a footprint to help alleviate seasonal and covid related food and security we also renewed for a further year our partnership with virginia ready the launch partner of our initiative to help those whose employment has been adversely affected by the covid 19 pandemic to access retraining and other assistance to find new jobs in the growing technology sector and finally in q4 we made a further contribution to the equal justice initiative recognizing that there remains much to be done in the important area of racial and social justice and now we ll open the call for your questions operator we re ready for the first question questions answers operator and we ll go to sterling auty of j p morgan sterling auty j p morgan analyst yeah thanks hi guys so now that you ve taken the second price increase i know it s kind of a what have you done for me lately question but how should we think about the final two price increases that you still have left and probably just as important what happens after the six year period of this contract jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer ok thanks for that question sterling for those of you on the call who may not be familiar with the structure referred to in the question let me just briefly cover that if i might so every six year period we are allowed for price increases in the back four years that we are in the first six year period which began in october of 2018 and we are now at the point where we have today announced effective september 1 of this year the second of the four allowable price increases and so in this period we don t guide to pricing so today s announcement is of course for an increase in com domain registrations that begins september 1 2022 beyond that announcement we don t guide the future pricing or discuss the factors that go into those decisions i will say this this is the second wholesale price increase for com since january of 2012 so if you look back over the last 10 years that translates into a cost increase of only a 1 3 cagr over the last 10 and a half years actually so i just wanted to point that out for the second part of your question so basically in 2020 eight years from 2018 in sorry six years from 2018 to 2024 we will start a second six year period this is a six year period that s part of our cooperative agreement with the commerce department which automatically renews every six years and as you may or may not know or recall the first two years do not allow for price increases so in fact without guiding to what we ll do in the future if you assume that we take if we took all of the four price increases meaning the remaining two in this six year period as far out as until at least october of 2026 the price of a com registration cannot exceed 10 26 and we believe com is and continues to be positioned competitively so without guiding we re in a six year period in which we ve taken the first two of four and then we ll start a second six year period and since the increases are only in the back four years none can come on the first two so just to reiterate com is currently the current price increase that we ve taken allows for two more if we were to take those two more and exit the six year period at 10 26 that price couldn t change until at least october of 2026 i know it s a long answer hopefully that s helpful sterling auty j p morgan analyst yeah it is helpful i appreciate that and then within the context of the initial guide you re giving here for 22 for the domain name growth of the 2 5 to 4 5 i think there s a lot of us that have watched the data year to date and granted we re just in the very beginning but any comments you can give do you feel like the base is off to a slower than normal start for the year and is there a timing of renewals or other things that investors should be thinking about and how that factored into your guide jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer sure george george kilguss executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure sure thanks jim yeah sterling this is george so i would just remind you and others on the call that we do have some seasonality as it relates to certain holidays and how they fall in the calendar this year in q1 for example the chinese new year is about two weeks earlier started on february 1 last year it was february 12 and we tend to see new registrations from our chinese registrars slow down a few weeks before the actual holiday and then recover once the holiday is over so that could be playing into some of the data that you see on our website but overall as you mentioned we do expect continued growth in the domain name base we have guided to 2 5 to 4 5 and if you recall that was a similar growth rate that we guided to last year at this time as well sterling auty j p morgan analyst makes sense and then very last one on web if all goes well with icann board is it your anticipation that you would be in the market selling web domains in 22 jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer yeah well so first of all the process that i mentioned that was directed by icann s board that is a process that s been held up for many years during litigation which the panel has now basically shut down for the second time and directed icann to move with this process so we re pleased to see icann doing it that is icann s process so i can t speak quite for the duration that that will take obviously we hope it s as brief as it can be but that is an icann process and secondly i think you re aware there are some standard processes associated with the launch of any tld there s a period where some security issues are observed and addressed there s a period where trademark holders are given the right to make their registrations first so putting all that together it s really hard to speculate in a way that allows me to answer your question i will say that we have not budgeted in 2022 any long term marketing costs or any revenue for web we certainly like to be in the market if we could but i think given all of those variables it isn t helpful for me to speculate as to whether it is exactly when or even what time frame as you asked web will come to market we hope it does soon and we certainly intend to bring it to market and be successful with it but beyond that i don t think i could speculate sterling auty j p morgan analyst makes sense thank you guys i appreciate it jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer sure operator and we ll take our last question from rob oliver of baird rob oliver baird analyst great thanks guys good afternoon sterling asked a lot of good questions i ll just follow up on his so just i ll start with web since jim that s where you left off you did mention in your prepared remarks that you re going to be monitoring the process at icann i just wanted to understand what s the vehicle for actually doing that how you monitor that and then i m fairly used to saber rattling about further legal actions and i m just wondering from your perspective what exactly that is like what avenues they have left they ve been able to stretch this out for so long and then i had a follow up for george as well thanks jim bidzos executive chairman and chief executive officer ok well i can t speak for afilias i can only tell you that the result of their last application was sanctions and a use of the word frivolous in the panel s answer to their application in reiterating their earlier finding which is to direct icann to proceed in terms of how we monitor that most of these actions that when icann s board takes these actions that information is publicized and so you can follow some of that on icann s website for example the results that i mentioned the direction that icann gave to one of their standing committees was in fact publicly available information so what we ll be monitoring you can certainly monitor yourself on icann s website as the board proceeds so i think beyond that again i can t really speak for afilias we ve blogged about this you can find our blogs and you can see our position we ve been firm from the beginning that we believe that afilias claims and demands were without merit thus far the panel has reaffirmed what we expected would happen that icann would be directed to proceed with its process and determine the delegation of web that s where we are now what afilias will do next if anything is up to them but at this point icann has taken some action and we re monitoring that rob oliver baird analyst got it ok that s helpful jim and then george just a couple quick ones for you just on the operating margin guide for 22 assuming and i think you guys have in the past never included things in guides that weren t set so assuming that guide does not include web and assuming you got web there would be some expenses associated with that i m not asking you to speculate on exactly what those expenses would be as jim already said that you guys won t but instead could we understand that the initial operating margin guide may then have to be adjusted at some point if we were you guys were to then get web and proceed with some of the expenses around ramping web george kilguss executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah rob to the extent that when web comes to us and clearly we ve got our plan and our launch in place we ll clearly provide updated guidance to the extent that those expenses and or revenue are going to impact the current year rob oliver baird analyst got it ok helpful and then just lastly just you mentioned some of the kind of vagaries around global domain trends in chinese new year of course and just was wondering for about any sort of geographic color and again a follow up on sterling s question just about kind of what you re seeing here early in the year and i know renewal rates have been higher because of some of the activity that you guys have seen in u s and emea and how that is trending and how that looks to you here as well thanks george kilguss executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure rob so as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we had a solid year of growth in the domain name base it was up 5 year over year and in 2021 we saw the gains in the base primarily from our u s emea and our asia pacific registrars when you look at new units or gross adds as jim mentioned we generated 44 6 million in 2021 that was up about 2 million units year over year and that increase is similar to the 2 million new unit increase that we experienced in 2019 and the 2 million unit increase we also experienced in 2020 so we ve had pretty good consistent demand growth over the last few years from a new unit perspective we saw gains in 2021 from registrars in emea asia pacific and china and we ll provide more color as we come out of here in 2021 as to the trends that we re seeing in the regions at that time rob oliver baird analyst great we got to get a super bowl out i mean we re going to be watching that s what i m going to be watching for the com right when hopefully we get one of those this year thank you guys thank you rob operator and so that concludes the question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to david atchley for any final comments david atchley vice president of investor relations and corporate treasure thank you operator please call the investor relations department with any follow up questions from this call thank you for your participation this concludes our call have a good

significant resources to stemming the spread of the virus we are proud of the progress we ve made thus far though the rise of variants like omicron and surges in infection rates make it clear that our work is not over we continue to leverage labcorp s comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access to identify and monitor new variants and to advance vaccine and therapy development in the fourth quarter covid testing volumes were greater than anticipated we have performed over 74 million tests for covid to date of which approximately 8 6 million were in the fourth quarter this heightened demand continued into the new year although volume is significantly less now than in december or in january time to results for covid pcr test remained one to two days on average even during the latest surge as we ve done throughout the pandemic we are keeping capacity levels high to quickly respond to spikes and testing needs we are continuing to invest in equipment elevated staffing levels and our supply chain in addition we remain prepared and staffed to support additional drug development work for vaccines including boosters or additional therapies the company s covid related innovations in the quarter included the rollout of observed self collection for covid pcr testing at over 1 000 patient service centers and at the start of the fourth quarter we announced the receipt of fda emergency use authorization for a combined covid and flu at home collection kit these offerings are reflective of our work to make covid testing faster easier and more accessible i ll now turn to our enterprise strategy where we made significant progress in 2021 i ll provide a few highlights that will give you a sense of our growth and our forward momentum in oncology we made significant strides in fortifying our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities at the same time we followed through on our commitment to improve cancer care access last year we formed our oncology business unit and we introduced our enterprise oncology offering genomic profiling of tumors is key to identifying the best targeted therapy for oncology patients in december we announced our agreement to acquire personal genome diagnostics or pgdx the company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue based products which complement our existing capabilities through pgdx kitted solutions we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where the patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories these solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of this year other exciting expansions of our oncology test menu included clonoseq the first and only fda cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer and omniseq insight a pan cancer tissue based sequencing test for people with late stage solid tumors all of these offerings can help physicians make more informed decisions about treatments for their patients and help bring new medicines

enhance ovia health s innovative platform that provides family planning pregnancy and parenting support additionally we began to deploy labcorp diagnostic assistant this new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient s lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions we opened an automated kit production line in belgium in the spring and in the fourth quarter we opened an integrated laboratory in singapore which strengthens our bioanalytical services in the asia pacific region and just this month we announced the launch of labcorp ondemand which builds on the success of pixel by labcorp this suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests it s another way that labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy we pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long term and high growth potential we did this through tuck in deals and strategic acquisitions including omniseq ovia health pgdx and myriad autoimmune s vectra test which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis yesterday we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with ascension one of the largest health systems in the united states through our new long term relationship with ascension we will manage its hospital based laboratories in 10 states and we will purchase select assets of its outreach laboratory business for approximately 400 million we expect the first year annualized revenues to be between 550 million and 600 million from the combined hospital business and lab asset acquisition while operating margins are expected to be less than segment margins initially they are expected to improve each year the transaction is expected to be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in year 1 and should return its cost of capital by year 2 this is a notable opportunity for us and one of the most significant deals of its kind in the sector it expands our clinical services in several states across the country and it builds on our strong track record of building similar relationships the deal with ascension also underscores our ability to help health systems manage industrywide shifts as part of the collaboration we will explore clinical trial and oncology opportunities that enhance patient access we look forward to this new partnership and ultimately to welcoming new colleagues to labcorp we also reached agreements with other hospitals and hospital systems including minnesota based north memorial health we continue to be excited about our robust m a pipeline and expect more activity in the coming months in 2021 we provided the highest quality service to customers and patients and we made meaningful investments in our people in fact labcorp has consistently been recognized for the impact of our work and for the value we place on our employees we were recently named again to fortune magazine s list of world s most admired companies and for the fifth consecutive year the human rights campaign foundation designated labcorp as the best place to work for lgbtq equality we were also deemed one of america s most responsible companies for 2022 by newsweek importantly in 2021 management and the board of directors working with outside advisors thoroughly reviewed our structure and capital allocation as part of the comprehensive review of our structure we had extensive discussions with third parties and the board considered a wide range of options including significant acquisitions divestitures spinning off businesses as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners the board unanimously concluded that the company s existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time that said we continue to believe that labcorp shares are not fully valued in the marketplace to that end we announced several actions designed to further enhance shareholder value among them are the initiation of a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 as well as a 2 5 billion share repurchase program 1 billion of which is being repurchased on an accelerated basis we are also implementing a new launchpad business process improvement initiative that targets 350 million in savings over the next three years and today in addition to giving 2022 guidance we will also share a longer term outlook and beginning with first quarter results we will provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures moving forward we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science innovation and new technology as we execute on our strategy management and board will continue to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value in conclusion our strong base business performance coupled with formidable progress against our strategic priorities in 2021 sets us up for long term success this gives us great confidence in our longer term growth oriented bright outlook which glenn will take you through along with our 2022 guidance i am proud of what the team at labcorp accomplished together in 2021 and i am excited for all that s to come this year and into the future as we continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders now i ll turn it over to glenn glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you adam i m going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment our 2022 full year guidance and then conclude with our longer term outlook through 2024 revenue for the quarter was 4 1 billion a decrease of 9 7 compared to last year due to declines in organic revenue of 10 3 and divestitures of 0 1 partially offset by acquisitions of 0 6 and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points the 10 3 decline in organic revenue was driven by a 15 3 decrease in covid testing partially offset by a 5 increase in the company s organic base business operating income for the quarter was 731 million or 18 of revenue during the quarter we had 93 million of amortization and 79 million of restructuring charges and special items excluding these items adjusted operating income in the quarter was 902 million or 22 2 of revenue compared to 1 4 billion or 31 8 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in covid testing excluding covid testing the base business compared to the base business last year experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins due to organic growth and launchpad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs the tax rate for the quarter was 19 3 the adjusted tax rate excluding restructuring charges special items and amortization was 24 6 compared to 24 8 last year going forward we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25 excluding any impact from potential tax reform net earnings for the quarter were 553 million or 5 75 per diluted share adjusted eps which exclude amortization restructuring charges and special items were 6 77 in the quarter down from 10 56 last year operating cash flow was 698 million in the quarter compared to 775 million a year ago the decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings partially offset by favorable working capital capital expenditures totaled 150 million compared to 99 million last year and as a result free cash flow was 548 million in the quarter compared to 675 million last year during the quarter we used 1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested 171 million on acquisitions now i ll review our segment performance beginning with diagnostics revenue for the quarter was 2 6 billion a decrease of 16 9 compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 17 8 partially offset by acquisitions of 0 7 and favorable foreign currency translation of 20 basis points the decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21 8 reduction from covid testing partially offset by a 4 1 increase in the base business relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 5 primarily due to organic growth total volume decreased 8 7 compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 8 9 partially offset by acquisition volume of 0 3 the decrease in organic volume was due to a 14 6 decline in covid testing partially offset by a 5 7 increase in the base business price mix decreased 8 2 versus last year due to lower covid testing of 7 2 and lower base business of 1 6 partially offset by acquisitions of 0 5 and currency of 0 2 diagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7 2 compared to its base business last year with 8 1 coming from volume partially offset by a 1 decline from price mix the price mix decline was primarily due to the recovery of our canadian business which carries a lower average requisition price diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was 776 million or 29 6 of revenue compared to 1 2 billion or 39 1 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in covid testing covid testing margins were down compared to last year primarily due to a volume decline of approximately 50 while the company continued to maintain capacity base business margins were higher compared to last year due to organic base business growth and launchpad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs diagnostics achieved its goal to deliver approximately 200 million of net savings from its three year launchpad initiative now i ll review the performance of drug development revenue for the quarter was 1 5 billion an increase of 3 9 compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 7 9 and acquisitions of 0 3 partially offset by lower covid testing performed through its centralized business of 4 and divestitures of 0 3 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 9 9 primarily driven by organic growth adjusted operating income for the segment was 206 million or 14 2 of revenue compared to 248 million or 17 8 last year the decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to lower covid testing in the base business higher personnel and other inflationary costs as well as investments in oncology capabilities were partially offset by organic growth and launchpad savings we continue to exclude the enterprise component of drug development bonus expense which is reflected in corporate unallocated and totaled 11 million for the quarter while margins were down in the quarter they were up for the full year compared to 2020 and we expect margins to continue to increase in 2022 for the trailing 12 months net orders and net book to bill remained strong at 7 3 billion and 1 25 respectively backlog at the end of the quarter was 15 billion an increase of 8 7 compared to last year and we expect approximately 5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months now i ll discuss our 2022 guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of december 31 2021 for the full year in addition the guidance includes the softness we experienced in january due to omicron which we expect will rebound through the rest of the quarter the enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions share repurchases and dividends which we will initiate in the second quarter we expect enterprise revenue to decline one and a half to six and a half percent compared to 2021 this guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10 while covid testing is expected to decline 60 to 75 we expect diagnostics revenue to decline 11 and a half to 17 and a half percent compared to 2021 this guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will growth three and a half to 6 covid testing revenue is expected to decline 60 to 75 at the midpoint of our base business guidance range the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4 4 primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix we expect drug development revenue to grow 7 to 9 5 compared to 2021 this guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points this guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10 compared to 2021 given the amount of capacity we have within diagnostics we ve assumed that no covid testing will be performed in drug development central lab business in 2022 we expect to benefit from broad based growth in all three businesses helping drive continued margin improvement in the segment at the midpoint of our base business guidance range the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11 3 our adjusted eps guidance is 17 25 to 21 25 compared to 2021 adjusted eps of 28 52 the adjusted eps guidance reflects the expectation of lower covid testing in 2022 while the base business continues to profitably grow free cash flow is expected to be between 1 7 billion to 1 9 billion compared to 2 6 billion in 2021 now i ll discuss our longer term outlook which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024 we expect enterprise base business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4 to 7 compared to 2021 we also expect revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2 to 3 we expect diagnostics base business organic revenue to grow at a two and a half to four and a half percent cagr compared to 2021 this outlook is higher than historical growth driven by a continued recovery in our base business relative to 2021 broad based growth including hospitals and health systems and the lower incremental impact of pama in the outlook period we expect drug development base business organic revenue to grow at a 7 to 10 cagr compared to 2021 this outlook is higher than our historical growth and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster growing early development and late stage clinical businesses as we continue to emphasize profitable growth we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021 which was approximately 14 and a half percent this margin expansion is due in part to the company s launchpad initiative which is expected to deliver 350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs and finally we expect adjusted eps to grow at an 11 to 14 cagr compared to 2020 19 adjusted eps of 11 32 we continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings power of the company excluding covid testing the adjusted eps outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to profitably grow organically in addition we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed toward accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while keeping within our targeted gross debt leverage of two and a half to three times for additional comparison purposes we ve also included in the supplemental deck on our investor relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results 2022 guidance and our longer term outlook in summary the company had another quarter of strong performance we remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our base business for 2022 we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business while covid testing volumes are expected to decline through the year in addition our longer term outlook is expected to deliver double digit adjusted eps growth driven by top line growth margin improvement and capital allocation operator we ll now take questions questions answers operator our first question comes from jack meehan with nephron research your line is open jack meehan nephron research analyst thank you and good morning wanted to start and ask about the long term outlook so in the 11 to 14 adjusted eps cagr versus 2019 can you talk about what your assumption is related to diagnostics pricing and maybe the return of pama in 2023 and also just what you re assuming in terms of any ongoing covid benefit beyond 2022 adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah good morning jack yeah a couple of things so first of all if you look at diagnostics pricing i ll start with pama there is obviously no impact of pama this year working through acla which is the trade organization we re going to continue to fight for a more rational way to think about pama in the future but for our base case we re assuming that in 2023 there d be about 100 million impact and in 2024 it d be about half of that so that s kind of what we re thinking for pama in terms of other pricing we don t see any acceleration of pricing decline we re going to try to see if there s any way to increase pricing in certain areas that s not easy i don t think i would build a lot into the plan for that but we re also looking at other things like labcorp ondemand where you might have a different type of pricing as you go directly to consumers and so forth so in general i would think about the overall pricing pressure continuing the pama pressure being less as we go into the 2024 time frame and that the underlying base business is where we ll continue to see strong performance and hopefully what you can see is that we have a strong commitment to the base business in diagnostics if you think about covid we don t have much built in if any frankly as you start to get into 2024 and beyond we ll see how that turns out but it really is all about the base business it s about our ability to continue to grow in our geographies where we re strong you heard about our deal today with ascension it s about doing more of those types of deals so we think that the future is very bright for diagnostics and our ability to grow but it s not through pricing and there will continue to be pricing pressure it s more through geographic expansion hospital deals and continued growth in the segment itself glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer jack the only thing i d add to the discussion was just that when you look at the guidance that we provided or the outlook for the longer term what you see is obviously good top line growth across the businesses supplemented by obviously acquisitions from capital allocation but that we do expect to see margin improvement over this period of time and net margin improvement coming from both businesses so to your point helping offset some of the inflationary costs as well as pama at least that s in call it 23 and potentially beyond that and that it s really also then utilizing our balance sheet and our free cash flow so we expect to be back within our targeted leverage of about two and a half to three times over that period of time so using that cash flow to support acquisitions that again will be targeted at least 2 to 3 and then dividends and then obviously with the remainder going back to returning capital through our share repurchase program jack meehan nephron research analyst great and then as a follow up i wanted to talk about the ascension deal was hoping for just some more color on what brought that together how long you had been working toward this and i ask because there s been a lot of focus on some of the challenges in the lab industry as it pertains to labor i was curious how much that might have weighed into this and then finally can you just stack up ascension versus some of the other things you might be looking at your pipeline at the moment adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes so we ve had a very good discussion and partnership with the team at ascension it s been really a pleasure to work with them we ve been talking to them for quite some time frankly and these are the types of deals that they re long term strategic in nature so it takes time you have to make sure that the cultures are a fit that the organizations have the same types of culture and you get to know each other and that s why these deals tend to take a while before they come to fruition so we ve been talking to our partners there for quite some time now and what i would say is once we realized the cultural fit that we could work together well that there s a focus on patient care and ensuring that the patients get the needs that they or the services that they need to ensure that the physicians and the hospitals are able to get the test that they want to ensure that as new colleagues move over into labcorp over time that they would have a good experience that s when we began to get even more and more serious about the partnership and discussions this is a very large deal typically they re not near as large as this but again it s one of many hospital systems that we re talking to and we continue to feel good about the pipeline jack meehan nephron research analyst thank you adam adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from a j rice with credit suisse your line is open a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks hi everybody maybe i ll just ask about the covid assumptions for 2022 obviously the range you re giving i think equates to about 690 million at the low end 1 1 billion at the high end does the high end assume additional surges some testing in the fourth quarter around cough cold and flu is the low end pretty much what you ve already almost seen in the first quarter just give us some flavor on that and have you assumed so how it progresses over the course of the year and any change in relevant pricing assumptions versus where you re at now with the phe and all adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer sure good morning a j so i ll give you some context and i ll give you a sense of how we think about it so we did 74 million tests for covid for date to date and about 8 5 million 8 6 million of those in the fourth quarter so that gives you about 83 000 tests per day in the fourth quarter if you look at the end of the fourth quarter last year you actually saw significantly higher than the average of 83 000 and in the beginning of january we actually saw more than at the end of december so we saw a real peak in the first couple of weeks throughout most of january if we look at where we are right now we re actually closer to where we were in the average back in december and back in the fourth quarter so you ve already seen a significant decline in covid testing the reason we gave you a range of minus 60 to minus 75 is because there s a multitude of ways to be within that range one could be that there s another variant and therefore you have increase in volume we don t know when that would happen last year i never would have expected anything to happen in the summer and we saw something in the summer and we also saw another surge in the wintertime as we go through this year we don t know if there ll be another variant and or another surge but the other thing that could be is that the price stays where it is and there s not a surge and you could get to our range through that if there is a price decrease if the emergency is not declared again after april you could see another surge that would offset a price increase if the emergency situation is relieved so as i think about it i think we re going to continue to see a decline in testing i personally believe that the emergency situation will be hit through this year which would keep price relatively consistent there ll always be pressure on the price but the range of 60 to 75 would be within multiple different things happening so it s hard to give you an exact number a j because as we did last year we gave you our best estimate and each quarter we changed it based on new information new data we have we ll continue to break it out separately so we can inform you of what we re seeing and what we think but that s the best information we have at this time glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a j the only thing i would add just additionally for your modeling purposes as you would expect that we expect the strongest period to be in the first quarter and then obviously going down as the year unfolds but wide range of outcomes but the trend clearly to be lower call it in the second half than what we would expect in the first half at this time a j rice credit suisse analyst sure thanks adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer thanks a j operator our next question comes from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley your line is open ricky goldwasser morgan stanley analyst yeah hi good morning so when we think about the long term guidance of 11 to 14 of 2019 what is how should we think about sort of the right 22 eps baseline that we should apply because based on kind of like your results right 2021 grew faster than 11 to 14 so how should we think about that right baseline eps baseline to calculate off and also in the long term guide what are your underlying assumption for labor and supply cost inflation adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you ricky and we spent a lot of time obviously trying to give you the best information we could because the baselines are a bit tricky as you think about everything that s happened with covid so i ll have glenn give you some additional specifics there labor and supply there s no doubt that we re getting hit with significant inflation labor and supply is not something we take lightly we re watching it very closely and we re seeing wage increases and supply increases that s why we put in place the 350 million launchpad initiative to help offset that the issue that occurs ricky is that you get hit with the labor and supply and the wage issues right away and it takes you time to get the cost out so we ve given you our guidance over time and we ve given our averages over time but for example i think that the first quarter of this year will be harder than by the time we get to the fourth quarter this year because you get hit with all the wage inflation and we had some weather with the omicron variant and so forth and it takes us some time to get the cost out which we re working very hard on that s why we feel confident to give you the 30 million to 50 million basis point improvement on average per year because we feel confident we can do that but the timing is going to be a little bit different because you get hit hard with the wage and the supply inflation and then it takes you time to get the cost out but we assume there will be continued pressure on wages and supply as we go through the long term outlook we don t think it s something that s temporary and that s why we have to continue to find ways to reduce costs where we can and maybe glenn you can give some baseline discussion glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi ricky the reason why obviously we chose to do a growth rate off of 2019 was to get to a pre pandemic level and that we expect that by the end of the call it the long term horizon covid will be de minimis into that number so that was kind of the double digit growth rate that we would expect at the 11 to 14 cagr we did comment because on revenue we can go off of a 21 base because we distinguish between covid revenue and base business revenue but when we were talking about margins just to show that we do expect to see margin improvement over the time we did comment that you would get to roughly around a 14 and a half percent margin in 21 from the base business and again the reason why we say that s an estimate is because there s a lot of shared resources that are supporting both the covid business and the base business but it s a proxy and if you just took that further down and set as a proxy that 14 and a half percent on your base business margin would get you to roughly call it around a 14 shared number from an adjusted eps from the base business so either you use the base estimate in call it 2021 of earnings and growing double digits or the base of 2019 which is a clean number for our base business you still get to roughly the same trend in 22 from a base business and beyond we do expect double digit growth in each of the periods going forward within that outlook horizon operator our next question comes from patrick donnelly with citi your line is open patrick donnelly citi analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions maybe one on the drug development side obviously with the 7 to 10 guide you re expecting pretty healthy fundamentals there can you just talk about the funding backdrop we get a lot of questions about just the biotech environment in general obviously it s been pretty volatile not too many in terms of the equity capital markets not too much action so how are you guys thinking about that is what you re seeing in terms of the balance sheets on the biotech and pharma side sufficient to kind of support healthy growth obviously you feel that way and then secondarily similar on the drug development side would love just your perspective on china given some of the news this week in terms of the unverified list any of that activity change how you think about that region or how you think about the business overall thank you adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure hi patrick good morning yeah so our rfps continue to be very strong and we continue to get a significant number of rfps discussions with pharma and biotech clients is that they have strong pipelines and there s a lot that they still need to do to be funded if you look at our net orders i mean we had 7 3 billion in net orders and our trailing 12 month book to bill is still above 1 2 which is what we look to be and it was very strong for the quarter itself you look at our backlog it s 15 billion so it s almost 9 increase versus last year and about 5 billion of that backlog we expect to convert into revenue over the next 12 months so every indication we have is that the rfps the funding remain strong for us to be within the range of growth that we expect to be in in the long term outlook that we gave to you in terms of china china remains a very important market for pharma i believe that they will continue to be an important growth market so therefore we have a significant presence there we re able to perform studies there we built significant organic in terms of people and capabilities in the country and i think it was the right thing to do and it will show that it will continue to be the right thing to do over time patrick donnelly citi analyst thank you operator our next question comes from eric coldwell with baird your line is open eric coldwell baird analyst thanks very much a lot of questions on ascension i think first just if you could share with us the total lab revenue of ascension or the percentage that you re initially taking over here any outlook for expansion potential down the road number two could you give us how many hospitals you re actually taking over ascension has 142 i think you re getting 10 of 20 states that they re operating in and then finally i was curious if you could give us the mix of the hospital lab management versus the outreach revenue that you re assuming in the 550 million to 600 million estimate thanks very much adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer sure good morning eric eric coldwell baird analyst good morning adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer and i ll give you some context and i ll ask glenn to jump in with some numbers as well so first of all we re excited about this opportunity and we think that it is a great opportunity for not just the patients that ascension serves and a long term relationship that we ll have with them but we expect the first year annualized revenues to be between 550 million and 600 million from their hospital business and the lab asset acquisition what i would say is we worked with them on what they wanted to do at the time in terms of the size and the scale of the partnership and we believe there will be opportunities for us to work together in many different ways as we go into the future not just with hospital work by the way and we re going to explore clinical trial work together oncology opportunities that enhance patient access so there s lots of opportunities for us as we go into the future i don t want to speak too much about them and their percent of revenue so for i think that s something you would need to ask ascension but what we can tell you is that we believe that this long term partnership is going to be very very fruitful for both organizations glenn do you want to give a little further context glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no i agree and eric what we did put in the release was that the assets that we re acquiring the outreach labs would have had last year revenue of approximately 150 million and that by putting in the full year annualized revenues as adam said the 550 million to 600 million you can assume that that 150 million we re taking on some compression with it but then growth from it as well would size up what we got within the outreach business versus the strategic partnership of managing the in hospital labs being the difference eric coldwell baird analyst hey glenn thank you for that i should have expanded on my question i m trying to squeeze it in under the time limits here but the typically we see repricing volumes on outreach deals or the repricing is i think typically something like 30 i don t know if that s similar to what you re seeing here and then i did actually have another question on hospital lab management deals i know the rev rec can be at least at your peer it s probably in the ballpark of half of what they would see on a normal requisition revenue so i was just curious if you could give us some sense on the pricing dynamics with this deal glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah eric what i would say is again with the revenues that we re picking up to your point there is compression again that comes with the outreach labs that we have and that s reflected and we said approximately 150 million but it will be compressed and then will grow so it does give you at least an indication of the mix if you will from a pricing again similarly we expect to have normal call it pricing kind of margins that would come with the outreach but with the in hospital labs to your point they are at a lower price point so when you look at the mix impact and adam commented in his remarks that an a strategic partnership of this size with that much going from the in hospital lab management you would expect to see lower than obviously segment margins but the positive is is that once we start there the first year and we see that margin compression we expect to then see that grow and improve through efficiencies and productivity and so forth so dilutive to margins for sure obviously it s a transaction that we think from a return standpoint is very attractive excited about the strategic partnership excited about the potential additional growth that could occur with that partnership over time that will continue to drive good returns for the company and margins that will improve over time eric coldwell baird analyst ok thanks very much adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer thanks eric operator our next question comes from brian tanquilut with jefferies your line is open brian tanquilut jefferies analyst hey good morning guys and congrats on the quarter i guess my question glenn as i think about the long term guidance again right i mean two and a half to four and a half percent of the base lab kind of like revenue or growth assumption how are we thinking about kind of like what the drivers are of that being above and then maybe like the timing is that more front end loaded given some easier comps and then how do i think about the capabilities that you ve added over the last few years as being contributing to that above average growth thanks glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey brian so first to your point the growth rate is a little bit higher than our historical organic growth within the business but a lot of that is with the investments that we ve made and the growth and the focus of the strategic growth such as the hospital systems and so forth where we continue to find opportunities to see additional growth those cagrs if you will are based upon 2021 which again would not have been call it a fully recovered year so we get some of the benefits of that growth the recent acquisitions that we ve done that have been already call it in the base so not new acquisitions but ones that have done not necessarily have been fully annualized we continue to get some additional growth from that the fact that our expectation for pama that in the outlook period is less impactful than what it had been historically for us continues that and just the overall efficiencies launchpad that supports the top line growth as well so we think we re on a good cadence and good momentum to be able to hit those numbers over the planning horizon brian tanquilut jefferies analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from kevin caliendo with ubs your line is open kevin caliendo ubs analyst thanks thanks for taking my call i just wanted to highlight a little bit that you still say when it comes to the strategic alternatives sort of at this time and i m wondering if anything has changed obviously you went through a whole process here then you did a nice acquisition you have this big ascension deal what would need to change for you to go back and rethink the potential for something more strategic with regards to the strategic alternatives is it a willing partner is it the market conditions can you just sort of take us through what would need to change or what might prompt a revisit of the very strategic alternatives adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you kevin and good morning when we went through the strategic review we looked at everything and we were very thorough i mean we spent almost a year evaluating all the alternatives talking to people externally making sure that we looked at not just structure but capital allocation and after that entire process the board unanimously agreed that at this time the structure is right but we also realize and believe that our shares are not still fully valued in the marketplace and we re doing a lot of things in terms of capital allocation and additional disclosures and long term guidance which we think will help with shareholder return we believe that this should help more fully value the shares in the marketplace but we also agree as a management team and board that we should always be looking at alternative scenarios and that we should always be open if there s other things over time that makes sense so it s another way of us acknowledging that it s not a one and done type of analysis it s an analysis that you continually do you continually refresh you continue to look at where you are how you re performing how things in the marketplace are evolving so that s all you re hearing at the moment we re going to continue to look at our options as anybody would expect you to do kevin caliendo ubs analyst fair enough and if i could do a really quick follow up just on the cadence for the year you did say you expect covid to be higher is there any other inputs that could affect what might normally be a regular cadence for the company is there any costs associated with ascension upfront any timing issues that we should be thinking about as we model out the year adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer the only thing i would say kevin as i mentioned in january you had a lot of weather you had a lot of omicron where even some of our employees weren t able to get in to open up service centers and with drug development we had you have to charge for people when they work but people aren t working because they re ill we faced issues that you saw in almost every business in the united states so first quarter is going to be probably one of the tougher quarters versus the other quarters in the year but all that s been taken into full evaluation and as we provided our guidance for 2022 and longer term we ve looked at all of that so other than that i think things look strong and we continue to be optimistic about the guidance and where we are kevin caliendo ubs analyst thanks and thanks for all the details today adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from pito chickering with deutsche bank your line is open pito chickering deutsche bank analyst hi good morning guys and thanks for taking my question my question here is on the long term outlook of 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion did i understand that you re modeling 2023 ebit margins in diagnostics increasing in 2023 despite the 100 million of pama impact and i think you did talk about a lot of pressures here on labor and supply costs can you give us some more details on how launchpad can offset those impacts it just seems like there s a lot of headwinds coming from inflation in pama and you re still sort of guiding to margins increasing i just want to understand some more details of how you guys are going to achieve that thanks so much adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yes so i ll start off with there s no doubt that we re seeing inflation and we re seeing wage inflation but also material costs going up and those things but that s why we put in place the 350 million of cost savings and it s not going to be 100 million 100 million 100 million over three years we re going to try to get as much as we can out in the first year and then do more in the following years the timing as i mentioned earlier will be a little bit different the pressure hits you right away but you take out the costs as you go through the year and to give you a sense the type of things that we re looking at for example are in our diagnostic area right now you might accession a sample meaning log it into the system in one area and then you might have to fly it to another lab in a different part of the country and then there might be another test that you have to do in another lab we re looking at ways to streamline that so you get the results faster but you wouldn t have the sample moving around as often it s good for your esg goals but it also is good for patients and ultimately could reduce cost so we re looking at those type of initiatives which ultimately could reduce cost but it doesn t happen in a matter of days it takes a little bit of time to kind of reshuffle reorganize what you re trying to do but we have a lot of initiatives like that that we re putting in place even things like our automated propel system that we re going to put in additional laboratories it can reduce cost it s less wage pressure because it doesn t take as many people necessary to run but also you can get better quality faster results at time so we re looking for things to fundamentally change some of our business processes and that s why it takes a little bit longer but that s also why we re confident that we can deliver on the 30 to 50 basis point improvement in margin over time if you look at it on average pito chickering deutsche bank analyst great thanks so much guys adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from derik de bruin with bank of america your line is open derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking my question so could you just go in a little bit more detail on the long term outlook for the drug development business and specifically are you willing to sort of give us some additional color on what your assumptions are for early stage central lab and late stage just to sort of give us a better view on the mix of the business and what s going on there you re obviously seeing a much bigger you re seeing acceleration in that business relative to historical trends and just like a little bit more underlying drivers on the segments thank you very much adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure derik i ll give you a little bit glenn can jump in the first thing i d tell you derik is that we re going to give some additional disclosures when we report our first quarter earnings in april so i think that will be helpful we do that at that time but clearly when you look at the growth i mean a lot of the growth is coming from the later stage clinical trial business we see great opportunities there we ve invested in there with things like globalcare as well as snapiot to give us good capabilities in terms of decentralized clinical trials which are becoming more and more important we ve built our presence in japan and in china in that business so you ll see and we believe that s an area that we can get very significant growth and also margin improvement and then if you look at the central laboratory business we re a leader there and we continue to feel strong in that business but because you re a leader the ability to grow isn t necessarily as easy as the ability to grow in areas like clinical trials where we re not yet where we want to be in terms of leadership and then the last thing i d say is that our early stage business is a smaller business i mean we re still able to compete we have the ability to compete effectively in that business but it s not the size or the magnitude of the other two businesses we do expect strong growth in that business but at a scale that s smaller than the first two businesses glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add is that when you look at the components of the businesses to your point early development and the late stage clinical businesses have historically are higher growth businesses than the central lab business and so we ve made a lot of investments in capacity to continue to be able to fuel that growth in those two areas in particular the acquisitions that we ve done whether it s toxikon globalcare snapiot have been targeted in the higher growth areas within ed and central lab or in late stage rather so just the mix of our business continues to be more weighted toward the faster growing parts that we ve made so overall we ve always said kind of mid to high single digits was kind of the aspirational growth we ve made a lot of investments that the long term growth rate targets that we have are reinforcing that what we ve been doing should enable us to get into that range operator our next question comes from matt larew with william blair your line is open madeline mollman william blair analyst hi this is madeline mollman on for matt larew we were just wondering you said decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62 can you contextualize that a little bit do you can you tell us like from what they were growing and then what do you anticipate that will be in 2022 and what s your win rate there versus standard clinical trials adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah so that s a good question and the growth rate is still off a relatively small base so if you look at fully decentralized clinical trials it s still in the single digits in terms of the total trials that we have going right now but as you look at new trial rfps most of them actually includes some component that is virtual or hybrid so we believe that over time you re going to continue to see that percent increase albeit for last year and this year it s not a very significant amount of the total trials that we re running i would say more take a look at the five year outlook and then it starts to become more significant in terms of the total mix of trials that you have ongoing particularly if you re looking for fully decentralized clinical trials operator our next question comes from tycho peterson with j p morgan your line is open tycho peterson j p morgan analyst hey good morning a follow up to derik s question on drug development i appreciate your comments on kind of the long range plan but are you able to talk if there s anything that came out of the strategic review in terms of how you might run the business differently where you may be reinvesting more i m just curious what kind of the learnings of the review were and then also on the long range plan the 7 to 10 growth is impressive a number of the cro peers are kind of blessing 10 plus growth so do you see upside to that long range plan as well adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah good morning tycho first thing i d say is that when you look at the drug development business we re going to provide additional insights in the second quarter that i think are going to be helpful because you have to look at the mix of the business when you try to compare across different cros our mix of business is different than most because we have a very big central laboratory business and the central laboratory in general isn t as fast growth as the later stage clinical trials with an earlier stage so it s a little bit hard to make those comparisons when we break apart our businesses and when we look at our competitors we believe that the long term guidance that we re providing is very strong and we also believe when you look at the guidance we re giving it s accelerated versus what we ve observed in the past because we believe that we re starting to see the success from some of the investments that we ve made in the past but at the same time as i said earlier we continue and we will continue to look at all of our avenues for growth all of our avenues to meet both shareholder returns but also the needs of our customers as we move forward and we re committed to continuing to do that i don t know glenn if there s any additional context you d provide glenn eisenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think when you say you run differently i think the point that we ve made a lot of investments again targeted organically and our oncology focus within the business really we believe that over time those organic investments plus if you will the pgdxs the toxikons the other acquisitions that we have will continue to help fuel the growth in our faster growing parts of our business tycho peterson j p morgan analyst and then one quick follow up on oncology just why was pgdx the right asset in liquid biopsy obviously there are a number of emerging players in that market was it because it got a kitted approach what kind of stood out from your perspective adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer yeah no that s an important question and first of all we have internal capabilities for liquid biopsy so using our internal experts we were able to look at what the available assets were out there to decide what we thought would be a good match for what we are developing internally i think having a kitted solution and having the first one approved by the fda was important particularly as we start to think about clinical trials kitted solutions might be very helpful in clinical trials but also as we start to think about taking tests like this globally which we haven t done before frankly but we think there might be the ability for us to globally launch a specialty test like a liquid biopsy having the ability to both do a kitted solution and a central laboratory solution was important to us and pgdx actually has capabilities in both of those areas so we think it s good for clinical trials we think it s good for patient care if you can do the test closer to a patient but it also could enable us to more easily go globally with this type of test tycho peterson j p morgan analyst ok thank you adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer absolutely so is there any last question chas was that the end of the questions chas cook vice president investor relations that s going to be it adam schechter chairman and chief executive officer ok so i want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you can see that our considerable progress last year coupled with what we have in store for 2022 actually laid a great groundwork for promising not only short term but also long term growth and i just want to say none of it will be possible if it wasn t for all of our colleagues around the world our 75 000 employees around the world and each of them play a role ensuring that our company delivers on our mission to improve health and improve lives we look forward to continuing to have dialogue with you and please continue to be safe and we ll see you soon thank you operator duration 65 minutes call participants

chief financial officer please go ahead susan wood thank you operator good afternoon everyone and welcome to acadian timberâ s fourth quarter conference call with me on the call today is adam sheparski acadianâ s president and chief executive officer before discussing acadianâ s results i will first remind everyone that in discussing our fourth quarter and 2021 financial and operating performance the outlook for 2022 and responding to your questions we may make forward looking statements these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and future results may differ materially for further information on our known risk factors i encourage you to review our news release and md a which are available on sedar and on our website at acadiantimber com i will begin with some comments on our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 then adam will add some further remarks on the business market conditions and the outlook for 2022 sales for the fourth quarter were 25 9 million an increase of 1 million when compared to 24 9 million in the prior year period the weighted average selling price excluding biomass increased 7 year over year benefiting from favorable operating conditions and increased sawlog pricing sales volume excluding biomass decreased 7 due to lower hardwood pulpwood sales operating costs of 19 8 million in the quarter were 1 7 million higher than the 18 1 million in the prior year due to higher harvesting activity in maine and increased timber services in new brunswick weighted average variable costs excluding biomass increased 10 reflecting higher log processing and fuel costs partially offset by a stronger canadian dollar adjusted ebitda totaled 6 3 million during the quarter as compared to 7 3 million in the prior year period adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 24 compared to 29 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the decrease in ebitda margin was mainly driven by reduced sales volumes in new brunswick combined with lower gains on timberland sales in maine our net income for the fourth quarter was 6 5 million compared to 15 3 million in the prior year period the variance is primarily due to a combination of lower gains on non cash items such as unrealized foreign exchange on long term debt and fair value adjustments in 2021 as compared to 2020 we generated 5 1 million of free cash flow and declared dividends of 4 8 million to our shareholders during the fourth quarter which resulted in a payout ratio of 94 with respect to our annual results acadian performed well throughout 2021 despite several challenges including unseasonably warm weather in the first quarter the impact of sawmill residuals on the softwood pulpwood markets and increased fuel prices acadianâ s operations benefited from strong demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs driven by favorable end use markets sales for 2021 were 95 7 million compared to 91 million in 2020 acadianâ s weighted average selling price excluding biomass increased 4 with a higher value product mix and strong sawlog prices sales volume excluding biomass decreased 5 primarily due to lower softwood pulpwood sales due to the competition of sawmill residuals and to a lesser extent lower hardwood pulpwood sales due to increased regional inventories adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2021 was 22 5 million compared to 21 5 million in 2020 while adjusted ebitda margin was 23 compared to 24 in the prior year we generated free cash flow of 16 9 million in 2021 compared to 15 2 million last year i will now move into the fourth quarter results for our new brunswick operations sales for our new brunswick timberlands were 18 million compared to 19 3 million in the same period of 2020 sales volume excluding biomass decreased 23 due to reduced softwood sawlog and hardwood pulpwood sales partially offset by an increase in hardwood sawlog sales driven by strong demand and increased timber services activity the weighted average selling price excluding biomass increased 6 as a result of strong hardwood sawlog prices and volumes operating cost in the fourth quarter totaled 13 2 million compared to 12 9 million in the prior year period the increase in operating cost is a result of increased timber services activity and higher land management costs partially offset by lower sales volume new brunswickâ s adjusted ebitda in the quarter was 4 6 million compared to 6 5 million in the prior year period with adjusted ebitda margin decreasing to 25 compared to 34 last year the decrease in ebitda and ebitda margin was a result of lower sales volume in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period switching over to maine sales during the fourth quarter totaled 8 million compared to 5 6 million in the same period last year sales volume excluding biomass increased 39 year over year due to higher softwood and hardwood sawlog sales driven by favorable operating conditions and strong demand the weighted average selling price excluding biomass in u s dollar terms increased by 8 year over year with higher sawlog prices benefiting from favorable market dynamics operating costs totaled 6 million in the quarter compared to 4 7 million during the same period of 2020 as a result of higher harvesting activity weighted average variable cost excluding biomass decreased 4 benefiting from a higher proportion of softwood in the mix combined with a stronger canadian dollar adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 2 1 million compared to 1 3 million during the same period last year while adjusted ebitda margin was 26 compared to 24 in the prior year period acadianâ s financial position remains strong ending the fourth quarter with a liquidity position of 19 8 million including a cash balance of 7 3 million and our undrawn revolving credit facilities with that i will turn the call over to adam adam sheparski thank you susan the safety remains the number one priority at acadian we are extremely proud to announce that there were no recordable safety incidents among employees and contractors during the year we believe that emphasizing and achieving a good safety record is a leading indicator of success in the broader business and i would like to congratulate the entire team on this tremendous achievement 2021 was once again another transformative year for acadian while continuing to operate through the covid pandemic the new management team was finalized and full integration to a standalone company was completed all while delivering solid operating performance during the year market demand for our products remained strong with the number of new customers beginning to take delivery which has had a positive impact on pricing although acadian experienced some headwinds in the form of unseasonal weather challenging pulpwood markets with significant increases in fuel costs the financial results for the year demonstrate the stability of the timberland business also during 2021 acadian executed its first carbon development and marketing agreement to develop voluntary carbon credits on the portion of the maine timberland that is subject to a working forest conservation easement while this project is relatively small and expected to contribute modestly to cash flow and have little impact on operations it forms the foundation for further carbon credit development although we are still a few months away from the development of our first credits the project remains on track and we should have additional insights at the end of the first quarter before i turn to our fourth quarter results yesterday we announced that acadian would be implementing both a dividend reinvestment plan and the normal course issuer bid we believe the drip allows acadian to assist in the facilitation of shareholder support in the company and allows us to remain poised to pursue potential strategic opportunities instituting the ncib enables us to acquire common shares when the market price represents a desirable use of capital to increase shareholder value however given the liquidity of acadian stock we expect that we will be somewhat limited in our ability to repurchase shares through the life of the program now turning to our fourth quarter results operating conditions during the quarter were favorable across both new brunswick and maine as susan mentioned earlier acadianâ s weighted average selling price excluding biomass increased 7 while sales volume decreased 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 softwood sawlog sales volume remained steady year over year on a consolidated basis with increases in maine offset by decreases in volume in new brunswick improvements in maine were driven by favorable operating conditions combined with the prior year period being impacted by temporary weather related road closures higher inventory levels in new brunswick combined with strong prior year period drove most of the declines in volume softwood sawlog prices increased 9 in maine or 13 higher in u s dollar terms and were steady in new brunswick increases in softwood sawlog prices to customers were partially offset by a higher proportion of lower value softwood in the mix we experienced increased demand for our hardwood sawlog as sales volume increased 13 and hardwood sawlog prices were 18 higher when compared to the prior year period hardwood sawlog sales and pricing are being driven by strong demand in both appearance and industrial grade lumber markets throughout the region demand for hardwood pulpwood decreased the sales volume was down 25 while prices remained steady year over year regional inventories remained high throughout the quarter with additional capacity coming online at the beginning of 2022 we are starting to see an increase in demand softwood pulpwood demand increased relatively speaking as sales volume was up 20 and prices were up 11 year over year volumes remained significantly lower than historical levels due to the abundance of sawmill residuals as we discussed on previous calls but we have seen a slight improvement during the quarter and entering into 2022 the outlook for acadian softwood and hardwood sawlog sales is positive within used markets showing strength as we head into 2022 north american softwood lumber consumption is expected to remain strong with sustained demand from repair and remodeling activity and new home construction consensus forecast is for approximately 1 57 million u s housing starts in 2022 compared to 1 58 million in 2021 although interest rates are expected to rise a large u s population entering their home buying years and a low inventory of homes for sale will be key drivers supporting this growth demand for our softwood sawlog is expected to remain stable as a result of these positive end use market dynamics acadian also expects continued strong demand in pricing for its hardwood sawlog due to limited regional supply and benefiting from new customer relationships in both the appearance and industrial grade hardwood lumber markets we remain cautiously optimistic that hardwood pulp will remain stable through 2022 with increased customer confidence and market demand for hardwood pulp meanwhile as i mentioned previously although we did see some slight improvements in softwood pulpwood entering 2022 we expect the market to remain somewhat challenged given elevated regional inventories of both softwood pulpwood and sawmill residuals in closing with the new management team fully in place our highly capable team is energized and committed to acadianâ s future success in 2022 we will continue to seek opportunities for growth both internally and externally and for improvements to our operating performance with that we are now available to take your questions operator question and answer session operator certainly our first question comes from the line of andrew kuske from credit suisse your question please andrew kuske thanks good afternoon appreciate the time on the call maybe the starting question is just on the buyback announcements and if we go back many years itâ s been done in the past at times to allocate capital but i guess just looking at it now how do you think about the right times to allocate capital on a buyback and just how does it fit into your evaluation framework for the overall company adam sheparski yes thanks we spent a lot of time thinking with the ncib obviously and we wanted to ensure that we were prepared for what may come about in 2022 obviously markets are a little bit volatile we have been fortunate that our share price hasnâ t gone north or south dramatically but as we go into 2022 we could see some variability in our cash flows and so we wanted to make sure that we were ready to address any potential excess capital that we have and to reward our shareholders as such andrew kuske okay thatâ s â adam thatâ s helpful and then maybe just a question on what you are seeing in the markets and i think you laid out a good outlook in the release and then also on this call but i guess maybe one area that goes forgotten at times you talked about the u s housing market dynamics and how robust they can be but atlantic canada itself is going through quite a resurgence and migration real estate all of those things what opportunities do you see in the local market to really benefit acadianâ s positioning adam sheparski thatâ s a good question itâ s in the news atlantic canada has been seeing a lot of a growth which is frankly itâ s been a rare for atlantic canada for some time now if i think about our customer base i suspect there will be more demand from them coming into atlantic canada i see as we mentioned before andrew we need more processing to come online and i think there is opportunities for that in atlantic canada and maybe that growth locally may based on that to be honest the price of lumber as it stands today and what we have seen i think people are operating pretty steady and we wouldnâ t expect that to change but we never know if it could stem some more investment in the region which would absolutely help with our sales andrew kuske okay thatâ s great thank you very much adam sheparski thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of paul quinn from rbc capital markets your question please paul quinn yes thanks very much good morning guys as you referenced new customers in your press release i am just wondering how significant that is what the new customers would make up of sales in â 21 adam sheparski itâ s not a big number in 2021 i would say that going into 2020 i am still not sure it will be a big percentage of sales as you know we are a softwood â most of our sales are softwood and we have a couple of large customers including obviously twin rivers under fiber supply agreement we are seeing customers coming in on the hardwood side which has been positive from our perspective although those customers may improve or increase a little bit of 2022 i think the key to remember is in the hardwood side itâ s also sales volumes might be not significantly impacted we expect margins to just start to improve associated with that paul quinn okay so it sounds like the new customers are more on the hardwood side than the softwood side is that right adam sheparski yes thatâ s safe to say paul quinn okay then just sticking with the softwood customers what are your customers saying about the outlook their outlook for 2022 and where their inventory is on a relative basis adam sheparski yes i think it depends on who you ask we have different customers on different sides of the border obviously different products even on softwood i would say that a couple of customers probably seen inventories come down as we entered into the end of the year but i would say there is sufficient supply in new brunswick we are seeing some opportunities in maine for softwood obviously which you have seen in our q4 results and we would expect continued demand in maine paul quinn okay and then â and just lastly i am really curious on your carbon â your carbon plan here so maybe you could give us some specifics of how this is working and what you are selling into the market adam sheparski so not showing anything yet but with the agreement in place this year we are currently in the process or finalizing inventory amount which â and beginning to start to calculate what carbon credits will be available to us for sale as we previously disclosed we are expecting to probably start selling those credits mid to late 2022 the timeline has not changed itâ s still on track and then again thatâ s on just the east portion in maine which is about 190 000 acres we havenâ t really spent a lot of time working on the other pieces of our property i could say we spent a lot of time thinking about it but we are taking 2022 to really understand the carbon market the process and how it evolves and specifically as it relates to new brunswick we are going to take those learnings in maine we are going to wait to see what the compliance market in canada looks like and we expect that to happen in 2023 and 2024 so i would say 2022 is the year of understanding the process understanding maine start to receive some revenue associated with the carbon credits in maine and then 2023 if we choose to move forward with future projects done thatâ s probably one paul quinn okay so just so i understand that the â what you got the agreement honored is that they credits themselves they are resulting from deferred harvests are they resulting from something you are doing to increase the growth of the course adam sheparski i would say they are being developed based on market norms is how they calculate it in maine so comparing our growth rates and our harvesting to the markets in maine in the general markets in maine paul quinn okay and just lastly just because that voluntary carbon value might be different in east coast what is that market currently sitting at i mean what do you hope to monetize it at price per ton adam sheparski i would never guess what the market is going to be at when we go to sell paul i would say we understand that the market is about mid teens we understand is it hasnâ t really changed much since we talked back in october but i would never try and estimate what thatâ s going to be mid to late 2022 paul quinn alright hey thatâ s helpful thanks very much adam sheparski great thanks operator and this does conclude the question and answer session of todayâ s program i would like to hand the program back to adam sheparski for any further remarks adam sheparski thank you on behalf of the board and management of acadian i would like to thank all of our shareholders for their ongoing support thank you stay safe and we look forward to our first quarter conference call on may 5th goodbye operator thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in todayâ s conference this does conclude the program you may now disconnect good day
