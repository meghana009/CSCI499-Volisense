i do think i ll get a deal president biden telling voters he s confident the marathon to pass his domestic agenda is nearing an end after months of negotiations and infighting between democrats look i ve been i was a senator for 370 years and i was never i was relatively good at putting together deals but today biden facing a different dynamic when you re in the united states senate and your president united states and you have 50 democrats everyone is a president every single one so you got to work things out one of those key senators clearly on the president s mind mr manchin is uh as opposed to that joe is not a bad guy and he s a friend and he s always the end of the day come around and voted mr manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college the president named checking senator joe manchin as well as senator kirsten cinema throughout the night and first of all she s smart as a devil number one number two she s very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation where she s not supportive and she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and or on wealthy people period the to moderate democrats stalling the effort to get biden s bill through the senate and forcing hard choices we re down to four or five issues which i m not going to negotiate on national television as you might guess the president says he s willing to slim down or even eliminate some sections of his plan removing a proposal to fund free community college nationwide cutting down paid parental leave from 12 to just four weeks and extending the child tax credit for just one more year biden also saying it will be tough to expand medicare to cover dental vision and hearing that s a reach and the reason why it s a reach it s not i think it s a good idea and it s not that costly in relative terms a potential compromise 800 dental vouchers for people in need as for mansions push to add a work requirement for the child tax credit no here s the deal all these people are working anyway on voting rights the president says he s open to possibly reforming the filibuster a senate rule requiring a 60 vote threshold to advance most legislation well that remains to be seen exactly what that means in terms of fundamentally all or not whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up just so i m clear though you would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue is that correct and maybe more outside passing is sweeping agenda biden also discussed supply chain issues climate change policing and immigration specifically the situation at the southern border with mexico i guess i should go down but the uh the whole point of it is i haven t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down with the coronavirus pandemic still a reality the president says he s hopeful vaccines will soon be available for children ages 5 11 unlike past administrations science will dictate this i m not telling anyone no i really mean the expectations are to be ready in the near term meaning weeks not not months and months advertisement as biden and top democrats strategize pelosi says a deal is very possible share copy link copy president joe biden and congress top two democrats labored to wrap up their giant domestic legislation friday as the party continued scaling back the measure and determining ways to pay for it ahead of new deadlines biden had breakfast at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined in a call from new york the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package of social services and climate change strategies to around 2 trillion pushing for an agreement pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on health care provisions pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said democrats have set an informal goal of agreeing to an outline of the plan by the end of this week a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components could lay the groundwork for final agreements on detailed legislation leaders hope democrats want to reach an accord on the legislation before biden departs for a trip to europe late next week at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free pre kindergarten for all youngsters negotiations proceed as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall thursday for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions are down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations or individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another key democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema will not raise a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which senator sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid monthslong family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten a one year extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top rate of 39 6 of those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples but the revisions would not be all positive for big companies and the wealthy the white house is reviving the idea of a 15 minimum corporate tax rate which biden had proposed this year that s even for companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans ___associated press writers alex jaffe kevin freking and zeke miller contributed to

on wednesday ex president and current loser donald trump announced he is launching the trump media technology group tmtg a venture supposedly valued at 2 billion that will encompass everything from a hellhole social network called truth social to non woke entertainment par for his track record it looks like he s trying to snatch up rights to various permutations of the word truth as mother jones points out filings with the u s patent and trademark office from a florida lawyer named holly collins look an awful lot like they were made on behalf of tmtg on oct 13 collins filed for a trademark on truthsocial with the purposes listed as related to software telecommunications online user generated content and digital content hosting on oct 14 she filed for a trademark on tmtg and the next day for tmtg both listed as related to mobile applications advertising and marketing and on demand content streaming around the same time collins also filed for a number of terms that one could easily see popping up as the lingua franca of truth social perhaps replacing terms like fave or retweet on oct 14 she filed for trademarks on truthing retruth post a truth and follow the truth the last of those is actually already in use the filing for follow the truth is accompanied by a logo identical to promotional materials released by trump s media group and which also appears as the main catchphrase on the truth social website collins told the patent office she was filing the trademark requests on behalf of t media tech llc which was registered in delaware this summer and is based in orlando florida it doesn t appear to have any online presence unless of course it s the same entity as or one of those owned by tmtg gizmodo reached out to tmtg but didn t receive a response we ll update if we hear back trump is famously obsessed with branding and trademarks it s the reason why the trump family name appears on far more properties than they actually own one example npr reported in 2015 is a series of towers on the west side that bear trump s name despite him not actually having an ownership stake in them in the 1970s trump reportedly owed chase bank hundreds of millions of dollars over the riverside south project of which the towers were a part at the same time his other real estate businesses and atlantic city casino were struggling trump was forced to sell the development to investors from hong kong to avoid a total collapse but the deal he struck required leaving the trump logo on them according to npr trump owns just a handful of the 17 trump branded buildings in nyc in 2011 trump claimed to be worth 9 billion of which 4 billion he claimed was the value of his brand at that time trump had filed over 200 trademark applications for everything from trump class and trumpnet to the donald j trump credit card tour de trump and ominously trump power he also regularly files for trademarks to businesses that he has yet to publicly announce so this is a guy obsessed with snatching the rights to pretty much anything he can get his hands on tmtg will be listed on the nasdaq stock exchange courtesy of a merger with another shell company digital world acquisition group which is acting as a special purpose acquisition company spac spacs are basically shell companies formed for the sole purpose of acquiring an unlisted company in order to fast track it to going public spacs have raised over us100 a 134 billion in recent years largely focusing on the tech sector and in the process becoming emblematic of the speculative hype that s rife in tech investments trump s venture appears to be a little different as cnn noted despite the announcement being accompanied by an investor info packet rather than the more usual disclosures of financial projections and details on the deal shares in digital world acquisition group are now skyrocketing after closing at us9 96 13 on wednesday it was worth up to 177 a share on friday according to cnn this is extremely unusual especially now nowadays it s rare to see a spac pop more than 10 matt kennedy a senior ipo market strategist at renaissance capital told cnn this is clearly meme stock territory it s totally disconnected from fundamentals kennedy added to investors he warned be prepared to lose potentially everything else this is a stock trading purely on momentum beyond the speculative surge tmtg and truth social have one accomplishment to date likely being the death of gettr the maga social network that longtime trump aide jason miller became ceo of this year truth social is itself not doing so hot as it was promptly flooded with trolls who discovered an insecure signup page that shouldn t have been live yet one of them registered the handle donaldjtrump and immediately began posting a meme of a pig pooping developers behind the open source codebase that truth social appears to be built on mastodon have accused tmtg of violating the software s licensing agreement and are demanding that the company come into compliance within 30 days or risk facing legal action

federal government to prepare for and respond to disasters while the agency has supported states and health care systems throughout the pandemic it has mainly done so by providing resources and coordination assistance such as setting up mobile vaccination units and reimbursing states for some inoculation efforts rothenberg said in other cases the agency has coordinated with the u s department of health and human services office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response to distribute supplies such as ventilators and antibody treatments and has worked with other federal agencies that deploy medical staff requested by states according to rothenberg in partnership with health and human services veterans affairs and department of defense we have deployed medical

plane crashes reported claim vaccine related strokes in pilots have caused an epidemic of plane crashes the facts a video circulating widely on facebook and various video sharing websites this week spreads a bogus claim that vaccine linked medical ailments in pilots have caused numerous recent plane crashes the nearly 30 minute video uses fake news banners and fear mongering narration to baselessly suggest recent plane accidents including an oct 11 small plane crash in a san diego suburb happened because pilots had strokes caused by covid 19 vaccines there s a silent epidemic of plane crashes happening around the country and nobody s connecting the dots the video s narrator says by listening to the audio from the cockpit of this latest crash it s clear that the pilot was having a stroke the pilot was a doctor from a hospital he was required to get the vaccine it s true the pilot in the oct 11 crash was a cardiologist but the claim that he suffered a medical condition after receiving the covid 19 vaccine is not supported by any evidence to date the national transportation safety board which said it is investigating the crash has not yet stated a cause the idea that there s an epidemic of vaccine related plane crashes is also unsupported faa spokesperson brittany trotter told the associated press in an email that the agency has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with covid 19 vaccines faa data shows that fatality rates from general aviation accidents have decreased in 2021 pilots who want to fly a plane or serve as a required airline crew member after receiving a dose of a covid 19 vaccine must wait 48 hours before doing so according to faa guidelines that s intended to allow pilots to wait out any side effects from the vaccine which the centers for disease control and prevention says are typically mild to moderate and resolve within a few days there is no evidence that covid 19 vaccines increase the risk of stroke but the coronavirus itself is associated with an increased risk of stroke according to dr mitchell s v elkind a professor of neurology and epidemiology at columbia university and the immediate past president of the american heart association about 1 2 of people hospitalized with covid develop strokes elkind told the ap in an email so

president joe biden the falsified memo from shared services canada which used the image of the canadian flag in its letterhead said federal employees were banned from using the phrase let s go brandon in any variation under any circumstance and violators of the policy could be fired online posts echoed the false language the phrase refers to a meme that emerged earlier this month from a video of an

social policy and programs supply chain issues terrible job numbers people quitting their job because the government is essentially forcing them to put a needle in their arm or lose their job crumbling economy terrible inflation and the list goes on this is joe biden s build back better the instagram caption stated but the post which received more than 135 000 likes on instagram left out that the photo was taken during a severe winter storm the photo was taken on feb 20 2021 in houston by photographer francois picard for agence france presse the extreme low temperatures left millions in texas without power and water which also devastated the entire transportation infrastructure leading to food supply issues some grocery stores had to close locations entirely the legislation at the center of biden s build back better plan was introduced to the house in september and democrats are still working to rally support for the bill due to the pandemic there have been ongoing supply chain disruptions causing grocery stores to have inconsistent inventory but there are currently no nationwide food shortages or widespread supply chain issues according to the united states department of

i do think i ll get a deal president biden telling voters he s confident the marathon to pass his domestic agenda is nearing an end after months of negotiations and infighting between democrats look i ve been i was a senator for 370 years and i was never i was relatively good at putting together deals but today biden facing a different dynamic when you re in the united states senate and your president united states and you have 50 democrats everyone is a president every single one so you got to work things out one of those key senators clearly on the president s mind mr manchin is uh as opposed to that joe is not a bad guy and he s a friend and he s always the end of the day come around and voted mr manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college the president named checking senator joe manchin as well as senator kirsten cinema throughout the night and first of all she s smart as a devil number one number two she s very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation where she s not supportive and she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and or on wealthy people period the to moderate democrats stalling the effort to get biden s bill through the senate and forcing hard choices we re down to four or five issues which i m not going to negotiate on national television as you might guess the president says he s willing to slim down or even eliminate some sections of his plan removing a proposal to fund free community college nationwide cutting down paid parental leave from 12 to just four weeks and extending the child tax credit for just one more year biden also saying it will be tough to expand medicare to cover dental vision and hearing that s a reach and the reason why it s a reach it s not i think it s a good idea and it s not that costly in relative terms a potential compromise 800 dental vouchers for people in need as for mansions push to add a work requirement for the child tax credit no here s the deal all these people are working anyway on voting rights the president says he s open to possibly reforming the filibuster a senate rule requiring a 60 vote threshold to advance most legislation well that remains to be seen exactly what that means in terms of fundamentally all or not whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up just so i m clear though you would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue is that correct and maybe more outside passing is sweeping agenda biden also discussed supply chain issues climate change policing and immigration specifically the situation at the southern border with mexico i guess i should go down but the uh the whole point of it is i haven t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down with the coronavirus pandemic still a reality the president says he s hopeful vaccines will soon be available for children ages 5 11 unlike past administrations science will dictate this i m not telling anyone no i really mean the expectations are to be ready in the near term meaning weeks not not months and months advertisement as biden and top democrats strategize pelosi says a deal is very possible share copy link copy president joe biden and congress top two democrats labored to wrap up their giant domestic legislation friday as the party continued scaling back the measure and determining ways to pay for it ahead of new deadlines biden had breakfast at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined in a call from new york the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package of social services and climate change strategies to around 2 trillion pushing for an agreement pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on health care provisions pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said democrats have set an informal goal of agreeing to an outline of the plan by the end of this week a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components could lay the groundwork for final agreements on detailed legislation leaders hope democrats want to reach an accord on the legislation before biden departs for a trip to europe late next week at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free pre kindergarten for all youngsters negotiations proceed as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall thursday for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions are down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations or individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another key democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema will not raise a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which senator sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid monthslong family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten a one year extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top rate of 39 6 of those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples but the revisions would not be all positive for big companies and the wealthy the white house is reviving the idea of a 15 minimum corporate tax rate which biden had proposed this year that s even for companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans ___associated press writers alex jaffe kevin freking and zeke miller contributed to

a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation friday though appearing to let the day s informal deadline slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on health care provisions biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set democrats had imposed a friday deadline to at least strike agreement but by early evening no deal was announced much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free pre kindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions were down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans

disappointing september nonfarm payrolls data failed to alter tapering prospects a gdp reading near the market consensus could trigger another leg higher in us t bond yields the benchmark 10 year us t bond yield stays within a touching distance of the critical 1 75 mark and a break above that level could open the door for additional dollar strength on the other hand a big miss could cause investors to price in a delay in the reduction of the fed s asset purchases and weigh heavily on the dollar finally the personal consumption expenditures pce price index the fed s preferred gauge of inflation will be the last data release of the week to watch on friday however this data by itself is unlikely to have a significant impact on xau usd if the trend is already set by the preceding events gold technical outlook although the relative strength on the daily chart edged higher to 60 it s difficult to say that the outlook is bullish unless gold makes a decisive move above the 1 795 1 800 area where the fibonacci 50 retracement of april june uptrend 100 day sma and the 200 day sma meet above that hurdle 1 825 30 area fibonacci 38 2 retracement of the april june uptrend static level could be seen as the next target before 1 840 static level on the downside 1 780 50 day sma aligns as the first support ahead of 1 770 former resistance fibonacci 61 8 retracement sellers are likely to maintain control of the action as long as the above mentioned resistance holds gold sentiment poll according to the fxstreet forecast poll gold is widely expected to reclaim 1 800 in the short term but the upside potential remains limited with an average target of 1 815 on the one week view the bullish bias remains intact on the monthly and quarterly outlooks as well
with the s p 500 back at its all time highs gold stopped lagging behind however how long can this unsustainable growth last the fomo rally while the s p 500 has demonstrated a resounding ability to shake off bad news an epic divergence has developed between positioning and economic expectations and while fear of missing out fomo keeps sentiment near the high end of its range q3 gdp growth is projected near the low end of its range for example while the atlanta fed s third quarter gdp growth estimate was north of 5 in early september the bank reduced the estimate to 1 3 on oct 5 moreover with the outlook even worse now the atlanta fed cut its q3 gdp growth estimate to 0 5 on oct 19 to explain the blue line above tracks the blue chip consensus gdp growth estimate for the third quarter and the shaded blue area represents the range of economists estimates if you analyze the depth you can see that economists expect a print in the 2 to 5 5 range in stark contrast the green line above tracks the atlanta fed s gdpnow estimate which has sunk like a stone and now implies 0 5 gdp growth in the third quarter what s more bank of america also released its latest global fund manager survey on oct 19 and with institutional investors increasing their equity exposure when their economic expectations have turned negative for the first time in 18 months fomo is now on full display to explain the dark blue line above tracks the net percentage of respondents that are overweight equities while the light blue line above tracks the net percentage of respondents that expect stronger economic growth if you analyze the right side of the chart you can see that intuitional investors equity positioning still far exceeds what s implied from economic growth prospects as a result if the dark blue line moves lower and reconnects with the light blue line plenty of sell orders will hit the market on top of that with stagflation fears now front and center institutional investors are hitting the bid even when their better judgment tells them otherwise to explain the dark blue line above tracks the net percentage of respondents that expect above trend growth and above trend inflation while the light blue line above tracks the net percentage of respondents that expect below trend growth and above trend inflation if you analyze the red circle on the right side of the chart you can see that growth with inflation prophecies are losing momentum the dark blue line while fears of low growth and persistent inflation are increasing the light blue line will we see an inflation miracle moreover with the fed stuck between a rock high inflation and a hard place weak growth the margin for error has dwindled and one policy mistake could bring down equities entire house of cards to that point while i ve been warning for months that the fed was and still is materially behind the inflation curve fomc officials aren t the only ones displaying inflationary anxiety to explain inflationary concerns have surged in october and while the spread between institutional investors concerns over inflation and the fed taper is quite the oxymoron persistent inflation makes another hawkish surprise even more likely moreover with the death of qe unlikely to solve the inflationary conundrum on its own the fed will likely forecast further tightening in 2022 to that point slowly but surely institutional investors are waking up to this reality for context q3 earnings calls have been riddled with mentions of inflation and many ceos that dabble in real goods have projected a further acceleration in 2022 as a result with the transitory camp now suffering a death by a thousand cuts it will likely take a miracle for the fed s 2022 inflation forecast to come to fruition to explain 69 28 of respondents viewed inflation as transitory permanent in september however the script has flipped to 58 and 38 in october as a result it s likely only a matter of time before the majority of institutional investors and the fed realize what s actually happening on the ground case in point unilever a consumer goods company with 149 000 employees and 400 brands that operates in more than 190 countries released its third quarter earnings on oct 21 cfo graeme pitkethly said that q4 price increases should at least rival q3 and extend into 2022 source reuters moreover unilever ceo alan jope told bloomberg on oct 21 peak inflation will be in the first half of 2022 and it will moderate as we move towards the second half we continue to responsibly take pricing and that s in relation to the very high levels of inflation we re seeing the s p 500 ahead of a deep correction furthermore i highlighted on oct 21 that rising commodity prices over the last month should filter into the commodity producer price index ppi and headline consumer price index cpi in the coming months i wrote the commodity ppi is a reliable leading indicator of the following month s headline consumer cpi and if the former stays flat for the next three months which is unlikely referencing releases in november 2021 december 2021 and january 2022 the readings will still imply year over year yoy percentage increases in the headline cpi in the 4 75 to 5 50 range furthermore this is an extremely conservative forecast since the commodity ppi has increased month over month mom for the last 17 months thus it s more likely that the headline cpi rises above 6 yoy than it falls below 4 yoy to that point union pacific railroad a shipping company that operates 8 300 locomotives in 23 u s states released its third quarter earnings on oct 21 and with freight revenue up by 12 and average revenue per car up by 9 evp kenny rocker said that the results reflected strong core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more importantly though with the input surge intensifying over the last 30 days the cost push inflationary spiral remains alive and well and it signals something important source union pacific railroad the motley fool finally the reason why inflation is so important in terms of its direct effect on the general stock market and its indirect effect on the pms is due to the composition of the s p 500 with information technology and communication services stocks accounting for roughly 39 of the s p 500 s movement deflationary assets have been the go to source for returns since 2009 however if the transitory narrative suffers a painful death a material unwind could ensure to explain the deflation basket the dark blue line has materially outperformed the inflation basket the light blue line since the global financial crisis gfc thus if surging inflation encourages a reversion to the mean immense volatility could strike the s p 500 the bottom line with investors prioritizing fomo over fundamentals the general stock market s recent uprising has helped uplift the pms however with the fed losing its inflation battle and the usd index poised to benefit from more hawkish momentum over the next few months a profound correction of the s p 500 will only enhance the u s dollar s already robust fundamentals moreover with the pms often moving inversely to the u s dollar their performance should suffer along the way in conclusion the pms declined on oct 21 as the usd index regained its mojo furthermore the front end of the u s yield curve surged 2 year yield up by 21 rounded and the u s 10 year treasury yield closed at its highest level 1 7 rounded since apr 4 thus while the pms borrow confidence from the s p 500 their fundamentals are actually deteriorating

usd jpy reaches 114 70 on wednesday a four year high 10 year treasury jgb spread widens by 7 points usd jpy encounters profit taking rebounds from support on friday fxstreet forecast poll is uniformly bearish out to one quarter after a month of torrid gains that extended to a four year high at 114 70 on wednesday the usd jpy executed a modest about face on thursday losing about 40 points and closing just below 114 00 in its initial rebound the usd jpy keyed on the first support encountered at 113 65 underlying the still buoyant nature of the pair on the week the usd jpy was slightly lower opening at 114 20 on monday and finishing on friday at 113 56 over the last month from the close on september 21 the day before the federal reserve meeting the usd jpy has gained 4 2 tuesday s finish at 114 38 was the highest close since october 10 2018 in comparison the eur usd had lost just under 1 to friday s open and the sterling had gained a bit less than 1 in the same period the japanese yen has been the weakest major against the dollar over the past four weeks since the federal open market committee fomc meeting on september 22 and the primary reason is sovereign yields the differential between the japanese government bond jgb 10 year yield and the us 10 year treasury has ballooned 28 basis points from its position on september 21 during that time the us 10 year yield has gone from 1 324 to 1 662 while the jgb equivalent has gone from 0 042 to 0 096 this has increased the us 10 year treasury yield advantage 7 basis points to 1 563 interest rates are not the only logic behind the dollar s ascendancy over the yen the worldwide computer chip shortage is expected to hit japan s export industries especially automobiles hard over the next six to twelve months car shipments could fall 40 from last year japan s national election on october 31 is almost guaranteed to return the liberal democratic party ldp candidate current prime minister fumio kishida to office he has promised new fiscal and monetary stimulus programs to revive the japanese economy while the efficacy of these measures for invigorating japan s export driven economy is questionable their ability to keep the yen on the defensive is not japanese economic data was mixed this week exports and imports rose more than forecast in september but as the annual statistics are still recovering from the collapse last year they are not indications of a strong recovery yearly exports were down 4 9 in september 2020 and imports were off 17 1 national consumer prices rose for the first time in 11 months in september adding 0 2 on an expectation for a 0 8 decline and following august s 0 4 decrease core cpi dropped 0 5 yoy more than double the 0 2 forecast and equal to the prior month s drop industrial production in the us sank 1 3 in september far worse than the 0 2 prediction and capacity utilizations dropped to 75 2 from 76 2 these coincide with the atlanta fed s declining estimate for third quarter gdp now at 0 5 it is down from over 6 in early august the us housing market remained effervescent with existing home sales 90 of activity jumping 7 it is possible the threat of rising mortgage rates has motivated buyers to complete their purchases before the cost of buying a home increases the contrast between the strong if uneven us economy and japan s much slower recovery is another factor behind the gains in the usd jpy usd jpy outlook all eyes have turned to the federal reserve s november 3 meeting and the expected announcement of its bond program reductions treasury yields have moved steadily higher for the last month the yield on the 10 year treasury the most important commercial referent is less than 10 basis points below its march 31 high of 1 746 an announcement from the fomc regardless of the initial amount or schedule should keep us interest rates moving higher japan s sovereign yields are stagnant and are not about to mimic the gains in the us that logic is the largest reason behind the surge in the usd jpy the bank of japan and the japanese government have in the past used the exchange rate to bolster the nation s export industries over the past quarter century the usd jpy has varied from 145 to 77 at 114 the usd jpy is near the midpoint of that range as us yields rise and jgb returns plateau the upper half of that territory is becoming more and more likely as a long term goal one suspects the boj and the tokyo government would welcome such a devaluation the bias in the usd jpy is higher american data is expected to support the federal reserve case for commencing the bond taper the personal consumption expenditure price index for september is forecast to jump to 4 7 the core rate to 3 6 both records if correct the consensus forecast for the first reading on third quarter gdp is 5 4 the discrepancy to the atlanta fed gdpnow projection of 0 5 is notable and unusual it would probably take a result near the atlanta estimate for the fed to delay its taper announcement the boj interest rate decision monetary policy statement and outlook report have some potential for market impact prime minister kishida may have discussed his economic plans with boj officials as they likely involve bank actions any hints from the bank as to policy developments could weaken the yen japan statistics october 18 october 22 fxstreet us statistics october 18

is testimony to the usd jpy sprint after crossing 112 00 on october 8 the steep upward slope of these averages is their main contribution to the current technical picture the long gap between the 113

thursday s close at 113 88 did not prompt a further test of the upside after tuesday s three year record close at 114 38 wednesday s test to 114 70 likewise indicated that for the moment momentum is

with the fulminating on the left about inequality fighting inequality is the mission of our times as new york s new mayor bill de blasio summed up the theme of his postelection powwow with president barack obama it s worth pausing to admire anew the very different and very realistic modesty underlying thomas jefferson s deathless declaration that all men are created equal we are equal he went on to explain in having the same god given rights that no one can legitimately take away from us but jefferson well knew that one of those rights to pursue our own happiness in our own way would yield wildly different outcomes for individuals even this most radical of the founding fathers knew that the equality of rights on which american independence rests would necessarily lead to inequality of condition indeed he believed that something like an aristocracy would arise springing from talent and virtue he ardently hoped not from inherited wealth or status in the greatest of the federalist papers number 10 james madison explicitly pointed out the connection between liberty and inequality and he explained why you can t have the first without the second men formed governments madison believed as did all the founding fathers to safeguard rights that come from nature not from government rights to life to liberty and to the acquisition and ownership of property before we joined forces in society and chose an official cloaked with the authority to wield our collective power to restrain or punish violators of our natural rights those rights were at constant risk of being trampled by someone stronger than we over time though those officials successors grew autocratic and their governments overturned the very rights they were supposed to protect creating a world as arbitrary as the inequality of the state of nature in which the strongest took whatever he wanted until someone still stronger came along rmn grand palais art resource ny in response americans understanding that kings are the servants not the proprietors of the people as jefferson snarled fired their king and created a democratic republic under its safeguard of our equal right to liberty each of us madison saw will employ his different talents drive and energy to follow his own individual dream of happiness with a wide variety of successes and failures most notably federalist 10 pointed out from the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results that inequality would be a sign of the new nation s success not failure it would mean that people were really free the democratic republic that the american revolution brought into being however contained the seeds of a new threat to natural rights madison fretted yes the new nation will operate by majority rule but even democratic majorities can t legitimately overturn the fundamental rights that it is government s purpose to safeguard no matter how overwhelming the vote to do so would be just as grievous a tyranny as the despotism of any sultan in his divan it would be in madison s famous phrase a tyranny of the majority as continental congressman richard henry lee put it an elective despotism is no less a despotism for all its democratic trappings how would such a tyranny occur almost certainly madison thought it would center on the apportionment of taxes levying taxes is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality yet there is perhaps no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number is a shilling saved to their own pockets how easy for the unpropertied many to expropriate the wealth of the propertied few by slow erosion decreeing that they should pay more than a proportionate share of the public expenses how seductive for the multitudinous farmers to levy taxes on the much smaller number of merchants or bankers or manufacturers while exempting themselves how tempting for the majority who have debts to transfer money secretly and silently away from the minority who are their creditors by debasing the currency so that the real value of what they owe steadily shrinks as madison well remembered from the ruinous inflation of the revolutionary war years and a year before the constitutional convention madison recalled the debt swamped farmers of western massachusetts had cooked up in shays s rebellion still more wicked and improper schemes for expropriating the property of others trying to close the courts at gunpoint to prevent foreclosures on their defaulted mortgages and even demanding the equal division of property so as chief architect of the constitution designed to give the federal government sufficient power to protect citizens basic rights above all the power to tax whose lack under the articles of confederation had made the revolutionary war longer and grimmer than it would have been if congress had had sufficient means to buy arms and pay soldiers madison proceeded with his heart in his mouth fearful that such augmented power made a tyranny of the majority all the more possible his main challenge at the convention as he saw it was to guard against precisely that outcome so while four of the 18 specific powers that article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress concern the levying of taxes and the borrowing and coining of money to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states taxes that shall be uniform throughout the united states eight of the rest deal with spending only for military and naval purposes while the general welfare powers extend only to building post offices and post roads establishing federal courts protecting intellectual property by copyrights and patents and regulating bankruptcies naturalization and interstate and foreign commerce not content merely to limit and define explicitly the federal government s power madison made sure that the constitution divided it up among several branches limiting the power that any single individual or official body could wield and putting each jealously on guard against any other s attempt to seize a disproportionate share moreover all these officials except the judges were elected representatives of the people they were the agents through whom americans who had no rulers governed themselves but why was the liberty that madison so mightily struggled to protect so precious americans knew how grievous its opposite was both from the enslaved blacks they saw all around them as well as from their knowledge that their own forebears had fled british persecution of non anglican protestants or european persecution of all protestants denied even freedom to express their own beliefs they knew what man could inflict on man but of all the founders treasury secretary alexander hamilton gave the most positive eloquent and inspiring answer to that question though in fact he thought that he was answering a question about economics illegitimate orphaned and poor hamilton dreamed big dreams as a teenage clerk sitting on his countinghouse stool on a small west indian island whose only business was sugar and slaves ambition burned within him along with a keen but unformed sense of his own talent he knew he could be something other than he was but what or how he didn t foresee maybe a war would come he daydreamed and give him his chance it did come by then through some fairy tale like strokes of good fortune he found himself in new york studying at king s college later columbia with eighteenth century student activism he dropped out of school joined the army rose by dint of the talent he knew he had to be general washington s right hand man and then with national independence won and washington elected president his treasury secretary if the liberty that america had secured through the war was going to be about pursuing your own happiness in your own way then hamilton aimed to create an economy that would give his fellow citizens the fullest opportunity to do so through a limitless variety of career possibilities america shouldn t just be an agricultural country he knew it should teem with industry trade finance everything imaginable and opportunity would breed opportunity as human ingenuity and curiosity the most valuable natural resources of all came up with new inventions new discoveries new ways of doing things new ways of using already existing things the bowels as well as the surface of the earth hamilton wrote will be ransacked for articles which were before neglected animals plants and minerals acquire an utility and value which were before unexplored the wealth of the nation and of individuals will mushroom he saw and america s opportunity economy would be a mighty engine of upward mobility to this end he established a financial system that made credit for setting up new enterprises plentiful and when he came to establish the new u s mint he made sure that it would strike coins of very small denomination to ensure that even the humblest could rise through the enrichment machine he had set in motion but the opportunity hamilton had in mind wasn t just the chance to get rich musing on his clerk s stool in saint croix he had feared that the fire burning within him would just gutter out if he found no outlet for his genius the best minds he concluded from his own experience labour without effect if confined to uncongenial pursuits in a free opportunity society by contrast each individual can find his proper element and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature the purpose of such a society is moral as well as practical to cherish and stimulate the activity of the human mind by multiplying the object of enterprise is a kind of soulcraft much of what we can make of our single life or even imagine making of it depends on the kind of society around us the liberty and opportunity that the united states would afford hamilton believed with all his fiery intensity would allow individuals to realize every god given potential and to become all that they had it within themselves to be it s hard to imagine a higher aspiration for your fellow man than that when we see the same faults followed by the same misfortunes madison wrote we may reasonably think that if we could have known the first we might have avoided the others so against the liberty and opportunity central to the founding american vision which produced two centuries of freedom and prosperity unmatched in history what have the dreams of equality yielded at the outermost extreme the french upheaval for égalité in 1789 and the russian drive toward a classless society in 1917 drenched every inch of their respective countries in blood and immeasurably decreased the stock of human happiness and freedom for years to come to be sure even a bill de blasio cherishes no such radical fantasies and if barack obama ever flirts with them he keeps it to himself but there is an american version of that impulse that dates back at least to shays s rebellion with its dream of an equal division of property in the twentieth century it most dramatically reshaped the nation whenever a progressive president like obama joined forces with a progressive new york mayor like de blasio to redistribute wealth through unequal taxation in a way that madison would have seen as a betrayal of his most fundamental beliefs sure to end badly it began in the great depression which convinced franklin roosevelt and fiorello la guardia that individuals were too puny powerless and insignificant to shape their fates in a world seemingly governed by vast impersonal forces that only a vast and mighty government could match indeed because fdr thought that the depression was a crisis of overproduction he also concluded that the hamiltonian vision of invention discovery and creation had grown obsolete the age of production was over and the age of redistribution had begun with government the only fair and wise arbiter of who should get what culver pictures the art archive at art resource ny roosevelt while still new york s governor had already begun to provide cash welfare to the indigent in 1931 and when he introduced the program nationally as president la guardia upped the ante quadrupling the federal dole in new york city with state and city funding though fdr soon ended the means tested national program as demeaning to recipients and replaced it with relief tied to work by the depression s end la guardia had built the nation s first archipelago of subsidized housing projects nine in all along with publicly funded hospitals and he spent taxpayer dollars to take over and subsidize the city s subway and bus lines and to establish a municipal health insurance system so for some housing health and transportation were now the government s responsibility paid for by others with the depression over a 1943 race riot convinced the mayor that taxpayer dollars still needed to flow into the welfare system in ever increasing amounts to create racial justice karl marx was partly right in saying that when history repeats itself it happens the first time as tragedy the second as farce for the next collaboration of a progressive president and new york mayor to reduce inequality that of lyndon johnson and john lindsay certainly began as farce but ended in a tragedy that continues to unfold to this day picking up the new dealers torch lindsay fell over himself with eagerness to make new york a demonstration project for johnson s war on poverty a grotesque failure that on its 50th anniversary this year mainstream reporters too young and uninformed to know better have striven to repaint as a success johnson s originally hamiltonian impulse to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities took as its operating model a cockeyed far left new york city community organizing program the chief self development activity of which was to protest noisily against the system hamilton s american capitalism that is to say which the community organizers deemed too racist and inequitable ever to provide opportunity lindsay himself as cockeyed as the community organizers decided that he could make impoverished black new yorkers into middle class citizens by building them public housing projects in middle class neighborhoods giving them middle class style control of their public schools and generating middle class incomes through a greatly expanded and enriched depression era cash welfare program aid to families with dependent children administered with such lax oversight that the city s welfare commissioner earned the nickname come and get it ginsberg despite war on poverty funding these projects required lindsay s imposition of a city income tax in 1966 in addition to the state and federal taxes that new yorkers already paid though the 1913 ratification of the sixteenth amendment levying the first permanent income tax with unequal graduated rates cracked open the door to madison s dreaded tyranny of the majority it was only in the depression that radical income redistribution became national policy it stayed so for half a century until the reagan administration gradually lowered income tax rates and made them less unequal but thereafter radical redistribution resumed so that by 2010 according to the congressional budget office the top earning 40 percent of households paid 106 2 percent of u s income taxes while the bottom 40 percent because of refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit paid minus 9 1 percent that bottom 40 percent received an average 18 950 in transfer payments including not just the refundable tax credits but also such means tested benefits as food stamps and medicaid as well as payments from medicare and social security programs to which they indeed contributed but social security is nevertheless an income transfer scheme in that low income recipients get paid back at higher rates than better off recipients as for the nonworking poor on welfare a new york family of four living in subsidized housing with food stamps medicaid and other means tested benefits receives the equivalent of 40 000 a year more than double what a 40 hour a week minimum wage job pays in the city though not counted in the government s official income statistics the fact that the internal revenue service that collects all this money for the government to redistribute does so without observing the most exact impartiality that madison urged but rather engages in schemes to trample on the rules of justice as kimberley strassel s exemplary wall street journal reporting on the agency s suppression of tea party groups has shown would be one more proof to madison that n framing a government of men over men the great difficulty is this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself now that president obama has turned into a brobdingnagian government power grab the governmental takeover of health care that began modestly with mayor la guardia and that ballooned with the war on poverty s creation of medicaid and medicare america will more resemble the fiscally unsustainable european welfare states than the u s under the madisonian constitution as government spending rises in part because the president has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance as jefferson complained in the declaration of independence less of the private capital and ready credit that hamilton foresaw as an engine of opportunity for ordinary citizens to build businesses and create upward mobility for themselves and their employees remains available moreover the array of new taxes concealed within the so called affordable care act as well as its income redistribution subsidies will further clog the gears of the opportunity machine in california s monterey county for instance a 54 year old part time worker making 18 000 annually will pay 1 a month for the same mid range policy that will cost a 54 year old with a 60 000 annual salary 848 a month almost 18 percent of his pretax income with almost triple the maximum yearly out of pocket co pays according to a california health benefit exchange website he d pay 1 412 a month if he should have the bad judgment to marry the 18 000 a year part timer though the kaiser family foundation gives slightly lower estimates thanks to sluggish economic and stagnant employment growth for the younger generation of americans it s already no longer true that each individual can find his proper element and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature the liberty to be whatever your talents might allow you to become has shriveled and could continue to shrivel toward a european dearth of opportunity the liberty to choose something as important as your own health care has also shrunk unless you re very rich so inequality has also widened one can t help hear the echo of richard henry lee s phrase an elective despotism when recalling that congress which passed the affordable care act by the slimmest of majorities without bothering to read it set up an appointive board largely unanswerable to the people s elected representatives to make obamacare s most important decisions greatly expanding the undemocratic administrative apparatus that increasingly governs the country by edict or when one recalls that president obama unconstitutionally changed the law also by edict with a casual stroke of that pen imposing by diktat what the legislature won t legislate nothing madisonian there george washington and many of his fellow founders believed that a special kind of culture one that nurtures self reliance and a love of liberty was essential to keeping alive the free constitution over whose creation he had presided just as that spirit has guttered out in welfare state britain once home to the free born englishman it can dim here too blather from government officials about the unjust inequality of american society on top of a generation s worth of hot air from the universities the mainstream media and the multibillion dollar antibusiness entertainment industry about how hamiltonian madisonian america oppresses a wide range of aggrieved victims while poisoning the air the water and the very earth itself though of course human ingenuity can solve every problem human ingenuity creates all this inexorably erodes the spirit of self reliance enterprise and opportunity that animated the founders in their justified faith that they were creating a unique innovation in government that would immeasurably advance the happiness of mankind it is possible to demoralize an entire people and stifle their faith in the future and in themselves the welfare underclass filled with aggrieved resentment and void of hope is the most extreme case in point their demoralization is pure gold to the ever aggrandizing government though since here is the ultimate victim class that justifies the whole scheme of redistribution under the control of wise and mighty rulers as jefferson would have called them nevertheless despite their material comfort which includes the latest sneakers flat screen tvs angry rap downloads junk food galore and bigger apartments than many middle class europeans can afford the spiritual poverty that besets many of the underclass the tawdry content of their character is chilling and ought to give pause to any supporter of the huge redistributionist welfare state project because man makes the meaning of his life himself through work through family through community it is not easy for a person kept by government from womb to tomb like a gerbil in a cage to retain a sense of dignity and purpose is this really what we want for him nor is it easy for someone branded his victimizer and taxed unequally to support him and the army of bureaucrats who live by claiming to make sure he gets his due to retain with confidence his own sense of dignity and purpose hamilton and madison had a much larger and nobler sense of human possibility top photo kreicher istock

a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation friday though appearing to let the day s informal deadline slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on health care provisions biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set democrats had imposed a friday deadline to at least strike agreement but by early evening no deal was announced much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free pre kindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions were down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans

a deal within reach president biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their top priority domestic legislation friday though appearing to let the day s informal deadline slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies advertisement biden met at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader charles e schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care healthcare and clean energy programs pelosi d san francisco said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on healthcare provisions biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set democrats had imposed a friday deadline to at least reach an agreement but by early evening no deal was announced advertisement much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers white house press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years advertisement progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more directly appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democratic caucus and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down advertisement when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions were down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes on corporations and the wealthiest americans to pay for the package the white house seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal advertisement biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo former president trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year biden was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat fellow conservative sen joe manchin iii of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports advertisement if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a top line amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so that it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state the president acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide tuition free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy advertisement he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders i vt biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach advertisement instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the wealthiest americans and corporations pay their fair share in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for healthcare provided through the affordable care act advertisement the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would even apply to companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes advertisement the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans associated press writers

prequalified rates why do mortgage rates fluctuate if you follow mortgage interest rates for a few days you ll likely notice that rates can fluctuate by a bit or a lot from day to day many factors drive these fluctuations here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the job market has a widespread effect on the nation s overall economic health when more people are out of work the economy suffers when more people are fully employed the economy benefits the employment rate is also an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate the rate banks apply when borrowing lending money to each other overnight they do tend to follow it if that rate rises mortgage rates typically rise in tandem the fed also buys and sells mortgage backed securities or mbs a package of similar loans that a major mortgage investor buys and then resells to investors in the bond market rates tend to be lower when the fed is doing a lot of buying when the fed buys fewer mbs demand falls and rates will likely rise similarly when the fed raises the fed fund rate mortgage rates will also increase global economy global banking systems and economies are closely interconnected when economies in other parts of the world especially europe and asia experience a downturn it affects investors and financial institutions in the united states and when foreign economies are doing well they may attract more american investors and divert those investment dollars out of the u s economy those global influences contribute to the overall health of the u s economy when the domestic economy is doing well interest rates rise and when the american economy falters

benefits such as the advance child tax credit experts say you ll want to take action now if your income is set to rise to a level where the 2021 monthly child tax credits limits are in conflict with your income you may need to take action advised charles h thomas ii certified financial planner for intrepid eagle finance the irs offers an online portal to adjust your payment amounts declining the

is higher than expected they may also want to look into ways of reducing their taxable income so that their final tax bill is not as high as it could be he said related 9 unexpected companies hiring remote workers right now ronald suggested a few ways to do this one option is to put in some additional hours at work so that you exceed the threshold and transition into a new bracket he elaborated another method is to work with an accountant and help them establish a plan for your taxes to maximize deductions when possible some tax deductions for seasonal workers may include the cost of employer sponsored insurance smaller tax bills on itemized deductions and taxation of some social security benefits tax considerations for 1099 contractors this holiday season gig workers otherwise known as 1099 contractors who do not have payroll taxes deducted by their employer will have a few more considerations come tax time if you are a 1099 contractor you should understand that you are responsible for taxes on your contract income ronald said the irs states that all 1099 contractors are responsible for paying taxes on their own this means that they are accountable for figuring out the tax bracket they are in paying taxes based on that and then filing taxes with the government to report their income with that in mind contractors may wish to find ways to reduce their taxable

for more than half a century the great australian dream has been owning a home on a quarter acre block and pretty much the entire list of features included in the burke s backyard theme song in most of that time period rate cuts were welcomed by prospective home buyers as the calculations surrounding the cost of mortgage repayments became that little bit more achievable this is clear in westpac s time to buy a dwelling index which has now been running for 36 years despite the rba cash rate sitting at a record low 0 1 per cent in the past year the time to buy a dwelling index has plummeted when rates rise the consumer perception that the present is the right time to buy a home deteriorates in some cases immensely then when rates are cut the opposite generally occurs as households become more optimistic about the potential for buying under the current circumstances that is until recently despite the rba cash rate sitting at a record low 0 1 per cent in the past year the time to buy a dwelling index has plummeted to its lowest level since shortly before the financial crisis excluding the sudden drop that occurred when australia first went into lockdown this is arguably driven almost entirely by housing prices rocketing since late last year or early this year depending on the market in question in the united states it s a similar story in the university of michigan s consumer confidence survey the percentage of respondents who say that now is a good time to buy a home is currently sitting at its lowest level since october 1982 it seems like pretty much everywhere you look around the world housing prices are heading higher pricing out potential buyers who may have been able to afford to buy prior to the pandemic in australia the impact of rising prices on first home buyers has already become clear according to housing finance data from the australian bureau of statistics abs the number of new first homebuyer finance commitments has dropped by 22 8 per cent and appears set to continue to fall when rates rise the consumer perception that the present is the right time to buy a home deteriorate yet despite the number of first home buyers falling significantly and many australians seemingly seeing the present as a poor time to buy a home transaction volumes continue to remain strong part of this stems from investor activity in the market which has picked up significantly since bottoming out shortly after australia first went into lockdown last year since may 2020 the volume of borrowings by investors for properties has risen by 124 7 per cent the number of new first homebuyer finance commitments has dropped by 22 8 per cent according to housing price data provider corelogic the number of homes sold across australia in the 12 months ending august was almost 598 000 this marks the highest number of properties transacted in a rolling 12 month period since 2004 so we are left with something of a paradox a housing market where first home buyers are increasingly bowing out and people generally believe it is a poor time to buy a dwelling yet at the same time housing turnover as a percentage of overall housing stock is trending up and sitting at roughly the long run average australia s annual housing turnover visualised while divergences like this are not uncommon in the short term one has to wonder if this has implications for the long term future is this the beginning of a new status quo where more australians are priced out of home ownership where many households continue to see it as a poor time to buy a home in aggregate due to high prices a new standard where first home buyers increasingly lean on parental support and home ownership is increasingly concentrated in the hands of higher income households in some of australia s most expensive regions there is arguably some evidence that this is already taking place according to research firm digital finance analytics in september 58 8 per cent of first home buyers were receiving some form of parental assistance in order to buy a home in that month the average level of parental assistance rose to a record high of 94 784 or will australians eventually come to terms with these higher prices and choose some form of alternative living arrangement in order to afford to be in their own home high levels of interstate migration from new south wales and victoria to queensland suggests that may already be occurring as the citizens of sydney and melbourne attempt to escape a median house price of over a million dollars there is also the rise of multi generational households and the shift toward working from home in a rural or semi rural area which has seen hundreds of thousands of australians pursue a different version of the traditional great australian dream where to from here for the immediate future it appears there are more than enough investors first home buyers with parental assistance and uptraders downtraders to power the market forward but as prices continue to rise and more households are priced out of homeownership while others are put off by the sticker shock of high transaction costs such as stamp duty and agent commissions housing demand may begin to fall away in time given the uncertainties that lay ahead as south eastern australia reopens and the global economy stumbles it s hard to know where housing demand will go in the long term perhaps it all depends on how many australians are willing to give up on the pursuit of the traditional version of the great australian dream and instead choose a different path to home ownership tarric brooker is a freelance journalist and social commentator avidcommentator
karma is not something limited to hinduism and buddhism also known as the principle of cause and effect it states that what you get is what you give this is probably why gandhi managed to get india independent with no violence he did not want it back against what he defended some people claiming to protect tesla did not get that and created a virtual hell for missy cummings the immediate result is that she closed her twitter account fsd nhtsa adas full self driving i m really sick of seeing the abuse hurled by uninformed people towards missy_cummings petebuttigieg and nhtsagov if you re

youtube jennifer homendy jenniferhomendy october 22 2021 wrong this is reckless driving you should not sit in back of a tesla on autopilot ever autopilot is not autonomous or self driving your supervision is required 100 of the time you may kill yourself or others signed the guy w the tesla autopilot cannonballrun record pic twitter com lwemvv4jsa alex roy alexroy144 may 17 2021 unfortunately we do not doubt that the mob that attacked her is probably celebrating their victory everything points to precisely the opposite it was something they may regret for the rest of their lives if they really love tesla that much what they have done was to harm the company the first reason for that is a matter of reputation instead of attracting more people to the brand they claim to defend these guys are actually pushing them away from it famous folks have already said they would never buy a tesla regardless of how good they think the cars are it is a way to avoid being part of the club others compare these owners to some sort of cult even to fundamentalist religions their behavior towards cummings gives critics even more arguments to sustain that what does the company have to do with it a typical enterprise would have some sort of shielding by not getting involved with the discussion lars moravy and zachary kirkhorn tried to be professional about that at the q3 2021 earnings call but it was already too late elon musk said cummings was biased on twitter she quickly invited him to discuss that anytime the tesla ceo did not answer he only replied to a fake missy cummings that tweeted they would take away his beta because her lidar company could not compete with tesla the owner of that account has since changed its name to jeff who but the internet never forgets a screenshot shared by cristina balan shows musk s interaction with whoever the person behind that twitter account is any ceo would avoid that trap musk s answer showed he thought it was at least entertaining to make cummings bashing seem more legit these guys are saying cummings is biased because she is a member of the board of directors for veoneer the swedish lidar company connection would make her unfit for the task of being a safety adviser that is cringeworthy to say the least mahmood hikmet patiently explained why in a twitter thread summing it up missy cummings was not invited bybecause she is neutral or impartial the safety agency could just name a judge if that were the goal what nhtsa wants is her expertise it needs people who know what they are talking about cummings does that when it comes to autonomous driving tech and its interaction with humans she is a world specialist in the subject as hikmet stresses she is an adviser the government may get her opinion and accept it change its policies a bit due to what cummings says or completely ignore whatever she brings up making a petition to prevent her from advising nhtsa gives her role more weight than it actually has thanks to all the repercussions that may even become true the tesla fans that wrote a petition to ask nhtsa to cancel her nomination claim that they are doing that in the name of safety tesla s fsd and autopilot would save lives yet they do not explain why the company did not adopt proper testing with its software all other carmakers only put something in the hands of their customers when it is stable tesla released beta software for its customers to test it also did not forget a legal disclaimer that blames them if anything bad happens when testing the software it would be interesting to hear any explanation that could frame that as safe behavior in any way so far we have not seen a single argument to defend that which did not sound wholly lunatic or fallacious if these guys are against cummings her words on safety may be heard with more interest by the government on top of that the petition states that for over 13 years the industry has tried unsuccessfully to bring lidar powered self driving cars to market this is an ode to misinformation before anything else because there is no self driving car in the market although some tesla fans say it is perfectly safe to be in the rear seat when a tesla is on autopilot tesla itself has promised autonomous cars for years from a basically solved problem in 2016 it remains basically unsolved for a company that said its cars would become appreciating assets due to that capability tesla s promises are even less credible after the autopilot program director left the company cj moore was the man that told the california dmv that elon s tweet does not match engineering reality when the tesla ceo promised full autonomy soon it did not take long for moore to leave the company since that episode we only discovered that because a lawsuit against tesla and autopilot wants moore as a witness and the company said he is no longer an employee when anyone says that a vehicle that does not drive on its own is a self driving car they are autonowashing as liza dixon defined that behavior in other words they are making something seem more autonomous than it actually is this is not the only mistake contained in that short sentence in the petition against cummings lidars are becoming cheaper and being incorporated in a series of production vehicles automotive journalist lei xing made a list of chinese vehicles that will have lidars soon xpeng p5 nio et7 r auto es33 arcfox alpha s hi wm motor m7 im l7 and gac aion lx volvo s successor to the xc90 will use lidars as well as the lucid air bmw i4 bmw ix and multiple other products none of them claims to be autonomous the goal of lidar is to create redundancy or else to have a backup if any of the detection systems in an autonomous driving system fails if cameras were dirty a radar could help detect objects if radars had any issues lidar might keep the car going apart from refusing to use lidar tesla gave up on radars a while ago the company claims to be able to solve autonomous driving with cameras only if any of them fails or gets a dirty lens there s no backup a recent study by aaa provedsystems might not work as they should if it rains according to the petition against cummings tesla s system would be safer because it is easier and cheaper to implement lidars would demand expensive retrofitting ironically musk admitted his company would have to replace the cameras in vehicles made before tesla autonomy day on april 22 2019 that s a perfectly fine example of retrofitting and it only costs up to 10 000 that s what tesla charges from anyone willing to buy fsd if the campaign to prevent cummings from joining nhtsa were based just on incorrect or purposefully deceiving assumptions and concepts it would at least have been civilized even if eventually dishonest it was not as cummings closing her twitter account demonstrates in his thread hikmet shared a screenshot of the tweets made about her it is a horror show of misogyny sexism vulgarity and bootlicking toward musk you can check that for yourself inside hikmet s thread embedded below although we do not recommend it it is repulsive and depressing if cummings really had anything against tesla as her detractors claim this sort of behavior certainly did not help not only with what she thinks about tesla s demeanor but also about what other authorities may consider the u s transport secretary recently said musk should call him if he has anything to say about cummings jennifer homendy already saidis misleading and irresponsible the ntsb national transportation safety board chair tweeted in support of cummings and shared i won t back down performed by tom petty and the heartbreakers homendy could have chosen the toasters performing one of their most famous songs but she s probably not that much into ska that shows the kind of support cummings enjoys with critical people in the safety area after what she has gone through that support tends to increase we wonder how many signatures a petition to back her up would get at change org nobody has created any so far the one made by tesla fans and investors seems to have stalled at a bit less than 23 000 signatures from a potentially large group of tesla owners it was not as popular as they probably expected paradoxically that may be good for the company it may mean most customers think cummings can help make tesla safer precisely by challenging its approach to autonomous driving the ones that claim it is safe are only worried about their stocks and what to brag about in youtube videos hopefully she will not back down or let them down despite all the absurdities she had to endure these days not being on twitter will probably make her more productive as an nhtsa safety adviser thank you detractors

a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts unvaccinated fema employees aren t replacing noncompliant health care workers claim workers with the federal emergency management agency are not required to be vaccinated against covid 19 but are being used to replace health care personnel who are refusing to comply with vaccination mandates the facts the claims are spreading across social media platforms gaining thousands of likes and shares but both assertions are false fema workers are considered federal employees and are required to be vaccinated against covid 19 by nov 8 under an executive order issued by president joe biden also the agency is not sending its workers to replace unvaccinated health care personnel fema employees are required to be vaccinated as determined by the president fema s director of public affairs jaclyn rothenberg told the ap adding the social media posts that claim fema workers are replacing unvaccinated health care workers are unequivocally false fema coordinates within the federal government to prepare for and respond to disasters while the agency has supported states and health care systems throughout the pandemic it has mainly done so by providing resources and coordination assistance such as setting up mobile vaccination units and reimbursing states for some inoculation efforts rothenberg said in other cases the agency has coordinated with the u s department of health and human services office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response to distribute supplies such as ventilators and antibody treatments and has worked with other federal agencies that deploy medical staff requested by states according to rothenberg in partnership with health and human services veterans affairs and department of defense we have deployed medical staff at the request of the state to alleviate some of the stress caused by covid on the state s health care system rothenberg wrote in an email these deployed medical staff abide by the vaccination and other preventive measures requirements established by the receiving facility some states have raised the possibility of addressing potential staffing shortages by calling in medically trained national guard members the guard is also mandated to receive the vaccine under a pentagon order associated press writer sophia tulp in atlanta contributed this report no epidemic of vaccine related

spreads a bogus claim that vaccine linked medical ailments in pilots have caused numerous recent plane crashes the nearly 30 minute video uses fake news banners and fear mongering narration to baselessly suggest recent plane accidents including an oct 11 small plane crash in a san diego suburb happened because pilots had strokes caused by covid 19 vaccines there s a silent epidemic of plane crashes happening around the country and nobody s connecting the dots the video s narrator says by listening to the audio from the cockpit of this latest crash it s clear that the pilot was having a stroke the pilot was a doctor from a hospital he was required to get the vaccine it s true the pilot in the oct 11 crash was a cardiologist but the claim that he suffered a medical condition after receiving the covid 19 vaccine is not supported by any evidence to date the national transportation safety board which said it is investigating the crash has not yet stated a cause the idea that there s an epidemic of vaccine related plane crashes is also unsupported faa spokesperson brittany trotter told the associated press in an email that the agency has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with covid 19 vaccines faa data shows that fatality rates from general aviation accidents have decreased in 2021 pilots who want to fly a plane or serve as a required airline crew member after receiving a dose of a covid 19 vaccine must wait 48 hours before doing so according to faa guidelines that s intended to allow pilots to wait out any side effects from the vaccine which the centers for disease control and prevention says are typically mild to moderate and resolve within a few days there is no evidence that covid 19 vaccines increase the risk of stroke but the coronavirus itself is associated with an increased risk of stroke according to dr mitchell s v elkind a professor of neurology and epidemiology at columbia university and the immediate past president of the american heart association about 1 2 of people hospitalized with covid develop strokes elkind told the ap in an email so

in texas without power and water which also devastated the entire transportation infrastructure leading to food supply issues some grocery stores had to close locations entirely the legislation at the center of biden s build back better plan was introduced to the house in september and democrats are still working to rally support for the bill due to the pandemic there have been ongoing supply chain disruptions causing grocery stores to have inconsistent inventory but there are currently no nationwide food shortages or widespread supply chain issues according to the united states department of

fifteen years ago this month my first cookbook was released the well used copy pictured above is named number 1 the first one to arrive at my door i figured that my cookbook writing career would not go beyond into the vietnamese kitchen my journey to getting the book published began in 1992 when i wrote the proposal for a mother and daughter vietnamese cookbook titled pass the fish sauce i didn t sign a contract for the book until 2004 and the retitled publication into the vietnamese kitchen ivk didn t release until october 1 2006 by the time i landed at ten speed press i was ready to write and develop the 175 recipes for what would be the biggest full color english language cookbook on vietnamese cooking published to date indie press for an indie author before being purchased by random house ten speed press was a berkeley based indie known for making quirky books and taking chances it published many asian subjects and had an affinity for cookbooks ten speed s founder and owner phil wood was an eccentric who made books from his gut he loved food and published the moosewood cookbook and white trash cooking for example what color is your parachute is also among his successful titles when the book came out i drove to ten speed press with a bunch of food to do a presentation for the staff about fifty people attended including my editor aaron wehner and his boss lorena jones i got to personally thank everyone including a man named hal who chose the creamy paper stock there was also the book designing team that made sure that all diacritics accent marks were properly placed back then typefaces weren t as developed as they are now for foreign languages it took time to present terms such as phở and đại việt in a publication the book designers selected a handsome typeface not the usual times new roman after the event i drove over to the warehouse and picked up author copies to share with my family and testers completely naive i thought that was the typical author experience i had no idea how legacy new york publishers functioned and frankly i didn t care for all i knew into the vietnamese kitchen would be my only chance to write a cookbook a cookbook proposal that lingered i began writing my cookbook proposal in 1992 after i d returned from a fellowship in hong kong and was under employed i had been an avid cookbook reader since i was young by the time i was in my early twenties i had a growing cookbook collection built from a used bookshop near our apartment in west los angeles looking at the marketplace i realized that there was no cookbook that spoke to the foodways and refugee and immigrant experience of vietnamese americans in the main most asian cookbooks discussed cuisines from distant lands not here in america not so much about people s lived experiences in the united states the proposal for pass the fish sauce didn t get any action from agents who either ignored it or told me that i had to be on television to get a cookbook deal i sent it as an unsolicited proposal to a publisher and it was also rejected people didn t see the marketability of the asian american experience vis a vis food since my potential as a cookbook writer was low i worked in different capacities in higher education as an administrator of asian pacific american student services consultant with a think tank on race relations and strategic communication consultant along the way i earned a master s degree from the university of southern california serendipity connected me to phil wood in 2004 yesterday i pulled out a 2001 version of the proposal it s 60 pages long with an executive summary overview outline and sample chapters library books schooled me in book proposal writing but i also did it like a business proposal i had to convince publishers of the value of investing in my idea and in me looking at the sample banh mi recipe i laugh because i didn t fully know the recipe writing style yet they made me an offer anyway and i signed the book deal after consulting with a lawyer and then negotiating a few fine points cookbook publicity before social media ten speed put their top editor aaron on my book he taught me how to make a cookbook he also hounded me late at night via email he s now one of the top people at penguin random house we worked hard on the book and he pushed me to do my best aaron assembled a topnotch photography team led by photographer leigh beisch and food stylist karen shinto karen scraped together frequent flyer miles and flew to vietnam before the shoot she wanted to do the food justice she explained we became fast friends and she has styled all of my cookbooks since ivk once the book was designed aaron and i sought reviews and endorsements from heavyweights in food media and the cookbook world these were among my heroes in writing so i was naturally nervous about their responses ten speed press lead publicist kristin casemore was in charge of my project after the book was released i was simply thrilled to have it out in the world ditto for my recipe testers and small community at viet world kitchen which i d launched a few years earlier my parents were elated but didn t know what to make of my potentially penniless project to which i d devoted two years of my life without gainful employment elsewhere i was supposed to be in business i studied business and east asian languages and cultures as an undergrad or communication management my graduate degree there was no social media fanfare as there is now because there was no social media yet kristin worked her publicity network and into the vietnamese kitchen was well received the primary way i knew about the book s broader success was via news clippings and emails that kristin sent nowadays there are google alerts for example so things happen much faster today because i didn t think i d get to write another cookbook i kept the clippings in a box a lot of people liked it including the new york times splendid table saveur magazine and newspapers as far as australia nguoi viet the oldest vietnamese newspaper in america did a lovely story too i look like a mannequin but my mom looks beautiful measuring success beyond awards when cookbook awards season came around ivk was named a finalist for three awards from the james beard foundation and international association of culinary professionals jfb and iacp awards are considered like the oscar and emmy equivalent of the cookbook award world the book was up against works written by well known new york food people i was an unknown i attended the awards ceremony and felt disappointed when the book lost but heck it came out of nowhere and was a contender i didn t write the book thinking about award possibilities i just wanted to write a vietnamese cookbook that i thought would resonate with curious cooks ivk remains in print in 2007 the fully framed awards were mailed to recipients even if they were finalists neither is the case now a one book wonder or not many authors have multiple book ideas but i held on to just one for years after ivk i wasn t going to write a quick and easy or healthy diet vietnamese cookbook that wasn t my jam lorena recognized my ability to write recipes well and suggested dumplings in thinking about how to frame the subject i wanted to convey the vastness of asia through the broad range of dumplings asia isn t monolithic and neither are its dumplings assumptions about what is asian can be demystified and better understood by way of making and eating dumplings that was my motivation having something to contribute to the conversation is why i initially conceived ivk and so i traveled to asia visited asian american communities perused lots of cookbooks and worked in my kitchen asian dumplings came out in 2009 and earned another iacp finalist award it seemed like i knew what i was doing next up was asian tofu followed by the banh mi handbook and the pho cookbook for which i earned a beard award in 2018 that year i also earned an iacp award for editing unforgettable a crowd funded biography cookbook on culinary icon paula wolfert who was diagnosed with alzheimer s in 2013 during the past fifteen years i ve been able to make books that i want and for that i m incredibly grateful there are well over 300 000 cookbooks with my name on them circulating around the planet i m lucky that my books are sold in many places including germany where pho is available in german i ve even spotted my cookbooks in vietnam here s banh mi at the saigon airport i m with karen shinto my travel buddy and stylist plus a smart young woman who managed the book concession teaching cooking classes has been utterly fun my research and reporting for magazines and newspapers allowed me to meet all kinds of people and travel near and far i ve consulted with restaurants and corporations and i ve maintained this website and my social media presence to keep the conversation going in essence i developed a career as a cookbook author in 2019 at a vietnamese food any day book signing a chef asked if it would be alright if i signed her copy of an earlier book that i had written of course i said next generation asian cooks and cookbooks many first generation asian refugees and immigrants to america went into food and cooking out of need it was not their vocation that has recently changed with a new generation of vietnamese americans in food and food media they re all over the united states i met a bunch of them in brooklyn in 2019 at three sold out vfad dinners at di an di restaurant the photo below belongs to dan q dao some of the dad team members introduced me to their parents who had flown in to attend i was gobsmacked and to gauge what s going on in the broader cookbook publishing scene this is an incomplete stack that i pulled from my library they represent asian cookbooks that speak to the hyphenated american identities that we all have publishers who doubted interest in asian american titles changed their minds i guess we all can be wrong for the right reasons p s my mom sewed a plastic book cover for number 1

it s very likely that we are all going to be hearing a lot about rfid in the next few years rfid currently has that kind of wired buzz that technologies get when they are about to achieve critical mass rfid or radio frequency identification is a location tracking technology that basically consists of tiny inexpensive short range radio transmitter tags each with a unique id number that are applied to consumer products the transmitters announce their presence to sensitive radio receivers in warehouses shipping depots and retail stores this allows products to be tracked from cradle to grave real time tracking could revolutionize the supply chain by allowing retailers to automate the ordering and restocking of their shelves shippers to automate their shipment handling and manufacturers to know exactly where their inventory is rfid technology has been around since the 1980 s in one form or another2 but in the last few years it has advanced significantly in the areas of reductions in both size and cost of the transmitters modern rfid transmitters are cheap about 05 u s each and small about the size of a grain of sand modern rfid tags are powered inductively by the receiver so they don t need a battery and each one contains its own tiny antenna suitable for short range broadcasting at first glance one might be amused at the thought of a million tiny voices all mindlessly shouting the only word they know at the top of their little electronic lungs day and night consider this however the waste and inefficiency inherent in the manufacturing and distribution process results in hundreds of millions of dollars of lost and waste every year due to products that are lost stolen or out of stock according to the auto id center at mit3 rfid promises to alter that equation completely the gillette company makes razors blades and related leg shaving hair scraping products their chicago illinois chicago distribution center alone occupies 532 000 square feet think of a square building over 730 feet or 220 meters on each side this warehouse is designed to store 50 000 pallets of gillette products with a retail value of over 60 000 000 u s for their initial pilot program in the world of rfid gillette has announced that it will purchase five hundred million rfid tags they will use these to tag every pallet and every case of product they ship alien technology the company supplying gillette is just the first big winner in the rfid lottery rfid will allow gillette to follow each pallet and case as it proceeds from manufacturing to the warehouse from the warehouse to the shipping dock onto the truck and at the receiving dock at its final destination say the local supermarket but wait there s more at the supermercado the gillette products will be stocked on smart shelves for consumer access these shelves will let the store know when they need more razor blades stocked and the shelves in the back room will notify the store when it s time to reorder the cash registers will recognize the products without the clerk having to scan a barcode and don t even think about stuffing that gillette mach 3 down your pants i m going to extrapolate a little here and imagine that we actually have that internet refrigerator touted by billg and the other techno luminaries if you combine rfid internet enabled appliances and an online grocery retailer like peapod the whole story could get really weird consider the rfid house that just orders all the crap you need without bothering to ask my palm pilot 2005 sez aloud when it senses that i ve entered the room via my rfid wristwatch don t worry your pretty little head about it grouch i already ordered a sushi platter and a case of that australian shiraz you liked i m still waiting for you to select some entree s for next week hint hint and by the way don t forget your daughter s orthodontics appointment tomorrow meanwhile a nondescript grey truck prowls the neighborhood slowly and suspiciously there s a small antenna on the top and i wince slightly and say to my tiny electronic audience thanks guys good job 1 2 3 rfid updates sept 2003 privacy advocates raised alarms regarding rfid technology in california state legislative hearings recently beth givins of the privacy rights clearinghouse said rfid is essentially invisible and can result in both profiling and locational tracking of consumers without their knowledge or consent she was seconded by liz mcintyre spokeswoman for the advocacy group against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering who said without some sort of oversight this technology could create a very frightening society rfid industry spokesmen have responded by describing plans for rfid tags that can be disabled on checkout for retail customers nov 2003 mccarran international airport in las vegas nevada has signed a five year contract with matrics inc to purchase one hundred million rfid tags for deployment on passenger luggage according to an airport spokeman the tags will be used to ensure that all baggage has been processed by the airport security systems sam ingalls the airport it manager says rfid is the only technology that allows us to get a 99 5 assurance that bags have been properly screened 19 jan 2004 verisign wins the contract to operate object naming service ons the equivalent of the internet s dns system for rfid ons will store all the electronic product codes epc assigned to products with rfid tags the epc system was created by the non profit corporation epcglobal and the autoid center at mit the ons root directory is already operational according to stratton sclavos who heads verisign jan 2004 in the wake of the recent bovine spongiform encephalopathy scare the american meat industry has lined up behind a proposal for the rfid based national animal identification tag proponents claim that a similar system already in place in michigan would have reduced the time required to track down the infected animal to minutes instead of the two weeks it took fda scientists to wade through the mountain of paper records used to trace the affected herd and recall beef that might have been exposed meat industry experts say the rfid deployment could cost nearly 600 million over the next six years jan 2004 infosys technologies ltd an indian service company is proposing a global delivery model for rfid processing data storage and analysis this service targets the growing concerns among it managers about the logistics involved in managing the flood of data rfid systems are expected to produce it has been estimated that rfid tracking of all the products in all the walmart stores would generate hundreds of terabytes of data per day feb 2004 rsa security inc has unveiled a rfid blocker tag intended to keep other nearby tags from being read this is in response to the privacy concerns being voiced by civil libertarians and consumer advocates the blocker tag would be used to prevent rfid readers from gathering data from merchandise that consumers are carrying with them as they shop the blocker fools rfid readers by responding multiple times to a single query thus preventing the reader from getting valid data feb 2004 california state senator debra bowen says she is planning to introduce legislation that will restrict the use of rfid tags in retail applications while allowing it for pallet and case usage feb 2004 sap recently unveiled new supply chain software that was created from the ground up to accommodate rfid functionality according to infoworld magazine ibm oracle sun and microsoft all have rfid offerings under development feb 2004 international paper corporation reports that it s rfid deployment has been so successful that the company plans to market its rfid expertise to other companies under consulting agreements according to alan clark at ip rfid promises to revolutionize the businesses manage their supply chains april 2004 shorecliff communications presents rfid world a conference and exhibition billed as the most important technology event you will attend in 2004 industry experts anticipate that this will be the single most heavily attended it event of the year the

washington a deal within reach president biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation friday though appearing to let the day s informal deadline slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 percent of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remain on health care provisions biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe advertisement pelosi said she hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set democrats had imposed a friday deadline to at least strike agreement but by early evening no deal was announced much of what we need to do has been written just a few decisions now pelosi said sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago and then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free pre kindergarten for all youngsters advertisement negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said biden said the discussions were down to four or five issues on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal advertisement biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a top line amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision advertisement he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid monthslong family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation advertisement in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 percent corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 percent on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans send questions comments to the editors previous next

statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments form 8 k report containing all these materials have also been submitted to the sec because we published our prepared comments yesterday we ll go ahead and open the line for your questions kevin please go ahead open the line questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session our first question today is coming from vincent andrews from morgan stanley your line is now live vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone just in engineered materials you only had a modest volume hit sequentially despite obviously the auto situation got more challenging in the quarter and you found other high value places to put that volume so i guess as we think about 2022 and 2023 when that auto volume comes back presumably you re not going to i guess my question is is that incremental on top of where you ve already put this other volume or do you anticipate shifting some of that having to shift some of that volume back to your auto customers lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question vincent if we look at q3 auto builds were down pretty significantly globally like 12 down from the prior quarter and certainly that had some impact on us what i would say is though it had less impact on us as just given the nature of where we are i mean if we really look at our q3 volumes they were down into auto only about 1 and there s a couple of reasons for that one is if you look at we have shifted our portfolio more to electric vehicles electric vehicles are actually up about 35 year on year in terms of builds and we expect that to continue into next year and because we have so much more exposure now to electric vehicles so think about lithium ion battery separator film which has grown 40 year on year even though only about 10 to 15 of our portfolio now goes to electric vehicles that still did went a long way in kind of negating the impact we saw from the overall decline in auto builds so what i would say is yes while we did shift some volume out of auto we also have the shift within auto which allowed us to keep really get through the quarter with very little volume loss into end markets and we did see some more shift into other applications like industrial and electrical which were strong during the quarter but i would say actually a more of the shift was probably within auto into the ev which is consistent with the strategy that we laid out at the end of 2019 scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and we wouldn t expect to give that volume up as auto recovers in 22 and 23 so think about the auto recovery kind of being on top of that lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah and then if you think where that volume is going to come from because we did run pretty full in q3 but we did lose about 8 kt of production in q3 due to the unavailability of raw material be that resin or glass fiber or flame retardants so as we as those issues resolve themselves hopefully through the end of the year and into next year that s the additional volume that we ll be able to put into both auto and our other end use applications vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst great and then if i could just ask on the 100 million 50 million in em and 50 million in ac how does that trend in your sort of 22 and 23 assumptions does that are you assuming that sort of normalize when you get it back or you just sort of assuming it stays the same lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah i think just as we assume product prices and ebit margins are going to normalize as we move through q 2022 so probably toward in the second half of 2022 and we re assuming normalized prices in 2023 we also assume that those inflationary pressures in energy and in raw materials will also normalize in that time so think about it as margins normalizing through the second half of 2022 and be normalized for 2023 vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay makes sense thank you very much lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah operator your next question today is coming from john roberts from ubs your line is now live john roberts ubs analyst thank you do you or your syngas supplier in nanjing need to make structural changes to avoid the industry curtailments in the future lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i mean i think it s an interesting question i mean it s hard to know what structural changes you would make simply because the entire economy of china is based on coal gasification so we don t really know what to expect in terms of energy curtailments in the future what i would say is look we have seen this happen in china from time to time as a result of their blue sky initiatives whether it s for the olympics or some other thing and so we re not going to speculate on what s driving this energy curtailment but you know while we expect the curtailments to be moderate in the fourth quarter we don t really know what to expect yet for next year so i think it s a little early to address this what i would say is we are a little different than some of our competition in china just in terms of what else our syngas provider does so they have some choices that they can make about where the syngas go whether it comes to us or whether it goes into olefins and frankly right now economically it makes more sense for it to come to us john roberts ubs analyst and then back on the engineered plastics question it takes a while to get specked into new applications so i assume that rapid pivot to make up the lost auto volume that was existing applications that you ve had that just surged lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look we re seeing strong demand across all sectors of engineered materials so i would say any volume we can make we can sell to an existing customer for an existing application you know that said in the q3 we had 815 project wins we continue to grow quarter on quarter in terms of the number of project wins we have and the value of those project wins in q3 was up 11 versus the prior year so we are getting new projects all the time they tend to be higher margin projects that we re able to close and higher volume project so if you look at that going forward it just says you know our ability to shift between areas as we re essentially in a sold position will continue to be where we can continue to ship volumes into high margin products scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john if you recall a couple of years ago when lori came in one of the first things we did was do a robust strategy refresh and what came out of that was the high growth program focus that tom kelly and engineered materials team talked about at our investor day and so a lot of that effort around 5g electric vehicles medical etc was started two years ago and we re really starting to see the pipeline pay off from that here now a couple of years into that work and so i would say it s there is always some short term stuff but a lot of this is things we ve now been working for a couple of years john roberts ubs analyst thank you operator thank you your next question is coming from jeff zekauskas from jp morgan your line is now live jeffrey j zekauskas jp morgan analyst thanks very much are average acetic acid prices in china and europe and average vam prices in china and europe likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than they were in the third or comparable lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah it s great question jeff we hope we can answer that as we look toward the fourth quarter for pricing i think we did see q3 moderate from q2 i mean down about 15 in china similarly though we saw western hemisphere prices for acetic acid go up 15 so i think right now after the brief surge we had in prices following the energy curtailment acetic acid has settled in now to kind of that 1 000 per ton price so that s a little above q3 but i do expect it s going to continue to moderate over the quarter so i guess on average our best view at this point is probably q4 will look similar to q3 in terms of averages for acetic acid i think vam is a little trickier we have seen a surge in vam pricing following the energy curtailment as not just our vam capacity which was shut down for a few weeks but others vam capacity was shut down because these are more highly energy intensive processes in the acetyl chain so we have seen more loss of vam capacity in china with the higher raw materials we ve seen some of that capacity slow to come back or additional capacity stay down so vam prices remained quite high i mean record levels well over 2 000 this time and i think we re not seeing any fall off in demand for vam and for downstream vam derivatives just because there are such low inventories as you may be hearing from others on their calls in the chain so i would expect vam pricing to it s quite high in q3 but i would expect that to stay at that level or possibly even a little stronger as we go into q4 which would offset any further softening we see in acetic acid jeffrey j zekauskas jp morgan analyst so there have been all kinds of outages in 2021 from weather and then we had outages in china or curtailments in china have all of these different events led you to have a different view of where acetic acid and vam pricing might be at the end of next year that is have they structurally changed the way that you expect the industry to evolve and then secondly with all of the outages that you ve had this year how much more you know acetyl volume can you produce next year than you produced this year at a normal operating rate lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so how the outages affected my view of the industry i think the answer is no what continued to change is the supply demand balance gets tighter and tighter and we ve been calling that out for a few years i mean every year demand goes up 600 600 kt and so that s like one plant every year and nobody has been building plants so we are steadily now in that structural utilization kind of mid 80s to 90s which means instantaneous utilization when you account for turnarounds and unplanned downtimes and everything is in that high 90s mid 90s to a 100 and that s going to continue so it is that structural change in the industry which affects where i think we ll settle i don t think we re going to settle acetic acid prices down in the 300 range where we used to see it settle but i think it is going to be higher than that because structurally it s just a much tighter industry and i think what you see is the outages really reinforce that point because we very rapidly see the run up in pricing anytime there s a slightest wobble so i think it s not the outages that have changed my view it s i think the outages have reinforced our view that structurally this is a tightening market that is going to enjoy good margins for some period of time and we ve talked about it in other quarters that as there is not we had a little bit of capacity come on in china this year with we have our capacity coming on in 2023 which of course we will run to meet the market demand and have a lot of flexibility to take it up and down depending on what s going on with the markets but there is nothing else currently being built and so and yes demand is going to continue to grow so it is going to settle higher but i think it s really the overlying structure versus say the outages so what does that mean in terms of availability i mean yes we were down this year for the freeze event and of course we had some supplier issues for some time following the freeze event other than that actually our units run very reliably this year i do think as we move into future years we will be back at a normal pattern of turnaround so while i think there s some incremental capacity available to us next year i wouldn t say it s probably really significant from a volume standpoint jeffrey j zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much lori operator thank you your next question is coming from duffy fischer from barclays your line is now live duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning maybe a little bit to follow on the last question and also tying into several of your big customers on the quoting side that actually called out emulsions as being problematic from our pricing and sourcing standpoint so when you look at how tight you see things over the next couple of years when you look at the size of those customers should we expect some meaningful sized new announcements over the next year either on vam where you would maybe ship in acetic acid or would there be anybody that would look at doing kind of a integrated acetic acid in the vam project in the us lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer it s an interesting question duffy i mean let me kind of take the last part i really wouldn t expect anybody to do an acetic acid to vam to vae kind of new build i just don t think economically i mean that s probably just the acetic acid part of that is probably at least a 2 billion investment and then we add on the vam and vae it might even double that depending on the size of the facility so i think that s a pretty big lift for just about anybody not to mention the space the infrastructure the permitting and everything this is a 5 to 7 year prospect if someone were to start now so that s a ways out there so i m not i m not worried about that like i said we have 1 3 million tons coming on in 2023 which is basically the equivalent of two world scale plants for acetic acid and you ll recall we ve announced a series of vam and vae expansions globally around the world trying to meet what we do see as continuing strong demand i mean part of the problem right now of course is with the freeze with other outages things have gotten behind at one point as people restock the world will normalize again as we can see acetic acid prices come down that will lead eventually to lower vam prices and lower vae prices energy is a big factor so i mean i think it s going to normalize even short of a lot of new capacity being added but we do see the need for more capacity to come online which is the need we think we re best positioned to meet given our great technology our lower our energy efficient technology and our integration not just within our plants but also our networks globally that allow us to really optimize and provide secure supply to our customers around the globe duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you and then maybe just a second one on the 15 for next year can you walk us through are there any meaningful changes that would be in that number cash flow that would get spent on a buyback maybe a change in the tax rate i m just trying to understand kind of like what s the base assumptions for that 15 for next year other than where spreads go lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah let me just kind of walk through it and comment some of the things we re assuming in that number so what we ve said is next adjusted eps next year of at least 15 that is based on belief our acetyls business will have an ebit between 1 2 billion and 1 4 billion as i said a little earlier in the call that assumes we see relatively strong pricing we re expecting in the fourth quarter continuing into the first half of the year where you are in that range indicates where it might the different places we think it might start to moderate whether it s a little bit before the you know the third quarter whether it s into the third quarter we do though expect to see moderation to normalized pricing sometime midyear and as i said similar volumes to what we did this year because we think with turnaround normalized levels of turnarounds and everything i just assume kind of similar volumes for em we are expecting 700 million to 800 million of ebit that does include santoprene it does include the organic growth both from our project model and our growth model but also the bishop gur expansion but i would say it s also dampened a bit by our expectation that auto builds will not recover next year so we re expecting auto builds at the same level we re seeing auto builds in 2021 and that affects our normal materials into auto and but it also will affect santoprene because it is 65 into auto and then in total we expect it to be pretty consistent with this year because we expect it to continue to be challenged by acetic acid pricing at least in the first half of the year and also by energy pricing i will say if you add all those up you might come up with a number slightly over 15 so what you should be aware of is is we do expect other to go up as we expect less pension income next year with maybe a softening in the market which will then raise our so if you look at that in terms of free cash flow i mean free cash flow we re basically saying even with a lower expectation on ebit earnings driven primarily by moderation in acetyls we do expect about the same level of free cash flow so lower earnings but we do would then get that working capital normalization that shows up as free cash flow on our books if we see the moderation in asset sales and we do expect slightly higher capex we re still pegging capex around 600 million next year but we won t have the eu payment so kind of looking at all that that washes out to basically free cash flow in the same level we expect to see this year duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from hassan ahmed from alembic global your line is now live hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst good morning lori lori as i take a look at your sort of prepared remarks and the guidance you gave for the acetyl chain you know you re looking for sustainably sort of over 1 billion in 22 and 23 ebit you cited rightly saw a bunch of different reasons why you feel that s doable one of them was the sort of uplift in the cost curves so just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around what s going on over there obviously i see what s happening with the raw material side of things and the like and you cited sort of escalation in pricing for catalyst and the like as well so just on a relative basis i m trying to get a better sense of how much how we should think about your cost advantage relative to competitors improving in this sort of new raw material catalyst cost world lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah i think i ll just back up a little bit hassan if you look at like a decade ago our foundational earnings for acetyls were in that 300 million to 400 million and then if you go as recently as even last year we were saying we think our foundational earnings are around 800 million and that was based on continued rationalization of our footprint expansion activities we had done work we had done to improve the productivity of our sites whether it be energy efficiency or catalyst recovery systems and things that lowered our cost of production and now we re saying we think that base level is greater than 1 billion and so it s really the same thing i mean it is productivity it is energy efficiency but it also is this market dynamic that i was talking about i mean if you go back a decade we had really over built in china we but the industry had overbuilt in china and we were at low utilizations i mean mid 60s to growing to mid 70s now we re at much higher level of utilization with no new capacity other than our own on the horizon and maybe a few other little things around the globe and so we are just in a much tighter area of supply demand which we expect will continue for the next five to seven years unless someone else build new capacity but it will take them that long and that s really why we re saying that foundational earnings is really kind of a low as we think we will achieve in any given time is now at about that 1 billion level now obviously that could change if we had a global economic recession or something i mean but i m just saying in normal economic conditions we think that s the floor and i think that s i think it really demonstrates also the power of the model that we ve developed over these last ten years where we are able to as we did in the third quarter we had a 15 decline in the price of acetic acid in china but we were able to recover that with the price in the western hemisphere because we still had tightness in the western hemisphere and we had 8 less earnings from acid globally in the third quarter than we did in second quarter but we were able to recover that in margins for vam and vae and other downstream derivatives because and having that flexibility to shift geographically and having that ability to flex in the chain is what gives us confidence that unlike many of our competitors who don t have that flexibility we will be able to deliver that 1 billion of foundational earnings going forward hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst that s very helpful lori very helpful and as a follow up again reverting back to your prepared remarks your commentary about relatively tepid long term sort of supply growth i found it super interesting particularly as you sort of talked about china would love for you to dig a bit deeper into that i mean you re talking about how the whole sort of capital cost advantage in china has dwindled the whole permitting process is far more complex i mean to me that sounds super bullish not just for the acetyl chain but for commodity chemicals in general lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i think that s right i mean look we re not that many years ago we would have said there was a large advantage to building in china just from a speed of build and a cost of build as china has developed as they ve developed a stronger working class i would say that that advantage doesn t exist anymore not in the same way now look we re still bullish on china we still are bullish about our operations there but you know that advantage of being in china just from just as a place to be because of lower cost materials doesn t really exist anymore now there are other reasons to be in china like we are which is making things in china for the china market which continues to be a great market but making things in china for export not so attractive anymore and i think that s true for other commodities as well and for other regions of the world as well and i think also with the supply chain issues that we ve all experienced this year i think our strategy of making locally for local demand has proven to be a good one and probably one we ll see others start to follow as well hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst very helpful lori thank you so much operator thank you your next question is coming from michael sison from wells fargo your line is now live michael j sison wells fargo analyst hey good morning nice quarter again in terms of your comments here on the cost curve for the acetyl chain where are we now in terms of the advantages is the rest of the world three four times more expensive or higher just curious how that has changed relative to the footprint you have in the states lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look still although we ve seen increases in natural gas in the united states acetyls produced in the united states especially for us at clear lake with our technology with the economy of scale is still very much on the lower end of the cost curve and i would say quite significantly china coal had gotten more expensive even than singapore for a while because singapore was oil based but coal has gone up oil has gone up so i would say what we ve seen is while the entirety of the cost curve has gone up it hasn t really changed the dynamic about the very large advantage that we have in the gulf coast of the us versus the rest of the world michael j sison wells fargo analyst got it and then for your outlook for 2022 in em i think you commented organic growth of mid to high single digits in 22 and maybe in 23 that assumes auto doesn t grow in 22 and then in 23 do you think auto growth in that growth rate is higher lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah i think on a simplistic level yes i mean i think look we have growth in 2022 just not in auto we have growth in medical we have growth in electrical but i mean we also do expect to have some lingering impacts of the shortages of resins glass and flame retardants as we go into 2022 so i would expect a higher level of growth in 2023 based on the regrowth in auto and hopefully the full resolution of all those supply chain issue michael j sison wells fargo analyst great thank you lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you next question today is coming from ghansham panjabi from baird your line is now live ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thank you good morning everybody i guess lori relative to your outlook for the ac segment from three months ago is it purely the curtailments in china and the impact on pricing that is driving the upgraded view on 4q ebit or is there anything else as it relates to demand or mix sort of in higher feedstock costs and then related to that just your thoughts on how you see curtailments playing out for 4q specifically and the risk on the first quarter as well lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look we have baked in already for fourth quarter so let me start there i mean look we re seeing moderate very modest curtailments in 4q i mean the differences in 3q it had it all happened in about 15 days and in the fourth quarter the provinces know the number they ve been able to optimize more and so we re seeing only really modest curtailments in fourth quarter and it s a period typically wary of seasonality and we weren t expecting much this year but i would say that s fully baked into our fourth quarter but clearly those curtailments and the impacts are having on others as well as well as the curtailments we had in third quarter has changed our view of how long this pricing situation is going to last people are not going to be able to rebuild inventories now in the fourth quarter and so i think it just pushes that higher range of pricing further into 2022 as we do fully expect people once prices start to moderate even still fairly high prices they will want to rebuild inventory especially because we re already be going into the next construction season at the end of 1q so i think that really accounts for the change in our outlook for 2022 it s just this continued level of higher pricing higher margins for acetyl extending longer into the year now than what we thought a quarter ago ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst got it and the thesis points you sorry i was going to say that the thesis points you laid out in your prepared comments specific to china and the capacity additions and the unlikely nature of that just based on the world haven t changed over the past decade along with the economics does that also impact on the same basis your own supply chain and your own access to material etc how are you sort of thinking about that risk aspect lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah like i said we ve had i mean we had some issues around materials for additive that applies to powders and things as well things you never even hear about or think about but i would say in a major way we make 35 to 40 of our own co we start very far up in the value chain and we go very far to the end so again i think what we re seeing now in raw material i mean while it certainly has impacted us i think we ve also had more ability to deal with that because we have more choices in the chain where we can make decisions that ultimately help maintain or even in some cases improve our margins relative to others ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thanks so much operator thank you our next question today is coming from p j juvekar from citi your line is now live p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning lori a couple of things on your acetyl chain commentary that sort of peaked my interest first you talked about catalyst cost going up due to precious metals pricing how big is the catalyst cost and is it just the raw material inflation issue with precious metals or is there an availability issue of catalyst and the second question there you talked about the capital advantage to build capacity in china versus us is now negligible which is very interesting because steel cost are the same everywhere and they always had cheap labor and china was exporting deflation all these years do you think that s behind us or is it permanent thank you lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so let me talk about catalyst costs first i mean we haven t really shared the numbers but earlier in the year let s go back to like first quarter second quarter we actually saw costs for some catalysts we use precious metal pink rhodium pink platinum these sorts of things we actually thought increased by ten times versus what we had in previous year now a lot of these materials go into other applications they go into catalytic converters and back when auto was really picking up we really saw a lot of competition for that limited supply of precious metals interestingly enough not surprisingly also with the reduction in auto build so many catalytic converters being built we ve actually seen some moderation back to maybe not only five times what it is so i would say precious metals that s but we have seen some moderation and i think the volatility we re seeing in pricing there is just typical of the volatility we re seeing around the world where a lot of pent up demand people really wanting to produce but a lot of the i would say almost worsening issues around supply chain logistics and other and everything else which is keeping all of these markets quite volatile but i would say volatile at a much higher level than we enjoyed say just even two years ago p j juvekar citi analyst okay and then on the steel side lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah on the steel side you re right steel kind of cost the same around the world i mean it used to be an advantage in china probably due to some government support i think that s a lot of that is gone now so i think cost of materials in china is really not that much less labor not necessarily versus the us but versus maybe other parts of asia the labor has more normalized i mean i think labor is still a bit more expensive in the us but you also get a bit more productivity in the us so i m just saying that the difference in where it used to always be a 2 to 1 advantage to build in china versus the us for any other part of asia and you could do it and you could get through permitting and things more quickly that benefit advantage is there still a 10 advantage maybe but it s not as large as it used to be and that s really what i was referring to in my previous comments but again it still makes sense to build in china if you re building for materials that are going to be consumed in china because you get around any tariff issues or any trade war issues transportation logistics issues so it can still make sense to build in china i m just saying you re not we would not see the advantage of building in china for something we re going to export to some other parts of the region or some other part of the world p j juvekar citi analyst right right with the demographics in china do you expect sort of these labor costs rising that will continue in the future lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer look i think as the war for talent continues in all parts of the world now i expect we are in for a period of inflating labor costs really in every region of the world p j juvekar citi analyst great thank you for that color thank you lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you next question today is coming from bob koort from goldman sachs your line is now live bob koort goldman sachs analyst thanks so much good morning lori you mentioned you thought maybe autos will be flat is that an industry comment or because your ev mix is getting richer you can still grow and what s the latest on the medical stuff i know during the peak of covid you had some diminished demand because of deferral and elective procedures how is that end market trending at the moment lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i would say we expect auto builds to be flat year on year if you look at the industry and globally now i think that changes region to region i think asia is doing a bit better i think europe is doing a bit worse i think the us has been between there i think that s pretty consistent though with an industry view on auto builds i think while we all hope that chip shortage was going to improve i think now every most things you read by knowledgeable people say it s probably the end of next year before that starts to improve so our expectation is auto builds will continue to be flat year on year our own what that means for celanese though maybe i should call that out because i think it s important is actually we expect our auto volumes to be up 15 next year versus where they were this year just really as driven by the mix that we have again the higher exposure that we have in evs than we used to have evs have a higher kilogram per vehicle the presence we have in lithium ion battery separator films enhanced by the expansion in bishop that will finish here at the end of the year so again industrywide we expect flat auto builds we expect though our volume into auto to continue to grow by 15 and i think your last question bob but i had little problem hearing it i think was really around elective procedures and medical for medical and what we re seeing there yeah so what i would say is on medical elective procedures have been flat this year we kept calling out we expected them to increase we also didn t expect the delta variant and so what we re really seeing is they re still flat we re seeing a little bit of pickup in some regions but i would say nothing of significance in terms of our orthopedic side of the medical business what i will say though is we have seen a notable pickup in our business for other medical and pharma and it s really on the back of our focus we put on this and our strategy in 2019 trying to expand our presence in other parts of medical and pharma and we did see an increase in that in third quarter which is really what helped kind of keep our mix pretty steady versus second quarter and just as an example of the kind of projects that we re bringing in now in medical outside of orthopedics we ve actually just closed the deal to provide pom into dry powder inhaler for a company in india so this is for an inhaler uses dry powder uses our pom this is a high value application with pretty good not just good margins but good volume going forward so that s really where we re starting to see more growth higher margin business things like inhalers things like wearable diabetes devices obviously still continuing to grow our vital dose long dose delivery platforms i mean we are seeing really good growth in these segments and expect that to continue into next year and beyond bob koort goldman sachs analyst perfect thanks so much operator thank you next question today is coming from david begleiter from deutsche bank your line is now live david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning lori going back to your cost curve comments in china how much of this change you think is permanent is any of the 20 odd plants there you think are at risk for perhaps permanent shutdown lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i mean this is my personal belief i mean i think the advantage to build in china has disappeared and i think that s probably permanent i think it s like we see generally as you know as developing economies get more developed and get and strive to get a bigger middle class strive to increase wages strive to improve the quality of life for people in that company they do lose their cost advantage over time now they ve gained in productivity so i don t think it s bad it s going to switch i don t think it s going to be cheaper to build in other parts of the world but i don t think china is ever going to go back to being the super low cost producer that it once was and that s not necessarily a bad thing we see china also moving to create more high value materials more things in china to meet the growing demand of the population in china so i just don t think they ll always be the huge low cost exporters that they once were but we seen many economies go through that right and so who knows what the next economy will be but they re still the second largest economy in the world so there s no doubt china will remain a very important part of the world balance and certainly the chemical and polymer world balanced in terms of where things come from scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer you know david and i think if you really looked at technology difference that we ve talked about for a long period of time on just the straight variable costs the advantage that we have is still there and with some of the challenges we see in coal and just fundamental usage of coal and that being more and more restricted over time in china those plants operate at a slightly lower level lori talked about catalyst catalyst usage of the disadvantaged technologies is higher than what ours is so we re seeing the costs increase they re seeing the cost increase at a greater rate and so that should hopefully and that s kind of why we ve signaled strength as we work our way into 2022 is we do think that there is some changes here that we do believe are sustainable when then you layer on the fact that supply demand utilizations are getting into the 90 range david begleiter deutsche bank analyst on the back half of the year due to the cost you mentioned you mentioned there should be similar pressures next year do we return back to maybe in 2023 prior levels of earnings once these costs normalize scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer david we lost about half your question do you mind reasking that for us david begleiter deutsche bank analyst sorry i m actually told you had a step down in earnings here in the back half of the year due to inflation you ve i guess you ve highlighted additional pressures continuing into next year would you expect to return to normalized levels of tow earnings perhaps in 2023 lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i think that s a very reasonable assumption i mean the real issues other than the issue we have with losing belarus volumes this quarter but we ll place those volumes into other applications next quarter the things really driving the lower level of tow margins is acetic acid pricing is natural gas pricing so as we get to 2023 just as we expect normalization for acetic acid we would expect normalization in pricing and we would expect to see margins for tow come up to the level we ve seen as well as of course that will give us two years to pass through pricing actions on multi year contracts david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you operator thank you next question is coming from kevin mccarthy from vertical research partners your line is now live kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning lori i had a few related questions on natural gas i think you made the point in your prepared remarks that due to low levels of inventory the costs are flowing through maybe a little bit faster than would otherwise be the case and so with regard to your 4q earnings guidance do you think that natural gas or energy inflation will be net positive negative or neutral and then the second part would be related to recovery of those costs i think you mentioned that you re implementing surcharges so perhaps you could comment on where you re doing that if it s europe or other places and which products lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so if we look at natural gas i mean obviously natural gas is an issue in the us where we purchase about 55 million btus annually but it s also a real issue in europe where we don t necessarily purchase much natural gas directly but we certainly see it as a factor in many of our raw material costs as well as a factor in our steam and other things that we purchase from others and so it has been a significant factor this year third quarter is a step up from second quarter in fourth quarter we do expect to see another call it 25 increase in the us and a nearly doubling of natural gas prices in the eu so this will be a significant factor for us in the fourth quarter now with the surcharges with other things we do expect we ll be able to recover some of that i think though we will see for example in em another 20 million increase with the surcharge we re recovering some but it means we re probably just going to be flat to third quarter to fourth quarter not every contract can we put a surcharge on not every molecule will have a surcharge some contracts are fixed for a short period of time so we won t be able to recover everything but we do think we ll be able to basically mitigate these impact of the increase from third quarter to fourth quarter if we stay in the winter months next year we d expect first quarter to be kind of the same level of pricing we see in the fourth quarter but again we ll have been able to pass more of those costs on so we should see a bit of help as we move into next year as it comes to the impact of natural gas pricing on our overall margins kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst i see that s helpful and then secondly if i may wanted to ask about the 8 kilotons of production lost in the em segment you commented on availability issues around glass fiber flame retardants resins so wondering if you could kind of talk through those and are they getting any better or worse as far as you can tell in the fourth quarter and beyond what s your outlook there in terms of ability to produce lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look unfortunately i think it s going to be similar in the fourth quarter we don t really see an improvement i mean glass fiber demand has surged and the ability of the providers to respond to that especially post freeze it is just hard to get them back on and get the production up so i don t really see probably an improvement in glass fiber in the fourth quarter we do expect to start seeing some improvement next year similarly flame retardants i mean that one is a little even more complicated because pretty much all of the yellow phosphorus that s used to make flame retardants comes out of yunnan province in china which was curtailed as part of the energy curtailments in q3 and will probably be impacted in fourth quarter so that situation is not going to get better probably again this year hopefully we ll get better next year but there right now it s just a single source of this raw material and it happens to be in china so we need to we need a bit more time to understand what the energy curtailments are going to mean going forward to really know when that issue is going to resolve itself and resins i would say are mostly resolved at this point in time i don t expect resin availability to be as much of an issue in the fourth quarter and certainly not as we move into next year kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst perfect thanks so much operator thank you our next question is coming from matthew deyoe from boa your line is now live matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks i don t expect you to comment on market rumors but there was one earlier this summer about more or less ceramics for medical and industrial products companies and without talking about that one more specifically i guess can you help us frame out the scope at which you re looking through valuation m a and kind of what would fit into the model and what wouldn t fit because it seems like the search is fairly wide i guess lets start there lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i think as it comes to m a whatever you re hearing i would assume we re looking at everything anything that is related to end markets that we currently serve anything that s related to resins that we currently produce or might want to or polymers that we might want to produce i would just assume if there s a rumor if something s if you see something we re probably looking at it now that said we look at everything with a lot of discipline and we look at it through the lens that we laid out at investor day so we look at we really focus on can we achieve synergies with it what do we think is our unique ability to get value creation from it so is it something that we can provide our business models our project pipelines our growth models to all of those criteria where do we think it is on the value chain we look at but we look at everything we choose very few things to pursue and so maybe i would just stop at that what i will say though is we think we have a lot of managerial and financial bandwidth in order to complete transactions of any size or multiple transactions of a smaller size so at the time of the investor day we said we outlined about a 6 billion having 6 billion available on our balance sheet in order to do m a i will tell you even with the expected close of santoprene here in december we still think we have about 6 billion available to us on our balance sheet because of our higher earnings that we ve had this year and what that s meant in terms of cash generation and where our balance sheet is at so i mean assume we look at everything assume we continue to look at it through the criteria we laid out at investor day and know that we have a very large pot of money ready to go when we find the right opportunity and we have a management team that s ready to both negotiate and integrate matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful thanks just wanted to talk about a little bit on the em side with the nat gas costs i guess i was a little surprised that downstream ops would have that much exposure directly to nat gas is that just a reflection of like european energy costs moving up or is there some is nat gas more directly a feedstock to or is it just the acetic pass through i guess just wondering lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i mean if you think about it in the us just about everything is a derivative of natural gas so even in the us we ve seen almost a doubling of natural gas costs from say last year to this year to the current price this year but if you think about co if you think about methanol i mean in the us these are all natural gas derivatives so there is a kind of direct correlation to raw material feedstock having natural gas though for acetyl from an energy standpoint like this is very small because actually acetic acid is exothermic it is heat integrated with others downstream so not kind of the inverse of what you think it is a big deal for raw materials we tend to be able to pass that through not such a big deal in terms of direct cost of energy in our us operations in europe again more em exposure most em tends to be lower energy intensity so then compounding really doesn t require much energy but something like pom requires a lot of energy so you think about pom right you have to heat it you have to crystallize it you have to dry it that takes a lot of energy so there we really do see the direct impact of natural gas which is almost doubled from third quarter to what we expect in the fourth quarter and its kind of four times what it was in the third quarter or in the second quarter there you see a very direct relationship and one that s a little harder to pass through because it really has to do with steam steam costs and electricity costs and all those sorts of things matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you operator thank you your next question today is coming from frank mitsch from fermium research your line is now live frank mitsch fermium research analyst hey good morning and congrats on the nice results just curious with the step down that we re seeing in the acetate tow market can you comment on where you feel that fits within the celanese portfolio lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah frank i mean as you know we constantly look at everything in our portfolio and look at where we think the long term trends are and what does that mean for long term margin results and the fit in our portfolio what i would say on tow and similar to my previous comments is the step down we re seeing right now is we think uniquely tied to the price of acetic acid and energy prices around the globe and clearly the biggest piece of that being energy prices in europe and for our plant so we do believe that we ll see a normalization of pricing both raw materials and energy and with that we expect to continue to enjoy high margins in tow but like all of our portfolio we will continue to watch that and make strategic decisions accordingly as we move through the next few years scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and frank i mean i think it s important to remember i mean this is still between both the base business and the dividends that come out of the jv this generates a lot of cash for us and that cash can then be deployed for higher growth application so we saw last year the importance of having this business when we saw the downturn very solid results very solid cash flow generation and yeah we re seeing some near term compression but as lori said we do expect some level of normalization frank mitsch fermium research analyst that s very helpful and just a clarification in terms of your energy costs year over year just reading through the prepared remarks so it s 20 million negative impact in q3 an additional 20 million negative in q4 so we should assume like year over year higher energy is going to cost you 40 million is that correct lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look those that s for em i would say we ve also seen the impact of those higher energy impacts on raw material and that s probably closer to 250 million year on year but we ve been able to offset all of that except anticipate offsetting all of that except about 20 million in em through pricing initiative and other initiatives matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you very helpful thank you scott a richardson executive vice president and chief financial officer kevin let s make the next question our last one please operator certainly our final question today is coming from laurence alexander from jefferies your line is now live laurence alexander jefferies analyst good morning two quick ones then can you touch on given the improved structural outlook for acetyls why not pull forward capex to sort of fill in the pipeline the industry pipeline in 2026 to 2028 and on the carbon pricing to the extent that carbon prices move higher are your em customers giving you any sense of how that factors into pricing for your products are you seeing any kind of favorable mix shifts or negative from that and similarly within acetyls is there a certain level of carbon prices where some of the acetyl chain becomes disadvantaged relative to substitutes lori j ryerkerk chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah look i think in response to your first question not just for acetyls but for em we continue to look at our ability to pull forward all of our products because my margins are high and we believe that that structural demand is there similarly in em we can sell everything we can make right now and we expect that to continue as the desire for high quality unique products like we make continues to grow so we actually look at we constantly have been looking at how do we pull all of these up the limitations are really the actual time it just takes to do a project between permitting which unfortunately has been slowed down in most parts of the world because of covid all the while it s just the ability to get raw materials and we talked a little bit about steel but concrete everything there s so much demand right now for construction projects that we re finding it difficult to pull our projects up in a meaningful way but we ll continue to look at that and we ll continue to update you as we move through the year and then on your second question what i would say is for most of the high value products that we produce in em customers just want the product i mean we ve had three consecutive quarters of price increases in em kind of the first time in our history and what we find is that is not impacting the desire by customers to take products so i think in the inflationary environment we re all experiencing on everything people understand they may not like it but they understand why we re having to push through these price increases to cover raw materials and energy and again have not seen any loss of volume due to pricing i would say the same thing really in acid and downstream acetyl chain derivatives the demand for construction products and packaging and all these things that acetyls go into is only increasing and even at the higher prices i mean people maybe have been a bit slower to refill inventory at these prices but there s no material anyway available to refill inventory so again we ve not our customers would take more at these prices if we could produce more we ll just leave it at that laurence alexander jefferies analyst thank you operator thank you we reached the end of our question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments brandon ayache vice president

president joe biden joined anderson cooper on cnn for another one of those gimmicky town halls on thursday night and it turns out only a few people watched the biden town hall reportedly drew only 1 2 million viewers with a meager 271 000 in the key 25 to 54 year old advertisement demographic so i guess it was more than a few but not many more for comparison an average 2 83 million people watched tucker carlson and sean hannity on fox news during the same time slot more than double the president s audience msnbc s 8 p m and 9 p m shows drew an average of 1 39 million and it was a huge drop from his first presidential town hall on cnn in february when he drew 3 4 million viewers in march 2016 before donald trump was even the republican presidential nominee 3 26 million people watched trump s cnn town hall when you subtract all the journalists and pr folks who were required to watch for work on thursday night plus all the airport and restaurant tvs playing cnn nonstop and indiscriminately on mute in the background that leaves only a few people watching perhaps that s because americans don t want to watch biden on cable tv they want to watch him undo the catastrophic policies that upended their lives after all these would be viewers are the people whose kids are still suffering under covid theater at school who have lost their jobs due to private medical decisions who can t get packages shipped in time for christmas and who might be investigated for domestic terrorism if they show up to a school board meeting more than anything these would be viewers are suffering in biden s economy paying through the nose at the gas pump and grocery store if the items they need are still in stock for months americans have experienced a record high producer price index and inflation meanwhile a labor shortage worsened by fat government handouts under the guise of covid has resulted in desperate employers jacking up wages and passing that cost off to consumers in the form of higher prices this is all occurring as shelves go bare amid a supply chain crisis which biden s chief of staff thinks is a high class problem many americans are sick of it don t take my word for it look at the polls while biden gets up on the cnn platform and bloviates about how people are still terrified to go back to work because covid americans are shouting out that the economy is their no 1 concern a new quinnipiac poll the same one that revealed biden s approval rating is at an abysmal 37 percent asked respondents what is the most urgent issue facing the country today and the plurality responded that it s the economy 19 percent not covid 19 16 percent close behind is immigration at 14 percent and did you hear biden s town hall response to that when cooper asked him whether he has plans to visit the southern border biden said i ve been there before which evidence suggests is actually a lie unless he s talking about once when he drove through el paso then he said this and i haven t i mean i know it well i guess i should go down but the but the whole point of it is i haven t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down i ve been spending time going around looking at the 900 billion worth of damage done by by hurricanes and floods and and weather and traveling around the world this is a lie too of course from the man who flies home to delaware almost every weekend dodging visitor logs and other presidential responsibilities and who has called lids many a time throughout his short tenure americans would love to see this administration take steps to contain the border crisis where the 2021 fiscal year just ended with the number of customs and border protection arrests reaching 1 73 million the most on record ever there are a lot of other things americans would like to see right now too but biden on cnn isn t one of them

washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that the tangled supply chains and shortages that have bedeviled the u s economy since this summer have gotten worse and will likely keep inflation elevated well into next year the fed is not yet prepared to lift its benchmark interest rate he said though he suggested that the economy may be ready for a rate hike next year there is now greater risk of longer and more persistent bottlenecks and thus to higher inflation powell said at a virtual conference hosted by the south african reserve bank powell echoing many economists has previously said that shortages and higher prices are mostly a result of the pandemic s impact on supply lines with factories in asia temporarily closing amid covid infections and dozens of cargo ships anchored offshore he said friday that he still thinks those supply problems will be resolved over time but the fed will be vigilant and take steps to push inflation back down to its 2 percent goal if necessary no one should doubt that we will use our tools to guide inflation back to 2 percent he said advertisement consumer prices according to the fed s preferred gauge jumped 4 3 percent in august from a year earlier the fastest such increase in three decades the fed chairman said he is ready to taper or reduce the central bank s 120 billion in monthly bond purchases which are intended to lower longer term interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending powell is widely expected to announce the tapering after the fed s next meeting nov 2 3 but he added that it would be premature to raise the fed s short term interest rate because the job market needs more time to recover powell noted that there are still 5 million fewer jobs in the u s than before the pandemic we think we can be patient and allow the recovery to take place and allow the labor market to heal he said that healing could pick up in the coming months powell said as covid s delta variant fades hiring could then accelerate potentially back to the levels of this summer when roughly 1 million jobs were added in june and july he said it s very possible we will be at or near our full employment goal next year he said fed officials estimate that maximum employment is roughly when the unemployment rate reaches 3 8 percent though most central bank policymakers say they look at many other measures in making that determination some officials have also said that the fed s other goal stable prices rising at an average of 2 percent over time will also be met by next year those are the conditions that under the fed s policy framework would support a rate hike in september half the fed s policymakers supported a rate hike late next year while half preferred to wait until 2023 or later but financial markets expect at least two rate hikes by the end of 2022 according to futures prices tracked by the cme group send questions comments to the editors previous next

vecchione president and chief executive officer good morning and good afternoon to everyone also joining us here today is tim bruckner our chief credit officer this quarter s results continue to demonstrate the unique benefits of western alliance s national commercial business strategy to position wal as one of the country s premier growth commercial banks that consistently generates leading balance sheet and earnings growth with superior asset quality across economic cycles as a company we are proud of our thoughtful safe sustainable growth and are excited to have passed the 50 billion asset milestone validating our strategy during the quarter we raised 300 million in inaugural preferred offering achieving the lowest ever preferred dividend rate for a us bank under 100 billion in assets at 4 25 in the third quarter exceptional balance sheet expansion continued with our highest ever quarterly loan growth of 4 8 billion or 63 on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits rose by 3 4 billion or 32 annualized as we continue to effectively deploy liquidity loan demand continued to broaden across our business lines with c i loans increasing by 2 2 billion inclusive of 240 million of ppp runoff along with 2 3 billion of growth in our residential portfolio notably capital call lines drove 1 9 billion of growth within c i as deal activity continues to be strong and utilization rates rose additionally resort lending and hotel franchise finance contributed approximately 114 million to loan growth as well as 148 million increase in cre investors for the third quarter wal generated record total net revenues of 548 5 million a 57 annualized rise in ppnr to 317 1 million and adjusted eps of 2 30 adjusted eps quarter to quarter rose by 0 01 as the company recorded a provision for credit losses totaling 12 3 million an increase of 26 8 million from the 14 5 million provision release in the second quarter we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1 83 and 26 6 respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels in the quarters to come i would like to reiterate that amerihome is now integrated into the strategic fabric of western alliance and is thoughtfully managed to maximize value for the entire bank through loan deposit and net interest income growth a 5 2 billion increase in average earning assets drove net interest income growth of 39 9 million or 10 8 for the quarter or 43 annualized to 410 4 million of excess liquidity deployment into loans and loans held for sale contributed significantly to earnings fee income increased 2 1 million to 138 1 million and now represents over 25 of total net revenue asset quality continues to remain stable as total nonperforming assets declined to 10 million to 17 basis points of total assets and net charge offs were 3 million or 4 basis points finally what excites me most is the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us we will continue to do what we do best and support our clients in attractive markets nationally where they do business i believe we have exited the pandemic as an employer of choice for leading specialized commercial lenders which positions us well or extremely well to attract and retain uniquely qualified talent to thoughtfully sustain growth with superior risk adjusted returns for example during the quarter we hired two seasoned teams we added 11 people based in texas to our single family home construction cre national business line and brought on the leading national restaurant franchise finance team with the hire of six loan and credit professionals both teams join us from larger commercial banks where they improved their business plans and built robust multibillion dollar books of business the texas cre team has 10 million in outstandings and an additional 110 million approved to be funded and a 400 million pipeline likewise the restaurant franchise finance team has 90 million in outstandings and 54 million approved to be funded and a pipeline of 300 million dale will now take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer thank you ken for the quarter western alliance generated record net revenue of 548 5 million up 8 3 quarter over quarter or 33 annualized net interest income grew 39 9 million during the quarter to 410 4 million an increase of 44 year over year primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets ppnr rose 57 on an annualized linked quarter basis to 317 1 million excluding acquisition and restructuring expenses noninterest income increased 2 1 million to 138 million from the prior quarter as mortgage banking related income rose 12 million for the quarter and totaled 123 2 million servicing revenue increased 23 million in the quarter as refinance activity slowed despite a smaller servicing portfolio of 47 2 billion in unpaid principal balance gain on sale margin was 51 basis points for the quarter as we extended the time from funding to sale which positively impacted net interest income with these evolving mortgage sector fundamentals amerihome continues to meet our pro forma acquisition expectations contributing 0 58 during the quarter which is inclusive of 0 20 in net interest income from amerihome using our balance sheet an opportunity most stand alone correspondent lenders don t have finally adjusted net income for the quarter was 238 8 million or 2 30 in adjusted eps which is inclusive of a credit loss provision of 12 3 million but excludes pre tax merger and restructuring charges of 2 4 million turning to net interest drivers during the quarter deployment of our excess liquidity into higher yielding assets drove both loan growth and net interest income growth loans held for sale increased 2 1 billion and are yielding 3 35 on a linked quarter basis yields on loans held for investment declined 20 basis points to 4 28 which is fully explained by the continued strong growth of low to no loss asset categories namely residential loans and capital call lines interest bearing deposits remained relatively stable from the prior quarter at 21 basis points as were total cost of funds at 28 basis points consistent with our previous comments we believe that in the current rate environment funding costs have stabilized net interest income grew 39 9 million during the quarter to 410 million or 44 year over year as balance sheet growth and optimization of earning asset mix generated robust spread income average earning assets increased 5 2 billion or 12 during the quarter to 48 4 billion additionally we successfully deployed liquidity into loans and have held the investment portfolio relatively flat in favor of loans held for sale which we view as a higher yielding cash like alternative despite our successful liquidity deployment in q3 we still have meaningful dry powder of 1 billion in cash and the opportunity to further fund loans through continued deposit growth as a result of loan growth in lower yielding categories nim declined 8 basis points to 3 43 we expect continued strong net interest income growth as we re well positioned to take advantage of a rising rate environment as 71 of our commercial loan portfolio is variable rate and we have 47 noninterest bearing deposit funding our efficiency ratio improved to 41 5 from 44 5 during the quarter while we continue to make investments to support risk management and sustained growth the inherent operating efficiency of deploying excess liquidity has helped push our efficiency ratio to the lower 40s pre provision net revenue increased 39 7 million or 14 from the prior quarter and 75 from the same period last year this resulted in a ppnr roa of 2 45 for the quarter an increase of 14 basis points compared to 2 31 from the last quarter this continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides us significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth support infrastructure and capital other capital management actions as well as meet credit demand balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased 4 8 billion or 15 9 to 34 8 billion strong deposit growth of 3 4 billion brought balances to 45 3 billion at quarter end and all total assets have grown 58 year over year to 52 8 billion total deposits increased 313 million over the prior quarter to 2 1 billion primarily due to overnight borrowings of 400 million partially offset by redemption of 75 million in subordinated debt as ken described we experienced record quarterly loan growth this quarter with growth evenly split between residential and c i loans in all loans grew 4 8 billion during the quarter and were up 5 billion ex ppp runoff and 34 year over year residential real estate and c i loans grew 2 3 billion and 2 2 billion respectively turning to deposits we continue to see broad based core deposit growth across our business channels deposits grew 3 4 billion or 8 in the third quarter with the strongest growth in savings and money market accounts of 1 6 billion noninterest bearing dda accounts contributed 950 million and represents 47 of total deposits strong performance from commercial clients robust fundraising activity and tech and innovation and seasonal inflows in hoa banking relationships were all significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter we are confident in the stickiness of deposits that we ve generated in recent quarters particularly as our newer initiatives are finally taking root our asset quality remains strong and stable special mention loans continue to decline to 364 million or 105 basis points of funded loans total classified assets rose 26 million in the third quarter to 265 million or 50 basis points in total assets but are down more than 40 from a year ago on a ratio basis total nonperforming assets declined 10 million to 17 basis points in total assets quarterly credit losses continue to be nominal in the third quarter net charge offs were 3 million or 4 basis points of average loans annualized compared to 100 000 in the second quarter our loan allowance for credit losses increased 15 million from the prior quarter to 275 million due to robust loan growth in all total loan acl to funded loans is 80 basis points or 82 basis points when excluding ppp loans as mentioned in prior quarters the strategic focus of the bank is to source a significant portion of loan growth from low to mid last segments to achieve a diversified risk risk diversified portfolio with the third quarter loan growth our low to no loss segments now comprise over half of total loans given our industry leading return on equity and assets we generate sufficient capital to fund about 25 to 35 annual loan growth depending on the mix and this is after dividend service our tangible common equity to total asset ratio of 6 9 and common equity tier 1 of 8 7 were weighed down this quarter by robust asset growth in excess of these levels as you have seen throughout the year we took several capital actions to enhance our capital staff and support ongoing growth during q3 we issued 300 million of preferred equity which was slightly offset in total capital as we redeemed 75 million of subordinated debt we are also redeeming 175 million of 6 25 subordinated debt this quarter which we anticipate to be completed in november we will recognize a 6 million pre tax nonrecurring charge associated with this redemption as we accelerate amortization of origination costs on net debt inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment which we increased to 0 35 our tangible book value per share rose 1 81 in the quarter to 34 67 or 19 growth from the past year our tangible book value per share growth is industry leading and has grown 2 5 times that of the peers over the past five years or at a compound annual rate of over 19 i ll now hand the call back to ken to conclude kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer thanks dale the third quarter really was an exceptional quarter from an earnings and loan growth perspective as our distinctive national business strategy model continues to hit on all cylinders impressively end of period loan balances were 3 3 billion greater than the average balance which provides a strong jump off point for the fourth quarter net interest income in addition to the 1 billion in excess liquidity that we are gradually deploying in the coming quarters we re very excited about the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us as we enter the fourth quarter looking forward for full year 2022 you can expect loan held for investments to continue robust growth with a quarterly minimum of 1 5 billion to 2 billion an increase from the prior guidance of 1 billion to 1 5 billion or a low to mid 20s percent growth rate for the year with flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest income today approximately half of our growth was generated from low to no loss residential mortgages deposits are expected to grow in line with loans as we work to deploy excess liquidity and normalize the loan to deposit ratio which today stands at 77 we expect to maintain our efficiency ratio in the lower 40s as we continue to invest in risk management and technology and work to bring new business lines products and services to market total revenue and ppnr growth will track balance sheet growth as we benefit from operational leverage regarding capital we are targeting a cet1 ratio of 9 which our robust quarter end loan growth impacted we have several mechanisms to address our capital levels most importantly we generate significant capital through earnings growth and have historically demonstrated our success in accessing the capital markets in conclusion we continue to see strong pipelines and have the operating flexibility to both execute on near term opportunities while investing for the long term growth at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst very good morning kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer good morning ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst i guess just first ken you talked about next year and the low 40s efficiency ratio i think the one thing that investors wrestle with is just the sustainability of your roa roe give us a sense of like one is this efficiency ratio sustainable especially given your asset size going over 50 billion today and is there anything on the mortgage side that we should worry about that could impact the profitability of the bank over the next year or two kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer okay thanks ebrahim first we think the efficiency ratio in the lower 40s is sustainable for the next couple of years we think our strong net interest income will overpower any expense growth that we have what we re doing as a company i think it may be a little bit unique rather compared to our industry peers it s not only are we working on 2022 s growth but right now we re working on 2023 s growth and we need to keep the efficiency ratio in the lower 40s so we can bring in new teams as i just discussed launch new products and services to propel us going forward regarding amh and if there s anything that worries us or can impact the growth amh has a number of levers combined being inside of a commercial bank as you heard dale talk about with net interest income growth and so we are still confident about the 2022 s eps guidance that we had given when we did the acquisition which is now folded into our overall guidance as we talk about the company dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer ebrahim i appreciate your comment on alluding to the 50 billion as being a hurdle that sometimes is accompanied with higher levels of risk management expenses but as ken indicated we ve been leading this ahead for years now and so we have already put in place much of that infrastructure that we need and expect basically on risk management you probably get diseconomies of scale as you grow but we re prepared for that and that s embedded in our guidance on efficiency ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst that s helpful dale thanks just because i think the other side of low efficiency is concerned around underinvestment so i think that s helpful and then just separately on the loan growth ken i think you mentioned a minimum of 1 5 billion to 2 billion can you give us an upside scenario of what could lead that loan growth to being much stronger obviously you are a much larger bank today i would imagine there are much more many more opportunities than you had even 12 months ago so give us a sense of whether you see more upside or downside risk to that loan growth outlook and what would drive that thank you kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer okay thank you ebrahim let me just add to the last comment the first comment you made that we are very cognizant of underinvesting so we re not looking to drive that efficiency ratio below 40 we could if we wanted to but investing for the long term and having long term growth aspirations as we do it s important that we keep investing which leads us right into your question about my confidence level so i feel very strong about growing between 1 5 billion to 2 billion if you kind of look backwards you can see that our old guidance of 1 billion to 1 5 billion we easily passed that or exceeded that but right now as i look forward we have strong demand for subscription and capital call lines there is demand in lot banking hotel and residential construction we believe there will be some new amerihome products that we will bring online jumbo loans non qm loans that will be able to feed our balance sheet as well we see a great deal of activity in the cre income producing space especially with distribution centers we ve done a few spec centers and before the shell is even lifted those spec centers have been already preleased so we see strong demand there and there are several new businesses that we hope to bring online probably toward the back end of 2022 which will give us confidence as we go through the year in 2022 looking forward to 2023 in terms of our growth momentum so yes i guess the short answer is i m feeling good dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer i would also add like to add that for a couple of quarters now we ve talked about having to rightsize the loan to deposit ratio obviously if we re growing 1 5 billion to 2 billion on each side of the balance sheet at the same time we re not going to move that number we made some progress this last quarter where we took it to the higher 70s from the low 70s but we used to be at 95 so i expect as we go through this period and this may largely happen in the residential space but we would have some outsized quarters where loan growth is going to continue either way at that low loan to deposit deployment rate kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer and i just want to add one comment to my statement which is i want to make sure everyone on the line knows that we re not chasing loan growth right so 51 of our portfolio today is either in low loss or no loss credit segments so we ve been growing and growing in less riskier assets as we ve been posting these numbers ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst got it thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies casey haire jefferies analyst thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer hey casey casey haire jefferies analyst another loan growth question for you so this loan growth guide does feel pretty conservative especially with all the runway you have on the resi mortgage side this time next year you guys i think you guys had talked about getting resi loans to about 30 of the loan book is that still kind of your limit and then once you get there is 1 5 billion to 2 billion a quarter still sustainable and is that especially with all these new businesses that you re looking to add on at the end of 22 kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer thanks casey for your question and thanks for the very eloquent way you called me a sandbagger i appreciate that first if i wasn t clear the 1 5 billion to 2 billion is our minimum loan growth numbers we actually said that we think we re going to post mid 25 growth year over year and that would raise that number a little bit higher it may come in a little uneven but we think we ll get to the mid 25 range and to the 30 number we can get there as quickly as we want we would prefer to see it more coming in on the commercial side but we have a very balanced and restrained viewpoint at this moment on the mortgage side but we can turn that on note that i said that amh is turning on just turned on their non qm and jumbo loan product and that s going to take a little time to ramp up as we get amh s clients comfortable with the program understanding our credit box and our process but that thing should hit full stride somewhere in the middle of next year and that will allow us to step on the accelerator if we want and put on more loan growth really loan growth will be dictated somewhat by deposit growth as dale said we ve got plenty of deposit liquidity sitting on our balance sheet with a 76 loan to deposit ratio and also our guide is that we expect deposits to grow along with loans dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer yes i don t think there s a stop sign at a 31 concentration level of residential i mean i think that s where we would approach the median of the peers and we would probably we reflect always in terms of what our proportion should be but i could see that number being higher as you know there are some other institutions that are higher than that seem to be well regarded by the street and as we get there i think we re going to have kind of other opportunities and as well as to manage our interest rate risk profile where some institutions have maybe gotten into trouble with too high of a residential concentration is they don t have a funding mix that matches that but with nearly half of our funding in dda it gives us more tolerance for an interest rate risk environment to have something with a longer dated longer maturity on the asset side casey haire jefferies analyst okay very good servicing lines within fees and expenses a positive swing to the tune of about 30 million looking forward is there a way that you can kind of give us a better feel for this as we get used to this business because or should we just kind of should expect this volatility to continue dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer well honestly for us we look at it more on a total revenue from amerihome rather than looking at those two lines separately there is a little bit of an interchange between them if you have a more robust view in terms of what valuations of mortgage servicing rights are you re going to have a mortgage servicing right mark that could be maybe potentially higher and that gives you more gain on sale but ultimately and we re regularly selling these down we have a ready price point to confirm the veracity and the accuracy of that number and by singing what the gain is on terms of the disposition so one feeds the other and they run off of each other in a fairly short window on our balance sheet and income statement unlike some others casey haire jefferies analyst okay very good and just lastly on the capital management front ken i am sorry i missed your comments at the end there but you guys are below your kind of 9 level you did not use the atm is the thinking that on a more moderate pace of growth that you and a 25 plus roe that you ll just rebuild organically to get above 9 or are you looking to take actions kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer well there are a couple of things there i think this is a high class problem to have that our growth is coming in so yes we will go to the market for growth capital we could do that either through the atm or we have some other crt trades that we re working on and hopefully we ll line them up before the end of the fourth quarter our goal is to be just above 9 on a cet1 ratio i think once we get there and if our growth is sort of programmed the way we just described it we won t need to go back many more times to hit the market but if it comes in at an accelerated pace as i said high quality problem to have we re happy to issue growth capital to support these earnings casey haire jefferies analyst yeah thanks guys kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer all right you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler brad milsaps piper sandler analyst hey good morning guys kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer hey brad brad milsaps piper sandler analyst dale i was curious if you could comment on just kind of where new loan yields are coming on kind of relative to the book yield i don t think you included spot yields in the slide deck this quarter so i was just kind of curious where kind of where the new loans versus the old were coming on dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer yes new loan yields are pretty much on top of slightly lower than what we re running off the reason why we had a 20 bps decline and i think i alluded to this but i ll give it a little more color is because of the mix change we put on north of 2 billion of residential those yields are about 3 billion we put on just short of 2 billion worth of basically capital call lines those yields are pushing 3 billion 2 5 billion to 3 billion so if you add the both of those in that probably explains the 20 basis point kind of slip there now that said i mean i think residential is going to be a continued part of our growth trajectory and so will we have an additional kind of a slippage in total loan yield in the fourth quarter from the third yes i believe we will but it s not really the spot rates as much as the mix of the loan portfolio that s going to drive that a little bit lower but again we re prepared for that and as we did this quarter as well we expect to just kind of plow through that in terms of net interest income performance brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great that s helpful and as you guys have reshaped the loan portfolio and will continue to reshape with more resi how do i think about sort of asset betas if the fed were to in fact start raising rates at some point in the future i know you have the loan floor number in the q but just kind of curious how you guys are sort of levered to still the short end obviously a lot of dda but just kind of curious the impact this time around versus last time around since you do have more fixed rate product on the books dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer i don t know how many we re going to get but i ll say for the first couple of rate increases you re not going to see much change we do have a number of loans at floors and so those won t change some of them the floor and the variable rate are the same number that s a pretty common situation for recent origination activity so those could see an immediate increase but that s the smaller proportion in terms of the loan book so within a range of two to three kind of rate revisions i don t think we re going to see much on the asset yield improvement nor are we going to see much in terms of funding costs two reasons on the funding cost one is we ve got a very heavy proportion of dda today and two is i just see a lot of liquidity in the system and i see banks kind of struggling to deploy that i don t think you re going to get betas at least out of the gate for the industry as high as they ve been in other rate rising environments because there s just no incentive to increase your funding costs when your opportunities for deployment remain limited brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great and final question for me you mentioned your decision to hold more the mortgage loans on the books this quarter obviously that helps the average held for sale balance is your intent to continue to do that obviously market conditions will drive that but or if you just kind of scratch the surface on kind of where you think that number can go in terms of adding new products at amh etc just wanted to get a sense of that average balance going forward of loans held for sale kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer i think the average balance is going to rise it s going to rise as you see deposit growth continue we had a 7 3 billion average balance for q3 for the held for sale versus an ending loan balance of 6 8 million we see this as an attractive way to generate incremental net interest income these loans earned 3 35 that was up 24 basis points from the prior quarter and think of these mortgages or think of this the held for sale as a big money market account that has a three week turn to it or three week maturity that is government protected so we i mean this is great we love it and this is one of the reasons as we both dale and i alluded to in our comments that these are the benefits that we get with amh that stand alone mortgage providers would not get and that s why we re very excited about doing the acquisition because of all the deposit and loan growth net interest income opportunities that amh offer to us so this is just an example of leveraging amh s loan production on to wal s balance sheet and as i said at the end of the day better than investing in 10 basis points as i said that s what was told to us at ps 169 if there was anyone from new york on the line brad milsaps piper sandler analyst thanks for the color guys great quarter appreciate it kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet ubs analyst hey good morning guys thanks for the question i understand the comments about looking at amerihome in terms of total revenue basis in terms of the contribution but for the mortgage geeks in the room if you can just kind of talk about the math on the gain on sale how that may fluctuate you alluded to holding the loans longer possibly depressing the gain on sale also just talk about general gain on sale pressure or not that you re seeing in the marketplace kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer so there is a gain on sale pressure on the margin if you go back to our comments when we acquired amerihome we always kind of planned for more of a 2018 gain on sale margin scenario we hoped we d be wrong but it s moving toward that direction so what we have in terms of the opportunities in front of us is to increase our win share our win rate which was about 8 9 this quarter so that s one way to maintain the gain on sale dollar amount again the other thing is we re not a slave to the gain on sale income so we can participate or not at our choice somewhat by how much money we re bringing in on these mortgages and other opportunities that amh is generating for us so in our big pro forma when we looked at it we assume that we re going to get income from the new deposit growth income for held for sale income for held for investment mortgages we put on our balance sheet we assume that we were going to lower their cost of funds we assumee that we could go out and cross sell against their 840 client base and sell warehouse lending financing or msr financing so all that was sort of embedded in the big picture in terms of when we did the transaction so we have a number of levers to pull if the margin continues to compress without it jeopardizing our pro formas dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer we ve already started a couple of these and we talked about this i think last time as well so before we acquired amerihome they were just in the government products so gse or direct obligations of the federal government and they have now already rolled out their jumbo product that s a new sandbox for them that is also going to give them some gos revenue as well as nonqualified mortgages as well so we re expanding their playing field of what they re doing we re expanding the penetration that they re getting in this group for a 9 number as ken mentioned to something higher moving up from there and then we have a number of other elements like held for sale loans to again address the performance and to soften any volatility in the mortgage market because they can kind of rely on us for liquidity brock vandervliet ubs analyst and just to clarify that dale if you had sold straight away would that have resulted in a higher gain on sale that by holding you re just choosing to recognize in nii or some other place dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer no i don t think it would result in a higher gos if we had sold immediately what it would have resulted in is less interest income so i mentioned we said they had 0 58 contribution well 0 20 of that is basically them using our balance sheet and liquidity to use this held for sale line and hold if you strip that away and a number of banks that are solely in this space that aren t owned by a banking company don t really have net interest income that s really not a meaningful component of the revenue sources then their eps is 0 38 kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer right which represents about 16 of our overall earnings and just for the mortgage geeks out there as you said i just want to emphasize that while amh is a notable piece of our income stream there are other regional and national business lines that produce equal to or greater on the same number so for tech and innovation tech and innovation produces more than amerihome but we spend time talking about a business that has a six multiple handle to it when i d much rather talk about tech and innovation and the 29 multiple that that they get on tech and innovation income so i m using this as a platform brock to once again tell everyone we are moving away from giving any amh numbers going forward as it relates to eps it s just embedded into our numbers as we move forward and we re just going to talk about the whole company at the top of the house brock vandervliet ubs analyst got it ok appreciate the color thank you kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon king truist securities analyst hey good morning kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer good morning brandon king truist securities analyst i appreciated the details and commentary on the recent hire that you made in the production volume so far but i wanted to know if you could provide any more insight into your hiring strategy and your plans going forward especially in this environment a lot of other banks say that it s tough to find talent these days and competing on compensation or whatnot but just wanted to get more color on that kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer yeah great question and i do think the ability to hire is one of the longest poles in the tent to our strategic plan objectives so we are finding it a little more difficult to hire just yesterday on our town hall i announced a number of changes which we think are very positive relative to both compensation benefits and flex work schedules we think that s going to help us bring in the people that we need we have in certain cases for the administrators loan closures those types of folks offered hiring bonuses that seem to have worked and bring people in so that s good so i think we re feeling a little bit of the pinch as some of the other companies are as it relates to opportunities to bring new teams in though we have more people contacting us about coming over to western alliance i think our size of the bank now helps our profile helps of course the numbers that we posted help and it s also a very good way when we sit down across the table from a team or several people that we like to bring in and we say the stock did double this year and the equity portion of what they get also is very attractive so we re trying to work all the angles here in terms of bringing in people brandon king truist securities analyst okay great and then touching on credit so the reserve on a percentage basis has declined in the quarter but there was a provision obviously because of the higher balance sheet growth and now that you re growing in lower loss loan categories where do you see that loan loss reserve ratio shaking out at dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer it s really hard to say because we re in the cecl environment currently expected credit locks as well gosh i mean one of the things that was powerful in our ratio declining so quickly is the expectations for collateral value reductions particularly in commercial properties abated dramatically and so right out of the gate in the pandemic everyone thought there was going to be kind of a collateral value collapse no one was ever going to go to the office again and so those estimates by the blue chip and moody s and others we re fairly dramatic in terms of a swing that didn t happen and now that has basically been abated and so here we are with low expectations of collateral value decline and so the number looks pretty good could something result in a change in that environment that would kind of reset that view i think it could and that could put us in a higher expectation of potential risk that said in today s current environment where things are going it s a little bit like i don t know an asymptote in terms of kind of coming down we re approaching a limit i don t know exactly where that is but i would expect that over the coming quarters you ll see maybe a bleed off of basis points in terms of coverage but provisioning but at a slowing rate and how much lower it goes i don t know i mean you could come up with a lot lower number i mean if you say that if you look at our most recent performance on charge offs we re at 4 basis points this quarter annualized that s about where we are for the past year as well and we have a duration of our loan book of four years so if i say i need 4 basis points a year and we ve got to cover four years average life well i only need 16 i ll call it 20 basis points and we ve got 80 so in that sense it looks like there s a lot of room to run down further but i certainly wouldn t count on that kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer and we have a little bit of a rate volume thing going on here the volume being dollars we anticipate continuing to add to the provision but the rate side you ll see it decline a little bit so that s what we re balancing here brandon king truist securities analyst okay thanks for all the answers kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo timur braziler wells fargo analyst hi good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered so hust maybe just two more the build out or i guess the hire in the franchise finance business i think that lending category has been relatively flat since it was acquired a couple of years ago i guess what s the outlook for that business going forward is it just a bigger balance sheet that is giving you comfort in growing that and i guess how big would you like to see that business get with the new hire in place kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer well first let me say that the team that we brought over has as its roots ge credit granting experience and they have the same roots that we have in our hotel franchise finance group as well so that s one of the things that attracted us to the team that s one number two the large bank that they came from is stepping away from this sector mostly because we took the team and so the loans sitting on their balance sheet are ripe for the taking and that s why these guys have only been on maybe as i said six weeks eight weeks most they got 90 million outstandings they ve got a very strong pipeline and they ve already been approved for other loans that just need to be taken down by the borrowers so we re off to a good start and it s very encouraging i would say longer term there s no reason why this business will not look like our resort financing business which has 1 billion of loans it s just a question of the timing of how we get there and again everything we do is safe sound and thoughtful credit granting so as long as we see loans that fit our credit box we think the future for this group is very bright timur braziler wells fargo analyst okay and then on another one of your national verticals there s been some shake up in the hoa business with a competitor entering that space i guess in a larger scale what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint there and is there any reason to think that the growth trajectory on deposits and is any different with the shakeout kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer yeah good question there as well well first let me say that our hoa deposit business is killing it so in 2020 they had an all time record in terms of deposit gathering and brought in 683 million year to date they have brought in 1 1 billion so they ve doubled their production of 2020 in only nine months and so we re very optimistic about the continued growth in this area both on the deposit side and it gets dwarfed by our balance sheet but we re happy with the loan growth that we have there we have a couple of hundred million dollars loans are smaller in average size outstanding credit quality and we ll continue to grow that as we grow the deposits but deposits are this hoa business is a technology driven business and many people don t realize that and with the upheaval in the market i could think of two or three banks that are coming together or have purchased an hoa business we welcome competition we re not frightened of it and our performance to date indicates that we ll be able to stand up and continue to grow this segment timur braziler wells fargo analyst thank you for the color nice quarter kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris mcgratty kbw analyst hey good morning the 1 9 billion that you referenced with regard to capital call line can you contextualize that a little bit how big is that outstanding right now and then can you also just review the overall mix of the legacy bridge book kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer so there are about over 3 billion 3 1 billion in both subscription and capital call lines we see that as a very opportunistic area for us to continue to grow private equity venture capital funds that are our clients they re growing their funds and as they grow their funds they need more capital to help enhance their irrs and we re dealing with the brand names that you would know that are publicly traded are very very well known basically silent on this business two years ago and so we ve kind of stepped into it and we like the growth prospects there in terms of i ll say tech and innovation overall year to date tech and innovation overall has seen loan growth stay rather flat and that s because with all the liquidity in the vc ecosystem a lot of our loans are getting paid down but as i said on our town hall meeting yesterday about the tech and innovation group when they get lemons they make lemonade and the lemonade that they re making is really on the tech and innovation side in terms of growing deposits so they re having just an outstanding year in the tech and innovation deposit gathering they re up over 800 million so again that helps us fuel other opportunities we have other places on the balance sheet to grow loans chris mcgratty kbw analyst was there something thanks for that color was there something in this quarter because 1 9 billion and to get to 3 1 billion i mean that s quite remarkable in one quarter is there anything specific to this quarter that i know that the growth has been tremendous for the industry but basically a doubling kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer first let me say it surprised us as well as they grew that quickly we had been doing we had granted or approved a number of subscription lines dating back bigger ones in size q4 of 2020 and also the first quarter and second quarter of this year and they just started to get pulled down utilization runs around 50 or thereabouts and our clients are pulling it down and we re happy that they are chris mcgratty kbw analyst great if i could just sneak one more in the held for sale conversation about that growing kind of over the near term if we took a little bit of a longer view and looked out maybe a couple of years in a higher rate environment how would you see this strategy at all maybe not the balances be affected dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer i think it s going to top out i m not exactly sure at what level or when that is but as we continue to see economic recovery we see broadening of demand across other sectors a number of which have higher yield we think that this is it s an accordion i mean it s really to us it s almost like a parking in the securities book except it s rate sensitive and you can get the money out in three weeks i mean these are very short kind of roles so it s an alternative to that it certainly yields better and so we ve got excess liquidity with the enormous deposit growth we ve had this year we re parking it there as an alternative but we can pull that down quickly i think that over time we will i mean as we move our loan to deposit ratio back up to 90 or wherever it might be i think this some of that give up is going to be from here i might also say that some of that give up is going to come from the securities book we ran up our securities book hard in 2020 and early 2021 because we didn t have this alternative we have i would say underutilized deployment in there where we bought rmbs and we can buy rmbs that yield a lot less or we can buy government guaranteed puts to the gses basically the same kind of credit risk and make another 100 basis points chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay so the securities book is flat to down from here kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer yes chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay thanks dale operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks good morning kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer good morning jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst one question i think a lot of the p l stuff has been beat up pretty well but one question i had is the commercial segment and the consumer segment had roughly equal growth and it looks like your earnings are roughly equal do you think about the business that way do you want a balanced business model or do you expect one segment to outgrow the other over time kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer so we meet on a weekly basis with our senior operating committee and every week we talk about what s happening in every market and what s happening with all the products and it s at that meeting and also at our senior loan committee meetings where we allocate capital and liquidity as appropriate so that s what drives us is where is the best risk adjusted returns and that s what we push on we don t really come out and say capital call consumer versus commercial lines need to be balanced jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay ok good dale there s been a lot of questions on the earning asset mix and you used the term optimizing the earning asset mix of all the things that you ve talked about if you had to point to one or two that we can expect to see in the next quarter or two what would they be dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer well i think you re probably going to see kind of a continuation of what we ve got so far i would hope that we re going to continue to see broadening out of our loan development and production alternatives but at the same time what we d be doing on say loans held for sale as we just discussed or your other factors but if we ve got strong loan growth i think we ve got opportunities to kind of continue to and maybe trade away i mean capital call lines we love them they are just we think they re bullet proof in terms of structure but they re obviously not the highest yielding thing we have and they also consume a little bit more in terms of risk weighted assets at 100 jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst on the noninterest income line just to kind of put that to bed i think the message you re sending is don t expect it to grow at the same pace as net interest income but it will show up somewhere in the p l and it may bounce around a little bit but don t necessarily expect fees to keep pace with nii is that fair kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer yes i think that s fair jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just one question for you ken on eps i actually had to look up asymptote to remind me what that meant and so i m going to ask a simple question on the 2 30 eps that you put up for the quarter anything in there that you think is unsustainable even if i put what s the number 2 billion of loan growth and i think it s too low anything that s unsustainable in the 2 30 kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer well first that was dale showing off but he s studying for the sat exam and we wish him all the best on the 2 30 really there s nothing there that s unusual that i would remove that would lower eps i think that s a fairly good base to use and then i see where you re going take your take the incremental jump off on the ending loan balance to the average loan balance of 3 3 billion make some assumptions on how we deploy cash and take your q3 to q4 earnings or move them in that direction dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer i mean if you look at the third quarter i mean we have a spectacular operating leverage on a linked quarter basis i think the expenses were up 6 to the amount of revenue that trend is not obviously sustainable but consistent with our guide that we could be in the lower 40s so from here i don t think that there s anything that you really have to pull back from jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush david chiaverini wedbush analyst hi thanks i have a follow up on the size of the held for sale portfolio you mentioned about it rising with deposits but when i look at the period end balance versus the average it s lower and i would assume that and i may be stating the obvious here but it would be a function of mortgage origination levels so for instance over the summer months when you re originating say 20 billion if we go into the winter months and you re originating 10 billion and you re holding these loans for three weeks i imagine that those held on the balance sheet would be lower through the winter but can you talk about that a little bit dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer actually it s more kind of liquidity balancing for us i appreciate your comment and it is based on kind of originations but these are sold in short forwards to the gses for delivery and we just extended that a little bit what we do though is we extend those a little bit more so that they come due in the middle of the month rather than at the end if you saw our daily balance sheet and you can kind of infer this from what you ve seen before we tend to run up on loans toward the end of a month and toward the end of a quarter so there s a little bit of a trough in the middle and you see this on our loan book which has for the quarter north of a 3 billion lower average than the ending and so now we re in this period of flat lining where our loan growth so far has gone up a little but not a lot in the fourth quarter that s pretty typical and then kicks in as we go later in the year so what we ve done is we run up the held for sale book early on in the quarter that gets you to a higher average and then when the loan book spikes at quarter end we drive the held for sale balance down david chiaverini wedbush analyst got it very helpful and then you mentioned about the gain on sale margin you re expecting it to approach the 2018 level can you remind us what that margin was in 2018 kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer it was in the high 30s in 2018 david chiaverini wedbush analyst great and then shifting to that new team in texas the single family home construction cre national business line you sized the restaurant franchise finance and that could get to 1 billion can you give us a sense of how big you expect this team and this portfolio to grow kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer i m having a little trouble giving you that number because there are several factors that come into play housing permits the churn and all that but we wouldn t have gone into this area and hire this team unless we thought that over time we could get to about the same level as the food franchise group i just don t know how quickly they re going to get there but they ve got a very strong pipeline we re very active in terms of helping them and flying down there and working with them at their client base so a lot of optimism around it but i would say i think you should use the same 1 billion number for the food franchise david chiaverini wedbush analyst got it thanks very much operator and this concludes the question and answer portion of our call i will now turn the call back over to mr ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president and chief executive officer yes just thank you all for joining us today we think we had a killer quarter and we look forward to talking to you in a couple of months from now about

them out here are the facts unvaccinated fema employees aren t replacing noncompliant health care workers claim workers with the federal emergency management agency are not required to be vaccinated against covid 19 but are being used to replace health care personnel who are refusing to comply with vaccination mandates the facts the claims are spreading across social media platforms gaining

coordination assistance such as setting up mobile vaccination units and reimbursing states for some inoculation efforts rothenberg said in other cases the agency has coordinated with the u s department of health and human services office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response to distribute supplies such as ventilators and antibody treatments and has worked with other federal agencies that deploy medical staff requested by states according to rothenberg in partnership with health and human services veterans affairs and department of defense we have deployed medical staff at the request of the state to alleviate some of the stress caused by covid on the state s health care system rothenberg wrote in an email these deployed medical staff abide by the vaccination

plane crashes reported claim vaccine related strokes in pilots have caused an epidemic of plane crashes the facts a video circulating widely on facebook and various video sharing websites this week

crashes happening around the country and nobody s connecting the dots the video s narrator says by listening to the audio from the cockpit of this latest crash it s clear that the pilot was having a stroke the pilot was a doctor from a hospital he was required to get the vaccine it s true the pilot in the oct 11 crash was a cardiologist but the claim that he suffered a medical condition after receiving the covid 19 vaccine is not supported by any evidence to date the national transportation safety board which said it is investigating the crash has not yet stated a cause the idea that there s an epidemic of vaccine related plane crashes is also unsupported faa spokesperson brittany trotter told the associated press in an email that the agency has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with covid 19 vaccines faa data shows that fatality rates from general aviation accidents have decreased in 2021 pilots who want to fly a plane or serve as a required airline crew member after receiving a dose of a covid 19 vaccine must wait 48 hours before doing so according to faa guidelines that s intended to allow pilots to wait out any side effects from the vaccine which the centers for disease control and prevention says are typically mild to moderate and resolve within a few days there is no evidence that covid 19 vaccines increase the risk of stroke but the coronavirus itself is associated with an increased risk of stroke according to dr mitchell s v elkind a professor of neurology and

this report is being released simultaneously on file770 and genre grapevine and is also available to download as an e book epub file and as a pdf by chris m barkley and jason sanford you acquire information and you convey the information that s the job national public radio news director editor and reporter emeritus linda wertheimer february 7 2024 introduction by chris m barkley the earliest documentation of the phrase news is only the first rough draft of history is attributed to a 1943 new republic book review written by alan barth the phrase quickly caught on with other writers and journalists at the time and for many decades the late washington post president and publisher philip l graham was wrongly given credit for the phrase for journalists such as myself for example the phrase rings true on a very basic and emotional level and while what you are about to read here will be considered shocking and a seismic event in the history of sf fandom and the world science fiction society in particular it is my hope that it is just the beginning of a greater story yet to be told what my colleague and co author jason sanford and i are going to outline in this lengthy report will most certainly not be the final word on the extraordinary events and actions surrounding the 2023 hugo awards that were adjudicated and presented by the 81st world science fiction convention held in the city of chengdu in china in october of 2023 to understand how extraordinary these events were i refer back to the 79th worldcon held in washington d c in december of 2021 a bid from fans based in the people s republic of china won the bid for the 81st worldcon over the bid from winnipeg manitoba canada by a wide margin this in itself was not unusual except that there was a considerable amount of consternation on the method and accounting of the chinese ballots a majority of the ballots from china had email addresses and not the traditional street addresses that fans in other parts of the world usually provide the discon iii committee allowed the contested votes and the chengdu bid was declared the winner almost immediately there were signs that the chengdu convention committee may not have expected to win the one sheet announcement had no guests of honor hotel information or membership rates listed most alarmingly several vital convention committee spots were either vacant or non existent in the intervening twenty one months there were long periods of silence from the concom which caused a great deal of concern among many sf fans and convention organizers as well this period was followed up by a frenzy of activity first came the announcement of the author guests of honor the hugo award winning novelists liu cixin from china and canadian robert j sawyer and russian sf author sergey lukianenko lukianenko who was mostly unknown to readers and fans in the west turned out to be an ardent supporter of russian dictator vladimir putin and subsequently made inflammatory comments about his support for the unprovoked war against ukraine which began in february of 2022 in addition the chengdu worldcon was heavily criticized because it was being held under the auspices of an authoritarian regime which regularly spied on discriminated against or jailed political dissenters religious minorities writers artists booksellers and publishers there were also allegations that the government was colluding with business interests to build the venue the convention would be held in the delays in the construction of the facility moved the date of the start of the worldcon from early august to mid october but against all odds the chengdu worldcon was staged successfully and was widely acclaimed by all those who attended including myself i was invited by the worldcon convention committee and its hosting organization the chengdu science fiction society as a finalist in the best fan writer category full disclosure my airfare lodgings and meals were paid for by the convention i gave no considerations to the worldcon in return for my attendance the science fiction museum turned out to be a fabulous site for the proceedings the panels were well attended presentation areas were spectacular and the hugo awards ceremony came off without a hitch but having attended thirty one previous worldcons there is no such thing as a convention without some problems or complications the main one was that i heard first hand of complaints by attendees that there were a limited number of tickets for the main events the opening ceremonies the hugo awards ceremony and closing ceremonies the only curious thing i noticed was that the long list of nominations and the voting results which are usually out soon after the ceremony were not released in fact that was still the case by the time i left china which was two days later the final voting results were finally published on december 3 2023 forty six days after the end of the chengdu worldcon there was no explanation for the delay and on january 20th ninety one days from the opening of the convention the long list of nominees was published on thehugoawards org there was a firestorm of outrage condemnation speculation and rumors of malfeasance surrounding the absence of the works of novelist r f kuang babel screenwriter and producer neil gaiman the sandman fan writer paul weimer and xiran jay zhao who would have been an astounding award nominee for best new writer despite having enough nominations to make the final ballot at the time of its release no further explanation was given by the chengdu worldcon convention committee or hugo award administrators other than the works in question were ruled not eligible both jason and i have taken care to diligently gather evidence to answer the following questions who was responsible for the not eligible rulings was there evidence to support marking these particular works not eligible why were these particular works chosen to what extent was the chinese communist party and business interests involved what measures should be taken to ensure that the disenfranchisement of future nominees is never repeated this report prepared by myself and jason sanford is not meant to be the final word on what happened at this worldcon we are hoping that others both here and abroad will follow in our journalistic footsteps and come forward with more information and details about these events we hope that this is not the last inquiry into the curious shocking and ultimately devastating story that we hope will bring about changes in how worldcons are run and how the hugo awards are administered we also acknowledge that this report will be quite upsetting to the fannish community but we hope that exposing the truth will also lead to the first steps in healing these social and political wounds ailing us as journalists we are dedicated to be fair accurate and equitable in our pursuit of the truth we are lucky that we live in an open society where inquiries like this are not only legal but possible jason i and other dedicated journalists like the recently retired linda wertheimer whom i quoted above know that we carry a sacred responsibility to get it right and convey it directly to you factually and without bias chris m barkley 14 february 2024 leaked emails and files reveal political concerns resulted in ineligibility issues with 2023 hugo awards by chris m barkley and jason sanford emails and files released by one of the administrators of the 2023 hugo awards indicate that authors and works deemed not eligible for the awards were removed due to political considerations in particular administrators of the awards from the united states and canada researched political concerns related to hugo eligible authors and works and discussed removing certain ones from the ballot for those reasons revealing they were active participants in the censorship that took place when the hugo award voting and nomination statistics were released no detailed explanation was given for why multiple authors and works were deemed not eligible even though they had enough nominations to make the award s final ballot the only official explanation came from overall hugo awards administrator dave mccarty who said after reviewing the constitution and the rules we must follow the administration team determined those works persons were not eligible however emails and files released by another member of that hugo administration team diane lacey shows that the rules we must follow were in relation to chinese laws related to content and censorship lacey previously served as an administrator for the hugo awards in 2009 2011 and 2016 and was the lead hugo administrator for chicon 7 in 2012 the 2023 hugo award administration team for the 81st world science fiction convention in chengdu were comprised of the following people according to the official hugo awards website dave mccarty ben yalow ann marie rudolph diane lacey shi chen joe yao tina wang dongsheng guo and bo pang while the official hugo awards website doesn t list kat jones as an administrator the emails lacey shared show jones was involved in working on the awards lacey also confirmed this in an interview as did jones who said in an email exchange that i did a small amount of work in the margins of the 2023 hugo process but was nowhere near any decisions in an apology letter released to this report s authors diane lacey wrote let me start by saying that i am not making excuses there are no adequate excuses i am thoroughly ashamed of my part in this debacle and i will likely never forgive myself but the fans that have supported the hugos the nominees and those that were unfairly and erroneously deemed ineligible in particular deserve an explanation perhaps the only way i can even begin to ease my conscience is to provide one the emails lacey shared are extremely illuminating about the entire controversy in an email from dave mccarty dated june 5 2023 he announced to the hugo award administration group that this is us the group of folks that are validating the hugo finalists none of the chinese members of the administration team were listed as recipients in any of the emails examined for this report only administrators who were from western countries after discussing technical details of the work in the june 5th email mccarty wrote in addition to the regular technical review as we are happening in china and the laws we operate under are different we need to highlight anything of a sensitive political nature in the work it s not necessary to read everything but if the work focuses on china taiwan tibet or other topics that may be an issue in china that needs to be highlighted so that we can determine if it is safe to put it on the ballot or if the law will require us to make an administrative decision about it on june 5 kat jones asked mccarty for a list or a resource you can point us to that elaborates on other topics that may be an issue in china mccarty responded on june 5 at 7 18 pm saying at the moment the best guidance i have is mentions of hong kong taiwan tibet negatives of china i will try to get better guidance when i have a chance to dig into this deeper with the chinese folks on the committee on june 6 kat jones wrote an email to the administration group titled best novel potential issues in the email jones raised concerns about the novels babel or the necessity of violence by r f kuang and the daughter of doctor moreau by silvia moreno garcia jones wrote that babel has a lot about china i haven t read it and am not up on chinese politics so cannot say whether it would be viewed as negatives of china while adding that the daughter of doctor moreau talked about importing hacienda workers from china i have not read the book and do not know whether this would be considered negative babel which won the nebula award for best novel ended up being deemed not eligible for the hugo awards despite having 810 nominations more than enough to make the final ballot the daughter of doctor moreau was not removed from the ballot when the authors of this report reached out to kuang for comment her publicist said by email that due to her academic schedule and writing deadlines kuang was unavailable for an interview in addition to being involved in work on last year s hugos kat jones is the current overall hugo awards administrator for the 2024 worldcon in glasgow scotland in an emailed statement in response to a request for comment jones said she was concerned that the confidential hugo award eligibility research work product that was leaked may be incomplete or modified and that she was shocked that this extremely extremely confidential material was shared in the first place in relation to my involvement with chengdu she added as the previous hugo administrator from chicon8 there is a necessary handover aspect from administrator to administrator then in addition at the request of the chengdu team i assisted with eligibility research for some of the english language works creators in june 2023 i performed some of the 2023 hugo awards eligibility research on some of the english language potential finalists for chengdu i conducted the eligibility research as instructed by the 2023 hugo award administrator and asked for clarifications where instructions were not clear i did have concerns and i shared them with the administrator those concerns you should have evidence of if you have access to all communications i was not involved in the evaluation of the data we flagged and you ll note in those emails we all expressed confusion over the vague instructions and had no idea whether anything we were mentioning was an actual problem i had serious concerns at this point about this process i then stepped back and did no further work for the chengdu worldcon after the first pass of eligibility research i only had visibility into that first step as a hugo researcher i did not ever and do not have visibility into why the choices that were made were made at the end of her statement jones said i would not be willing to participate in any way in the administration of an award under such circumstances again i don t think we as a community should put our hugo award administration teams in this kind of no win situation the safety wellbeing and freedom of our community members is a whole different kind of consideration the entire statement from jones can be downloaded here the american and canadian hugo award administrators also examined political concerns around the finalists for the astounding award for best new writer in an email dated june 7 2023 lacey raised possible issues with regards to xiran jay zhao naseem jamnia and sue lynn tan xiran jay zhao ended up being deemed not eligible despite being a finalist in that same category the year before naseem jamnia made the final ballot while tan appears to have not had enough nominations to make the final ballot the hugo awards category that received the most concerns in the email chain was best fan writer as kat jones wrote in an email dated june 7 2023 this category has the potential to be problematic under the constraints you ve listed for most non chinese fan writers jones then detailed items of possible concern for numerous fan writers including the two authors of this report along with paul weimer bitter karella and several writers who subsequently did not receive enough nominations to qualify for the 2023 final ballot such as alex brown a 2022 hugo finalist in this category camestros felapton a 2018 hugo finalist and alasdair stuart a three time hugo finalist paul weimer would eventually be deemed not eligible for the award despite meeting eligibility requirements in the constitution of the world science fiction society which lists the rules governing the hugo awards among the concerns jones raised about weimer s writings were him having traveled to tibet him having a twitter discussion with jeannette ng about hong kong along with mentioning hong kong and tiananmen square on that social media platform expressing support for the chengdu worldcon while also sharing negatives about the chinese government in a patreon article and writing a review of s l huang s the water outlaws where jones said weimer praises huang for tak one of the pillars of chinese literature and reinvent it as a queer feminist retelling of an important and nation defining story it should be noted that mr weimer was nominated for the hugo award as fan writer on the 2020 2022 hugo award final ballots and last year for best fanzine as one of the editors of nerds of a feather in an interview on february 11 2024 weimer said he only found out he was declared not eligible for the hugo award for best fan writer when the complete hugo nomination and voting statistics were released he confirmed he was eligible for the best fan writer award by virtue of publishing more than 60 works in various places i had more fan writer somethings than you can shake a stick at by any definition of the word he said weimer also confirmed that despite the research done on him by the hugo administrators he has never visited tibet instead he had previously traveled to nepal and vietnam when told about the political research the hugo administrators did on him weimer s initial response was very pointed well fuck he said noting that he doesn t curse that often but a precision f bomb seemed appropriate here i was afraid that in the end this was going to come down to soft or hard or some kind of censorship once things started leaking out weimer said i mean they came up with a dossier on all of us and went through stuff from 10 years ago i mean i honestly think that the hugo committee are cowards i would like to hope that if i was in the position of dave mccarty and the others i d have simply said we can t hold the awards under these conditions and just cancel the fucking things rather than going through political dossiers this is the worst possible outcome strangely neither the emails nor other supporting files shared with the authors explain why the episode the sound of her wings from neil gaiman s the sandman tv series was ruled ineligible when asked about this diane lacey said she wasn t sure who reviewed finalists for the hugo award for best dramatic presentation but it wasn t her kat jones or any other associate administrators at the time of publication gaiman has not responded to a request for an interview a request for comment with xiran jay zhao is also still pending the emails provided by diane lacey can be downloaded here all emails examined by the authors are included in that document personal email addresses of the people on the hugo award administration team have been redacted in addition the name of one hugo administrator who was cc d on the shared emails but didn t respond to any of the emails was redacted otherwise the emails haven t been altered or edited in any way the authors of this report initially received these emails in a printed format some of the emails in the combined pdf are from a scanned version of the print copies in addition to the emails lacey also shared other supporting documents including a validation spreadsheet where comments were shared by the western hugo administrators about different hugo finalists and potential finalists comments on the finalists ranged from possible issues to minor possible issues to no issues one interesting aspect of the validation spreadsheet is it appears to show a number of chinese works that may have been removed from the final ballot for example in the best novel category four chinese novels are listed including we live in nanjing by tianrui shuofu none of these novels made the final ballot in both diane lacey s apology letter and an interview she said some of these chinese works were removed due to collusion in a chinese publication that had published a nominations list a slate as it were and so those ballots were identified and eliminated however the hugo administrators from the united states and canada appear to have only examined works and authors who were from the western world and who mainly published in english the validation spreadsheet shows that the western administrators did not raise concerns about any of the chinese authors or works on that spreadsheet only about western based authors and works originally published in english because of this it is possible some of these chinese works were removed for other reasons than slating while the emails from the hugo administrators don t reference overall hugo awards committee decisions or any specific orders from the chinese government a post reported to be from a sichuan government website discusses work done to censor works related to last year s worldcon in the post the propaganda department of the sichuan provincial committee of the communist party of china stated that three special groups reviewed the content of 1 512 works in five categories including cultural and creative literary and artistic that were shortlisted in the preliminary examination of the chengdu world science fiction convention conducting strict checks on works suspected of being related to politics and ethnicity and religion and putting forward proposals for the disposal of 12 controversial works related to lgbt issues the post was later deleted because the post was deleted it is difficult to prove its authenticity however the post does tie in with language from the chengdu worldcon s second progress report that was shared by ersatzculture on x twitter on january 20 and by nibedita sen on bluesky on january 23 that language stated eligible members vote according to the one person one vote rule to select hugo award works and individuals that comply with local laws and regulations it s also possible self censorship was undertaken due to fears of what might happen if certain finalists made the final ballot or due to pressure from financial interests and businesses in china not wanting to upset a major investment opportunity as reported by china org cn investment deals valued at approximately 1 09 billion were signed during the 81st world science fiction convention worldcon held in chengdu as lacey said in an interview the things that were marked ineligible was it local pressure from the government or was it business interests i can t answer that from my knowledge i would probably say business interests in an interview conducted on february 4 in chicago dave mccarty said that the chinese government was not indirectly involved in the hugo awards except insofar as the government says what the laws are in the country so the government of china says what s cool in china and the people just operate inside of the bounds of what s cool which is exactly the same way that you and i work here what mccarty appears to be referring to is self censorship as discussed in the academic article the cost of humour political satire on social media and censorship in china there is a red line around certain forbidden topics in the country because people don t know exactly what the red line is and because the punishment for crossing the line can be so severe self censorship is the only way to protect themselves and lower the risk in recent years this practice of self censoring has spread to numerous western organizations and groups that work in or have dealings with china including hollywood studios technology companies and ivy league schools regardless of whether official government censorship took place or if it was self censorship what is certain is that the hugo award administrators from outside of china were actively involved in researching issues that enabled this censorship in an email dated june 7 2023 at 6 18 pm and sent to the western hugo administrators dave mccarty said tomorrow i have a 4 hour meeting with my chinese counterpart to look at ballot detail and determine if any ballots are to be voided which happens with frequency so that it s not really that controversial if we determine we need to do it as well as what things we need to move categories the identity of this chinese counterpart remains unknown at this time mccarty then added the chairs and the administrators will review the items we ve highlighted in research friday evening if we have enough time after the ballot review otherwise we ll be looking at it on saturday china time of course so we re about 13 hours ahead of you this statement along with mccarty s earlier email saying the administrators will determine if it is safe to put finalists on the ballot or if the law will require us to make an administrative decision about it shows that the research the western administrators did on hugo award finalists was used by the chengdu convention chairs and administrators to determine who would be on the final ballot lacey confirmed in an interview that this is what happened we were supposed to identify any issues and pass them on she said the decisions were above our heads as lacey explained in more detail in her apology letter we were told to vet nominees for work focusing on china taiwan tibet or other topics that may be an issue in china and to my shame i did so understand that i signed up fully aware that there were going to be issues i am not that naïve regarding the chinese political system but i wanted the hugos to happen and not have them completely crash and burn since the release of the hugo award nomination statistics on january 20 western fandom has been outraged over what happened while multiple mainstream media outlets including the guardian publishers weekly and esquire have covered the story in addition there have been unverified reports of fans in china who are also angry at having their first worldcon tainted by this affair in the initial week after the release of the statistics multiple posts by chinese fans were translated and shared in the western world such as a thread of comments in a bluesky thread shared by angie wang and zimozi natsuco a genre fan from china published an essay on file770 describing shock and anger at what happened while also giving a glimpse behind the scenes at what might have gone down however in recent weeks posts like these from chinese fans have been harder to find according to a report by ersatz culture on file770 released on january 27 see item 8 at link posts related to the hugo awards controversy in china began disappearing around this time this report s authors attempted to reach out to chinese genre fans for comment but did not receive any responses in time to include in this report an explanation for what might be happening came from pablo vazquez a traveling genre fan and co chair of the 12th north american science fiction convention in san juan puerto rico vazquez is also well known for his connections with genre fans around the world when vazquez was asked if he could help connect the authors with any fans in china who might comment for this report he said i m sorry they do not want to speak to the media even anonymously as vazquez stated in a follow up comment i have a lot of love for chinese fandom and my friendships and connections there run deep that s a real and vibrant fandom there that is like us wanting very little to do with their government being involved in their fandom they definitely don t think it s their government and instead think its corporate interests or even worse a fan pro organization honestly they seem more scared by that than anything else which saddens me to see and despite multiple attempts to get them to share their story they seem really hesitant he elaborated further they don t seem to fear official reprisal the cpc seems to want to find who s responsible for embarrassing them on the world stage actually but rather ostracization from their community or its outright destruction if i were to hazard a guess the way we blew up this affair in the international media has now put this fandom in very serious trouble previously it was one of the few major avenues of free speech left in china now after all this the continuation of that freedom seems highly unlikely in the days following the january 20th release of the nomination long list several forums have been created online and all of them are calling for the hugo awards to be separated from the control of the sitting worldcon and amending the constitution of the world science fiction society wsfs to accomplish this in dave mccarty s february 4th interview he said he was opposed to separating the hugos from worldcon calling it entirely wrong headed even though i am certain that every administration decision i made was correct i don t think that anybody would ever give me this job again mccarty said in the interview the answers that i ve got for the administration decisions all i can say is again after reviewing this constitution and all the other rules we must follow the administration team ruled that these works were ineligible which absolutely categorically is our right to do you know that s right there in the wsfs constitution a full transcript of the file 770 interview with dave mccarty can be found here when paul weimer was asked if he supported separating the hugos from each local worldcon he said i was already moderately inclined toward that idea and now i m more inclined clearly we need third party auditing of the ballot and the whole process as a standard practice custom is not strong enough custom failed here it wasn t a failure in chengdu it was a failure here we need guardrails of multiple types because otherwise people are going to stop trusting the hugo results and that will be the death of the awards observations and conclusions by jason sanford in a recent article in esquire about the hugo awards controversy i talked about how the science fiction and fantasy genre saved my life i still remember how as a kid certain sf f novels and stories gave me an escape from horrific days while also opening my mind to new possibilities these stories also revealed to me that other people saw the world in similar ways to myself all of this gave me the drive to not give up and to continue moving forward and in a major way i found the stories that illuminated and saved my life through the hugo awards back then i read every hugo winner and finalist i could find while i didn t agree with or even like many of them they were still the standard by which i approached the sf f genre when i grew up and began writing my own sf f stories i realized the idealized version of the hugos from my youth didn t exist the hugo awards like all awards were flawed some stories that deserved to be finalists never made the ballot other works that did likely shouldn t have been there and that s before getting into the political infighting lack of diversity lack of inclusion and other issues that have plagued the awards for decades no the hugo awards aren t perfect however what i still love about the hugos is how they result from thousands of people across fandom working together to honor stories and authors i love how readers continue to discover new authors and stories thanks to the words hugo award finalist or hugo award winner i love seeing the excitement in an author s face when they re nominated for or win a hugo i also respect how each problem that pops up with the awards is examined and dissected by the genre as a whole until maybe eventually possibly a solution is found now the hugos are facing the biggest crisis in their history make no mistake the 2023 hugo awards were censored because certain authors and works were deemed to have too many political liabilities at least from the viewpoint of the chinese government while it s unclear if this was official censorship from the chinese government or self censorship by those afraid of offending governmental or business interests we can now be certain that censorship indeed took place however what also disturbs me is that the administrators of the hugo awards from the united states and canada countries that supposedly support and value free speech appear to have been active participants in this censorship let me say that again because there are too many people who believe all this happened solely because of the chinese government the administrators from the united states and canada appear to have helped censor the hugo awards as detailed in the emails and files examined by myself and chris barkley these western administrators took it upon themselves to research political concerns about many of the finalists i was one of those finalists they researched and let me tell you this is the first time i ve seen what amounts to a political dossier being created on what i ve said and done it s not a good feeling that this happened in conjunction with the hugo awards sickens me even more i know the hugo award administrators from the united states and canada were in a tough spot they deeply cared about both worldcon and the hugos and wanted both to be successful but in their attempt to do that they took actions that go against the very heart of what the awards should represent this didn t have to happen the administrators could have refused to research the political issues around various award finalists they could have spoken out when these issues first emerged they could have told the entire sf f genre what was happening before the awards were held instead the true story is only now coming out ironically while the western hugo administrators appear to have taken these actions in an attempt to protect both the hugos and worldcon the result has been the exact opposite this controversy has deeply hurt fandom in both the western world and in china in the leadup to the chengdu worldcon i wrote about speaking with many of the sf f fans from china who went to the 2022 worldcon in chicago i noted that we all love science fiction and fantasy and how despite my disagreements with many actions of the chinese government i hoped the chengdu worldcon would help bring together our shared international fandoms instead as chris and i documented in this report it now appears sf f fans in china are fearful of possible repression resulting from the hugos controversy it s my sincere hope that in the years to come we all remember that the regular sf f fans in china didn t want this to happen they are as horrified as western fans are by all of this instead of blaming china s genre fans we should work to ensure this issue with the hugo awards never happens again i want to thank diane lacey for providing these emails and files to chris and myself this is an amazing act of bravery and was undertaken because lacey deeply cares about the hugo awards i highly commend her for her work in revealing all this to the world i also urge everyone to read her apology letter the sf f genre has a lot of work in the coming months and years we must ensure nothing like this ever happens again the first opportunity for change will happen this year at the worldcon in glasgow during the business meeting proposals to decouple the hugos from worldcon will be raised and must be approved you can read the beginning of proposals to do this in these posts by chris barkley and cheryl morgan the world science fiction society wsfs must also start the process of incorporating so they have the actual power to deal with issues like this in the future if we want worldcon to exist a decade from now the wsfs must change the hugo awards remain one of the most prominent and visible worldwide icons of the science fiction and fantasy genre the awards must be saved the good news is the genre has the power to do just that jason sanford is a science fiction and fantasy writer who s also a passionate advocate for fellow authors creators and fans in particular through reporting in his genre grapevine column his first novel plague birds was a finalist for both the nebula award and the philip k dick award observations and conclusions by chris m barkley when i received the documents that are included in this report on february 3rd at capricon 44 i did not look at them immediately in fact i waited until i got home in cincinnati the next evening i did not read that material that day because i was attending a party honoring a very ill friend who as it turns out couldn t attend because of a medical emergency i did not want anything to detract from my enjoying the celebration but once i read the first two pages of the emails provided by diane lacey i was stunned anxious confused and finally very angry about what i was seeing and as i read the remaining pages i became even more upset to the point of being violently ill the chengdu hugo administrators compiled what a casual observer could reasonably consider to be dossiers of the works of possible nominees including myself and my co author jason sanford as you can see these lists contain what the admins thought the people s republic of china s government officials and censors may consider to be politically offensive or subversive in our works both in the recent past and up through the year of our eligibility after i got over my initial shock i realized i had a dilemma when pursuing a story the journalists who are chronicling the events usually do not find themselves as the subject of the inquiry but these documents and the truth behind them were entrusted to me so as far as i was concerned there was no way i could avoid being involved i also realized i could not do a report on this story alone for a brief while i considered enlisting the help of mainstream reporters but after reading several recent news articles about the hugo controversy i found that they lacked the insight about sf fandom that was needed to bring in a sense of context to what was happening i decided that whomever i chose i had to have an insider s knowledge of fandom and be a very good writer in their own right as well so i called in my fellow nominee and professional journalist jason sanford once he was apprised of the evidence i had in hand he did not hesitate to jump in and provide an invaluable perspective of what we should write in fact jason provided the bulk of the third person narrative of this report and as we wrote we knew that the truth we were revealing would have immediate and lasting consequences for everyone in science fiction fandom here in north america and internationally i have remarked to my partner that i don t believe in fate i don t believe that everything that happened from my surprise nomination last year the offer of attending the chengdu worldcon winning a hugo award for best fan writer and being personally embroiled in the controversy that followed in its wake was not fated to happen everything that did happen could have been avoided if the government of china their associated business interests and those involved in the running of the worldcon had not tried to do the right thing culturally speaking by western standards we generally believe that suppressing the truth and then covering up the attempt to do so is considered abhorrent and should be rightly condemned but in the people s republic of china and in other totalitarian nations speaking out and having a differing opinion can lead to being ostracized by the community imprisonment homelessness becoming a refugee or death for decades each individual and independent worldcon convention committee has had complete jurisdiction and control over the administration of the hugo awards and now that we have seen the disastrous results of what might happen in repressive countries like turkey hungary russia and uganda which have every right to bid under the current constitution of the world science fiction society we can well imagine what would happen if they hosted a worldcon and if that were to come to pass would the members of the worldcon be bound to nominate and vote on their ballots according to the local laws and regulations of an oppressive host country moreover are the hugo administrators beholden to assist them it is my opinion that mr mccarty and his fellow western based administrators felt by ingratiating themselves with the chengdu worldcon committee and other chinese administrators working with them they could to interdict any direct actions of censorship by the chinese communist party officials members of the censorship board or the security services by researching and ruling on potential nominees themselves the resounding answer should be a very loud no i think that people in fandom including the chengdu hugo award admins seem to have forgotten that the hugos are not supposed to be a popularity contest but a merits based award that is a judgment of the year s best works of fiction and non fiction as such it is up to the fans who i might add paid out of their own pockets for the privilege to nominate and vote on an annual basis who should have the final word on who is honored not the hugo administrators not the hosting convention committee and certainly not a group of government bureaucrats and censors with their own non consensual political agenda in his interview with me dave mccarty was adamant that the hugo awards should remain under the direct auspices of the worldcon hosting the proceedings but this debacle and the hugo administrators role in interdicting the nominations of four participants who should have been included on the final ballot practically ensures that the next two wsfs business meetings will seriously consider severing this traditional and long standing relationship and at the very least enact amendments that safeguard the nomination and voting process from any geo political influences here in north america and the rest of the world as well the firestorm of speculation and outrage that followed the release of the nomination long list engendered a frenzied demand for the truth of what really happened a furious yearning that could not and would not be denied by pronouncements of obfuscation half truths or attempts at subterfuge which brings us to diane lacey who is the hero of this story ms lacey whom i have also known for many years through socializing and working on sf conventions is very distraught about her role in what happened what she feared the most was that when this story was released to the public she would become a pariah in the fannish community it is my fervent contention and i think that my colleague jason would agree that what diane lacey has done was brave conscientious and ultimately the right thing to do for herself and for the community at large the omissions of the works of r f kuang neil gaiman paul weimer and xiran jay zhao formed the outline of the puzzle that has been confounding all of us since january 20th the emails spreadsheets and lacey s personal reminiscences provided a great number of the pieces that provided most of the answers fans have been asking for at least for now as far as our investigation is concerned there was no reason to exclude the works of kuang gaiman weimer or xiran jay zhao save for being viewed as being undesirable in the view of the the hugo award admins which had the effect of being the proxies chinese government what remains unknown at this time is what was the extent of the involvement of the chinese government or the business interests that surrounded the development of the science fiction museum if the business deals that emerged from the convention were orchestrated in conjunction with the convention organizers a more detailed knowledge of the reaction from the sf fans in china and whether or not there have been repercussions for them from this shameful incident i fully acknowledge the complete truth may never be known but with the publication of this report we now know more than we did on the morning of january 20 2024 and i can assure anyone reading this that the search for more explanations and answers will continue and so must the hugo awards the purpose of this report goes beyond a clarion call for truth and transparency it is also a plea for healing and transformation the hugo awards have been in existence for seventy one years it has strived to honor the best sf fantasy horror and works of related interest during those years i consider it to be as several astute critics have called it the literature of change what has happened is a test of our will to ask the right questions find the right answers heal our wounds and be resilient in the face of adversity because reacting out of fear is not the answer facing down that fear is you know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves an irrational fear of the unknown

as democrats cut president joe biden s social spending package from 3 5 trillion to nearly 2 trillion they re also working out how to raise the revenue to pay for it arizona senator kyrsten sinema s opposition to raising corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthiest americans as the biden administration had proposed is a stumbling block in the 50 50 senate lawmakers are considering a tax on billionaires to help cover the legislation s cost which the white house has insisted will be paid for via revenue and not deficit spending the proposal would apply to taxpayers with more than 1 billion in assets or who have an income of more than 100 million for three consecutive years roughly 700 of the wealthiest people in the u s in a package that s supposed to be about giving everybody a shot to get ahead it would be a big mistake from both a policy and political perspective not to ask billionaires to pay a fair share senate finance committee chair ron wyden said in a statement the billionaires income tax is about fairness and showing the american people taxes aren t mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country no working person in this country thinks it s right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end and sometimes never at all the plan would revalue tradable assets such as stocks against the market each year so billionaires pay tax on gains and take deductions for losses whether they sell the asset or not if the billionaires sell a non tradable asset such as real estate they would pay their usual taxes as well as a deferred recapture amount similar to the amount of interest on the taxes the individual deferred during the time they held asset there would also be rules to prevent billionaires from avoiding payment pertaining to passthrough entities gifts estates and trusts while some details of the plan are still being worked out and no final decisions have been made the plan is one of a number of revenue raising options under consideration democrats are working to reach an agreement that every member will support since they need all 50 senate votes to pass the legislation in a process that would allow them to move forward with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required the white house had originally proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 and increasing the top income tax rate for the wealthiest americans to 39 6 from 37 among other measures the house tax proposal similarly included raising the corporate tax rate to 26 5 a day ago however president biden said at a cnn town hall that sinema opposed any tax rate hikes on corporations and high income americans on friday white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters that other tax proposals are still on the table those include implementing a global minimum tax closing loopholes for high income americans and cracking down on tax evasion by the wealthiest americans the biden administration has called for a global minimum tax of at least 15 and wants 80 billion for the internal revenue service over 10 years to help beef up enforcement including audits of high income americans the white house has vowed it would not raise taxes on any americans making less than 400 000 a year
