editorial note we earn a commission from partner links on forbes advisor commissions do not affect our editors opinions or evaluations near the tail end of an unstable year for the global economy the u s dollar hit a 20 year high in value a number of factors both domestic and international have contributed to the strength of usd though economic conditions could shift in 2023 experts predict the dollar will hold a strong position why is the u s dollar so strong we asked experts to break down why the u s dollar gained strength against other currencies in 2022 they offered a few key explanations the u s dollar is still considered safe haven currency the dollar s role in the global economy has been a major factor in its strength in 2022 the greenback s reliability has made it the dominant global reserve currency since world war ii meaning it is most used by central banks around the world for international trade and financial transactions the primary reason the dollar became so strong is that it is still considered the safe haven currency and it will strengthen during times when markets are in a state of fear explains eric donovan head of institutional fx at stonex a financial services company dave schabes assistant instructional professor at the university of chicago s harris school of public policy adds that the war in ukraine is a specific contributing factor the u s has always been viewed as the number one global safe haven in times of political or military uncertainty he says when war actually broke out investors looked for stable places to put their money until the war resolves itself in the meantime russia s war on ukraine threatens to slow economic growth throughout europe and drag out the continent s energy crisis through 2023 and possibly 2024 continued interest rate hikes the strength of the dollar which is measured by the u s dollar index usdx is relative to other currencies that means other nations economic policies play a role in its value in particular the dollar index measures usd against the euro eur japanese yen jpy british pound gbp canadian dollar cad swedish krona sek and swiss franc chf unlike usd these other currencies haven t been subject to the same rate hike policies that have been put in place to slow inflation in the u s while all these countries have raised interest rates says schabes the u s has raised them far higher the u s can afford to do this because the u s economy is still fairly strong he explains while the eurozone is suffering from weakness in several countries exacerbated by the price increases both directly in natural gas and oil as well as the knock effects through the supply chain according to michael madowitz director of macroeconomic policy at the washington center for equitable growth slowing inflation in the u s has also resulted in investor money being diverted away from other nations and into the united states will the u s dollar grow in 2023 a number of shifting factors could affect the dollar s value in the coming year it s uncertain if the federal reserve will continue adjusting interest rates but the united nations has encouraged the agency to halt increases further hikes it says could spur global recession and hurt developing countries that have already been hit hard by the increased cost of u s goods there may be more rate hikes nonetheless until the fed sees inflation moderate substantially and as long as the us economy does not fall into recession i expect that the fed will continue to raise rates through a good portion of 2023 says schabes at the same time other nations have begun instituting their own rate increases and may continue which could balance out the position of the dollar with rate hikes across the globe coming says madowitz higher u s rates are a part of the strong dollar story but much less than we d expect for how fast the fed has raised rates the ongoing conflict in ukraine is also expected to play a part in the value of usd in 2023 both donovan and schabes predict that the dollar will remain strong in comparison to european currencies as long as the war persists how does a strong dollar benefit u s consumers a strong dollar has mixed implications for u s consumers as the currency increases in value u s based stock prices can be expected to drop which means a loss in the value of retirement savings for many investors one study from northwestern mutual found that the average retirement savings balance had dropped by 11 since 2021 on the upside higher dollar values mean certain goods are more affordable a strong dollar makes imported products relatively less expensive versus domestically produced products says schabes according to the bureau of labor statistics the price of imported goods dropped by 1 1 in september when the u s dollar peaked and by another 0 2 in october travel abroad can also be more budget friendly when the dollar strengthens particularly in regions where it has grown in comparison to the local currency as of late 2022 that includes japan the united kingdom sweden switzerland and canada

this is a guest post by fatema z sumar executive director of the center for international development harvard kennedy school a version of this article is republished from the conversation via a creative commons license u s income inequality grew in 2021 for the first time in a decade according to data the census bureau released in september 2022 that might sound surprising since the most accurate measure of the poverty rate declined during the same time span but for development experts like me this apparent contradiction makes perfect sense that s because what s been driving income inequality in the united states and around the world for years is that the very rich are getting even richer rather than the poor getting poorer in every major region of the world outside of europe extreme wealth is becoming concentrated in just a handful of people gini index economists and other experts track the gap between the rich and the poor with what s known as the gini index or coefficient this common measure of income inequality is calculated by assessing the relative share of national income received by proportions of the population in a society with perfect equality meaning everyone receives an equal share of the pie the gini coefficient would be 0 in the most unequal society conceivably possible where a single person hoarded every penny of that nation s wealth the gini coefficient would be 1 the gini index rose by 1 2 in the u s in 2021 to 0 494 from 0 488 a year earlier the census found in many other countries by contrast the gini has been declining even as the covid 19 pandemic and the deep recession and weak economic recovery it triggered worsened global income inequality inequality tends to be greater in developing countries than wealthier ones the united states is an exception the u s gini coefficient is much higher than in similar economies such as denmark which had a gini coefficient of 0 28 in 2019 and france where it stood at 0 32 in 2018 according to the world bank wealth inequality the inequality picture is even bleaker when looking beyond what people earn their income to what they own their assets investments and other wealth in 2021 the richest 1 of americans owned 34 9 of the country s wealth while average americans in the bottom half had only us 12 065 less money than their counterparts in other industrial nations by comparison the richest 1 in the united kingdom and germany owned only 22 6 and 18 6 of their country s wealth respectively globally the richest 10 of people now possess nearly 76 of the world s wealth meanwhile the bottom 50 own just 2 according to the 2022 world inequality report which analyzes data and the work of more than 100 researchers and inequality experts drivers of extreme income and wealth large increases in executive pay are contributing to higher levels of income inequality take a typical corporate ceo back in 1965 he all ceos were white men then and most still are today earned about 20 times the amount of an average worker at the company he led in 2018 the typical ceo earned 278 times as much as their typical employees but the world s roughly 2 700 billionaires make most of their money not through wages but through gains in the value of their stocks and other investments their assets grow in large part because of a cascade of corporate and individual tax breaks rather than salaried wages granted by shareholders when the wealthy in the united states earn money from capital gains the highest tax rate they pay is 20 whereas the highest income earners are on the hook for as much as 37 on every additional dollar they earn this calculation does not even count the effects of tax breaks which often slash the real world capital gain tax to much lower levels tesla spacex and twitter ceo elon musk is currently the world s richest man with a fortune of 240 billion according to a bloomberg estimate the 383 million he made per day in 2020 made it possible for him to buy enough tesla model 3 cars to cover almost the whole of manhattan had he wished to do so musk s wealth accumulation is extreme but the founders of several tech companies including google facebook and amazon have all earned many billions of dollars in just a few years the average person could never make that much money through a salary alone another day another billionaire a new billionaire is created every 26 hours according to oxfam an international aid and research group where i used to work globally inequality is so extreme that the world s 10 richest men possess more wealth than the 3 1 billion poorest people oxfam has calculated economists who study global inequality have found that the rich in large english speaking countries along with india and china have seen a dramatic rise in their earnings since the 1980s inequality boomed as deregulation economic liberalization programs and other policies created opportunities for the rich to get richer why inequality matters the rich tend to spend less of their money than the poor as a result the extreme concentration of wealth can slow the pace of economic growth extreme inequality can also exacerbate political dysfunction and undermine faith in political and economic systems it can also erode principles of fairness and democratic norms of sharing power and resources the richest people have more wealth than entire countries such extreme power and influence in the hands of a select few who face little accountability is raising concerns that are part of a robust debate on whether and how to address extreme inequality many proposed solutions call for new taxes regulations and policies along with philanthropic strategies like using grants and community based investments to dismantle inequality voters in some states like massachusetts will get to weigh in on whether to raise taxes on the income earned by their richest residents in ballot initiatives in november 2022 proponents of these initiatives claim the revenue raised would boost funding for public services such as education and infrastructure president joe biden is also proposing to almost double the top capital gains tax for those making over 1 million however societies choose to act i believe change is needed technically media

every month in the hammer art industry veteran simon de pury lifts the curtain on his life as the ultimate art world insider his brushes with celebrity and his invaluable insight into the inner workings of the art market a very pertinent analysis has been made by the brilliant writers of artnet news of the massive overall sales totals achieved by christie s sotheby s and phillips during the most recent november auctions a staggering 3 2 billion was obtained for impressionist modern postwar and contemporary art being hammered down over a period of just ten days it includes the 1 6 billion record of the paul allen collection at christie s which pulverized the previous record of 922 2 million for a single owner collection obtained at sothebys for the macklowe collection in november 2021 and may 2022 the timing of the sale of the paul allen collection could not have been better for the art market overall it proved that no matter what the general economic climate is at any given moment the appearance of an exceptional quality and fresh to market single owner collection will always cause heated competition collectors know that if they don t go for that caliber of works when they turn up these may be gone forever or for at least one or two generations as an infinitely more modest collector than most consignors to the recent sale accumulator is a more appropriate word i have regretted for years works that have escaped me simply because i wasn t bold enough to step up and pay that extra bit needed i have bought good stuff and bad stuff over the years but never regretted having bought something i coveted even if coming up with the money to pay for it has at times given me nightmares i discovered this early in my professional life when i was curator of baron thyssen bornemisza s collection in lugano switzerland my office was located exactly one floor above the one of his chief accountant every morning when i would arrive at work he would plead with me please please prevent the baron from acquiring any more works i simply don t know how to pay the bills this impressed me very much and selfishly i also realized that the ultimate consequence of cash flow drying up completely would be that i would be out of the absolute dream job back then in the art world i therefore prepared a small list of works from the collection that could be sold at auction when there were five or six works by any given artist in the collection i would select the least good one a lot of collectors use this method to prune their art holdings and to create the liquidity to upgrade their overall level of quality the chief accountant was thrilled with my proposal and the baron was a good sport about it this despite the fact that as most passionate collectors he loved acquiring new works and hated selling anything the results of the auction at sotheby s eased for a while the daily pressure that the accountant was putting on me looking at it in hindsight giving in to that pressure and putting that list together was totally idiotic while evidently there were no a works on my list even the value of b or c works for these artists grew so much in value over the years that none of them should have been sold the sales of the paul allen collection at christie s and to a lesser degree of the david solinger collection at sotheby s in a way played the same role for the art market now that the spectacular sale of the pierre bergé yves saint laurent collection did when it was sold at christie s in paris in march 2009 then like now the sizzling results were a formidable confidence booster for the thesis of art being an excellent alternative investment class the big difference is that the round of sales preceding the saint laurent auctions i e the london october and new york november sales at the three main houses in 2008 had been a bloodbath the percentage both in value and in numbers of the unsold lots was in excess of 50 percent a number of the key lots had been guaranteed when they were consigned in a good market in the spring of 2008 the consequence was losses for all three houses the art market had not seen anything like that since june 1990 when similarly high percentages of works failed to sell after japanese buyers who had fueled the 1980s boom ceased acquiring artworks from one moment to another the success of the saint laurent auction in 2009 at christie s meant that the art market recession had been short and in a sharp v shape in 1990 and the subsequent years no single owner collection of a comparable caliber to the paul allen or the yves saint laurent collections came onto the market it was only in 1997 and in 1998 when the victor ganz collection and the jacques koerfer collection were sold both at christie s in new york that the art market had fully recovered there are not that many art market professionals left who were around in the early 1990s when the market was tough stories of star salesmen of top london galleries needing to sell their porsche motor cars or of dealers who had overextended themselves sitting on a lot of stock unable to repay their debts were circulating conducting auctions required strong nerves none of the key lots was guaranteed or had an irrevocable bid i remember standing on the sotheby s rostrum gavel in hand wondering why the sale room was packed when nobody was raising their paddles luckily with the notable exceptions of the nahmad or mugrabi families who were bidding smartly with the current energy crisis wars inflation pandemic supply chain disruptions crypto meltdown extreme polarization and the climate catastrophe these are challenging times at best for the inveterate optimist that i am seen only from the microscopic perspective of the all in all tiny art market there are facts that would nevertheless inspire confidence according to forbes the 10 richest individuals in the world have doubled their fortunes since before the pandemic and the number of billionaires has risen during that time from 2 153 to 2 668 at the same time the number of trophy quality artworks left in private hands is shrinking each year this alone should ensure that going forward we will see price levels we never imagined would be possible before what did however strike me during the slowdown of the art market in the early 1990s was that when the general mood completely switches it can also alter the mood of the super rich the overall impact of asian buying on the market should also not be underestimated katya kazakina mentioned in her article on november 16 that 50 percent in value of sotheby s the now auction was purchased by asian collectors should chinese bidding halt in a comparable way to the stop of japanese purchasing in the 90s it surely would also have a detrimental impact during the summer of 2008 i was conducting my habitual round of charity auctions including some in the hamptons these galas are always attended by not only very affluent but also very generous guests they were all there but they were not bidding and getting bids felt like extracting teeth this gave me the feeling that clearly stormy weather lay ahead and so it is that during that same summer i negotiated with three potential purchasers the sale of a majority of phillips a contract was signed with the current owners of the company on october 4th and so when it appeared on october 8th that the global financial world was in meltdown i was able to weather the storm this summer and fall i have been busy as ever swinging my gavel at numerous benefit auctions around the globe they all have been characterized by spirited bidding so despite the generally pitch black horizon i remain optimistic for the art market simon de pury is the former chairman and chief

need to hold off any rate cuts next year even if the inflation picture starts to show consistent improvement i think we ll probably have to stay there all through 2023 and into 2024 given the

chase is preparing for a recession that starts in 2023 as the most likely current path for the u s economy credit suisse analyst susan roth katzke said tuesday in a research note the new york based bank s management considers that its central case for the upcoming year with a so called soft landing or a severe crisis seen as less likely katzke said after meeting with jpmorgan president and chief operating officer daniel pinto last week the recession scenario is likely to either be a mild downturn in 2023 that sees the federal reserve s benchmark lending rate hit about 5 or a deeper contraction occurring somewhat later that would stretch into 2024 and would see the fed raising rates to as high as 6 katzke said jpmorgan s earning power reserves for loan losses diverse business lines and moves to lower risk ought to render jpmorgan well prepared and well positioned to manage through the expected downturn she said the bottom line is that the bank wasn t wavering from its

getty the recent collapse of the global cryptocurrency markets has exposed many previously hidden dangers related to these blackbox investments growing secrecy at our nation s public pensions has turned government retirement plans into blackboxes themselves public pension officials have agreed to be kept in the dark about how much they re poised to lose in cryptocurrency investments and aren t eager to acknowledge the losses resulting from their gambling in crypto no one knows for certain just how much blackbox cryptocurrency blackbox public pensions own what do the bankrupt crypto companies terra luna3 3ac celsius cel voyager and ftx have in common with our nation s public pension plans they all provide opaque financial products to unsuspecting investors that have massive hidden risks hailed by the mainstream media as crypto winter the gross mismanagement of the above five companies has substantially contributed to the 2 trillion collapse of global crypto markets this year first to be included in the growing list of victims is canada s third largest pension fund the ontario teachers pension plan here in america according to a 2022 study published by the cfa institute 94 of state and government sponsored pension funds are invested in one or more cryptocurrencies despite the obvious risk due to an alarming lack of fiduciary oversight most of these pensions have failed to monitor and have agreed to be kept in the dark as to their cryptocurrency holdings pension officials aren t eager to publicly acknowledge losses resulting from their gambling in crypto nevertheless reports of cryptocurrency holdings at our nation s public pensions are slowly surfacing the houston firefighters relief and retirement fund reportedly bought 25 million in cryptocurrencies which was touted as the first announced direct purchase of digital assets by a u s pension plan two public pension funds for fairfax county of virginia reportedly indirectly invested over 120 million into funds that pursue opportunities in the crypto world such as blockchain technology digital tokens and cryptocurrency derivatives a recent report shows the minnesota state board of investment held small stakes in the crypto exchange coinbase global and bitcoin miners riot blockchain and marathon digital holdings as well as fixed income securities from coinbase the state of wisconsin investment board reportedly made purchases of coinbase marathon and riot blockchain new jersey s main state pension fund appears to have invested in some crypto related stocks recently other public funds that have reportedly taken stakes in crypto firms include the utah retirement systems and the pennsylvania public school employees retirement system although the initial wave of public pension cryptocurrency disclosures involve relatively small sums tens or hundreds of millions per pension not billions recent disclosures suggesting intentional fraud by ftx executives once again raise important questions about public pension investment decision making and practices for instance how do government pensions perform due diligence on prospective investments and can plan decision makers be held accountable for reckless or negligent investments for u s private pensions subject to the comprehensive federal law erisa the department of labor s release no 2022 01 offers guidance about investing in cryptocurrencies it cautions plan fiduciaries to exercise extreme care before deciding to offer cryptocurrencies because they present significant risks of fraud theft and loss to plan participants as emphasized by the dol in the release plan fiduciaries must act solely in the financial interests of plan participants and adhere to an exacting standard of professional care that courts have commonly held as the highest obligations known to the law moreover as detailed by the u s supreme court in hughes v northwestern university 2022 erisa governed fiduciaries have a continuing duty to monitor investments and to remove imprudent ones within a reasonable time any breach of these duties results in personal liability to the fiduciary for any losses to the plan including for losses incurred as a result of investments in cryptocurrency to be sure erisa provides plan participants with a great deal of protection and avenues for recourse if fiduciaries violate their duties of care protections government employees are not afforded in their retirement plans suing public pensions for failing to prudently vet or monitor investments in cryptocurrency or anything else for that matter is virtually impossible under state law for example the state retirement system of ohio strs lost over 5 billion last year but for reasons that are difficult to fathom still chose to pay 10 million in performance bonuses to staff would a 10 billion loss have resulted in 20 million in undeserved bonuses staggering long term mismanagement of investments previously resulted in elimination of contractually required cost of living adjustments to fund participants when a board member recently proposed clawing back bonus payments to staff the staff tried to implement a no dissent policy to muzzle board members from publicly discussing policy decisions with which they disagreed how did the strs staff lose all that money we ll likely never know because for over two years the pension has steadfastly refused to provide prospectuses and other documents related to its investments in response to public records requests filed on behalf of participants claiming trade secret protection what we are learning from the ftx flop however indicates that these defenses may be on their last breath the collapse of the world s second largest crypto exchange ftx is unprecedented never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here wrote jay ray iii ftx s newly appointed ceo in a document recently filed with the delaware bankruptcy court per his investigation he reports that he ftx group did not keep appropriate books and records or security controls with respect to its digital assets and its quarterly financial statements were never audited the resulting shockwaves throughout the ftx investor community has less to do with its disbelief that such a fraud could ever happen but that it could happen in a company that employs blockchain it never occurred to anyone that although ftx user transactions transpire on a blockchain the company did not use the technology for its own corporate transactions because ftx founder sam bankman fried spent so much time with u s federal regulators it may have appeared to the public that ftx had been government vetted and approved there is no inherent requirement that a blockchain issue a cryptocurrency says florida attorney anessa santos fundamentally blockchain is a network styled data management system that can solve many problems endemic to central banking for example financial systems properly designed on blockchain can provide transaction records that are open transparent immutable and secure in near real time santos believes blockchain could be a great solution to the transparency problem in public pension plans if all of the investment funds and financial products were required to transact on the same blockchain network and the activity of that network was made open and transparent then each order and related information would be time stamped immutable and available for viewing on demand the technology to do this is over a decade old and proven beyond reproach the only thing that s missing is the political will and understanding to require its use in short the only obstacle to public pension transparency is the fact that no one including wall street money managers hired by pensions elected officials and union representatives serving on pension boards state attorneys general state auditors securities regulators and law enforcement wants to expose what i refer to in my book who stole my pension as gross malpractice generally practiced at our nation s government pensions no one cares except pension stakeholders including active government workers retirees and taxpayers

amid the bear market and persistent inflation it s been a tough year for 401 k s and other defined contribution retirement plans for annuities on the other hand business is booming in the summer of 2022 annuities insurance products that provide a pension like income in retirement continued a historic winning streak the products enjoyed their second straight quarter of record breaking sales reaching a total of 80 7 billion 29 more than the same quarter last year according to limra an industry funded firm that s been tracking the products since the 1980s that s the highest quarterly sales total ever the new figures top the previous record which was set just last quarter in that period annuity sales reached 77 5 billion at the time the highest quarter of sales ever recorded and experts in the industry say there s no end in sight i still believe this is just getting started said david lau the founder of dpl financial partners which consults financial advisors about fee only insurance products i think this is just up and to the right as far as the eye can see what s driving this boom experts say the same factors that are dragging down the broader economy are driving annuities to new heights rising interest rates for example push up the yield from bonds which often means bigger payments for annuity holders and as stocks tumble the relative stability of annuities makes them a more attractive option for retirement the rate environment coupled with difficult market and economic conditions have led to many advisors and their clients flocking to annuities for safety cerulli associates a boston based research group wrote in a recent study of the market cerulli believes that if the fed continues raising interest rates sales of fixed rate deferred annuities will increase their hot streak lau believes there s also another factor at play as stocks both domestic and foreign and bonds all become more intertwined diversifying one s portfolio is harder than ever annuities he said can provide an income that s largely independent of other asset classes the need for asset protection and lifetime income just continues to increase lau said you need to bring something that is not going to go down with the rest of the market not all annuities have shared equally in the profits at the high end fixed rate deferred annuities saw their best quarter ever with sales of 30 billion 161 more than the same period last year fixed indexed annuities also had a record quarter with sales of 21 5 billion and the newest category registered index linked annuities rila reached 10 6 billion 14 more than last year s third quarter meanwhile other annuities declined sales of traditional variable annuities not including rilas dropped to 14 1 billion down 34 from the same time last year and deferred income annuities which delay payments until a certain date or event also fell although only by 1 to 505 million what s behind this wide variety of sales numbers lau believes the difference lies in the products themselves while fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of interest an appealingly reliable income in today s market the payments from a variable annuity depend on how well its portfolio is doing variable are down because people want to be out of the market lau said if you re feeling the pain of the market you want to go to something that s going to take you away from it and give you some protection in spite of these disparities the net result has been an extraordinary year for annuities in 2022 so far total sales have reached 223 4 billion 17 higher than in the first three quarters of 2021 and experts expect the surge to continue in its study cerulli projects that traditional fixed annuities will reach 70 billion in sales by the end of 2022 their highest level since the firm started studying them in 2005 cerulli is also bullish on rilas which it says will make up 23 of all annuity sales by 2027 up from 17 this year what can advisors learn from all this lau thinks the data sends a clear message about annuities i think this clearly shows that clients want them he said they want income they want downside protection and it just can t be delivered through investments these days

construction continues on a housing project in colchester earlier this year homes are still selling as inventory remains low but observers are keeping a watchful eye on the markets file photo by glenn russell vtdigger the doubling of interest rates over the past year is affecting construction and the real estate market across vermont in different ways some observers say the spike is scaring potential buyers away from purchasing homes joe carelli is among those observers carelli president of citizens bank for new hampshire and vermont said applications for mortgages and refinancings have slowed down significantly but the economy he added is still robust we re continuing to see very strong employment numbers carelli said the indicators today don t point to a recession demand for housing remains very strong according to david white founder of white and burke a burlington real estate management company white said builders can still build single family homes and sell them at a profit the construction of multifamily housing is harder white said because the costs of building have gone up dramatically with rising interest rates partly to blame and while rents have gone up he said outside of chittenden county developers cannot charge rents high enough to recover the cost of construction elsewhere in the state it s darn near impossible right now to make those numbers work white said he predicts that with high interest rates construction will slow down as interest rates go up it makes it harder to finance a project white said average interest rates on a 30 year mortgage have risen from 3 1 a year ago to 6 6 now according to the federal home loan mortgage corp which calculates the rates based on thousands of applications it receives from lenders across the country when borrowers apply for a mortgage steve kendall the senior residential loan officer at morrisville based union bank said he cannot remember a time when interest rates rose as quickly in a single year but he does not see higher interest rates as having much of an impact he said he has seen a slowdown in residential construction but he attributes that to the fact that winter is coming and not to interest rates according to kendall builders and remodelers are moving forward with residential and commercial projects since there s such limited inventory i don t think the rates are going to bring developers and projects to a screeching halt because there s still the demand kendall said in northwestern vermont the number of new homes on the market in october dropped from the previous year by 9 2 for single family homes and 2 1 for townhouses and condos according to the northwest vermont realtor association sales of single family homes fell during that time too by 20 7 for single family homes and 4 5 for condos and townhouses homes are still selling fast the average single family home in northwestern vermont was on the market for 28 days and the average condo or townhouse for 13 days according to the northwest vermont realtor association prices also appear to keep rising the median sales price for a single family home rose by 9 8 in that year to 435 000 the median sales price for a condo or townhouse rose by 16 3 to 330 000 the doubling of interest rates has had an effect on how much of a home first time buyers can afford to purchase in central vermont according to tim heney a real estate agent in montpelier heney noted a decline in the number of buyers in the last two months but he is not certain whether to attribute that decline to interest rates or to the annual dropoff in buyers toward the end of the year in rutland real estate agent joshua lemieux said he is no longer seeing offers of 30 to 35 above the asking price as he did last year because of that he said even though people have to pay a higher interest rate on their mortgage they are paying more or less the same as they would have at the lower interest rates that accompanied higher prices last year in bennington interest rates appear to be having an impact according to real estate agent lilli west it definitely has slowed things down and that is what the feds wanted to do west said she said she sees this especially with regard to investors who had made bennington the focus of tremendous real estate activity in 2021 it s really dried up the investors west said because they are being scared away by rising interest rates they are no longer competing against first time home buyers and those buyers have an easier time now west said now they re finally able to not be in as many multiple offer situations west said though she stressed that the real estate market is still strong i would say it s comparable to 2018 and 2019 periods of strong economic growth nationwide west said it s just not as strong as it was in the first two years of the covid 19 pandemic she is noticing that the rising interest rates are leading sellers to rethink their decisions to sell when you re at a 30 year mortgage at 3 you don t want to lose that and go to a 7 mortgage west said interest rates hit 7 last month before easing to 6 6 according to the federal home loan mortgage corp in the bennington area west said high interest rates have meant fewer cash buyers she attributes that to the fact that cash buyers often pull money out of the stock market when they want to buy real estate and with the stock market driven down by high interest rates people are reluctant to pull their money out of the market at a loss but in montpelier rutland and parts of southern vermont cash buyers are still showing up real estate agents told vtdigger cash buyers can drive other buyers out because sellers do not have to wait for the buyer to come up with financing and they can also drive bidding wars that leave first time local buyers out of the picture we re still seeing some cash sales said claudia harris a weston based real estate agent who also covers ludlow winhall londonderry jamaica and peru

for corporate pension plan sponsors and asset allocators plans are often made to be changed there may be no better example than the financial market s roller coaster ride over the past 21 months and the careful planning upended along the way consider early march 2021 the s p 500 was trading at about 3 939 and the u s 10 year note yielded about 1 52 on march 11 president joe biden signed into law the american rescue plan act offering relief for corporate employers struggling with higher pension contributions the legacy of years of near zero interest rates everything is quite different today the 10 year note topped 4 in early november it has since fallen and concerns about rising interest rates have sent stocks swooning this year the arpa pension provisions are nearly meaningless and the seismic market shift has led to big changes in the pension plan industry with more likely to follow nevertheless according to milliman s monthly records the plan funded ratio through october was 112 8 with a funded status surplus of 163 billion at the end of 2022 balance sheets will have greatly improved says zorast wadia a principal and consulting actuary with milliman that begs the question what should be your pension funding strategy going forward for many corporate plan sponsors the answer is some sort of risk management scheme in the second quarter of 2022 pension buyouts topped a fresh record according to data from limra as previously reported those numbers include heavyweights like ibm while it is largely some jumbo transactions that are helping goose the numbers there is much more appetite among plan sponsors now that funded status has improved so drastically says michael clark managing director and consulting actuary with agilis partners llc in 2020 and into 2021 a lot of plan sponsors still looked at pension risk transfer as potentially cost prohibitive clark said with funding status much improved this now looks like a perfect moment to shed risk there s definitely a disconnect between the relief promised by arpa and strategies like pension risk transfers and liability driven investing according to clark relief is structured to protect companies when rates are low from having a spike in liabilities says clark when rates are higher there s more reason to consider those strategies what we re going to see in 2023 is that relief is no longer relief as rates have spiked higher there is also likely to be more take up of strategies around liability driven investing says randy cusick managing director at sei institutional group a lot of clients are saying it s time to start hedging interest rate risk in the immediate aftermath of arpa s passage some sponsors reallocated toward riskier assets cusick notes taking advantage of the longer funding time horizon offered by the legislation he expects more reallocating to take place as sponsors assess the changed market conditions milliman s wadia thinks this is a perfect moment for sponsors to consider ldi funding relief has allowed plan sponsors to invest more conservatively he says since they re no longer trying to make up for shortfalls instead of risk transfer shift from equities to fixed income over time thereby solidifying your funded status even more perhaps more important wadia says is trying to avoid the same mistakes made in the late 1990s the last period in which corporate pensions flourished that later led to shortfalls we re seeing the same conditions now that allowed plans to flourish back then wadia says you want to avoid some of the plan design features that caused them to have to be frozen this is a good time to restructure plans to avoid the highly leveraged final average pay designs found in traditional db plans wadia says in favor of a better cost sharing relationship between employer and employee as found in many hybrid structures such as cash balance plans clark agrees if anything he thinks arpa did give sponsors time to consider their options the interesting thing will be to watch what sponsors do in terms of rebalancing once it seems like we ve turned the corner clark says given the economic environment it s not unfathomable that we would see sponsors evaluate their asset balance strategy to capture any upside while keeping in mind how much they want to keep allocated to ldi tags agilis partners llc american rescue plan act ldi liability driven investing michael clark milliman special coverage ldi zorast wadia

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here more than a year after one of china s biggest real estate developers began to collapse trouble has rippled through cities across the country dozens of other developers have also missed debt payments the sale of new homes has plunged and construction cranes have come to a standstill at many sites last week the chinese government which until now has stayed largely on the sidelines of the country s housing crash has taken its most forceful steps to try to minimize the damage from the turmoil that has enveloped china evergrande group the world s most heavily indebted developer and many of its competitors real estate development plays an outsize role in china s economy representing about one quarter of economic output and one quarter of its bank loans housing represents at least three fifths of household assets in china and many chinese regard apartments as the only reliable way to build wealth last week s intervention by the government took on greater urgency as covid 19 cases hit record levels the infections have prompted a new wave of strict lockdowns disrupting factories and other businesses cutting into spending by consumers and preventing homebuyers from visiting apartment complex showrooms this has further strained an economy under severe pressure china s cabinet called late wednesday for banks most of which are state owned to lend more money for the completion of unfinished apartments following a similar directive by regulators put out hours earlier china s central bank the people s bank of china and the main bank regulator codified 16 measures on the same day to make sure that developers can borrow enough money from banks and bond investors and can defer repayment when necessary and friday evening the central bank reduced by 70 billion the money that the country s commercial banks are together required to hold for emergencies freeing them to lend that money instead an affiliate of the central bank agreed this month to guarantee the repayment of new bonds issued by some less distressed real estate developers in effect assuring investors it was safe to lend to the companies the finance ministry has enacted a tax break for people who buy a new home within a year of selling the previous one acting on instructions from the cabinet and bank regulators china s biggest banks gave lines of credit this week to large developers the industrial and commercial bank of china announced thursday that it had issued lines of credit totaling 91 billion to 12 developers bank of communications gave a 14 billion line of credit to vanke china s biggest developer yi gang governor of the central bank declared that the government was willing to use its policy tools to stabilize the country s huge real estate sector china s housing sector is linked to a lot of upstream and downstream industries so its healthy development is of great significance to the overall economy yi said in a speech monday financial regulators in china are under pressure to rebuild public confidence in the real estate sector domestic and international investors have been selling bonds and other assets and moving money out of the country as worries persist about the economy which is expected to grow at barely half of beijing s target of 5 5 this year speculation is rising that xi jinping china s leader may raise taxes on the affluent to pay for more social spending bond prices have fallen this autumn in shanghai trading driving up yields and making it more expensive for developers to borrow without government help lightly regulated wealth management funds many of which use borrowed money to place big bets in bond markets have seen investors withdraw large sums another sign of the broad financial duress also affecting housing just as china s health policy has become stuck in an inflexible zero covid stance of lockdowns and mass testing china s housing policy is also deadlocked strong positions taken by xi have complicated the resolution of the housing crisis and covid 19 policy with exports falling right now and consumer spending weak during widespread lockdowns the economy is even more dependent on housing to save the property market is to save the economy said han xiuyun an associate professor of economics at tsinghua university in an online analysis in housing the crucial issue lies in whether the government should once again tolerate people using housing investments as a way to make money rather than simply as a place to live xi had proclaimed in 2016 that housing is for shelter not speculation an idea that became government policy two years ago the country s housing ministry imposed a three red lines policy that put guardrails around how much developers could borrow the goal was to prevent developers from borrowing excessively and plowing the money into speculative projects while also constraining banks from lending too much crossing even one red line put pressure on developers to start paying back debt and that quickly strained their finances the housing ministry has left the three red lines policy in place even as at least three dozen real estate developers have missed payments on one or more bonds mainly overseas bonds china s housing market was inflated and might have crashed even without the tougher policy some analysts believe after home prices soared over the past quarter century oxford economics calculated this week that prices for newly built homes across china reached 8 5 times the average household disposable income last year in the united states that ratio peaked at 5 8 times in 2007 before the american housing bubble burst some economists say that xi was right to address speculation but that the policy response needs to be more carefully crafted even though the direction of the policy of housing is for living not speculation is correct the implementation of the policy may require fine tuning in light of market conditions said zhu ning deputy dean of the shanghai advanced institute of finance this week s burst of regulatory activity could mark the start of that fine tuning an affiliate of the central bank has begun providing guarantees for 35 billion worth of bonds to be issued by the country s real estate developers government guarantees will allow developers to sell new bonds at low interest rates to the state controlled banks proceeds of the new bonds will then be used to repay or buy back existing bonds the aim is to relieve steep interest costs facing developers under another of the measures released this week the china banking and insurance regulatory commission has separately told banks that they can delay collecting interest and principal payments from real estate developers for a year that deferral allows china s commercial banking system to avoid recording a big wave of troubled loans which would otherwise depress profits the housing ministry has begun allowing local governments to dismantle their extensive limits on who can buy apartments many cities had discouraged out of town investors from buying homes until now so as to make apartments less expensive for longtime residents finally china s ministry of finance has approved a temporary tax break designed to make sure that investors keep their money in the property market the rule says that the 20 tax on gains from selling real estate can be avoided if the proceeds from the sale are invested into another real estate acquisition within 12 months the tax break which resembles the so called section 1031 tax provision for real estate investors in the united states expires at the end of next year the goal is to encourage people sitting on large gains in the value of their homes to trade up to newer and larger apartments that might help revive at least part of china s huge construction industry the longer term problem is that the vast movement of rural residents to cities that began in the 1980s has slowed as villages have been drained of people while the country s birthrate has plunged oxford economics estimated this week that housing demand was 8 million units per year from 2010 through 2019 but would drop to 4 6 million per year from next year through 2030 the dilemma for beijing lies in how to manage the decline of the construction industry and many associated industries from steel and cement to furniture and washing machines the construction sector has to shrink said george magnus an associate at the china center at oxford university the question is how and at what cost this article originally appeared in the new york times
a group of house lawmakers on both sides of the aisle is pushing to expand the low income housing tax credit as the supply of affordable housing remains tight rep suzan delbene d washington and brad wenstrup r ohio led 54 members of congress in a bipartisan letter monday urging house leaders to address the growing affordable housing shortage in the u s they asked for several provisions aimed at strengthening and expanding the lihtc in a potential year end legislative package during the lame duck session among the proposals is one that would extend the 12 5 lihtc allocation which expired at the end of last year they noted that a pipeline of lihtc developments is ready to go now but the program has been vastly oversubscribed in 2020 developers asked for nearly 2 5 times as many low income housing credits as there was available authority for and any restored or new resources could be deployed immediately by restoring and extending the 12 5 housing credit allocation increase the u s capitol building in washington d c andrew harrer bloomberg they also want to lower a 50 requirement for private activity bond funding to 2 to increase access to the tax credits which would enable more states to more efficiently use their private activity bond cap and unlock resources for states to complete hundreds of thousands of more shovel ready developments currently to access the 4 housing credits 50 of a development has to be funded with private activity bonds however nearly half of all states have already reached their federally allocated pab cap so without further congressional action state and local governments and affordable housing developers are limited in their ability to finance new housing stock the lawmakers contend that provision would lead to 1 million new affordable homes over the next decade while the other provision would add about 540 000 homes by enacting these two provisions we can have a huge positive impact on affordable housing production said the letter according to novogradac these provisions alone are estimated to build or preserve 1 54 million new affordable homes over the next decade affordable housing industry proponents back the move to expand the tax credits we applaud representatives delbene and wenstrup for recognizing the immediate and urgent need to take action to address our affordable housing crisis and for galvanizing bipartisan support around these critical proposals to expand and strengthen the housing credit said emily cadik ceo of the affordable housing tax credit coalition in a statement monday these measures will allow us to immediately ramp up affordable housing production and tackle one of the primary drivers of inflation at a time when rents are skyrocketing

indices talking points it was a quiet monday on the economic calendar despite it being cyber monday everywhere else but the latter portion of this week s docket carries considerable headline risk chair powell has a speech on wednesday afternoon and then thursday brings pce data which is the fed s preferred inflation gauge and then friday brings non farm payrolls for the month of november given the fed s focus on inflation this will likely be highly watched by market participants for clues towards that next move from the fomc us equities pulled back to open the week but remain within the context of intermediate term ranges the analysis contained in article relies on price action and chart formations to learn more about price action or chart patterns check out our dailyfx education section recommended by james stanley get your free equities forecast get my guide stocks pulled back to start the week and if tracking from short term charts there were some trends to work with taking a step back however highlights the ranges that have been in place for the past couple of weeks that haven t yet given way although with the economic calendar for later this week there s likely some positioning ahead of the events taking place as traders tighten up risk ahead of the drivers tomorrow brings consumer confidence out of the united states and then wednesday brings a speech from chair powell thursday morning brings pce data which is the fed s preferred inflation gauge and this is followed by friday s non farm payrolls data and given where we are with the fed s hiking cycle with many looking on the horizon in an attempt of finding a slower pace of rate hikes the intense focus on that data will likely remain the big question is whether we ll hear a balanced message from chair powell or something more resembling the jackson hole outing when the chair was much more focused with a hawkish speech that reminded markets that the fed wasn t near complete in addressing inflation at this point inflation remains brisk and far above target but the fed has already hiked a lot this year starting in march and it will likely take some time for that tightening to fully transmit through the economy accordingly we ve heard from multiple fed speakers that have talked up the prospect of slowing rate hikes which has been music to bulls ears at this point there s a scant 32 probability of a 75 basis point hike at the december rate decision and this has actually been a bullish factor over the past couple of weeks s p 500 the s p found resistance at the same 4050 level last week which opens up the possibility of a double top formation but for that to come to fruition we d need to see a breach of the neckline which currently marks the very bottom of the support zone around the 3915 3928 area on the chart with approximately 135 points from the top to the neckline this would provide a projected move down to below 3800 if it fills in but that 3915 3928 area is support until then and a hold in that area keeps the door open for range continuation scenarios in the s p 500 on the resistance side of the coin this is where the plot thickens just above the 4050 high is the 200 day moving average and just above that is a confluent spot around 4100 and above that is a lot of other possible resistance so the road ahead is not a simple one for bulls and this is likely playing into the lack of bullish behavior over the 4k psychological level of late s p 500 daily chart chart prepared by james stanley s p 500 on tradingview nasdaq 100 if we do see equity weakness themes making their way back by the end of the year rates are likely going to be a push point and that would also mean that the nasdaq could have a greater level of vulnerability and as a comparison during the recent rally the tech heavy index has lagged and even at this point remains very near the lows while both the s p and dow have put in some topside stretch while the s p 500 is holding resistance just below the 200 day moving average but support above the 100 day moving average the nasdaq hasn t scaled above either yet further illustrating that lag shorter term there s a possible descending triangle formation in here with support taken from a neckline at around 11 528 the next support below that is a familiar fibonacci level plotted at 11 294 if that comes into play tomorrow there may be an attractive bounce setup provided that support has confirmed at that level but if we get the risk aversion theme roaring back similar to what showed after powell s speech in august it s the 11 068 level that s of interest as a push below that would mark a return of control to bears nasdaq daily price chart chart prepared by james stanley nasdaq 100 on tradingview dow breakout pulls back the dow has led the way higher and it s the only index of the three discussed in this article that has pushed over that prior august high so it s set a fresh six month high just last friday and opened this week with a fast reversal this brings up a number of now nearby prior support levels there s a spot at 33 701 that s a fibonacci level of note and below that is a prior price action resistance swing turned support plotted at around 33 444 for bears they would likely want to see the 33k level traded through although there may be greener pastures for equity bears

a team of technology experts within banks and technology companies have designed an anti bitcoin it s the architectural drawings for a distributed ledger that borrows many of the concepts behind bitcoin but instead of existing outside of the government and the current banking system the way bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies do this version would be used by central banks traditional banks and some fintechs and fully regulated the idea is to counter the rapid rise of unregulated digital currencies with an approved and supervised form of digital dollar and along the way help modernize many outdated payment rails and other tech platforms used in financial services the impetus for this was that the debate about the future of the digital dollar seemed to be resolving into a kind of ping pong battle between central bank digital currencies and stablecoins said tony mclaughlin managing director emerging payments and business development at citi treasury trade solutions as if the choice is really between centralizing things with the central bank or having unregulated wildcat stablecoins and that seemed to be a false choice mclaughlin and several counterparts at other banks including td wells fargo and u s bank have designed a shared ledger scheme in which digital dollars issued by governments could coexist alongside digital dollars issued by banks and private companies like paypal and square the group has published a white paper describing the system which they dub the regulated liability network it starts with first principles mclaughlin said is a dollar only the greenback or coin in your pocket or is it a deposit on a bank or a balance on a fintech wallet the concept of the regulated liability network is to say yes let s have a programmable digital dollar but not limit it to central bank money mclaughlin said public blockchains like ethereum operate 24 7 and they are programmable and multi asset bankers would like to see these virtues used in the regulated financial system through the adoption of shared ledger technology we can t try to disregard or hold back this technology said jon prendergast head of u s payments strategy for td enterprise payments and a contributor to the regulated liability network white paper blockchain is one of the most revolutionary brilliant technologies to come around for centuries but using it in a way that tries to avoid any regulatory oversight from a sovereign government that s just a nonstarter the government ultimately isn t going to agree that this technology should be used outside of its sphere of influence on the other hand the group does want to limit digital dollars to regulated entities if allowed to develop outside of regulation cryptocurrencies and stablecoins may substitute for sovereign money the white paper states they may diminish an important instrument of national self determination and negatively affect financial stability outside experts see promise in the idea this is an idea that is very interesting and deserves exploration said timothy massad research fellow at the harvard kennedy school mossavar rahmani center for business and government what s interesting about it is that it tries to bring together shared ledger technology with sovereign currencies and with what i would call the regulated financial system it s basically saying look if shared ledger technology has advantages then why can t it be used for sovereign currencies and other traditional assets like the bankers involved massad said a shared ledger of this kind could make the u s financial system more efficient one of the things that is true about our financial system is that multiple entities spend a lot of time reconciling the same sets of data and shared ledger technology he said conceivably this is a way to reduce the cost of that to create a golden record of information if it can be that plus a transfer mechanism that s a promising approach prendergast also sees this work as part of an effort toward modernization of the financial system most of the systems that underpin payments have been around for generations he said if you think about the card rails if you think about wires they ve been around for generations but nothing lasts forever and so whether it s the real time systems that have recently come up with iso 20022 format or it s systems like this that are based on distributed ledger there will be new platforms that evolve and that become dominant in money movement and value transfer prendergast and td want to ensure that we are engaged in these new forms of money and these new platforms and that we are able to inform how they re built and structured but also how to make sure that we are not being left behind rln could operate 24 7 and enable near instantaneous movement of value between entities or within large companies across borders he said there are aspects to this concept that might solve problems for our customers and that s why we want to do it prendergast said giving the government a role banks already use shared distributed ledgers in a few cases in october for instance tassat announced that three banks had begun using its interbank network for business to business payments using its distributed ledger cogent bank customers bank and western alliance bank the provenance blockchain foundation which was started by figure technologies has 50 bank members that use shared distributed ledgers for buying and selling mortgages and settling corporate clients transactions among each other what makes rln unique is that it envisions an important role for central bank digital currencies while tassat is focused on supporting the current regulatory framework having already conducted over 700 billion in transactions entirely within the existing perimeter of u s banking regulations said tassat ceo and chairman kevin greene in addition to supporting cbdcs the regulated liability network concept differs from existing distributed ledgers used by banks in that it would be a platform shared by central banks traditional banks and regulated nonbanks and it would be run by a regulated financial market utility we wouldn t have engaged in this if it wasn t regulated because ultimately that just doesn t end well prendergast said furthering the proper use of technology to streamline and make more efficient money movement and transactions for customers within a proper regulatory framework that was the goal it s the ability to use what bitcoin did in a test tube environment and make it applicable to a much wider and much stabler financial environment strongest use cases another priority for this initiative was that it needed to solve a problem prendergast said but consumer payments don t seem to have a problem that needs a new digital solution do i need another solution for buying a coffee mclaughlin said i don t trying to use this ledger to create digital dollars that would go directly into a consumer s wallet might be troublesome from a privacy standpoint as ledger owners might be able to see exactly where consumers money goes prendergast pointed out the main use case for rln may be cash management for large corporations corporate cash management is a salient use case because it s a place where programmable dollars might be extremely powerful but it s not a use case that can be readily supported by cbdc or stablecoins mclaughlin said u s corporations have about 2 trillion offshore he said money that often needs to be moved around between subsidiaries for example today if a multinational corporation wants to move dollars from a hong kong based subsidiary to an australian based subsidiary it can t do that on a 24 7 basis between different banks mclaughlin said a cbdc wouldn t suit this purpose because to do corporate cash management with cbdcs would require all of that corporate cash to move into the fed and off of commercial bank balance sheets stablecoins also don t work for this purpose because they are not regulated and they re not all equivalent to cash the rln might be used for other things later potentially we ll see how it evolves as the white paper gets read and people start to think about this prendergast said the first thing for us as u s banks is to at some point test this and make the case that we think there s value here and then evolve it and grow it from there how the rln would work the regulated liability network is technology neutral mclaughlin said it s not specifically pushing blockchain or distributed ledger technology he said but it is saying are there attributes of shared ledgers that might be valuable to import into the traditional financial system multiple forms of digital dollars would coexist on the same ledger one type is central bank money digital versions of dollar bills and coins in the u s these are liabilities of the federal reserve bank consumers and businesses can t have accounts at the fed at this point but banks can the second type is money deposited in commercial banks at the moment that s the dominant form of digital money mclaughlin said the third type is what mclaughlin calls e money issued by regulated fintechs for instance paypal balances and square cash balances all of these are promises to pay by different institutions a central bank a commercial bank or a regulated non bank they can all live on the rln and be interoperable then there is non sovereign money like bitcoin which lives on the bitcoin blockchain and would not be interoperable with the rln the ideology of bitcoin is that money does not belong to the nation state mclaughlin said and there are unregulated stablecoins these also would not exist on the rln for now if stablecoins do become regulated they could live on the network as well mclaughlin said this ledger would be run by a financial market utility a regulated entity formed as part of a public private partnership he said it would be similar to cls group in new york which is supervised by regulators around the world and can achieve finality of settlement meaning that the transfers in cls and the transfers in rln would be final from a legal perspective the rln disarms some of the potential disadvantages of cbdcs mclaughlin said the thing that people don t like about cbdcs is deposits and transactions moving into the central bank as this might impact credit creation he said the rln construct solves that problem by keeping the money on the private balance sheets where it can support lending into to the economy in the rln central bank digital currencies act as settlement assets if a person or company that banks at wells fargo makes a payment to another person or company that banks with citi you would instruct your bank to make a payment using your tokens in other words a different form factor of your bank balance mclaughlin said that means it should be subject to fdic insurance it s protected by banking regulations and it s protected by the capital that the commercial bank has to hold to facilitate a 100 payment the rln would extinguish the wells fargo token and mint a new citi token meaning citi owes the payee 100 and then it would move a wholesale cbdc from wells fargo to citi because citi will only accept the new liability if it receives a matching asset this new network could affect the future of the u s dollar proponents say we don t want to have a situation where other currencies are easier to transact in than the u s dollar mclaughlin said

increases into 2023 and there s some risk that we ve have to go even higher than bullard said at a barron s live webinar bullard made waves in financial markets earlier this month when he said the fed s hikes have had only limited effects on inflation so far and that the benchmark interest rate may need to rise to between 5 and 7 bullard who is a voting member of the fomc said that the fed will need to hold off any rate cuts next year even if the inflation picture starts to show consistent improvement i think we ll probably have to stay there all through 2023 and into 2024 given the

economic reports over the thanksgiving holiday paint a complicated picture of what s happening and where we are on recession watch the big economic surprise was the strength of black friday sales where consumers spent a record 9 12 billion online another surprise was the atlanta fed s forecast of 4 3 gdp growth in the fourth quarter since the atlanta fed data was used by many to say that the u s went into a recession earlier in the year the jobs data however wasn t a surprise the unemployment rate is now 3 7 and jobless claims are still very low historically with all the data we now have in front of us we can say that the u s did not go into a recession at the start of 2022 the question now is whether there is a way to avoid the job loss recession we re facing in 2023 the u s housing market went into recession in june of this year which i talked about a few months ago on cnbc a recession means that sales and production are down new and existing home sales are falling along with housing permits and starts as we have too many new homes for the builders to issue new permits the job loss recession is already here in the housing market and total incomes are falling with less volume in this sector although we don t have this in the larger economy yet housing traditionally gets weaker into a recession as it is a rate sensitive sector of our economy the federal reserve has forecast a 4 4 unemployment rate next year which would mean an immediate 1 increase from the cycle lows in the unemployment rate which again implies the job loss recession is something they re looking for i would even say want why do they want a job loss recession their main goal is to bring down inflation and americans losing their jobs is the fastest way to create more labor supply and weaker demand accordingly i raised my sixth and last recession red flag on aug 5 it was apparent on aug 5 that the leading economic index was in a downtrend that is similar to every single recession we have seen for decades the most recent leading economic index report has confirmed that the downtrend in the data is still intact i discussed this with the conference board earlier this year as i presented my six recession red flag model to them as always with any index you need to know the components and their weighting and understand how those components will look in the future the us lei fell for an eighth consecutive month suggesting the economy is possibly in a recession said ataman ozyildirim senior director of economics at the conference board in november the downturn in the lei reflects consumers worsening outlook amid high inflation and rising interest rates as well as declining prospects for housing construction and manufacturing so with all these factors in place housing already in a recession the fed s recent actions and dealing with inflation can we avoid this job loss recession yes we can it will be hard and we will need a lot of help but there is a pathway to this two things need to happen 1 inflation growth rate and long bond yields need to go down together the fed is bent on driving us into a recession to make it easier to achieve their single mandate to bring down inflation we have already seen some of the growth rates of inflation falling the used and new car price growth rate is falling as you all know car production was terrible during the global pandemic and we are working our way back to some sense of normal in auto production gasoline prices are also falling we have a lot of variables here that are out of our control that make this sector a bit abnormal today including the russia wild card releasing a lot of strategic reserves and opec s view of us however for now gas prices are down in addition prices paid for transportation of products from china to the u s are falling from the covid 19 peaks china s economy is in terrible shape with constant lockdowns however with less demand for goods from china we are receiving less stuff and our port backlogs are resolving as we have become a bit more efficient at the ports we used to have tons of boats in the waters of the pacific waiting to be docked to take stuff to the stores now this stressful aspect of transportation costs is gone and the fear of a downturn in the freight industry is taking hold however the biggest component of inflation isn t the transportation cost of goods from china to the u s it s rent shelter inflation which makes up 42 2 of the consumer price index housing is the significant x factor in our economy i believe the growth rate of shelter inflation is already cooling off it just won t get picked up on the cpi date until next year in september when the cpi inflation data was being reported on i talked with cnbc about how this data line lags with the cpi data in addition we have a lot of two unit construction built which will bring more supply online if we can get this to happen the fed can end their rate hikes once they get to their desired level over the next few months if the bond market s long end can fall we can get mortgage rates back down to 5 why does 5 matter currently rates have fallen from 7 375 to 6 62 which has boosted the weekly demand data to be positive for three weeks last week we had a decline in the year over year negative data which went from 46 year over year declines to 41 remember a big talking point of mine is that we would have hard comps starting in october of this year on a year over year basis last year purchase application data volume was rising late in the year which was abnormal i have talked about having 35 to 45 year over year declines as the norm from october to january with a possible 53 to 57 decline if demand gets worse well since october the year over year declines have been between 39 46 if mortgage rates keep going lower and we get more weekly data growth we do need to see a noticeable year over year decline to warrant talk of stabilization right now we are working from a shallow bar so we need to show context with the recent moves in purchase application data the housing market getting some stabilization will be a plus as we saw some buyers come into the marketplace with rates at 5 rates also need to stay at that lower for longer as well what can t happen is mortgage rates above 7 since that level hasn t fueled new listings which means less demand and the builders simply are done building anything new with rates that high however getting mortgage rates lower with duration will help housing the one issue here is that total inventory levels in america are still historically low and the fed does not want home prices to explode higher this might prevent them from aiding housing in any meaningful way because of the fear of what we saw in 2020 and 2021 it was savagely unhealthy nar total inventory data 1 220 000 listings the key here is that if the growth rate of inflation falls and mortgage rates can get back toward 5 with some duration that can stop the bleeding in the one sector of the economy that is in a recession also lower mortgage rates means those households that bought homes with higher rates recently can refinance if they can qualify 2 the fed pivots early when the labor market starts to get bad fed chairman powell will have a speaking engagement this wednesday so we might have the grinch for christmas speech about how americans need to feel more pain for his jolly fed members to get their job done taking down inflation aside from that i don t believe the fed pivots until the jobs market starts to break my target for the fed pivot is that jobless claims break above 323 000 on the four week moving average the last headline print came in at 240 000 so we aren t close to breaking over that number yet on a four week moving average this level isn t a high level historically when we look at jobless claims data however considering how low we got in jobless claims at 166 000 and where the job openings data is currently if we break above 323 000 the federal reserve will get its beloved job loss recession because once jobless claims break the downturn has just started the chart below shows initial jobless claims and the shaded grey parts define when we are in a recession the chart shows the last three recessions not including the covid 19 recession as you can see below when jobless claims have an aggressive rise working from a low level the job loss recession is happening if the fed can pivot and show that they re once again a dual mandate fed which means they care about employment then the damage is done early on and can be acted on quickly by the fed this is where it gets tricky since the fed has talked about not cutting rates when the economy gets weaker and has harped on americans feeling more pain for their job to be done for now the strong balance sheets of american households have kept consumption going but as short term rates rise americans will feel it on their credit cards home equity lines and any mortgage rates that have recast the fed believes the strength of the u s consumer gives it some cover to hike rates aggressively to this point i agree with the fed the consumer balance sheets look good but you shouldn t rely on your top horse to win every time we hear a lot of talk about recession in addition we know housing is in a downturn manufacturing data is looking weaker the global economies are struggling china is a giant mess europe is dealing with an economic war with russia and even my six recession red flags are raised history has shown us time and time again that a recession isn t that far away when a lot of these data lines turn negative together all with the fed raising rates however what we have here in america is different than other countries we are the only economic superpower in the world we have solid household balance sheets and a massive young workforce that can replace older workers and consume goods and services we fixed some of the economic sins of the past and had the longest economic and job expansion in history before covid 19 created a brief recession we recovered from that recession quickly when so many people said we would be in a depression after that event some of those factors that convinced me that we would recover in 2020 are still here the last time i had all six of my recession red flags was late in 2006 and we had a massive consumer credit bubble brewing that set up the great financial recession but we don t have that this time yes history isn t on our side but sometimes we create our history as we did with america is back economic recovery model with some help on the supply side we can have shelter inflation go down because the best way to fight inflation is to create more supply not by destroying demand we have to remember that we have over 900 000 plus two unit housing under construction that should get online next year which will help with rental inflation then we need the federal reserve to get off the grinch of christmas theme of causing more pain for americans by jacking up rates and having banks earn more money on their credit card interest charges if long bond yields fall mortgage rates will fall with them like it has since 1971 if that happens and mortgage rates can get toward 5 then the housing market can find some stabilization and the bleeding can stop so we do have a way to avoid a recession and even though history isn t on our side at this stage of the economic expansion we can connect the dots here and chart a path that avoids more pain
few things will try your patience the way a stripped screw or bolt can it seems almost axiomatic the closer you get to completing a project the more likely you will be to run into one or for that matter it can seem like before you can even get up some momentum disaster strikes when the first screw or bolt strips or its head flies off you may behead a bolt so violently in trying to remove the thing you may go flying too and then you re left wondering how to remove that stripped screw or bolt you might be laughing when you read this but surely you weren t the last time this happened to you and it will happen again reach for the proper extracting tools and set about the methodical work of removing the stripped screw or bolt getting the upper hand in these situations is satisfying you can get so good at it you almost look forward to the challenge here s how the basics in the simplest terms there are two ways to deal with a stripped screw and it all depends on whether its head is above the surface of the material into which it s driven if it is and you can get a grip on it then you opt for an external removal method either grip the screw or bolt head with a pair of locking pliers or use a socket specifically designed for extraction twist the thing out and you re done if the head of the screw is set deep if the fastener s head has snapped off or if the head is so severely rounded that not even locking pliers can grip it you ll have to employ an internal removal process you drill into the damaged fastener and go from there we explain all this in greater detail below but first here are some of the best tools for the delicate and not so delicate work of removing stripped screws great extracting tools locking pliers locking pliers with twist ring tapered straight flute hammer in extractor set square drive bit for small wood screws square drive bit for small wood screws ball peen hammer high speed cobalt alloy twist drills center finding drill bits bolt extractor sockets drift pin set how to remove stripped screws with exposed heads if you can grip the screw head or bolt do so with a pair of locking pliers our preferred pliers are these by malco these u s made pliers provide a ferocious grip on whatever you lock onto another good choice is insert a stout screwdriver through the twist ring in the handle of the pliers and turn to produce tremendous locking force roy berendsohn for removing small but stubborn bolts if you need a little extra torque slip a piece of 3 4 inch black pipe over the top handle of the locking pliers note this method can wreck the pliers and could get you hurt reserve it for small bolts where a little extra turning force is required to remove the fastener in some cases external removal is as simple as that lock on with some pliers and twist off in other cases you ll need to give the stubborn fastener s threads a good soaking with a penetrating lubricant of some kind like for bolts that are too severely rounded or are too stuck to turn them out with locking pliers use a set of sockets like the ones below specially designed to bite into stripped bolt heads open gallery how to remove stripped screws with embedded heads if you can t grab the outside of the screw with pliers you ll need this more involved solution for small screws and bolts the solution is pretty easy specialty drill bits like the are made to deal with screws in which the drive slot has been stripped out or gouged open you chuck this accessory in a cordless drill press it firmly into the damaged opening and run the drill slowly in reverse to back the screw out of the hole other accessories work differently some double end bits such as the have a specially designed drill on one end and an extractor on the other drill into the damaged fastener stop the drill remove the bit and flip it end for end then use the extractor end of the bit with the drill in reverse to back the fastener out of the hole roy berendsohn the spin it out screw extractor has serrated tips that dig into what remains of the stripped out fastener head chucked into a drill set in reverse it will back the fastener out of its hole now here s what the manufacturers of these products don t tell you they rely on the bite of their peculiar thread this may work perfectly but in other cases the extractor will simply ream the fastener out leaving you worse off than you were before an alternative old school method is to use a to use it you make a carefully drilled hole in the center of the snapped off screw or what s left of the bolt head tap in the extractor using a ball peen hammer and then twist the extractor out counter clockwise using an adjustable wrench note that the taper of the extractor can expand the screw or bolt so don t pound the extractor into the hole a few deft shots with the hammer will make it seat an alternative to this tool that doesn t expand the fastener and works better in gripping out fasteners made from brass and aluminum is a it works the same way drill the center hole in the broken fastener and tap in the extractor when you feel it bite stop and turn the extractor counterclockwise with a tap wrench or an adjustable wrench open gallery other tips and tricks some years ago i was repairing a storm door that got torn off in a blizzard and didn t have my screw extractors with me to remove some snapped off screws i drilled a hole in each and then tapped a square drive bit in the hole and then backed the screws out like nobody s business the same and r2 sizes that you use for square drive screws work well for this purpose drilling out the snapped shank of a broken screw or bolt can be a tricky business if the end of the end of the fastener snaps clean and flush with its surroundings use a struck with a hammer to make the starting indentation to help you seat a drill bit in the center of the body of the snapped off fastener for small diameter fasteners where the snapped off diameter is something like ¼ to 3 8 inch it can be even more difficult to start a twist drill in its center and that s true even after you ve used a center punch to make a starting indent in these cases consider using a to make a small countersunk hole in the snapped off shaft of the fastener and then follow that starter hole with a full length to make the hole into which you will tap the extractor either type of screw extractor spiral shank or straight flute in rare instances when you have complete access to the top of the snapped off fastener and can clamp a drill guide in position that s a great option we re particularly fond of the that works on both flat and round stock it can be a lifesaver when you need an extra measure of accuracy in drilling a hole roy berendsohn the big gator drill guide works on both flat and round stock because it has a v shaped bottom surface in the rare instances where access allows you to use a drill guide to drill out a broken bolt clamp the guide over the bolt so that the drill hole is centered on the broken fastener
