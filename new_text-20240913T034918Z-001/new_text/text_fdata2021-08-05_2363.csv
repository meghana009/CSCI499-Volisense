municipals were mixed in secondary trading after u s treasuries dipped to lows not seen since the beginning of the year but rose as the afternoon progressed on mixed economic news new issues fared well and another week of 2 billion plus inflows were reported bringing the total to nearly 60 billion for 2021 triple a benchmarks were little changed to firmer in spots on the short end after the up and down ust ride some rather hawkish comments made by fed vice chairman richard clarida generated selling pressure throughout much of the treasury curve with munis holding steady throughout most of the tax exempt curve said jeffrey lipton managing director of municipal credit at oppenheimer co the institutional need to get invested means municipals are in demand with some sacrifice over structure and credit quality especially given current seasonal conditions as new issue supply cannot fill the demand void left by maturing securities bond redemptions and coupon payments he said while retail investors have been displaying some resistance given frothy bond prices and a relatively greater degree of luxury to be more discerning when it comes to the search for value it would seem that the largest outlet for the asset class is signaling that all that really matters is that municipal bond mutual fund flows have now been positive for 21 consecutive weeks lipton said against this backdrop the new issue market remains strong with sufficient investment outlets as money gets put to work the investment company institute reported another week of inflows 2 639 billion for the week ending july 28 up from 1 881 billion the week prior the fund complex hit its 21st consecutive week of inflows exchange traded funds saw 623 million of inflows versus 458 million the week before total assets held now total 59 94 billion year to date according to ici there is so much cash that has been coming into muni funds over the past two months people just need to put the money to work said howard mackey managing director at nw financial group llc in hoboken new jersey bond buyer data shows 30 day visible supply at 6 45 billion and with most participants expecting up to 70 billion of investible cash the scarce supply should have a fairly good impact on demand going forward he said munis in general are doing very well in the first 12 to 15 years mackey said there is a lot of demand in that part of the curve and we have seen mmd post some significant gains and lower yields over the past couple of weeks i think combined with the strong inflows that particular trend is going to continue he added while munis are still outperforming year to date the performance spread to ust continues to narrow oppenheimer s lipton noted if it were not for compelling seasonal technicals highlighted by strong product demand we suspect that munis would be underperforming ust by a wider margin he said mackey said while the ratio of municipals to treasuries is stable it could still be a little rich for some investors taste some large arbitrage firms have come into the market and passed on tax exempts because of the rich ratios he said with munis quite rich to treasuries this is toward the richer part of that relationship mackey said it hasn t seemed to hurt munis but it has kept some buyers away from munis municipal to ust ratios were little changed ice data services showed the 10 year muni ust ratio at 71 and the 30 year at 74 refinitiv mmd had ratios at 70 in 10 years and 75 in 30 meanwhile other conservative investors are trying to guard their portfolios and position themselves for future market movement he noted some investment management funds tend to be more conservative they will buy on the shorter end of the curve because if and when we get a reversal the shorter the duration the better your defense in terms of a down market mackey said there is a noticeable demand for higher coupon bonds with 4 to 5 coupons he added because they are defensive in a down market once the market reverses the impact won t be as great on their portfolios as opposed to buying lower coupon par bonds mackey said in the primary the new york city transitional finance

additional strong months of gains are needed for the federal reserve to be comfortable announcing a tapering of its asset purchases wednesday s news could signal trouble missing expectations 330 000 jobs were added in the private sector in july according to adp and the june number was revised down to a 680 000 increase from the initially reported 692 000 gain economists polled by ifr markets expected 700 000 jobs added adp s july reading showed a clear deceleration in the pace of job growth relative to june said wilmington trust chief economist luke tilley and senior economist rhea thomas they expect friday s employment report will show 350 000 jobs added in july well below the 900 000 predicted by economists polled by ifr labor supply remains very tight posing challenges to firms efforts to increase staff they said the acceleration in cases and headlines due to the delta variant of covid 19 arose mostly after the cutoff data for this jobs report so is not likely to have an impact this month but it poses a risk in the august figures the big miss with the adp raised concerns that the delta variant is having a bigger impact on the economy said ed moya senior market analyst for the americas at oanda the labor market recovery is extremely uneven and suggests the economy continues to struggle in matching individuals up with the current job vacancies but moya said seasonal factors could come into play so investors should not be stunned if the private payrolls portion of the nfp report does come near the 718 000 estimate and the expiration of the added unemployment benefits which has occurred in almost half the states will not be an immediate panacea for labor shortages tilley and thomas said despite unemployment insurance claims slowing notably in states with an early curtailment of benefits today s data suggests that it may take time for workers to find jobs even after their benefits expire concerns about the virus particularly with the delta variant and caregiving issues may also keep the pace of job growth moderate particularly as demand in service industries like leisure and hospitality may moderate as we move into fall and winter months respondents to the institute for supply management services survey mentioned in comments that labor issues remain although the index set a record in july despite the record 64 1 reading price pressures and shortages remain challenges for businesses new orders production and employment all strengthened as did costs said david donabedian cio of cibc private wealth management the report is indicative of broad strength in the economy with all 17 industries surveyed reporting growth in july the index was 60 1 in june and economists projected a 60 4 read the business activity production index rose to 67 0 from 60 4 while the employment index gained to 53 8 from 49 3 and prices grew to 82 3 from 79 5 this report supports a taper announcement at jackson hole said oanda s moya which

it s beginning to look a lot like christmas just kidding no it isn t but that picture up above is a rude reminder that yes it s on the way eventually as we reported just a few weeks ago this winter is already being predicted as potentially very brutal you can read more about those long term forecast predictions here as we look forward to whatever kind of a winter we will have just the thought of snow cools me off during this hot summer day a little ice on the roads is inevitable and that means our safety is in jeopardy who steps up the ada county highway district it has been announced that instead of dropping that bright blue salt to treat icy roads with a regular white salt so what s the deal with the blue salt believe it or not it s only colored blue so that both crews and the public would be able to tell which roads had been treated while the dye was well intentioned it was doing nothing good for the environment since 2015 achd has used this blue dyed salt and it has recently come to their attention that two components in this dye can harm waterways plain white salt will be used however some with the blue dye remains in stock you may see this stuff around town until they re out of it but you won t see it near the boise river or in the foothills out of an abundance of caution snowmageddon 2017 it was the winter that we ll never forget in the treasure valley scroll down to see these freezing cold photos idaho changes from space
gerard mildner is the academic director at the portland state university center for real estate below he gives his opinions on inclusionary zoning urban growth boundaries and more this email interview from july has been edited statistics were drawn from sources including the federal government s website for permitting data census data metro and a 2014 study for holland development according to mildner you recently noted how building permits were down from 2019 to 2020 in the four county region citing federal data tell me about the numbers and why you think they re down between 1990 and 2007 the four county region produced 14 332 housing unit permits per year those numbers fell by two thirds during the great recession but even well after that the numbers for 2011 20 were only 12 117 units per year a decline of 15 despite the fact that our region is larger today and home prices and rents have fully recovered hence we had a huge deficit from the great recession and no boom thereafter this suggests a land supply constraint such as the urban growth boundary as most of the decline happened in single family homes in the last year housing permits declined by 22 with all of that decline happening in multi family construction inside the city of portland housing permits in the city fell by 65 in one year that s almost certainly the result of portland s 2017 inclusionary zoning rules which force developers of projects of 20 units or more to offer subsidized housing units for 99 years while their city s incentives last only 10 years developers completed apartment projects that were in the pipeline before inclusionary zoning and the pipeline dried up you ve called out barriers for new construction what are those barriers the two biggest issues are the urban growth boundary and inclusionary zoning but there are issues related to eviction procedures rent control tenant screening and relocation fees that depress investor interest and reduce housing supply on the ugb oregon s land use planning rules have been abused over the last 40 years with local officials finding every excuse not to expand metro s urban growth boundary they are required to demonstrate a 20 year land supply and do so by promising high density development in the suburbs that will not happen in the 1990s the argument was made that we should build up rather than build out treating the issue as a design or aesthetic issue however the hidden cost in that choice is that higher density costs more building a typical 5 story apartment with 4 stories of wood construction over a concrete podium costs roughly 50 more per square foot than a 2 story wood frame apartment going taller requires steel and concrete construction which costs an additional 50 more per square foot since 1980 the population of our three county region has increased by 74 while the urban growth boundary has been expanded by only 15 beyond the ugb land prices fall by a factor of 10 to 20 suggesting that our allocation of that land for grass seeds strawberries and hazelnuts rather than housing is a mis allocation of resources fundamentally we are a region that attracts a lot of californians and other in migrants to bring a lot of equity to the homebuying market if we aren t building the next bethany forest heights villebois or river terrace they will bid up the prices of existing homes expand gerard mildner is the academic director of the center for real estate at portland state university keene studio you ve opposed the city s inclusionary zoning policy why isn t it working in your estimation is this a case of a well intentioned policy going awry and if so what should city leaders do to address the problem inclusionary zoning places the burden of building subsidized housing on new development relying upon the broken theory that new housing somehow caused rents to rise new housing is expensive but that s because the product is new and higher quality than the existing stock social welfare programs like subsidized housing should be funded by the general funds of state and local government not a tax on new housing development in fact new housing adds to supply which moderates price and rent increases some communities implement inclusionary zoning on a voluntary basis which ensures that the incentives are sufficient to encourage developers to include subsidized units that s something the city could implement tomorrow however i m skeptical that the city council can admit they made a mistake which makes me think the legislature needs to intervene the legislature gave municipalities the power to implement inclusionary zoning in 2016 and we now have four years of evidence to show that the city of portland isn t a responsible guardian of those powers no other city in the state implemented the policy business journal readers know that housing prices in oregon have continued to rise throughout the pandemic do you see them tapering anytime soon or no why the only short term policy that will reduce housing prices is the federal reserve raising interest rates they are considering tapering off their purchases of bonds which would have that effect beyond that it s important to note that inflationary expectations play a role in housing demand if buyers think that prices will rise by 10 in the upcoming year that reduces the cost of their home purchase hence if the state and local government show a credible policy to boost housing production that could moderate demand at the same time it takes 3 4 years between the conception of a real estate development to actual units on the ground that s why it s so critical to move the region s urban reserves inside the ugb give grants to local governments to build new arterial roads and water and sewer lines and help cities and developers plan new communities hence we need a sustained policy to promote housing development unfortunately most legislators and municipal officials only see housing policy as a discussion of how to squeeze more subsidized housing units from the development community no one is taking responsibility for the lack of housing production what s your outlook for the next year in housing in portland where do we go from here the pandemic has exposed the weakness of a housing policy focused on density and multi family apartments consumers are looking for spare bedrooms and home offices which has reduced the demand for small downtown apartments and boosted the demand for single family homes that shows up in the latest report by rmls the inventory of single family homes has shrunk from 2 3 months to 0 7 months of supply larger homes will tend to cost less per square foot on a quality adjusted basis in the suburbs so i would expect demand to rise greatest there i would also expect more demand in distant communities like camas ridgefield north plains canby woodburn newberg hood river and salem for example the average home price in salem is about 25 less than that in the portland metro area the question is the housing price savings worth the commute however if working at home becomes more common and workers are going to the office only two or three days per week then a longer commute becomes more tolerable particularly if that saves on housing costs and allows the household to have more space note that this is a long run effect most homeowners stay in their house for seven to 10 years so they need to be convinced that their current work environment and work rules will remain in place for an extended period

i will turn the call over to blake to discuss the results blake fernandez senior vice president of investor relations and market intelligence thanks reuven in our pipelines and transportation segment the second quarter contribution margin was 45 million compared to 43 million in the second quarter of last this increase was primarily attributable to the dropdown of the trucking assets dropped on may 1st 2020 and paline pipeline performance in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment the contribution margin was 19 million in the second quarter of this year compared to 19 million in the second quarter of last year during the second quarter of 2021 equity income from our crude oil joint venture pipelines was approximately 7 million which was flat with the prior year period capital expenditures were approximately 2 6 million in the second quarter which consisted of 1 5 million of discretionary spending and 1 1 million of sustaining maintenance for full year 2021 our total gross capital expenditure forecast is 29 million which includes 8 4 million of discretionary and 11 1 million of maintenance capital with that i will turn the call over to uzi for his closing comments uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer thank you blake and good morning everybody we witnessed a strong sequential increase in performance in the second quarter based on the lack of winter weather impact lower turnaround activity and no maintenance of the paline pipeline that occurred in the first quarter we successfully raised 400 million of debt to a senior note offering creating flexibility and extending our maturities we continue our long history of distribution growth with a third 33rd consecutive increase and we remain committed to delivering a 5 increase on the full year basis our distribution coverage and leverage ratios remain healthy and that was positive delek has no major maintenance plan for the rest of the year with that operator can you please open the call for questions questions answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question comes from spiro dounis of credit suisse please go ahead spiro dounis credit suisse analyst hey morning guys uzi first one for you i was hoping to hear your thoughts on the macro set up here into the back half of the year it seems like a lot of green shoots out there and energy of course with the exception of the delta variant driving some lockdowns overseas i didn t believe in before that even always been kind of bit cautious on demand and the rebound there in 21 i think you saw it more of a 2022 story so just curious that more or less materializing kind of like how you expected really just any thoughts of that set up for gmp and downstream in the second half would be great uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer yeah good morning spiro thanks again for your interest you asked several questions let me try to answer each one of them and if i did a poor job just push back and ask for more info spiro dounis credit suisse analyst you bet uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer these are the demand situation we i have not changed my mind we have not changed our mind and we think that demand situation will get back to normality only in 2022 i don t know that the delta variant is a big factor here i don t know it may be but at this point i see it being contained for the time being i think that israel is already giving third vaccine we ll see how it works so i think the rebound the big rebound is being expected toward the end of this year 21 and 22 i do think that 22 will be as we said in the past very very strong year probably the strongest we ve seen just because of the fact that people will get tired after being at home for almost two years i think employers ceos are anxious to see their employees back to the office and i do believe that that would happen so the demand situation is getting there we see the demand we re what 5 to 7 below 2019 i think we will get back to normality toward the end of this year and early next year you are asking about the activities in the energy sector we also the acquisition of or the merger of hfc and sinclair i think that there will be more and more merger and acquisitions energy sector is ripe for changes i must say that everybody talks about energy transformation i think that we re a little bit too fast to come to conclusions that fossil fuels is out of the picture i think we have many years ahead of us obviously with the changing market carbon capture as well as esg but i still drove my car here to the office this morning and i don t think i that would change over the next five years last you asked about our situation we haven t changed our mind much we still have the organic growth that we mentioned the slurry project the red river that came to fruition the paline situation that is getting there obviously west texas with the wins and toward the end of next year 2022 we need to look carefully at dropping down wink to webster i think i hope i answered every question that you had spiro dounis credit suisse analyst yeah no no you d be able to appreciate it as the great color and so your last comment that time to my next question which is on these growth projects i think you said that you d want to complete a lot of your organic growth that you ve got going on out there just before dropping down krotz springs sounds like wink to webster to your point is is kind of a next year event but just curious where we re at in terms of timing between completing some of these growth projects organically before moving on to krotz springs uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer well krotz springs is a different thing we ll discuss it later on today but with the supreme court decision of growth is at the top of the list if you will even with the administration to grant we ve been granted the exemption at krotz then krotz is certainly a very good refinery and then we should consider carefully dropping down the assets of krotz and of course then i mentioned the wink to webster and other maybe organic or inorganic projects as we look forward to an improving market spiro dounis credit suisse analyst perfect that s all i have today guys thank you uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer thank you spiro operator there are no other questions at this time this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to uzi yemin for closing remarks uzi yemin chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you i d like to thank everybody around the table for being such great colleagues i d like to thank you investors for your trust in us you

who are willing to work invest and live in hong kong washington while chanting the slogan of stand with hong kong people has in fact engaged in actions against the national security law in hong kong and imposing the so called sanctions such self contradictory behaviour exposed its hypocrisy and despicableness photo taken on may 28 2021 shows the u s capitol building behind a traffic sign in washington d c the united states u s senate republicans on friday blocked legislation to establish an independent commission to investigate the deadly jan 6 capitol riot xinhua liu jie part 8 on june 25 the white house put out on its website a statement regarding the closing down of hong kong s apple daily in which it falsely accused china of suppressing press freedom the apple daily under the cloak of a media outlet had long engaged in illegal acts of harming the country and destabilizing hong kong seriously violating the journalistic ethics and jeopardizing the media environment of hong kong the newspaper had long been engaged in concocting fake news to mislead the public during the turbulence over proposed ordinance amendments in hong kong in 2019 the newspaper produced a flurry of fake news and peddled wrong values to perplex the public disseminate anti police and anti china remarks and instigate black violence hong kong is a society governed by rule of law and everyone is equal before the law no one has extra legal privileges and no institution is an extra legal entity hong kong police act against individuals and companies suspected of endangering national security in strict accordance with the law and their actions are a just move to crack down on crimes and maintain the rule of law and social order those who describe moves on an individual news organization and on those in charge of an individual news organization as acts to crack down on press freedom have ulterior motives and are seeking to talk black into white it is the united states which has brutally suppressed the media and restricted press freedom analyses by the guardian and netherlands based investigative journalism website bellingcat showed from may 26 2020 to june 2 2020 alone there were 148 arrests or attacks on journalists covering protests ignited by the killing of george floyd among which 34 instances involved officers physically assaulting journalists and 33 instances involved journalists being arrested or detained a female photojournalist was left blinded in the left eye by a police projectile during one of the protests in 2021 the u s government forcibly shut down more than 30 foreign news media websites german writer michael lueders has revealed in his new book the hypocritical superpower that the u s government and its interest groups are apt at influencing and shaping public opinion by selecting information and polarizing public views so that people are brainwashed without any realization washington s repeated provocations in this respect reveal that it is in fact a mastermind of troubles and a public opinion manipulator in fact the press freedom in hong kong has not been damaged but has been consolidated at present there are 93 local 69 overseas and 39 online media organizations registered with the government respectively showing increases from a year ago the press and the general public exercise the right of supervision every day and enjoy the freedom to criticize the administration of the hksar government there is no obstruction for overseas media to interview people with different positions part 9 on july 7 the white house announced the extension of the so called national emergency with respect to hong kong and of relevant hong kong related sanctions for one year and continued with the cancellation of preferential treatment for hong kong the so called national emergency with respect to hong kong a measure announced by former u s president donald trump s administration on july 14 2020 is a gross interference in china s internal affairs the extension of the so called national emergency also marked the first time that joe biden since taking office as u s president continued with trump s thinking on hong kong from the perspective of policy implementation and once again publicly intervened in hong kong affairs which are china s internal affairs such an act seriously undermined china s sovereignty security and development interests hong kong residents celebrate the passage of the law of the people s republic of china on safeguarding national security in the hong kong special administrative region hksar in causeway bay of south china s hong kong june 30 2020 xinhua wang shen hong kong had always been an excuse for washington to put pressure on beijing during the trump administration at the end of june 2020 the law on safeguarding national security in hksar was promulgated and implemented trump then signed an executive order declaring that the united states immediately entered a national emergency on the grounds that the situation in hong kong would pose a threat to the national security economy and foreign policy of the united states at the same time the country also ended its special treatment for hong kong previously hong kong enjoyed treatment that many cities in the chinese mainland did not have mainly in immigration import and export control tourism and economy the biden administration followed the trump administration s wrong acts on hong kong extending the so called national emergency and continued with its outrageous sanctions against china sanctions on hong kong however will surely backfire and bite the united states official data released by china last year showed that there were around 85 000 u s citizens and more than 1 300 u s enterprises in hong kong including almost all of america s major financial firms over the years the united states has gained a huge trade surplus from its trade with hong kong and its interests in hong kong have been deep and direct sanctions will bring complexities to u s enterprises in hong kong subjecting their normal operations to political risks in as early as 2020 there was wide condemnation around the world against the so called sanctions imposed on hong kong by countries such as the united states chester humphrey president of the senate of grenada pointed out that the united states just wanted to divert the attention of the american people from domestic problems and that its sanctions against other countries were illegal patricio giusto director of the sino argentine observatory said that the so called sanctions will not pose a substantial threat and have no legal basis which once again exposed the double standards of u s politicians standing with hong kong on one hand and relentlessly sticking to sanctioning it on the other is the absurd logic of u s politicians and a logic that no one including hong kong people can understand part 10 on july 10 the u s department of state posted a statement issued by 21 members of the so called media freedom coalition on its website expressing strong concerns about the judicial organs of the hksar handling the case of apple daily according to law and falsely claiming that the use of the national security law to suppress journalism is a serious and negative step freedom is not laissez faire scientific rationality legal order and international rules are the foundation of freedom as montesquieu said in the spirit of law liberty is the right to do what the law permits any freedom has boundaries even the so called free countries have also defined clear forbidden zones and restrictions for freedom and it is never allowed to break through the bottom line of the legal system the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic said u s justice oliver wendell holmes in a judgement in 1919 constitutions of over 100 countries in the world stipulate that the exercise of basic rights and freedoms must not endanger national security the international covenant on civil and political rights clarifies that the rights to freedom of belief expression peaceful assembly and public trial must be subject to necessary restrictions on grounds of national security public order public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others the european convention on human rights has similar provisions the united states britain canada australia and other countries have also established strict legal systems to safeguard national security and have no mercy in cracking down on criminal acts endangering national security in the united states although the first amendment to the constitution stipulates that freedom of speech and press should be ensured the country still set up state agencies that conduct oversight over on the media the federal communications commission is responsible for issuing licenses to radio and television stations in the united states and imposes basic restrictions on program content the u s supreme court has also said that speech that directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action is not protected in germany denial of the holocaust and other forms of incitement to hatred against certain ethnic groups are punishable by up to five years in prison in august 2018 the german federal constitutional court said in a ruling that punishing the denial of nazi genocide is fundamentally in line with the constitutional provisions on freedom of speech in france the current law on the freedom of the press clearly stipulates that damaging the basic interests of the country abetting crimes slandering and insulting and spreading false news through the media are all illegal and criminal acts and must be punished penalties include fines imprisonment and confiscation of publications jimmy lai chee ying is taken by the police to the headquarters of apple daily for investigation in hong kong south china aug 10 2020 xinhua lui siu wai hong kong police arrested and prosecuted apple daily and its personnel and froze related properties for colluding with external forces and jeopardizing national security these actions are a necessary and legitimate move to safeguard the rule of law in hong kong and has nothing to do with protecting freedom of speech and the press the united states gathered some members of the so called media freedom coalition to beautify and excuse the anti china and destabilizing hong kong media outlets and their employees in an attempt to put pressure on china its actions seriously desecrated the spirit of law and seriously violated the conscience of the media apple daily is also a mirror which not only reflects the ending of the anti china and destabilizing hong kong forces but also clearly reflects the double standards of the u s side in dealing with the hong kong issue we would like to ask are hong kong people willing to stand with such politicians and governments part 11 on july 16 as a bid to smear hong kong s business environment the u s government issued a so called business advisory to caution u s businesses about emerging risks to their operations and activities in hong kong meanwhile washington imposed sanctions on seven officials of the liaison office of the central people s government in the hksar the u s advisory which attempts to discredit the national security law in hong kong while stating that hong kong is still a popular investment and trade location for the united states and that it provides competitive financial trade and professional services is self contradictory and illogical investors moves are an important indicator of hong kong s business environment more than a year after the implementation of the national security law the initial public offering funds raised in hong kong exceeded 500 billion hong kong dollars 64 35 billion u s dollars representing an increase of more than 50 percent year on year total deposits in hong kong banks rose by over 5 percent from a year ago the american chamber of commerce in hong kong said that the city has a crucial role to play as an international business hub and that it remains a critical and vibrant facilitator of trade and financial flow between the east and west jim thompson chairman and founder of logistics company crown worldwide group said the u s administration is making it harder for american investors to do business in the city which is like putting handcuffs on them this is so sad experts and scholars believe that the so called business advisory from the u s government will not affect corporate decisions while the united states regularly issues similar warnings businesses make their own judgements the enterprises did not withdraw from hong kong even when black clad rioters were running wild in the city and they are less likely to do so now as hong kong s social order has been restored and the city s development has been back on track under the protection of the national security law the stepped up sanctions by the united states have already backfired and bitten the country itself u s trade surplus with hong kong totaled 297 billion dollars from 2009 to 2018 when the sanctions were imposed u s trade and finance were the first to take a hit in a foreign affairs article published mid july former u s consul general in hong kong kurt w tong wrote that the u s treasury department knows sanctions on major chinese banks could trigger significant instability in the international payment system by interrupting the huge volume of financial transactions between the world s two largest economies which would in turn harm u s financial markets and the perceived reliability of the u s centric global payments system when even the american people are unwilling to stand with their own government the lie of u s politicians that they stand with the people of hong kong naturally falls apart conclusion u s politicians have been constantly claiming to defend hong kong s human rights and freedom and stand with the people of hong kong but actions speak louder than words all their slogans have proved to be nothing but lies all chinese people including people in hong kong have already clearly seen what these politicians are defending is not the hong kong people s human rights and freedom but the freedom of a handful of rioters to disrupt hong kong s stability and endanger china s national security and the freedom of these politicians to continue interfering in hong kong s affairs and containing china radical protesters attack police officers in tsuen wan in the western new territories of south china s hong kong aug 25 2019 xinhua under the pretext of democracy and human rights these politicians have been offering real endorsements for the rioters which fully exposes the double standards of these u s politicians they condemned the capitol riot with utmost rage but nevertheless called similar acts in hong kong a beautiful sight to behold they have enacted the world s most thorough national security law at home but nevertheless tried to smear china s parallel efforts to plug the security hole in hong kong in the name of press freedom they are interfering with and undermining the rule of law in hong kong amid the closure of apple daily those u s politicians fully exposed their tricks to smear others they tried to turn some media organizations into extra legal entities for anti china forces to disrupt hong kong and contain china by making waves on hong kong issues the u s side has revealed itself as the black hand in stirring up opposition and controlling public opinion the so called press freedom is nothing but a fig leaf for their self interests they twisted facts deliberately smeared the rule of law in hong kong and grossly interfered in china s internal affairs patriots administering hong kong is the trend of the times and the aspiration of the hong kong people improving hong kong s electoral system is necessary for the sustained and healthy development of hong kong s democratic system when peace and stability were finally restored in hong kong and the rights and freedoms of hong kong citizens were better protected in a secure environment the united states leveled accusations and attacked hong kong s efforts to improve its electoral system and continued to demonize the national security law in hong kong which fully exposes washington s hegemonic nature while habitually bullying others and wielding the big stick of sanctions those u s politicians have in fact exhausted their tactics for them only a chaotic hong kong serves their interests the more stable hong kong is the more anxious they will be and now their agents were arrested their plans for disturbing the city have failed no matter how much pressure or how many rounds of sanctions the united states can impose they will be nothing but waste paper all in all some u s politicians concern about hong kong s democracy is a sham their true intention is to meddle in hong kong s politics and china s internal affairs their real purpose is to use hong kong as a tool to realize their political interests and contain china s development the so called standing with the hong kong people is nothing but a cover to deceive the world and reflects the hypocrisy of the u s politicians what they are doing is to make enemies with the hong kong people those politicians are advised to stop repeating these cliches in 1840 britain opened the door of china with ships and guns and hong kong was gradually occupied by britain for more than 100 years since then the chinese people have waged indomitable struggles for national liberation national independence and social progress today the chinese nation has made a great leap from standing up getting prosperous to becoming strong and their effort to realize the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process china has become an important force in safeguarding world peace and promoting common development and its relations with the rest of the world have undergone tremendous changes with the implementation of a series of effective measures including the national security law hong kong s social order has been restored its development has returned to the right track and the city has opened a new chapter with good governance hong kong is getting more stable and prosperous with a better implementation of the one country two systems principle this is the strongest response to those u s politicians who slander beijing s hong kong policy no one can stop hong kong from reclaiming its glorious past the chinese people will never allow any foreign force to bully oppress or enslave them and the cause of one country two systems will never be obstructed or undermined by any external force anyone who would attempt to do so will find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel forged by over 1 4 billion chinese people history has proved countless times that the final victory will always belong to the indomitable chinese people
the defense department is hoping that space based synthetic aperture radar or sar could help the united states and allies keep track of illegal fishing all over the globe later this month the defense innovation unit will launch a 150 000 contest for solutions and tools that use satellite based synthetic aperture radar to identify vessels that may be fishing illegally illegal fishing is a national security problem as one commenter argued a few months ago in defense one the stability of countries and regions are threatened by the declining health of fish stocks and by the groups and governments that run lawless fishing fleets the long range fishing fleet that china has is one of the principal perpetrators of fishing particularly in africa where i focused on it rear adm heidi berg said on wednesday at the navy league s sea air space conference berg who was formerly the director of intelligence for u s africa command is now u s cyber command director of plans and policy when chinese fishing vessels operate in places like africa s eastern or western coasts chinese military ships often accompany them china will also engender corruption said berg they continue to act to support authoritarian regimes that ensure their continued access to waters where they work illegally this devastates the economies of these organizations particularly when you look at western africa berg pointed to the importance of coastal industries and fishing in the economies of western african nations china deliberately targets places that are challenged by weak institutions poor governance poor rule of law she said sar data may be particularly well suited for what is a very big technical challenge unlike other space based cameras sar can collect data at night and when there s cloud cover unlike automatic identification system data it can t be spoofed and does not rely on data provided by a ship you re trying to keep tabs on but sar data doesn t easily lend itself to surveying the entire ocean for specific types of ships labeled sar datasets of the size and quality to build machine learning models that can identify and characterize vessels in ways that are useful for the iuu fishing are very hard to come by jared dunnmon the technical director of artificial intelligence at the defense innovation unit said wednesday it takes a lot of domain expertise not only to pre process the data and to understand how to work with sar but also because the domain expertise needed to label it is not easy to come by so that limits the ability of some of the best folks in the world from say the computer vision community where i come from to meaningfully contribute to that problem dunnmon says that the amount of space based sar data similar to space based camera imagery a few years ago is also set to explode as the costs and barriers to launching satellites continue to fall in the next couple of years we expect to see more and more space based sar data to the point where we can get rapid re visit to most parts of the world and that s a game changer he said if we cover that trend with automated algorithms that can rapidly analyze that data at scale to even just detect vessels much less characterize them then not only could they better track illegal fishing but they might also be able to much better monitor the entire ocean in a way that was never before possible

on july 14 2021 the us securities and exchange commission sec or commission announced settled charges against blotics ltd f d b a coinschedule ltd coinschedule the uk based operator of coinschedule com a now defunct website that profiled offerings of digital assets 1 the sec charged coinschedule with violations of the anti touting provisions of section 17 b of the securities act of 1933 the securities act section 17 b makes it unlawful for any person to promote a security without disclosing that they received consideration for doing so or the amount of such consideration 2 although the sec has pursued anti touting charges against website operators in the past 3 this is the first time that the sec has brought anti touting charges against a website operator in the digital asset space prior anti touting actions in the digital asset space have been levied against individuals rather than website or platform operators 4 significantly commissioners hester peirce and elad roisman issued a public dissent to the order 5 the dissent takes issue with the order s failure to cite which digital assets listed on coinschedule com were securities and requests that the sec address the present lack of clarity with respect to the application of the federal securities laws to digital assets background according to the order coinschedule owned and operated a website that publicized over 2 500 different offerings of digital assets from 2016 to august 2019 coinschedule compiled background information and news about the offerings and the issuers developers and scored and ranked them based on different metrics and categories the information on coinschedule s website was accessible by us persons who made up a significant portion of the website s users during this period coinschedule primarily earned revenue from token issuers that paid to list their token offerings on the website coinschedule offered issuers tiered marketing packages where for higher fees issuers would receive greater publicity and more prominent placement on the website coinschedule also offered issuers extra services for additional compensation including introductions to digital asset trading platforms issuers and other persons could also purchase general advertising space on the website coinschedule claimed to perform due diligence on each of the offerings profiled on its website and rated each offering with a trust score letter grade based on a proprietary algorithm that determined the credibility of the offering and was published on coinschedule s website coinschedule also provided guidance to issuers that purchased marketing packages from it on how to increase their trust score coinschedule never disclosed to its website visitors the consideration it received from issuers to list profile or otherwise advertise their tokens the sec staff seemed to take particular issue with coinschedule providing a trust score and other services to issuers without sufficient disclosure to users noting coinschedule presented potential investors with seemingly independent profiles about token offerings when in fact they were bought and paid for by token issuers 6 the sec concluded that the tokens published on the website included digital asset securities and therefore coinschedule had violated the anti touting provisions of section 17 b of the securities act coinschedule was ordered to pay 43 000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a penalty of 154 434 key takeaways as further described below key takeaways from the order include 1 the call to action from commissioners peirce and roisman for the sec to update the murky regulatory status of digital assets 2 the use of the anti touting provisions to bring an action against coinschedule and 3 the sec s exercise of jurisdiction over non us persons 1 call to action from commissioners peirce and roisman as noted by commissioners peirce and roisman s dissent the order does not indicate which assets publicized on coinschedule com were securities instead the order summarily states without further analysis that he digital tokens publicized by coinschedule included those that were offered and sold as investment contracts which are securities pursuant to section 2 a 1 of the securities act 7 the dissent notes that providing clear insight outside of the enforcement context into the commission s investment contract determinations and analysis for digital assets would serve everyone well and that ne of the ways to help work through the issue might be to develop a safe harbor along the lines of that which commissioner peirce has proposed which would allow token offerings to occur subject to a set of tailored protections for token purchasers 8 the dissent further observes that in this void litigated and settled commission enforcement actions have become the go to source of guidance 9 2 the use of the anti touting provisions to bring action against coinschedule the order demonstrates that the sec will use all the tools at its disposal to pursue conduct it believes may violate the federal securities laws the decision by the sec to bring anti touting charges is notable because prior touting charges in the digital asset space have followed distinctly different fact patterns in particular the sec has previously brought charges against popular public figures who used their celebrity to publicize initial coin offerings icos without disclosing the compensation they received from issuers 10 as a result the application of anti touting violations in this instance to a website operator is a departure from previous enforcement actions in connection with a digital asset 3 extraterritorial scope of the sec s jurisdiction the extraterritorial scope of the order also serves as a useful reminder because coinschedule was based in the united kingdom not the united states while the internet can be a useful tool to access a wide user base it can also be used to bring foreign companies within the expansive scope of the sec s jurisdiction where a website is accessible to us persons the order specifically references that a significant portion of coinschedule platform s web traffic originated from the united states before measures were taken to deter and prevent united states persons from viewing its content this is not the first time that the sec has exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction with respect to digital assets in sec v telegram group inc et al the sec was granted a preliminary injunction to halt the delivery of grams a digital asset security to both us and non us investors because the intended resale of grams by non us investors into the secondary market could make them potentially accessible to us purchasers 11 firms operating outside the united states should therefore consider the ability of us persons to access their website or platform if they engage in conduct that could implicate us securities laws footnotes
regulatory clarity key to industry s healthy development in the previous column we introduced various forms of digital assets with a particular focus on security token offerings stos a new promising and regulated means of capital raising in this column we will analyze the global sto landscape and opportunities for its use in hong kong and the greater bay area gba global sto landscape stos regulatory compliant tokens that combine features of cryptocurrency and traditional stocks have replaced the unregulated frenze of icos and are expected to be a new fundraising channel for illiquid assets just in may this year crypto exchange inx completed the listing of inx limited the first sto registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec raising more than us 125 million meanwhile singapore based dbs bank issued a us 11 3 million digital bond to professional investors there are many examples of using technology to digitize existing securities such as stocks and bonds the table below listed a few notable ones increasing global regulatory clarity one of the biggest developments we are seeing in the global crypto space is the increase in regulatory clarity the developments in this space over the last couple of years have been remarkable below are some examples of recent legal and regulatory actions the securities and futures commission sfc issued a warning statement on july 16 2021 indicating its regulatory stance on virtual asset funds and exchanges the sfc was aware of binance s offering of trading services in stock tokens in a number of jurisdictions and was concerned that these services may also be offered to hong kong investors hence it made clear to investors that no binance entity is licensed or registered to conduct regulated activities in hong kong hong kong customs has arrested four suspects for allegedly laundering illegal funds through cryptocurrency marking the first arrests of this nature in the city authorities in china have escalated their campaign against cryptocurrencies arresting more than 1 100 people suspected of using digital assets to launder illegal funds and ordering mines in one of its western provinces to shut down in the west the commodity futures trading commission cftc has also initiated investigations on binance over concerns that it allows americans to trade regulated derivative products on its unregulated trading platform what is next for stos with increased global regulations the increased regulatory clarity has been welcomed by the community as regulatory clarity will manage out the bad apples and invite more institutional investors to enter the space professional investors are becoming more comfortable as the digital asset management industry matures alongside regulation regulation is key in unlocking the potential of digital assets and protecting investors so they can invest with trust and confidence something that unregulated exchanges fail to offer opportunities in hk and gba hong kong the de facto center for sto development in apac hong kong has one of the most established capital market infrastructures in the world with us 3 7 trillion assets under management 2019 data source hkma as well as an abundance of licensed financial advisors broker dealers and sponsors ready to serve security token issuers hong kong was ranked 5th in the global financial centres index gfci released by z yen group and the china development institute in september 2020 since the first of its semi annual ratings were published in march 2007 gfci has consistently ranked hong kong as one of the top international financial centres in asia with the introduction of clear regulatory frameworks the recent government promotion of the limited partnership fund lpf regime and hong kong s ongoing promotion as the asian hub for capital market we expect stos to benefit significantly in the next few years while mainland china has imposed stricter regulations on digital assets with a clear intention of limiting their growth hong kong has taken a more liberal approach by outlining a clear regulatory framework to upgrade the quality of issuers and protect investor rights and hopefully to become a hub for stos in the asia pacific as stos are very much still in the innovator early adopter stage of their development the supporting ecosystem plays an imperative role in determining their success in the next column we will explain the end to end process of completing an sto and how each ecosystem participant plays a role contact us at
new york ny tony tyler iata s director general and ceo spoke at the aviation day usa event in new york today hosted by the wings club and iata in his remarks he urged aviation stakeholders to work together to address key issues facing aviation ensuring the industry s continued economic viability development of infrastructure to keep up with rising demand for connectivity and meeting the industry s environmental commitments tyler cited the successful partnership on aviation safety as a template for how industry and governments should cooperate to address these challenges tony tyler s speech good morning it s always a pleasure to be back in new york one of the world s great cities and the center of the global financial community i d like to thank the wings club for joining with us to host this event and airlines for america for their strong support thanks are also owed to our generous sponsors without them events like this would not be possible i think it is fair to say that commercial aviation and new york each make a huge contribution to the other s success aviation provides the global connectivity that sustains new york s status as the hub of the financial world and a top tourist destination and new york is certainly among the most important destinations for the more than 80 airlines that serve the three major metropolitan airports thus this is an ideal location to host what i hope is the first of many aviation days looking around the room i m impressed by the breadth and depth of industry knowledge and by the diversity of aviation stakeholders represented here we have airlines airports equipment manufacturers air navigation service providers ansps regulators and the investment community we are connected through the shared conviction that aviation makes the world a better place and the strength of aviation lies in the working together approach we take to address industry challenges in fact partnerships and collaboration are in our collective dna perhaps that is because every single flight is the result of close cooperation between many different stakeholders including airlines airports ground service providers and ansps safety partnerships have been critical to our most successful achievement which is safety by working together we have made flying the safest form of long distance travel the world has ever known last week we released data on the industry s safety performance for 2015 the global accident rate was one major accident for every 3 1 million flights this was a 30 improvement compared to the previous five year rate of one major accident for every 2 2 million flights furthermore there were zero jet hull loss accidents that resulted in passenger fatalities in 2015 the four fatal hull loss accidents all involved turboprop equipment i must qualify this figure because two tragedies the loss of germanwings 9525 and metrojet 9268 are not included in the totals as they were deliberate events not accidents indeed 2015 is similar to 2014 in this regard if you look at the last two years the industry s safety performance has been affected primarily by events that could be classified as unthinkable in 2014 we had the disappearance of an aircraft with no obvious cause and another shot down over a conflict zone in 2015 the headlines focused on two terrible air disasters one in which a pilot deliberately took his own life and those of all on board and one in which the aircraft is believed to have been destroyed by an act of terrorism there are no simple solutions to the issues raised by these tragedies but the best way to honor those who lost their lives is by re dedicating ourselves to making flying even safer in that regard i am proud that iata participated in the aviation rulemaking committee created by the federal aviation administration faa on the subject of pilot mental and emotional health as well as on the task force on risks to civil aviation arising from conflict zones established by the international civil aviation organization icao these tragic and unexpected events have re emphasized that we must always be alert to emerging hazards to ensure that they are addressed before they become safety threats one example that is in the news almost every day is drones or as icao refers to them remotely piloted aircraft systems don t get me wrong as someone who has spent his entire adult life in aviation it s great to see aviation reach a new audience we are only beginning to discover the many potential commercial applications of this technology and it would be naïve to think that states and military forces will reduce their use of drones they are here to stay but we must not allow them to become a drag on the efficiency of the airways or a safety threat to commercial aviation of course the great majority of drone operators pose no risk but we do need a sensible approach to regulation and a pragmatic method of firm enforcement for those who disregard rules and regulations and put others in danger the issue is real we have plenty of pilot reports of drones where they were not expected particularly in the airport environment but also at altitude appropriately there is a lot of work being done in this area iata welcomes faa s activity and is supporting the know before you fly campaign to educate prospective users about the safe and responsible operation of drones and we are working closely with icao as well as stakeholders representing airports ansps and pilots to agree a common approach i am confident that by working together we can address the challenges posed by drones while benefiting from their tremendous potential other partnership opportunities i also believe we have the opportunity to apply this partnership approach to other challenges facing aviation including ensuring our continued economic viability infrastructure development the environment let s begin with our economic viability commercial aviation is growing because the value it has delivered has continued to increase over the 102 years of its existence globally the 3 8 billion people and 53 million tonnes of cargo that airlines will safely carry this year supports some 2 4 trillion in economic activity and some 58 million jobs in the united states the world s largest single air market aviation supports some 5 7 million jobs including tourism related employment and contributes some 562 billion to us gdp paradoxically it is no secret that for all the value we deliver airlines have always struggled to turn a healthy or sustainable profit for their investors with a lot of hard work and the confluence of some key factors this is changing we expect that airlines will deliver a 36 billion profit in 2016 for a 5 1 net margin while it s not close to the 23 net margin that apple delivered last year it is considered a strong result for our industry even more significantly airlines are starting to provide a normal return to their investors without whose support we cannot meet the forecast demand for air travel the average cost of capital is estimated at around 7 0 this year and for the second year in a row and only the second time in our history airlines collectively are set to deliver a return in excess of that 8 6 but i should also put some perspective on that profitability on a unit basis we are looking at airlines making less than 10 for each passenger carried spurred by the performance of us airlines the north america region is leading the industry in terms of profitability airlines in the us and canada are expected to earn some 19 2 billion in 2016 or roughly half the industry s global profit these profits represent the fruit of more than a decade of toil and sweat as well as financial restructuring consolidation has also played a role by allowing airline managements to implement significant efficiency programs and to get the economies of density from much more efficient networks this in turn concentrates flows of passengers raising load factors and allowing larger aircraft with lower unit costs to be used i know we will have a financial panel including our own brian pearce to discuss the performance and outlook for the us airline industry so i will not go into too much more detail but i do want to emphasize that profitability is a good thing for which no one need apologize profitability is enabling airlines to pay down debt a total of 6 1 billion in the first nine months of 2015 according to our friends at airlines for america profitability means airlines can invest in fleet renewal add new routes and improve the passenger experience to the tune of 12 1 billion over the same period profitability allows airlines to reward shareholders for their patience and support via dividends and stock buybacks and employees for their hard work and dedication through salary increases and profit sharing it s also important to note that while us airlines are making record profits for airlines on average they are just in the middle of the pack in comparison to other us industries the figures i have provided describe an industry that is healthy it is also an industry that continues to deliver great value to consumers on a global basis fares in 2015 are estimated to have fallen 5 compared to 2014 after adjusting for the effects of the strong us dollar and they were down 57 compared to 1995 after adjusting for inflation and excluding surcharges and taxes in the us airfares including typical ancillary fees remain around 39 below pre deregulation levels in real terms according to a4a we should not take for granted the industry s ability to continue to deliver excellent value to consumers while providing the connectivity that drives global gdp and job creation in addition to exogenous factors largely beyond our control it also depends to some extent on governments not over burdening airlines and passengers with fees and taxes that drive up the cost of air travel to punitive levels the us government collected 22 6 billion last year in fees and taxes from aviation but it continues to find new ways to extract dollars from airlines and passengers a recent example is a final rule issued by the department of agriculture s animal and plant health inspection service or aphis which more than triples the fee each aircraft pays for inspection services from 70 75 to 225 00 even before this outrageous increase the aphis fee was being used to subsidize inspections for other industries as the department s own consultant determined now the department appears to be doubling down on this violation of icao charging principles we also continue to be concerned regarding the high costs airlines are incurring to comply with onerous us department of transportation dot regulations particularly in the area of consumer protection the 1978 airline deregulation act was enacted on the premise that the market rather than regulators would drive airlines to provide services that their customers value at a price customers are willing to pay it was also assumed that airlines rather than regulators would be best positioned to determine how to reduce the impact of disruptions to those services resulting from weather or other factors for that reason it is extremely frustrating to our members when for example dot unilaterally decides how airlines should treat passengers during extended tarmac delays regardless of the reason for the delay and sets draconian fines for failure to abide by the rules not surprisingly the rules have had the reverse effect from what was intended by actually increasing the number of passenger disruptions and time lost to delays this was validated yet again in a 2015 study conducted by researchers at dartmouth university and mit that stated that the rule is estimated to have significantly increased passenger delays to dot s credit they appear to be taking to heart some of the lessons from their efforts to regulate the passenger experience most recently the department has been exploring the possibility of new rules to ensure that persons with disabilities have full access to commercial air travel rather than simply imposing regulations dot is now considering whether to hold a negotiated rulemaking whereby representatives of airlines and disabled travelers can join together and come to a consensus on what regulations should or should not be imposed in this area this collaborative approach offers the promise of solutions that support the interests of all parties in an effective and efficient way infrastructure a partnership approach will also be needed to address growing infrastructure issues in the us and around the world i know we will hear from a panel of experts specifically focused on the heavily congested ny airspace so i will take a high level view according to our most recent forecast global passenger numbers are expected to reach 7 billion by 2034 exactly twice as many as the 3 5 billion in 2015 although the us is a mature market domestic traffic is still expected to grow by 80 to 808 million in 2034 while total traffic to from and within the us will grow by 83 to more than 1 1 billion passenger journeys a year it is very clear to me that we cannot keep up with this demand under our present system of air traffic management atm inefficiencies in atm infrastructure impose a heavy toll on the global economy and they will only get worse european atm represents the biggest challenge but in the us faa s nextgen modernization program is significantly behind schedule according to the dot inspector general full nextgen implementation will take 10 years longer than its initial goal of 2025 and cost two or three times more than the initial estimated 40 billion in public private investment the reality is that as it is currently structured faa has been unable to move nextgen forward at a pace commensurate with the requirement although it is true that much of the problem lies outside the agency s control it is subject to the vagaries and shifting priorities of the annual federal budget process given the importance of the us market a modernized and efficient us air traffic control system is critical to the future growth of global commercial aviation and it is for that reason that we support legislation to modernize the system through the creation of an independent corporatized non profit entity to perform these services we recognize that the decision to move from a government agency to a corporatized entity should not be taken lightly however after more than 20 years of debate in the us and after similar and successful modernization efforts around the world we believe that now is the time to move forward with this historic transformation the environment i would like to finish with a discussion on the environment environmental sustainability is our license to grow in cooperation with our partners in the value chain we have adopted a global strategy to manage our emissions based on improvements in technology operations and infrastructure as well as the development of a global market based measure mbm we had enough confidence in the strategy to commit to carbon neutral growth from 2020 and to a halving of net carbon emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 we are making strong progress fuel efficiency is improving around 2 a year sustainable fuels for aviation have matured although we still need governments to step up to incentivize industrial scale levels of production and earlier this month a co2 standard was agreed that will institutionalize the continuous technical improvements that come with every new generation of aircraft and engines all of this represents significant forward movement but it is not enough we need the help of a market based measure to meet our ambitious targets we are supporting the leadership of icao in achieving a global agreement on a framework for a market based measure at its assembly this autumn as an industry we are united in a preference for a mandatory global carbon offset scheme as a key tool in achieving our carbon neutral growth commitment from 2020 iata is working with its members on how best we can equitably divide the bill taking into account the circumstances of mature airlines and of those that are still growing rapidly i d like to turn to another aspect of our social responsibility one that is particularly close to me which is helping to stop the trade in illegal wildlife now the responsibility for enforcement of the rules governing international wildlife trade is clearly with governments but well trained airline staff can be an invaluable source of information on suspicious passenger behavior and unusual shipments in support of this initiative we have undertaken a number of activities we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites to cooperate on reducing illegal trade in wildlife and their products as well as on ensuring the safe and secure transport of legally traded wildlife we are supporting the us agency for international development s reducing opportunities for unlawful transport of endangered species or routes program to support the development of standards and training to enable airline personnel to recognize and report efforts to transport this endangered wildlife in fact a workshop on illegal trafficking is being held at bangkok airport today in partnership with usaid we are participating in the united for wildlife task force which aims to identify ways the transport sector can break the chain between suppliers and consumers aviation can play a role in stopping the terrible scourge of illegal trade in wildlife that threatens some of the most precious animal and plant life on our planet and we are honored to be able to do so conclusion we are privileged to work in an industry that is a force for good in our world many industries contribute to the global community i believe that aviation makes the global community possible by bringing together people and businesses and creating opportunities for greater understanding across cultures in doing so we work together some 100 000 times a day 365 days a year i know you have an excellent program ahead of you so i will leave you on that note thank you

please try again later sign up to the hull live newsletter for daily updates and breaking news india is among four countries being removed from england s red list as part of a host of changes to the traffic light system for international travel the government has announced bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates are also being moved out of the high risk category the decision means arriving travellers will no longer be required to spend 11 nights at a coronavirus quarantine hotel spain has avoided being given red status but the government is urging travellers to take a pcr test before they fly home from the country mexico georgia and the french overseas departments of la reunion and mayotte will be put in the red tier spain has avoided the list owen humphreys pa germany austria slovenia slovakia latvia romania and norway are among seven countries being added to the quarantine free green list as expected it was also confirmed that arrivals from france will no longer need to self isolate it will be aligned with all other amber nations from which arrivals only need to quarantine at home if they are not fully vaccinated the changes to the travel lists come into force at 4am on sunday quarantine hotel costs are soaring to better reflect the increased costs involved according to the government from august 12 the rate for solo travellers will rise from 1 750 to 2 285 additional adults sharing a room will see their bill hiked from 650 to 1 430 transport secretary grant shapps said the government is committed to opening up international travel safely taking advantage of the gains we ve made through our successful vaccination programme he went on while we must continue to be cautious today s changes reopen a range of different holiday destinations across the globe which is good news for both the sector and travelling public transport secretary grant shapps tolga akmen pa health secretary sajid javid said changes to the travel lists are based on the latest data and expert public health advice he added that the announcement demonstrates the need for continued caution with additions made to the red list to help protect the success of our vaccine rollout from the threat of new variants the travel industry had feared that spain could be added to the red list following a recent rise in coronavirus cases there were fears in the travel industry that spain the most popular overseas destination for uk holidaymakers could be added to the red list but it is staying amber the government urged travellers arriving from spain to take a pcr test wherever possible as their mandatory pre departure test many people currently use cheaper lateral flow tests to meet the testing requirement in a statement the government said pcr tests should be used as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country it added that uk clinicians and scientists remain in close contact with their counterparts in spain to keep abreast of the latest data and picture of cases the government claimed its decision to scrap the amber plus list and align france in line with the rest of the amber list simplifies the system to three categories but the green watchlist which is designed to give travellers notice where green status is at risk remains in use and is unchanged karen dee chief executive of the airport operators association said the extension of the green list is a positive step forward but warned that the uk remains a long way off a full and meaningful restart of international travel tim alderslade boss of airlines uk the industry body representing uk registered carriers described the announcement as another missed opportunity he added that the travel industry has not had anything like the reopening it was hoping for paul charles chief executive of travel consultancy the pc agency said while there s some welcome progress the government is still being too cautious at a time when they should be opening up travel faster to help the sector s recovery johan lundgren chief executive of easyjet said now summer is fully under way this provides some reassurance to consumers by keeping the status quo for key holiday destinations as well as adding some green list destinations for last minute bookers where there are still great flight and holiday deals available but we remain disappointed at the double standards applied to travel versus the domestic economy with infection rates remaining lower in much of europe and the high vaccination levels in the uk if not now it is hard to know when the time is for much of europe to genuinely turn green and government urgently needs to tackle this expensive testing regime which is adding unnecessary cost especially for the fully vaccinated no one wants to see flying become a preserve of the rich again particularly when so many need to get away or reunite after such a long time mark tanzer chief executive of abta the travel association said today s confirmation that france joins popular holiday destinations such as spain and greece on the list of countries that fully vaccinated individuals and their families can travel to without the need to quarantine on return is positive particularly as we are now in the critical school holiday season however the government is still failing to capitalise fully on the success of the vaccine rollout with a very cautious approach to the green list and failure to relax restrictions on travel including requirements for multiple tests even when visiting low risk destinations as a result the uk is falling behind our european competitors and the opening up of international travel from the uk is progressing at a snail s pace making it extremely difficult for travel agents and tour operators to generate enough income to kickstart a recovery which is desperately needed to protect jobs businesses and livelihoods for more stories from where you live visit inyourarea here is the state of play for your summer holidays is there any good news seven countries will be added to england s green travel list from 4am on sunday the government announced on wednesday anyone returning from germany austria slovenia slovakia latvia romania and norway will no longer need to quarantine on arrival a strict testing regime is key to the travel rules jane barlow pa france has also lost its confusing amber plus status which meant all travellers and not just those who are not fully vaccinated had to self isolate for 10 days upon return our nearest neighbour had been in a category all by itself because of concerning levels of the beta variant of covid 19 there is that it sadly yes but it just got slightly easier to visit india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates as they have been downgraded from the red to the amber list meaning arrivals will no longer have to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel there are currently 24 countries on the green list including the popular holiday destinations of barbados croatia and malta unfortunately 16 of these are on the green watch list meaning they could be suddenly be shunted up to amber hotel quarantine is about to get a lot more expensive jonathan brady pa australia and new zealand are both unambiguously green unfortunately neither are welcoming british travellers at the moment has anyone joined the red list yes mexico georgia and the french overseas territories of la reunion and mayotte are joining the red list if you have a holiday to one of those destinations already booked and want to press ahead bear in mind the cost for solo travellers in a quarantine hotel in england will be ramped up from 1 750 to 2 285 from august 12 the charge for an additional adult sharing a room will more than double from 650 to 1 430 to better reflect the increased costs involved the government said is my trip to spain safe there were fears in the travel industry that spain the most popular overseas destination for uk holidaymakers could be added to england s red list the government announced it would keep its amber status but urged travellers arriving in the uk from spain to take a pcr test for the mandatory pre departure test as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country many travellers have been relying on the cheaper lateral flow test kits which are less reliable than pcrs things keep changing what do i have to do when i get home again there are different rules for countries on the red amber and green lists that also differ according to a traveller s vaccination status passengers to england returning from a red list country must have proof of a negative covid 19 test before departure and must book a hotel quarantine package including two covid 19 tests even if they have had both jabs they must also complete a passenger locator form those arriving from abroad need to fill in a passenger locator form brian lawless pa if you have come from an amber list country you need proof of a negative test before travel and those who are not fully vaccinated must self isolate 10 days upon arrival and take a pcr test on day two and day eight you might be able to get out of quarantine early if you pay for a private pcr test to be taken on day five under the test to release scheme those with two vaccines only need to take a pcr test on day two of their arrival and can skip self isolation the same rules apply to those who are under the age of 18 regardless of their vaccination status anyone returning from a green list country need only have proof of a negative covid 19 test before travel fill in a passenger locator form and take a test on day two after arrival do these changes apply elsewhere in the uk the devolved nations have control over their own amber red and green lists of countries as well as the rules around quarantine upon return and the recent changes have attracted criticism from some quarters the welsh government is still advising against all but essential travel abroad and those who have been to a red list country cannot even enter until they have completed 10 days of quarantine in england or scotland first in a statement a spokesman for the welsh government said we have long called for a clearer system of rules regarding international travel the ad hoc nature of the decisions made by the uk government on the issue does little to instil confidence or provide clarity for travellers we continue to advise against all but essential travel abroad because of the continuing risk of infection including with new variants of coronavirus which may not respond to our vaccines we will consider the latest changes announced by the uk government

the second quarter with a 16 gross 31 net increase in wells spud compared to the first quarter which substantially outpaced the 9 industry wide rig increase in our liquids rich basins drilling activity drove a 14 increase in net ducs to 5 0 net locations which we anticipate will be highly contributory to production volumes over the next twelve months as operators such as chevron corporation pioneer natural resources inc exxon mobil corporation pdc energy inc and diamondback energy inc turn our ducs in line to production collectively these large well capitalized e ps operate 60 of our ducs and are running an aggregate 19 frac crews in our basins driven by this high quality duc inventory we anticipate our production volumes over the next twelve months or the period from q3 2021 through q2 2022 will average between 9 000 boe d and 10 000 boe d our acquisition team remained highly disciplined as commodity prices increased throughout the second quarter targeting highly accretive acquisitions focused on activity wells and continued to deliver deploying 14 4 million in mineral acquisition capital almost entirely to the permian basin as a result of higher seller price expectations and the desire to maintain discipline in the face of increased competition which has historically proven to be transitory we anticipate deploying 15 million of acquisition capital over the next two quarters which will be majority funded by retained cash and our portfolio optimization and rationalization activities blake c williams chief financial officer added our high quality asset base delivered strong second quarter results highlighted by both record revenues and adjusted ebitda 1 realized pricing improved 13 over the first quarter which along with our production uplift drove a 9 increase in our dividend to 0 35 per share this quarter further we were able to internally fund approximately 40 of our second quarter mineral acquisition capital which is up from 30 in the first quarter finally we are excited to implement a base plus variable dividend structure 2 with a quarterly base dividend of 0 14 per share which represents an attractive and sustainable fixed base yield relative to broader market indices we believe the base dividend has been battle tested as it equates to our second quarter 2020 dividend which incorporates the substantial commodity price economic and activity disruptions attributable to the covid 19 pandemic and the actions of opec in addition to the base dividend our second quarter dividend includes a variable amount of 0 21 per share bringing our total payout to 80 of discretionary cash flow ex lease bonus 1 for the second quarter the variable dividend represents an incremental 4 4 annualized yield for a total dividend yield of 7 3 to our

davis barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you for joining us today i first want to take a moment to remember jim crain who joined the enlink family as a member of the board of directors of our predecessor company in 2005 jim served us faithfully and diligently for the last 16 years including attending an enlink board meeting on the last day of his life his contribution to enlink was great and we will miss jim on the call today we will discuss our second quarter results our current operating environment and the opportunities we see for our carbon solutions group after the significant disruption from severe weather in february the strong momentum exiting the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter with producers adding rigs and completing wells that have been drilled but not completed we achieved adjusted ebitda of 258 million in the second quarter which built on the strong first quarter results and represents over 6 growth from prior year net of mvc payments that ended in 2020 this is a tremendous outcome and positions us well for the second half of 2021 with continued momentum in producer activity on our footprint and strong commodity prices we expect to end 2021 in the upper end of our previously updated adjusted ebitda guidance range of 1 02 to 1 06 billion we generated approximately 72 million in free cash flow after distributions during the second quarter which takes our trailing 12 month total to nearly 360 million as the first half of 2021 has shown we remain focused on executing our plan and driving sustainable value our first execution plan priority is to optimize our existing business and improve efficiencies after leading our peers last year with a greater than 20 reduction in operating in general and administrative expenses we have maintained those reductions through increased efficiencies even with the growth and inflation we are now seeing the second priority of our execution plan is to maintain financial flexibility and we have continued to make significant progress on this front as i ve already mentioned we are generating strong cash flow and using the majority of that cash to pay down debt we have previously discussed our near term leverage goal is to get below four times and that goal is now within arm s reach as we exited the second quarter at 4 1 times our third priority is deliberate and disciplined growth as we previously announced in the second quarter we closed the amarillo rattler transaction a very attractive permian basin acquisition with an excellent customer behind it and we remain very confident in achieving a six x multiple on full year 22 ebitda as far as capital projects our team has been hard at work as we continue to utilize our capital light growth model to handle higher permian volumes driven by robust customer activity we have been expanding our midland basin capacity creatively and efficiently through a plant relocation and other plant optimizations now looking ahead i am excited about the opportunities in our louisiana business our team continues to work on exciting downstream growth opportunities and we expect to bring some of those low capital high return opportunities to closure in the next few months in addition we announced in june the formation of the carbon solutions group which will focus on carbon capture utilization and sequestration as we all know the united states as a whole and a growing number of companies have set aggressive climate goals focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the iea sustainable development scenario ccus should account for approximately 15 of the cumulative reduction in emissions within the u s the mississippi river corridor in the gulf coast of louisiana is one of the largest co2 emitting regions and we believe that our extensive assets in the ground our customer relationships and long history of operating in the state of louisiana uniquely position us to build a business aimed at helping companies achieve their carbon reduction goals last but not least our fourth priority is sustainability and safety these are part of our dna and i m pleased to report that we have strengthened our governance through the formation of board level sustainability committee to monitor our performance risks and opportunities in summary i believe the momentum that we are seeing in our business today coupled with a strong first half of 2021 and our team s relentless focus on the execution of our plan have us well positioned to drive sustainable value and growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond with that i ll turn it over to ben to discuss our operational update ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks barry and good morning everyone i ll start with the permian segment which continues to see robust activity and generated 44 million in segment profit segment profit includes 10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter related to our midland basin plant relocation project project war horse the second quarter of 2021 also marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive segment cash flow with 4 5 million being generated average natural gas gathering volumes were 11 higher compared to the first quarter of 2021 and increased by approximately 18 compared to the second quarter of 2020 average natural gas processing volumes for the second quarter were 9 higher compared to the first quarter of 2021 and increased by approximately 7 over the prior year quarter project war horse continues to progress as planned as previously announced we expanded the scope of the project which will bring its processing capacity to 95 million cubic feet per day we expect to place the plant in service in the third quarter with the full expanded capacity available in the fourth quarter between an uptick in rig activity during the second quarter and the recent amarillo acquisition we anticipate our capacity will be well utilized in the first half of 2022 so we continue to work on other capital light alternatives to accommodate higher volumes we have also seen delaware activity pick up and forecast the restart of the tiger plant in early 2022 turning now to louisiana where the second and third quarters are seasonally lower segment profit for the second quarter of 2021 came in at 67 3 million which represents an increase of 5 5 over the prior year quarter louisiana continues to generate very strong cash flow with 65 1 million in the second quarter of 2021 and we continue to forecast strong cash flow for the remainder of 2021 this segment saw strong gas and ngl volumes with ngl margins that expected summer seasonal lows moving to oklahoma our team continued to execute as operator activity picked up during the quarter segment profit for the second quarter of 2021 came in at 85 6 million this compares to 55 5 million reported in the first quarter of 2021 which was negatively impacted by winter storm uri excluding the impact of mvc payments that expired in 2020 the segment profit in the second quarter grew over 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 oklahoma also continued to show a significant segment cash flow of 80 7 million in the quarter oklahoma is a combo play where gas ngl and crude prices all matter for producer economics we have seen our customers particularly private operators look to take advantage of the improved commodity backdrop and we saw rig activity on our footprint approximately double during the second quarter when compared to the first quarter the devon dow jv continues to progress as planned with its two rig program for 2021 the first volumes are projected to hit our system in the third quarter but it will be more significant in the fourth quarter as producers have been more active we expect our overall decline rate in oklahoma to moderate significantly and we currently forecast a decline in the mid single digits for 2022 based on current operator activity and plans wrapping up in north texas segment profit for the quarter was 57 9 million which is slightly below the 61 9 million reported in the first quarter of 2021 excluding the approximate 50 million one time impact of winter storm uri gathering volumes for the second quarter of 2021 increased 2 from the first quarter of 2021 similar to oklahoma north texas producers benefit from higher gas and ngl prices our primary customer bkb continues to focus primarily on reactivating old wells and restimulating active wells this along with some new completion activity from other customers is moderating decline rates with the second quarter coming in at 7 year over year with that i ll pass it over to pablo to discuss our financial results pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ben and good morning everyone i ll start with the second quarter highlights as barry mentioned enlink delivered a solid second quarter building off the momentum exiting the first quarter and achieving 258 million of adjusted ebitda and 72 million of free cash flow after distributions with all four of our assets segments delivering positive cash contributions excluding the impact of the mvc that rolled off at the end of the year adjusted ebitda increased approximately 6 5 from the second quarter of 2020 also although there is always volatility in quarterly cash flows due to the timing of capital expenditures enlink has delivered 359 million of free cash flow after distributions over the last 12 months i am very proud of our enlink team for their continued focus on execution including their focus on efficiencies and on holding on to the significant cost savings that we achieved last year the focus is helping us offset some inflationary pressures we have seen this year primarily in labor and in materials like chemicals and lubricants our operating and general and administrative expenses in the first half of 2021 are just about flat from the second half of 2020 after adjusting for project war horse operating expenses and the noise from winter storm uri we continue to see the significant cost reductions that we achieved in 2020 as largely sustainable in a modest growth environment which is what we re experiencing so far this year on the capital expenditures front our team continues to focus on a capital light high returns approach as ben mentioned our midland basin plant relocation project is going well and the scope expansion of 50 million cubic feet a day only added a couple of million dollars of capital also in june we announced a new crude terminal in the midland basin which will secure additional gathering volumes and blending opportunities we expect this project to cost about 12 million and achieve a low single digit 2022 ebitda multiple these projects are both incorporated in our updated capex guidance from june which was 165 million to 195 million now as barry and ben both mentioned we are seeing strong producer activity which improves and makes more visible the growth outlook for our 2022 volumes as a result where we sit today we expect to be at the higher end of capex guidance but we will continue to monitor market conditions closely and remain nimble with our plans on the balance sheet side we find ourselves in a much stronger position than where we were a year ago we have ample liquidity have made a lot of progress on debt reduction and have effectively managed our term loan maturity while preserving the ability to continue to de lever through cash flow during the quarter we ve paid down an additional 100 million of our term loan and we continue to be well positioned to repay the remaining 250 million by year end given our strong free cash flow generation and our 1 75 billion undrawn revolver our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio under our credit facility was just below 4 1 times a quarter end that puts us very close to our near term leverage goal of under four times and as a result we re beginning to consider a more balanced capital allocation approach that allows us to continue to de lever the balance sheet but mixes in more return of capital to unitholders this could include common unit distribution increases as well as common and preferred unit buybacks to that end we repurchased 10 million of common units between june and july and we will continue to be opportunistic with the unit repurchase program now as we look ahead following the successful first half of 2021 we feel very good about our outlook for the second half of the year as barry mentioned with the current market backdrop we expect to end 2021 in the upper end of our adjusted ebitda guidance range of 1 02 billion to 1 06 billion as a reminder we do have seasonality in our louisiana ngl business which is typically strongest in the fourth quarter in addition we continue to see solid operator activity across the permian strong industrial and commodity pricing trends in louisiana and improving operator activity in oklahoma and north texas positioning us to achieve continued growth in 2022 with that i ll turn it back to barry barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you pablo i ll sum up our discussion so far by saying this enlink delivered another strong quarter and is solidly on track to be in the upper end of our updated adjusted ebitda guidance for 2021 the outlook for volumes and cash flow growth in 2022 has also improved our strong performance over the last several quarters has enabled us to reduce debt outstanding approach our near term leverage goal of less than four times and begin to review a more balanced use of the free cash flow after distributions we re not stopping there however our team wakes up every day with a focus on how to be more efficient and grow in a sustainable and capital light manner this is exemplified with the work our carbon solutions group is doing to partner with companies to help them achieve their emissions reduction goals with that you may now open the call for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from shneur gershuni with ubs please go ahead shneur gershuni ubs analyst hi good morning everyone maybe to start off i kind of want to focus on barry your closing remarks and sort of how you talked about the setup for 2022 when i sort of look at the numbers today oklahoma seems to be outperforming your expectations just talking about drilling activity there you re steering us toward the higher end of your guide which would suggest a strong exit rate as well so and at the same time you talked about the tiger plant potentially coming online in 22 i m not sure if you have like specific insight from exxon there or not but i was kind of wondering in how you re thinking about the growth rate in 22 versus 21 do you think it s modest growth versus where you exit in 4q or do you or do you think that there s going to be a step up especially with all the efforts you ve done on reducing costs and improving efficiencies and so forth barry davis chairman and chief executive officer yes this is barry thank you for the question and look i think you did a good job summarizing the things that we highlighted that are positive momentum that we ve experienced here in the first half and we expect to continue through the second half i mean all of those are very good drivers to what we expect in 2022 that being said we re not going to give guidance today on 2022 i think we ve said what really needs to be said we re seeing increased producer activity in the key basins of oklahoma and north texas great opportunities that were taking advantage of the louisiana market and then the strength of the permian growth has just continued and we re very optimistic about what will happen in 2022 so the level of growth in 2022 we haven t actually quantified at this point either anecdotally or by percentages but i would just say we re continuing to increase our optimism about the growth that we ll see in 2022 ben would you add any specific comments around the basins ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer may be just a few things in oklahoma i said just a minute ago we ve seen rig activity roughly double right at the moment we have seven rigs working on dedicated acreage from four or five different producers two of those are the dow jv rigs but the others are other companies mostly the private operators and so we re at a point where we now see 2022 declines significantly moderating to be in the mid single digits versus 2021 volumes if you look out in the permian you touch there on exxon s plans in the delaware certainly we do have updated plans from exxon that support the restart of the tiger plant early next year but it s not just exxon we have a fairly diverse book of business in the delaware and in addition to exxon one of our other large independent public producers is accelerating their activity on our dedicated acreage so that along with exxon along with some other activity from smaller producers is what s leading to the restart of the tiger plant and of course midland continues to be our strongest basin and overall with 17 or 18 rigs working on dedicated acreage today on the gas side shneur gershuni ubs analyst ok that i really appreciate that i understand it it s too early to provide 22 guidance but just kind of want to make so i understood the drivers maybe to pivot a little bit here much specifically a pablo question but you sort of talked about how you re evaluating options looking at buybacks looking at the preferred i know that you ve got 250 last on the term loan but you have a lot of capacity on your revolver as well too is kind of the thought process there to sort of think about either a just retiring that completely but putting it onto the revolver and being opportunistic around buybacks and preferreds and then sort of use the access free cash as kind of balance and work that down just given the flexibility that the revolver has or is that something kind of you want to take away or take care of first and then buyback some preferreds afterwards just kind of interested in your thought process on how it will sort of sequence itself out over the next let s say six to 18 months pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yes shneur thanks for the question we have made a lot of progress on the capital structure as you mentioned we were very purposeful when we termed out the vast majority of the term loan in the fourth quarter with a bond deal to leave some outstanding so that we could continue to de lever if you term out all your debt then it s hard to do that right so we ve got the 250 million remaining outstanding we ll take care of that through cash flow and put any remaining piece on the revolver and then continue chip away at it i would say we don t need to see that before we turn to what we re calling a more balanced capital allocation approach to increase the returns to the equity holders a bit that s more related to how close we are to our leverage target of just below four times shneur gershuni ubs analyst ok got it so just to clarify so it doesn t get in the way of buybacks and it s something that you opportunistically will actually chip away at for one thing so it would be more the pivot really or takeaway that we should take is that you are pivoting to focus more on the buybacks and preferreds pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and it s not just buybacks but we also mentioned distribution increases that s something we ll be reviewing with our board over the next couple of quarters shneur gershuni ubs analyst ok perfect really appreciate the colors today thank you very much and stay safe operator our next question comes from dinei chichety with jpmorgan please go ahead unverified speaker hi good morning i just wanted to follow up on your carbon solutions group finance manger you did discuss current 45q tax credit is sufficient to take to make low hanging projects viable maybe if you could expand any further on potential opportunities like that and what does that timeline we are looking at there ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer hey dinei it s ben lamb start with the second question first the size of the opportunity you can think of it is not much different than the size of the gas market today and specifically in the mississippi river corridor where our infrastructure is the most robust there s between 80 and 100 million metric tons a year of total co2 emissions so the ultimate addressable market is vast now the the first part of your question is it economic today with the current 45q tax structure some carbon sources are economic today with the 45q tax structure certainly not the entire market but enough of the market that we believe we have the opportunity to build a scale business with the 45q tax credit that s in place today we also think that we ve seen a lot of bipartisan support in washington for ccus and for expanding the scope of 45q and as that happens more and more of those 80 to 100 million metric tons a year will become economic over time and i want to emphasize that we have the ability to take advantage of this opportunity repurposing some of the assets that we have in the ground and that s because we have assets of sufficient diameter that we can operate at the pressures required to move co2 efficiently and move a quantity of material and move a distance that we think fits the market as we expect it to develop in the next few years unverified speaker got it then maybe just trying to understand on the guidance here so the commodity shape that you meant during your guidance is still kind of low compare toward where the guidance should be maybe if you could shed any thoughts on what size the upper end of the guidance and any other items which we should keep in mind other than the seasonality which you already mentioned ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah dinei so good question we did outline the commodity prices that we used for the full guidance range update that we gave in june obviously prices have been stronger particularly on the ngl and natural gas side and so that is one of the contributors to the commentary that we gave on today s call which is that we expect to be in the upper end of the range that we previously provided unverified speaker got it that s it for me thank you barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from t j schults with rbc capital markets please go ahead t j schults rbc capital markets analyst hey everybody good morning my first question is just for the midland you talk about looking into 2022 for other capital light expansions does that as you look at ways to expand the capacity does that consider moving another plant and then what s the current outlook with thunderbird thanks ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer hey t j yes so you re right with the capacity that we re adding with war horse initially 80 million a day here in the near term and then another 15 million by the end of the year we ll be up in the 660s of capacity but we expect that we will start to fill that fairly quickly in the first half of next year and so we are already looking at efficient ways to increase processing capacity that could include offloading to others because there are others who are constructing facilities in the midland basin today new build facility it could include moving another plant as you say and we do have a couple of candidates in our portfolio that could be available for that it could include something like a joint venture with one of our midland neighbors to make sure that we fully utilize the capacity that someone builds another one that s come up recently when we acquired amarillo rattler we acquired a small refrigeration plant that today can only process about 20 million cubic feet a day with relatively low recoveries as we ve done more work around that facility we think that facility may be expandable and we may be able to significantly increase the recoveries in that facility such that we might have a smaller version of war horse on our hands in terms of the efficiency with which we can add some processing capacity so all of those options will be on the table with a focus on these capital light alternatives t j schults rbc capital markets analyst ok makes sense and then just taking questions on the stack so certainly a conducive commodity environment and if that persists does your guide for this year and the kind of outlook into 2022 does that assume that these seven rig rigs persist or does getting to the higher end of the guide and view to 22 consider more rigs just trying to understand maybe the appetite from some of the private producers to consider and or continue to increase activity from current levels just given where the money is now thanks ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah t j we don t even need the seven rigs to persist to get to the mid single digit decline in 2022 that what we re seeing right now is a very nice helpful tailwind and if the seven if a rig count of seven sticks so to speak then we would see upside from what we re talking about today t j schults rbc capital markets analyst ok great thanks operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to barry davis for any closing comment barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you sarah for facilitating our call this morning and thank you everyone for being on the call today and for your support as

executive vice president andre cano our executive director and iro leandro miranda our cfo oswaldo fernandes the bradesco seguros ceo ivan gontijo and banco next chief executive officer renato ejnisman now i turn the floor to leandro leandro miranda deputy executive director deputy officer investor relations officer member of board of executive thank you firetti good morning everyone thank you for your interest and for joining us on our second q earnings call this quarter we saw a new surge at the moment which unfortunately affected a significant number of residents however there was also a great acceleration in vaccinations which is the only real solution for the covid 19 the current pace is good and it shall accelerate even further over the coming months this should help brazil achieve the benefit seen in the countries of more advanced vaccination phase we see continued recovery on the current economic theories even with this fight in covid case in the beginning of the year and especially now with vaccinations ramping up we foresee a growth of 5 2 of the brazilian economy in 2021 for unemployment it s rapidly rising supporting loan growth and keeping delinquency ratios at historically low levels fiscal risks have decreased with the growth leading to a positive surprise in debt to ebitda ratio and thereby it may be an appreciation of the real on page three we begin a discussion on our numbers our income in the quarter was brl6 3 billion with the accumulated return reaching 18 2 over six months the loan portfolio expanded 3 in comparison to the previous quarter and about 10 year on year the tier one ratio reached 14 1 an increase of 0 5 bps q on q and 1 6 bps year over year which indicates a very comfortable capital level so far this year we have already distributed brl six billion in the form of interest on shareholders equity this brought our payout to 52 we feel that our second quarter results had a good level driven by a robust performance in banking activity the insurance income was adversely impacted by the increase in health and life insurance claims due to the impact from new spikes of the pandemic and a lower financial income due to the variations in marketing indices the fact that we were able to deliver a strong consolidated income despite the heat taken from insurance activities demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet and our organization s ability to diversify our revenue streams moving now to slide four we present our income statement as we mentioned before the lower quarterly income primarily reflects the impact on the insurance business which was heavily affected by the claims related to covid 19 despite the evolution of the import sale to revenue area looking just at the income from the banking structure the growth in the quarter was up 16 compared to the first q in later comparison the income goes 125 as the second q was the most affected by the pandemic it s worth noting that the banking structure s income in the second q was 22 higher than the second q 19 the total nii was up 1 in the quarter and down in yearly comparison because the market nii was rather high in the second q 20 thanks to the robust market in covid activities all expenses came at a very good level posting a reduction of 10 7 q on q this comes from the positive performance in the funds and our lower models we would like to point out the sharp improvement in costs despite the covid increase finally when we compare our operation this half year with the first six months we have in 2019 it s possible to notice that we have had significant evolution and as we are expanding total revenues are up 6 and reflect the growth in the portfolio and customer base more than absorbed the expenses fell 7 3 even with the high inflation accumulated experience and as a consequence the efficiency ratio reached 45 7 an improvement of 3 7 percentage points if we now take a look at slide five our funding activities continued to perform well funds from clients grew 4 5 in the annual comparison particularly demand deposits and savings they are complete an important source of funding for our mortgaging and operations on slide six we talk about the expanded portfolio which grew 9 9 in 21 we posted a sharp 21 higher in individuals and 28 7 in smes for large companies the annual comparison was somewhat tempered by the solid growth of working capital lines that we started with organic and greater access to the capital market that we start some lines report the attractive levels of growth over 12 months in real estate funding it grew by 40 this performance reflects improvements in our contracting process and the strength of our origination channels in which i would like to highlight our digital variant that originated around 1 700 transactions in the first semester of 2021 4 times higher than last year therefore a channel that is increasingly gaining share in our loans origination payroll deductible loans grew 19 8 with origination of concentrate on our own terms agricultural loans rose 18 2 an increase of brl3 1 billion for companies and brl1 2 billion for individuals reflecting the correlations we have on farmers through our original agricultural platforms which we have reinforced with agricultural engineers along with the distribution of our branch network which is primarily agriculture municipalities the growth of 28 7 year on year reflects the reposition we made in our business resource subject in which we treated the number for the lenders and also added 600 relationship managers we also reviewed the small entrepreneur origination journey we will have more news in the second half finally i d like to highlight the origination of loans to individuals which has been already enjoying steady growth for perhaps even for a year and now is 40 higher compared to the same quarter of the previous year in this quarter with the recovery of the economy the origination of companies grew by around 25 turning now to slide seven our expanded all expenses brl3 5 billion in the quarter representing 1 9 of the portfolio the level was consistent with our guidance the reduction in cost of risk is a consequence of the positive performance in delinquency ratios and the growth in normal risk transactions over the last few quarters such as real estate financing payroll deductible loans and the loan coverage ratio remains at rather high levels and is expected to continue above pre pandemic levels up to the end of this year the coverage ratio including the renegotiated portfolio remained virtually stable turning now to slide eight we see that the delinquencies are remaining under control in line with our expectations the market value ratio remained stable with the 10 bps improvement in individual segments the 15 to 90 day ratio showed signs of improvement in all segments we believe that the delinquency ratios are expected to convert to pre pandemic levels by early 2022 this past performance can be explained by a marked portfolio management the progress of our loan models enjoins co activation as well as renegotiations that are extended on the clients i would like to highlight that the npl creation this quarter is at the same level of 2019 moving to slide nine the extended portfolio continued to improve for 36 year on year from a balance of brl41 3 billion only brl3 5 billion are in arrears for over 30 years the possibility of amortization remained available to clients in the second quarter but the demand was low coming to slide 10 you can see that our renegotiated portfolio declined by brl900 million in the second period this year after holding a stable position in the first year these shows our trend toward more normal loan conditions we maintained a high level of provisions maybe the highest compared to our peers equivalent to 62 of the portfolio the new considerations in the renegotiated portfolio continued to be stable in the quarter but are expected to climb by the end of the year returning to pre pandemic levels coming now to slide 11 the total nii grew 1 over the quarter year on year there was a drop of 5 7 thanks to the short market nii in the second quarter of the previous year the quarterly growth in the client nii is mainly driven by the expansion of the business portfolio mainly in personal loans credit cards and payroll deductible loans which more than offset the slowdown in spreads motivated by market dynamics we expect spreads to start rise indeed it might even improve during the second half due to the covid improvements we now turn to slide 12 we posted a strong performance increase we are seeing intense growth in the volumes transacted in both debt and credit cards reflecting a recovered economy for checking accounts we were able to recover the level of revenues from our non quarter banking correspondents due to a resumption in commercial activity revenues were also positively impacted by an annual growth of more than 1 7 million clients offsetting reduction of the debt and dock revenues in asset management the growth over the quarter came out of the strategy to diversify into new products that have a higher added value in addition we experienced growth in our net funding both in our own products as well as on third parties this comes as a result of the work performed by our team of investment specialists contributing to a net funding of brl17 billion in the first half of 2021 and also by higher revenues originated from prepared funds we also highlight the strong performance in the income from consortium investment bank benefit from the favorable market review operating expenses now on to slide 13 as you can see our total costs fell by 4 4 over six months the comparison between the quarter and the previous year is impaired by the covid base of comparison as a number of expenses were not carried out due to the pandemic personnel expenses were primarily impacted by higher provisions for profit shares which stood its stance compared to the previous year given the 60 higher net income this year the decline in the administrative expenses for the high stringent cost control measures of 8 3 on a gpm 35 8 turning now to slide 14 our insurance operations at bradesco both grew 20 in revenues in income which was brl2 3 billion despite the weighted level of claims due to the events related to the pandemic on this slide we highlight the covid 19 impact in our insurance operations with costs reaching brl1 8 billion in the second quarter 21 and brl three billion in the first half totaling around brl4 8 billion since the beginning of the pandemic the financial income in the second q also was affected by the behavior of the ratios which had an impact on the performance of financial investments at bradesco this scenario is temporary it already shows improvement as a consequence of the vaccination but we decided to revise our insurance guidance as well as we are going to be paying it further on slide 15 gives an overview of weekly events related to the pandemic in our healthcare business here we show the curves with the volumes of pcr tests that have been researched as well as hospitalizations for covid sufferers during the same period since the onset of the pandemic bradesco salutes ensuring clients took more than brl1 3 million 1 3 million pcr exams and approximately 78 000 as you can see this graph is a good figure for hospitalization levels and these charts allow us to expect reduction in the short future due to the recent weak strength although still high level we now move on to slide 16 as you can see our capital and liquidity ratios our tier one capital ratio finished the quarter at 14 1 and the common equity stood at 13 1 which was an increase of 50 bps compared to the previous quarter and 160 bps compared to june 2020 the ratio is well above the regulatory means in a fairly comfortable level moving now to slide 17 we provide data that demonstrate the growth in the use of our digital channels this year 98 of transactions are already digital clients using our various channels goods and digital journeys and an ongoing evolution toward transition to digital without performance of the branch the most significant transaction of volumes are now in the mobile channel the number of financial result in the first six months of this year reached brl600 million which is 1 higher than the previous year we also saw a record number of accounts opened for both individuals and companies organic volumes are about twice as high as last year the volume of loans coming from digital channels over the period amounted to brl31 billion 21 higher than last year growth in digital segments came to 54 the number of platform requests to digital channels grew 270 and this year we issued 3 9 million new cards for the insurance company we wanted to sell one million products through digital channels in the first half of 2021 which represents revenues of brl700 billion an annual increase of 80 compared to the same period last year we now move on to slide 18 where you can see the evolution of our payments the push we have been giving to pix from acquiring journey with financial vision and contributing to improved volume of transactions pix is responsible for over 50 of the business transactions we witnessed a digitization of minor transactions given the fact that around 40 of the quality peak transactions are below brl50 activity graphs only process the checks and atm withdrawls have decreased in quantity which contributes to a reduction in our expenses turning now to slide 19 in addition to continually improving our channels we have also made investments to bia our artificial intelligence that simplifies our clients lives by providing increasingly pleasant experience i would like to point out that we are five years in the use of artificial intelligence in brazil in this first half of the year digital collection grew 43 totaling 275 million transactions clients in which 83 million of these interactions were through whatsapp i m pleased to share with you that bradesco received for the second consecutive year the award of most innovative bank in latin america an award recognized by the banker magazines reflecting all the investment and focus we have placed on innovation turning now to slide 20 we can see agora next and bitz our digital business as you could see throughout the presentation posted a strong performance agora saw nearly 50 growth over 12 months in both the number of clients and in terms of volume under custody agora is getting more and more important in funding for us as well as you can see that there is a increase of 81 in net funding next is expected to continue to both grow in the second half thanks to the member get member program and partnerships the sign up process has been improved and 70 of our accounts are opened within 24 hours next has also incorporated shopfast that now includes a new source of revenue from nonfinancial business and finally bitz the digital wallet that we introduced last september has already surpassed one million accounts turning now to slide 21 we would like to point out that we are the first financial institution in brazil to announce our goal to achieve a balance to greenhouse gas emission by all our clients and investor companies reaching what is know as net zero this is an extension of our climate strategy 15 years ago bradesco was one of the first to measure the amount of carbon generated at group s operations overall 2019 we have neutralized 100 of these emissions in 2020 we were also the first financial institution in brazil to join pcaf the partnership for carbon accounting financials we have realized a new level of climate management and we d like to play a leading role in this transition in the country engaging and supporting our clients for better business while promoting a more efficient clean and climate moving now to page 22 concerning our guidance we considered responsible well balanced drivers when the year began and we maintained expectations for all lines with the exception of insurance due to the change with the event of covid 19 we believe that we see growth above the center of the range for the main portfolio as well as for fees and in the center for client nii at the bottom fortunately costs primarily due to the expected effects from the collective bargaining agreement for bank employees net inflation accelerated sharply in the first half in the favor of the guidance for all expenses the insurance guidance was reviewed downwards only now anticipate a drop from 15 to 20 as a consequence of the drops described earlier today finally we would like to thank you so much for making the time to be with us and we are going to proceed with the questions and answer sessions questions and answers operator our first question is coming from mario pierry of bank of america mario pierry bank of america analyst good afternoon i have two questions first related to your insurance operations and especially in your guidance for the year last year you basically were guiding for results from insurance of about brl10 billion in 2021 which means an average rate of only brl2 6 billion in the third and fourth quarter but when we look back over the last four quarters your results in insurance were averaging almost brl3 1 billion even there s you already included the expenses related to covid in the first quarter so i was wondering why do you expect your run rate to remain below the last four quarters especially considering a higher rate generation to be positive for your financial results so that s my first question second question is related to your operating expenses you are very close to the top of the guidance here expenses of 4 however we see significant headwinds in the second half of the year especially related to salary negotiations talk a little bit about where things are in regards to annual salary renegotiations and how can you offset these headwinds in the second half of the year especially you already closed about 1 000 branches which is almost 25 of the branch network is there more room to reduce branches or the efficiency needs to then turn somewhere else leandro miranda deputy executive director deputy officer investor relations officer member of board of executive okay i m going to ask michael to read to help me repeat your questions if i m not able to answer all of it because the sound was not that clear as far as the insurance the first question is related to the guidance for insurance right so basically in the way we see the big aspects and therefore we shall have better quarters from now on especially in the fourth quarter as we continue to grow in terms of premiums that our revenues and especially in light the number of debt has also gotten source parts we expect that this will come more in line with the previous years but of course this time will come gradually and it also depends on movement of mutation here how it s going to evolve in terms of vaccination regarding to the operating expenses these rates contemplates over the employees of personnel adjustment that we shall have in the second semester we believe that we are going to continue to reduce expenses overall despite of this increase in salaries because basically as of what was spoken out earlier we continue to close branches and we continue to transform those branches into point of sales or business units we continue to reduce our administrative expenses as well so we understand that we are going to be able to keep the lower part of the balance mario pierry bank of america analyst okay sorry about the quality of the sound it s a little bit hard to hear as well but so just to go back on insurance right if i look at your first quarter results the insurance had like brl3 1 billion and we already have very elevated costs related to covid so but if we think about it your financial results should improve anything if your covid expenses remain elevated in line with the first quarter numbers i was just wondering why we shouldn t able to average brl three billion per quarter in the second half of the year leandro miranda deputy executive director deputy officer investor relations officer member of board of executive yes mario basically we are assuming in the guidance that we continue in the path to normalization in the second half for sure we have to go disclaimer that as you know there is a lot of uncertainties on how it s going to progress but our view is this path to normalization the third quarter is going to be better than the third quarter that probably got a lot of the cost of claims that came from the peak but it s still not a normal quarter because there are two costs that should be impacting it we expect a gradual convergence of the inflation index that impacted the results so reducing the negative impact in our financial results but that s also something that we are cautious on forecast so i think you should take our guidance as one that takes a view of that we are going to a normalization but not a total normalization from the beginning of the third quarter it s something that will happen with some graduality mario pierry bank of america analyst okay and just to follow up on the insurance also our ability to increase prices going forward for premiums and for your plans how do you think about that going into next year leandro miranda deputy executive director deputy officer investor relations officer member of board of executive well i think we are going to have a couple of benefits there the first one is that with the improvement of the economy pretty much companies have bradesco s ability of a premium plan for their employees so we have seen that we have a very high correlation in sales of our plans as the economy is getting better that s the first one the second one is that we have the plan that really affects the customers so the plan that you have seen here hardly ever would be accepted in other insurance companies that s the reason why more and more people are buying the plan from us so it s another of incentive in the clients and therefore we shall be keeping on the increase in revenues but of course the market is going to depend on the price there is no way that we can that but the quality is being well appreciated by the markets in addition we are presenting a very important growth through digital channels in the first half alone we have a little bit more than a million insurance items that were acquired digitally we see that trend continue also as we on the point that we see the perception of value of insurance for customers increasing given the uncertainty we have seen and the risks perceived during the covid crisis so we see a solid demand for life insurance as we understand health insurance we have a premium plan so i think even if the economy has not really fully recovered this the kind of premium growth we are experiencing already starting to show an encouraging trend octavio de lazari chief executive officer yes it s entirely easy to see how the digital channels are improving the sales in there and we are using digital channels not only the bank but in all of our platforms agora is going to start to sell also to offer insurance products to our clients so more and more we are attracting the different pools of clients that we have in order to have a base of more than seven million clients for digital channels but from different platforms so we can see the best from them mario pierry bank of america analyst thank you very much carlos firetti business controller and market relations director okay

even with the usual caveat about the poor reliability of this metric as a predictive indicator this looks like bad news for the second straight month adp projects a decline in job growth with this big swing and a miss on expectations in july they show 330 000 jobs added almost exactly half of what economists expected to see advertisement private sector employment increased by 330 000 jobs from june to july according to the july adp national employment reporttm broadly distributed to the public each month free of charge the adp national employment report is produced by the adp research institute in collaboration with moody s analytics the report which is derived from adp s actual payroll data measures the change in total nonfarm private employment each month on a seasonally adjusted basis the bureau of labor statistics will report its numbers on friday and to some extent using adp as a bellwether is a fool s errand it tends to get the trending correct which is why economists and investors pay attention to their report but month to month reliance is um tricky just be warned that misses to the low side by adp has occasionally been followed by surprisingly good data at bls although their misses tend to run the other direction projections that overshoot bls reports on jobs growth that might be why investors turned a little bearish after the report came out although earnings reports probably had more to do with it the dow jones industrial average fell 168 points or 0 48 while the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite lost 0 32 and 0 05 respectively the july adp employment report showed private sector hiring slowed sharply last month amid a rise in covid 19 infections u s firms added 330 000 new workers in july down from 680 000 in june the labor department will release the july nonfarm payrolls report on friday advertisement cnbc focused more on the report itself noting that it s the most modest growth level in the series since february job creation at private companies tumbled in july as fears mounted over the spreading coronavirus delta variant payroll processing firm adp reported wednesday employers added 330 000 positions for the month a sharp deceleration from the downwardly revised 680 000 in june and well below the 653 000 dow jones estimate june s final total fell from the initial estimate of 692 000 july s job growth was also the smallest gain since february that s a relatively paltry level of growth especially considering the number of open jobs and still unemployed americans receiving pandemic benefits in the most recent weekly jobless claims report the department of labor put the number of continuing pandemic unemployment claims at over nine million cnbc offered a bit more reason to take adp seriously as a predictive indicator while highlighting the expectations for friday s bls result the adp count done in conjunction with moody s analytics comes two days before the more closely watched labor department nonfarm payrolls release the two reports can differ significantly but have been fairly close this year through june adp had averaged about 30 000 fewer jobs a month than the official government tally unlike adp the labor department s count includes government jobs and is expected to show a total gain of 845 000 after june s 850 000 increase advertisement if that comes to pass it would be a yuuuuge miss on the part of adp if the two have correlated this well all year it s tough to see how they could miss the mark in july by 500 000 but it s certainly possible at stake is the biden administration s claims to be building back better but the issue might be whether they re building back at all the sidelined workers are not coming back to the labor force and that is creating shortages of both labor and material that has slowed economic activity while sending prices higher the inflation risks have strengthened making the arguments of transitory spikes all but demolished now the administration wants to argue that a little inflation isn t necessarily bad but it s tough to see this level of inflation as a good trend especially as it erodes the buying power that the administration claims as a genuine result of their policies that will collapse in september when pandemic ui benefit programs end and suddenly workers will have much less leverage while experiencing higher costs of living if the jobs growth trend starts declining then that leverage will dissipate even faster stay tuned for friday s report to see whether adp got the trend call correct

26 8 million for the quarter ended june 30 2020 the decrease compared to the prior year was primarily the result of lower margin driven by lower customer counts partially offset by a decrease in g a

reported retail gross margin of 26 4 million compared to retail gross margin of 45 0 million for the quarter ended june 30 2020 this decrease of 18 6 million was primarily attributable to fewer

255 7302 spark energy inc condensed consolidated statements of operations in thousands except per share data unaudited 1 reflects the retail gross margin attributable to our retail electricity segment or retail natural gas segment as applicable retail gross margin is a non gaap financial measure see reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures section below for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin to their most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with gaap 2 reflects the retail gross margin for the retail electricity segment or retail natural gas segment as applicable divided by the total volumes in mwh or mmbtu respectively 3 excludes volumes 8 402 mwhs related to winter storm uri impact for the six months ended june 30 2021 4 retail gross margin electricity per mwh excludes winter storm uri impact reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda less i customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period plus or minus ii net loss gain on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization this conforms to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in our senior credit facility we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under the company s senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for the company s debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of the company s financial condition and or liquidity we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our performance and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful for an understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity due to its use in covenants in our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure historical cost basis and specific items not reflective of ongoing operations the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less iii net asset optimization revenues expenses iv net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments v net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments and vi gains losses from non recurring events including non recurring market volatility retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity segments as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the current quarter we have made the decision to add back the financial loss related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the storm combined with the impact of the scarcity pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss net cash provided by operating activities and operating income loss and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision making process the following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss and net cash provided used in operating activities for each of the periods indicated the following table presents a reconciliation of retail gross margin to operating income loss for each of the periods indicated 1 retail gross margin

the global economy is set to have the largest post recession recovery in 80 years while the bounce back will be uneven across each country global growth is expected to reach 5 6 percent this year while many professionals and civilians alike were worried about the post pandemic economy it is set to make a huge rebound still progress isn t a straight line millions of people are returning to work some of whom have been making more money on unemployment benefits than at their previous job with so many people looking for work and jobs in many fields to be filled there is a disconnect between them every company wants to hire the best employees and as more and more people go back to work the economy will thrive once again unemployment in virginia the unemployment rate was 5 3 percent in january compared to the previous year the number was 2 8 percent higher while there is still room for growth the number of unemployed workers has decreased as people go back to work there are still positions to be filled for businesses to grow and expand the economy unemployment will have to go down for this to happen but that s why companies and workers alike need to find the right match hiring new employees is more complex these days but there are a variety of methods businesses can use to find the right people hiring methods one of the most important things for companies to do whether hiring nurses customer service representatives or even custodians is to run a background check for job candidates these checks don t just provide the information necessary to find out about their criminal record they offer details about their past addresses names and will even verify their employment and education if the person isn t being honest about something on their resume you will likely be able to find out by running a background check next there are thousands of recent college graduates entering the workforce in may of 2021 around half of the people who graduated college in 2020 were still looking for a job now 2021 graduates have joined them if you are hiring for positions that require no previous experience don t overlook recent graduates they will be motivated to work for less to gain that experience and are the perfect employees for training in exactly the way you want to mold them to find the perfect recent graduate attend career events at colleges that will match you with the right candidate using social media can also facilitate the search for the right employees first you can get out the word that you are hiring using social media you can find candidates through platforms like linkedin you can even check up on someone you are interested in hiring by going on their profiles whoever you are hiring whether they are a recent graduate or an experienced worker social media is a great tool for hiring finally you should institute a referral program when you work with employees you trust asking them for referrals is a great way to find other amazing employees good people associate with good people if someone who is hard working and intelligent says the same about their friend you might find someone that is perfect for the position the recovering economy as companies hire new employees and grow the economy will expand with it it s a transition that won t be instant but it will be accomplished workers need jobs and companies need employees while some of the people on unemployment were making better money than they were at their previous jobs and businesses want experienced employees compromise will be made it is inevitable the rest of the unemployment benefits will run out and people will need to go back to work when they do and the country is at full employment again the economy will bounce back and thrive more than ever before it is a time unlike any other when it comes to the economy it has recovered faster than most people anticipated but there is still work to be done businesses need employees and workers need positions when the right matches are found everyone will benefit whether you re a company hiring or someone looking for a job there is an opportunity to grow together and thrive story by ryan beitler ryan is a journalist writer and blogger who has written about the economy and business for dozens of publications

on july 31 the national moratorium on evictions which the centers for disease control put into place as part of its statutory authority to make and enforce such regulations as in judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases expired millions of americans faced eviction after job loss during the pandemic left them behind on rent actually saying that the eviction moratorium expired doesn t do justice to what happened the moratorium was killed by the united states supreme court s conservative majority they ignored the federal agency s clear statutory authority and ruled 5 4 that the cdc lacked the power to issue a national order halting evictions fortunately the biden administration is working to put a new moratorium into place in the next few days according to the post and now we ll see whether the supreme court has the nerve to scrap the new policy and throw a potentially huge number of americans out onto the streets and what exactly five conservative lawyers with no relevant expertise are doing second guessing an important piece of the nation s public health policy in the midst of a deadly pandemic is a good question to ask more broadly federal housing policy is a mess and that shouldn t surprise you housing policy is largely urban policy and the interests of cities and especially of the urban poor are badly underrepresented in federal policymaking circles but the political economy of housing policy may be about to change housing policy is increasingly becoming a generational issue that cuts across race and class rather than one that mostly affects the urban poor the reason for that is simple in the american cities that combine robust job growth with access to culture and amenities that millennials and generation z value places like new york city san francisco los angeles boston washington san diego and miami housing has become increasingly unaffordable young people who want to live near where they work are increasingly priced out of rentals never mind the market to buy a home which is completely out of reach for those without family money housing is expensive because we haven t built enough of it to keep up with people who live or want to live in america s vibrant cities the numbers in new york are startling but not atypical a 2020 report by the citizens budget commission lays out the problem between 2010 and 2018 the number of jobs in new york city increased 22 percent while the housing stock increased only 4 percent resulting in only 0 19 housing units being added for every net new job created over the last decade a wider gulf between job and housing growth than any city except san francisco the result according to the cbc is increasing household sizes higher rates of overcrowding persistently low vacancy rates and a rapidly declining number of housing units that are affordable to low and moderate income households why is under supply such a problem one big reason is nimbyism i e not in my backyard opposition to new buildings and in particular to the kinds of large scale building projects that are needed to address under supply nimby opposition to increased density to re zoning that s often required to get it and to the transport improvements needed to make new development accessible to the urban core these are key barriers to achieving normal vacancy rates and increased affordability and all of this is an acute problem for young people who are finding it more difficult to get ahead when their incomes are eaten up by student loans and spiraling rent younger people are noticing that a lot of nimbys are relatively affluent boomers who own their homes an important recent academic paper compares millennial versus boomer views about dense development and urban housing affordability the upshot millennials are feeding a new yimby yes in my backyard movement many millennials favor high density urban development as a way to make housing more affordable and many millennials blame high housing prices on boomer nimbys who stubbornly oppose large scale development in favor of single family construction one anecdote that s been making the rounds on social media concerns a nimby in berkeley calif who opposed a new housing project because it would she said cast a shadow on her zucchini garden you re talking about zucchinis really because i m struggling to pay rent retorted a furious yimby at a berkeley planning meeting nimbys have one argument they return to again and again building more market rate housing they say doesn t lower rents it just provides more housing for the affluent but the weight of the evidence tells us creating more housing supply does exactly what you d expect it lowers the price of housing overall and if you re worried about gentrification it s important to remember that gentrifiers in the substantial business of upgrading older housing stock for rich people absolutely love nimbys nimby opposition to new construction especially dense housing makes projects focused on upscale renovations of existing housing stock more valuable that puts the wealthy in direct competition with the non wealthy for a stagnant supply of existing housing we need a lot more building and at a scale that can only be provided by private developers but that doesn t mean we should have a laissez faire market for urban housing city governments should regulate to encourage new development to include affordable units this is what nyc does with its mandatory inclusionary zoning in exchange for generous tax abatements and the easing of project height and density restrictions developers set aside 30 percent of units for lower income tenants and subsidize them to reduce rent those units are subject to new york s rent stabilization rules that limit rent increases the remaining 70 percent are priced at market rent we should also subsidize some housing directly although given the size of the under supply problem the government would never be able to budget enough money to solve the problem through direct subsidy alone and given new york s poor record as a landlord a major expansion of public housing is simply not in the cards i ll end with a question that i m asking in all seriousness how much is nimbyism driven by a genuine but economically dubious concern that building more housing raises housing prices and how much of it is older people who just don t like change if it s the former then data about the actual effect of building more housing even market rate housing might have some effect but if it s the latter then nimbyism isn t so much a view as a disposition and there s not much to be done about it other than wonder how people who don t like change ended up living in our most vibrant cities rather than some sleepy place where no one wants to build in their backyard

our terminals performed well during the second quarter and we are very excited to report that construction of our sponsor s diluent recovery unit project or dru was completed in july the dru is now in the start up phase and our sponsor expects the facility to be placed into service during the third quarter in addition construction of all major items at our sponsor s destination facility at port

partnership with long term take or pay revenues while providing transportation safety and environmental benefits to our customers as well as providing increased market access and additional jobs along the rail routes we continue to be very excited about our future as well as the future of our sponsor s new dru and port arthur terminal as we engage with our customers regarding the second phase of usd s growth which could include a second dru customer committing to delivering the next 50 000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen into the dru with the resulting drubittm available to be transloaded through the partnership s hardisty rail terminal to the gulf coast and other potential destinations added mr borgen we look forward to keeping our investors updated with future announcements regarding the dru partnership s second quarter 2021 liquidity operational and financial results substantially all of the partnership s cash flows are generated from multi year take or pay terminalling services agreements related to its crude oil terminals which include minimum monthly commitment fees the partnership s customers include major integrated oil companies refiners and marketers the majority of which are investment grade rated the partnership s operating results for the second quarter of 2021 relative to the same quarter in 2020 were primarily influenced by higher revenue at its stroud terminal during the quarter due to higher rates that are based on crude oil index pricing differentials also during the quarter the partnership recognized revenue that was previously deferred at the stroud terminal during the first quarter of 2021 associated with the make up right options that are granted to the partnership s customers additionally revenue at the hardisty terminal in the second quarter of 2021 relative to the second quarter of 2020 was higher due to a favorable variance resulting from the change in the canadian exchange rate associated with the partnership s canadian dollar denominated contracts and increased rates on certain of the partnership s hardisty agreements the partnership experienced higher operating costs during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in subcontracted rail services costs and pipeline fees associated with higher throughput partially offset by lower selling general and administrative costs net income increased in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily because of the operating factors discussed above coupled with lower interest expense incurred during the 2021 period resulting from lower interest rates and a lower weighted average balance of debt outstanding the partnership also recognized a small non cash foreign currency transaction gain in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to a non cash loss recognized in the 2020 comparative period partially offsetting was a higher non cash loss associated with the partnership s interest rate derivatives during the second quarter of 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020 net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter increased 160 relative to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the operating factors discussed above and the general timing of receipts and payments of accounts receivable accounts payable and deferred revenue balances adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow dcf increased by 28 and 48 respectively for the quarter relative to the second quarter of 2020 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily a result of the operating factors discussed above dcf was also positively impacted by a decrease in cash paid for interest during the quarter partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes and higher maintenance capital expenditures incurred during the current quarter which included technology upgrades and safety maintenance at the partnership s hardisty and stroud terminals as of june 30 2021 the partnership had approximately 3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing capacity of 206 million on its 385 million senior secured

ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property depreciation amortization and impairment related to real estate properties and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management believes that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however management believes ffo and ffo per share to be important supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of iip s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items primarily depreciation expense historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time however real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions iip believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods ffo and ffo per share are used by management to evaluate the reit s operating performance and these measures are the predominant measures used by the reit industry and industry analysts to evaluate reits for these reasons management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share management believes that affo and affo per share are also appropriate supplemental measures of a reit s operating performance iip calculates affo by adding to ffo certain non cash and infrequent or unpredictable expenses which may impact comparability consisting of non cash stock based compensation expense and non cash interest expense generally for the three and six months ended june 30 2021 ffo diluted affo and ffo and affo per diluted share include the dilutive impact of the assumed full exchange of the exchangeable senior notes

share for the three and six months ended june 30 2020 and as such were treated as anti dilutive for purposes of calculating ffo affo and ffo and affo per diluted share for the three and six months ended june 30 2020 iip s computation of ffo and affo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and affo utilized by other equity reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such reits further ffo and affo do not represent cash flow available for management s discretionary use ffo and affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of iip s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of iip s liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund iip s cash needs including iip s ability to pay dividends or make distributions ffo and affo should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with gaap as measures of

the big bank posted a rare earnings disappointment for the second quarter bank of america bac 0 94 just did something it rarely does reported revenue that fell short of analysts estimates for the second quarter in this fool live video clip recorded on july 19 fool com contributor matt frankel cfp and industry focus host jason moser discuss the numbers and whether investors should be concerned 10 stocks we like better than bank of america when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and bank of america wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 jason moser let s talk about this bank of america numbers because that s another one where i was looking through this call it was interesting to see the revenue down modestly 3 5 from a year ago but it sounded like investment banking fees played a role there but what stood out to you there with bank of america s quarter matthew frankel yes bank of america they missed revenue expectations which is really rare for a bank banks generally beat expectations i really don t know why they even bother putting out expectations because they just beat them every quarter but bank of america had a rare miss they missed revenue by about 200 million but as you said a lot of this was on the investment banking side specifically the trading revenue remember i just said that jpmorgan jpm 0 51 blew expectations out of the water for trading revenue between the two fixed income and equities they beat by 1 8 billion bank of america did not bank of america missed trading revenue estimates on the fixed income side by 800 million so 800 million lower than expectations if they missed their revenue expectations by 200 million but missed trading revenue expectations by 800 million that means the rest of their business actually beat expectations moser yeah frankel another concerning thing net interest margin was i mentioned this is a problem across the board but was even lower than expected net interest margin was 1 61 that s 26 basis points lower than it was a year ago and a little bit lower than analysts were looking for like jpmorgan they released some reserves they released 1 6 billion in reserves their loan book grew in the second quarter slightly but for the first time since the pandemic started i guess consumers are going to start spending money one of the most interesting things and then i ll stop talking about bank of america because i talked about them enough on our show they actually put out a lot of consumer spending data in their earnings presentation remember brian moynihan ahead a couple of weeks ago said consumers were spending about 20 more than they were before the pandemic moser yeah frankel but now we have the hard numbers it s actually 22 more than the first half of 2019 he broke it down into categories consumers are spending more than pre pandemic not just 2020 everyone knows we re spending more money on gas and groceries and stuff like that now than we were in 2020 i don t think i bought gas during the second quarter of 2020 frankel you probably didn t either moser i d tell you i m still not buying a whole heck of a lot of it though it s a lot more now than it was a year ago that s for sure frankel the average bank of america customer is spending 34 more on retail than they were before the pandemic 20 more on services 16 more on food and 8 more on gas than they were in 2019 they re spending 13 less on travel so that really hasn t come back yet but even with that across the board that s 22 higher consumer spending than before the pandemic deposits are up loans are down but how long is that going to last if people are spending like this moser yeah that s a good point deposits are up 14 that s considerable but to your point again more credit reserves released much like the loan demand that s another common thread we re seeing and it s a good indicator these banks are feeling better and better about being back to where we were before 2020 ultimately that s an encouraging sign there but yet another common thread to pay attention to with these banks

he ran unopposed in 2019 we are doing much more and doing much better but also not costing our taxpayers any increase in property taxes he said i ll be happy with that as a legacy he said he s extending himself for one more term in the hope of preparing somebody to take over the job there just aren t people that want to do what is a less than pleasant job for lower than market wages it has to be somebody that s half volunteering or more than half and wanting to help the town he said we need to find more of those people like we used to have republican town committee chairman david m lahm explained the republican decision to endorse mattson by saying both parties want the best people to run lyme it s not about winning it s about the town both mattson and lahm pointed out the democrats

with incumbent democrat fred harger in an uncontested race lahm said the republicans could have run another candidate but chose not to fred s a very valued member of the board lahm said why would i

the challenge that china s rise poses for liberal democracies puts a premium on pushing the frontiers of science and technology western economies have a deep ability to innovate when they have the will to do so as the rapid development of safe and effective covid 19 vaccines has shown but how can this momentum be maintained across a wide range of areas when we are not confronting an acute crisis in many respects the united states is leading the way soon after taking office president joe biden elevated the director of the white house office of science and technology policy to cabinet status and appointed the renowned geneticist molecular biologist and mathematician eric lander to the post and the us innovation and competition act passed by the senate in june matches this signal of intent with action promising to commit 250bn to promote emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence robotics and quantum computing america is serious about avoiding a future in which the west must rely on authoritarian regimes for technology in the same way we once depended on them for oil but it is less clear what role the united kingdom the smaller partner in the new atlantic charter that biden and uk prime minister boris johnson signed in june will play in securing technological leadership for the west the uk government s plan to support high risk high reward scientific research by establishing an advanced research and invention agency modelled on the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa is a welcome step as is the uk s new life sciences strategy the government has also indicated that the country s departure from the european union will likely prompt it to adopt a more forward looking stance on gene editing and reduce bureaucratic obstacles for researchers but the uk has not yet done nearly enough to adapt its post brexit science and technology strategy it cannot match the us and china in terms of either financial heft or population nor should policymakers assume that other powers are standing still india s deep tech market is developing fast while the eu is increasing tech investment and reforming its outdated tax treatment of stock options thereby removing an obstacle that has long held back its tech entrepreneurs uk chancellor of the exchequer rishi sunak has committed to increase government research and development spending to 22bn 31bn by 2025 which shows that what is big for the uk will always be modest in comparison to the us and china the uk therefore needs to make that money go much further it needs to use policies and institutions as multipliers which in practice means developing a greater risk appetite and to experiment with novel mechanisms for allocating research funds the country already has world class research infrastructure but funding and researchers time are too often diverted to bureaucratic tasks one promising alternative may be fast grants launched in the us in april 2020 by patrick collison co founder of the digital payments firm stripe and the george mason university economist tyler cowen to provide emergency science funding during the covid 19 pandemic by developing an application form that took less than 30 minutes to complete and making funding decisions within 48 hours the scheme last year provided 50mn to 260 projects another idea which we proposed in a recent essay collection and could yield new ideas and knowledge is a horizon research fellowship that would award long term grants to a small number of promising researchers every year the uk also needs to engage with frontier technologies that will reshape society in the years ahead in particular the country s expertise in life sciences and climate technology should generate a rich reservoir of basic research on the future of food and biotech yielding innovations that improve human and planetary health but as the uk develops its comparative advantage in this domain it will need to exploit its newfound ability to diverge from the eu by becoming a nation of early adopters that productively adopts and diffuses new technologies removing the barriers that stifle markets in fields ranging from drone delivery and lab grown meat to autonomous vehicles will attract innovators from across the world project syndicate

full year guidance of both revenue and adjusted ebitda financial outlook as of august 4 2021 q2 holdings is providing guidance for its third quarter of 2021 and revised guidance for its full year 2021 the financial information below represents forward looking non gaap financial information including estimates of non gaap revenue and adjusted ebitda gaap net loss is the most comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda differs from gaap net loss in that it excludes items such as depreciation and amortization stock based compensation acquisition related costs interest income taxes unoccupied lease charges partnership termination charges loss on extinguishment of debt and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting q2 holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort therefore q2 holdings has not provided guidance for gaap net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward looking adjusted ebitda guidance to gaap net loss however it is important to note that these excluded items could be material to our results computed in accordance with gaap in future periods q2 holdings is providing guidance for its third quarter of 2021 as follows total non gaap revenue of 125 0 million to 126 5 million which would represent year over year growth of 19 percent to 21 percent adjusted ebitda of 6 2 million to 6 8 million q2 holdings is providing updated guidance for the full year 2021 as follows total non gaap revenue of 497 5 million to 499 5 million which would represent year

gaap research and development expense non gaap general and administrative expense non gaap operating expense non gaap operating income loss non gaap net income non gaap net income per share and non gaap diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding management believes that these non gaap financial measures are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that q2 does not consider indicative of its core performance in the case of non gaap revenue q2 adjusts revenue to exclude the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting adjustments in the case of adjusted ebitda q2 adjusts net loss for such items as interest taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation acquisition related costs unoccupied lease charges partnership termination charges loss on extinguishment of debt and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting in the case of non gaap gross margin and non gaap gross profit q2 adjusts gross profit and gross margin for stock based compensation amortization of acquired technology acquisition related costs and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting in the case of non gaap sales and marketing expense non gaap research and development expense and non gaap general and administrative expense q2 adjusts the corresponding gaap expense to exclude stock based compensation non gaap operating expense is calculated by taking the sum of non gaap sales and marketing expenses non gaap research and development expense and non gaap general and administrative expense in the case of non gaap operating income loss non gaap net income loss and non gaap net income loss per share q2 adjusts operating loss and net loss respectively for stock based compensation acquisition related costs amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired intangibles unoccupied lease charges partnership termination charges and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting and with respect to non gaap net income amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and loss on extinguishment of debt in the case of non gaap diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding q2 adjusts gaap diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding by the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares which include i employee equity incentive plans excluding the impact of unrecognized stock based compensation expense and ii convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants including the anti dilutive impact of the company s note hedge and capped call

a 2 6 million increase in employee related costs pipeline and storage operating income decreased 11 3 million to 65 3 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 compared with 76 5 million in the

third quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of 21 0 million for the three and nine months ended june 30 2020 due to the non recurring nature of this benefit we

additional information www faruqilaw com rkt there is no cost or obligation to you faruqi faruqi is a leading minority and woman owned national securities law firm with offices in new york delaware pennsylvania california and georgia as detailed below the lawsuit focuses on whether the company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and or misleading statements and or failing to disclose that 1 rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets 2 rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment 3 the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 4 as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as the company s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 5 rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and 6 as a result of the foregoing defendants positive statements about the company s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on may 5 2021 rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented the company s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the collapse in the company s gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by the company during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results defendant booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket s lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets defendant booth also admitted that certain of these trends began at the end of q1 i e before the massive insider sales by rhi on this news rocket s class a common stock price fell 3 79 per share or 16 62 to close at 19 01 per share on may 6 2021 on heavy volume of over 37 million shares traded as the market continued to digest the news in the days that

i used to work at a camera store with a young woman who would occasionally tell stories about a ghost she was having sex with as she described the encounters it became clear to all of us who worked in the store that the ghost in the stories matched the exact physical description of her boyfriend and that she was for some reason relating sexual encounters with him that would have been entirely normal if she wasn t framing them as assignations with a spirit to this day i have no idea why she told these stories though i suspect it was her way of talking about sex from a safe remove of verbalizing sexual thoughts through a layer of fiction ghosts or at least stories about ghosts provide us with a unique opportunity to rationalize that which we cannot or are unwilling to explain from a bump in the night to a bang in the dark in our narratives they take whatever form serves a purpose and even when they re unhelpful in the moment it seems as though ghost stories always end with a spirit s unfinished business contributing to the needs of the living i thought about that coworker and the need that her stories might have filled when reading one of this week s more intriguing comic book releases which involves an artist begging to be haunted thanks to phoenix comics for helping to sort through the numerous new releases this week only some of which involve wayward spirits lost on planet earth the introduction of this paperback explains that it began as a critique of star trek s politics but author magdalene visaggio found that to be too much of a polemic until she pivoted to focus on one character s story of self discovery in a setting that is clearly trek inspired without being entirely infringing perhapsmight have benefitted from a bit more time baking in the story oven as it is the book sometimes still feels like polemic in lieu of plot but that doesn t make for an entirely unenjoyable read particularly when it poses its most intriguing questions involving the unavoidable links between science and colonization we often think of curiosity learning and space exploration as an unassailable good but who gets to explore and who gets left behind what happens to those new lives and new civilizations once they re sought out these difficult questions are posed and not entirely answered as our cast of characters embark on more personal journeys of self discovery asking an entirely different set of questions about how best to live an authentic life is this story personal or political it is in fragments both but seldom does one focus illuminate the other writer magdalene visaggio illustrator claudio aguirre letterer ibd s zakk saam editor joe corallo designer tim daniel the me you love in the dark issue 1 not only is this a book with for the majority of its pages a single character talking to herself but it is also almost entirely contained within a single house a one character bottle episode is the reddest of red flags butis a fine start to a darkly meditative story about how when we re alone with our thoughts our thoughts can become a character of their own a frustrated artist struggles to compose new work after renting a house that is she was promised haunted plagued by artistic blocks and a morbid drinking habit she finds herself pleading with whatever reluctant ghosts might be present to torture her back to creative fulfillment what she may not realize is that she s doing a thorough job of torturing herself artist running on empty is a fine first half of a premise and ghost with an unknown agenda intervenes is an intriguing twist but that twist comes on such a late page in this first issue that some readers may find themselves flipping ahead to find the part where the action starts story skottie young art jorge corona colors jean francois beaulieu lettering nake piekos of blambot 3d modeling david stoll editors joel enos went wagenschutz production artist deanna phelps amelia erroway castaway commander a lavishly illustrated lovingly told story is every bit as delightful as the best pixar films it is a world of steampunk airships and massive flying beasts where the young daughter of a wealthy commander yearns to break free of the strict confines of her military life and to embark on airborne adventures of her own our hero amelia is both brave and reckless a dangerous combination particularly when combined with her father s desire to over shelter his daughter his reasons for concern make more sense and become more complex as we learn more about the family s past when a storm grounds her father s ship amelia sees an opportunity she steals the vessel and heads out into dangerous weather nearly dying before she s rescued by a scrappy family of explorers and adventurers living deep in an uncharted jungle it is there that amelia discovers the freedom she d always sought and also the responsibilities to others that come along with it an engrossing adventure on every page amelia erroway is perfectly paced with scenes of soaring swashbuckling mixed with tender family drama the book is targeted to ages 8 to 12 but is likely to be a great joy for readers far beyond that range i can t wait to give a copy to

nonprofit group mainers guarding right whales launched a new billboard campaign this week to inform tourists that lobster dinners at seaside harbors come at a steep price to north atlantic right whales according to organization officials the billboard which will be up for the rest of the month two weeks in one location and two in another is in massachusetts and asks is your lobster whale safe the billboard asks drivers to text 72345 for more information the number links to the organization s website and the campaign for a whale safe designation for u s lobster currently no such designation exists but the group is fighting to change that and more with the new awareness campaign related researchers test ropeless lobster traps we believe if we can educate and inform travelers about the near extinction of right whales and the cause they will take action and help protect the whales barbara skapa founder and executive director of mainers guarding right whales said in the release the organization paid 3 750 for two billboards which will run for two weeks each with the first facing northbound traffic at one location along u s route 1 until aug 16 and the other along interstate 95 from aug 16 to the end of the month advertisement beyond simply supporting their mission mainers guarding right whales urges consumers to ask for whale safe lobster when buying lobster and encourage lobstermen to use ropeless fishing technology or lighter ropes to let whales break free of entanglement it also recommends consumers buy their lobster from a scuba diver which is illegal in maine but not in massachusetts support the marine stewardship council in certifying whale safe lobster eat only marine stewardship council certified seafood and consider avoiding lobster until there is a certified whale safe designation the north atlantic right whale is critically endangered only about 366 of the whales are still alive having lost more than 10 percent of their population in under five years because of fishing entanglements ship strikes and low calving rates an estimated 85 percent of right whales show signs of entanglements according to officials from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration but maine lobstermen have long contended that not only are they not causing the problems they aren t seeing right whales in maine waters since 2017 33 right whales have been killed according to noaa of those 21 were in canada and 12 were in the united states advertisement ten incidents were attributed to ship strikes including two in u s waters but none can be linked to the maine lobster industry the country s lobster fishery has long been heralded as an example of a sustainable fishery largely thanks to measures implemented locally including minimum and maximum size restrictions to protect both juveniles and breeding stock prohibitions on keeping females with visible eggs on their tails and statewide trap limits according to marianne lacroix director of the maine lobster marketing collaborative the rhetoric around maine lobster s role in harming right whales does not reflect the facts it s unfortunate that this campaign ignores the decades of cooperation from maine lobstermen and proactive changes they have made to protect right whales lacroix said citing other protective measures including eliminating surface rope setting more traps on each buoy line to reduce vertical lines in the water incorporating weak links to allow whales to break free if they become entangled and closures in areas where whales are known to aggregate the campaign also provides confusing and sometimes inaccurate information for consumers who are trying to make good choices in the foods they eat lacroix said sustainability and preserving the marine environment are essential to the culture of lobstering values and practices passed down through generations maine s lobster fishery has multiple sustainable designations from the gulf of maine research institute monterey bay aquarium and the federal government the sustainable certification from the marine stewardship council was suspended last year after a court case that highlighted the national marine fisheries service s procedural failure to provide the proper documentation to authorize the fishery advertisement industry officials hope the certification will be restored soon now that a new biological opinion has been finalized plans to help protect the critically endangered whales are underway with the proposed north atlantic large whale take reduction plan which calls for a 60 percent reduction in right whale deaths and serious injuries this year and the final biological opinion from noaa released in may which increases that target to 98 percent over the next 10 years the details for the take reduction plan are expected to come later this summer or in early fall a hotly contested draft of the plan was released late last year the proposal includes plans to reduce the number of vertical lines introduce weak insertions or weak rope into buoy lines and add additional seasonal restricted areas that are closed to buoy lines but would allow ropeless fishing among others the plan does not include measures to help prevent ship strikes or reduce mortality and serious injuries in canadian waters which account for the majority of right whale deaths the biological opinion s conservation framework calls for noaa to develop a roadmap to ropeless fishing in the next year that considers research needs as well as the economic operational and enforcement aspects of ropeless fishing the document suggests that the technology could be one management tool used to achieve the required risk reduction ropeless lobster fishing technology allows lobster traps to rise to the surface after activation via smart phone signals mainers guarding right whales said in its news release advertisement mainers guarding right whales also believes the new technology is the solution to rope and gear entanglements despite its costs citing in its news release promising trials in canada and elsewhere in new england ropeless fishing has not been tested in maine patrick keliher commissioner of the maine department of marine resources criticized what he called a pr stunt for oversimplifying the complex challenge of transitioning to ropeless fishing from the testing phase to a commercial scale operation keliher has on multiple occasions voiced serious concerns about the technology which is still under development and is expensive it would cost an estimated half a billion dollars or more to convert the state s entire fleet keliher said previously that ropeless fishing is an untenable solution that would require them to completely reinvent the fishery ropeless fishing technology is not currently a viable option he said in a statement on tuesday the technology must be further developed to ensure that all fixed and mobile gear fleets can locate ropeless lobster gear to avoid conflict and lost gear enforcement of fisheries with ropeless gear is also a hurdle with many unanswered questions marine patrol will need to be equipped with technology to locate retrieve and set back gear an enforcement action which is critical to the management of this valuable resource but skapa does not appear deterred the fishing industry in maine has a long history of adapting to change in the face of new challenges and we believe with the right support it will do just that she said in the release related headlines researchers test ropeless lobster trap technology with eye toward whale protection send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more this article was originally published on fool com all figures quoted in us dollars unless otherwise stated square nyse sq recently agreed to buy afterpay otc aftp f an australian buy now pay later bnpl service provider for 29 billion in stock the deal represents a premium of 21 9 over afterpay s ten day weighted average share price and values the company at 25 times this year s sales square s stock rallied following the announcement which accompanied a solid second quarter report on aug 1 that beat analysts expectations meanwhile shares of its rival paypal nasdaq pypl which had already been sliding following its mixed second quarter report on july 28 fell even further after square posted its earnings report and announced the afterpay deal square s takeover of afterpay counters paypal s pay in 4 bnpl service which it launched last august both afterpay and pay in 4 let customers pay for goods in four interest free payments but square plans to integrate afterpay into both its seller ecosystem and its rapidly growing cash app which already provides peer to peer payments bitcoin crypto btc purchases and stock trading services should paypal s investors worry about square s latest move or is there enough room for both companies and their other rivals to thrive in the expanding bnpl market why is square paying a premium for afterpay square s takeover of afterpay which will close in the first quarter of calendar 2022 initially seems pricey it will pay nearly a quarter of its market cap and significantly dilute its existing shares with an all stock transaction for a company that will likely only boost its 2022 revenue by about 5 afterpay s revenue rose 78 in fiscal 2021 which ended in june but square s revenue surged 101 in 2020 and is expected to rise 102 this year therefore square seems to be paying a high premium and diluting its shares for a company that generates slower growth however square s growth in 2020 and most of 2021 was largely driven by bitcoin trades during the pandemic if we exclude those bitcoin sales square s revenue only rose 17 in 2020 and analysts expect its total revenue to grow just 13 in 2022 as those cryptocurrency trades normalize however they still expect afterpay s revenue to rise 66 in fiscal 2022 so it could generate smoother growth than square s volatile core business afterpay would also expand square s overseas presence since it only generates about half of its underlying sales in the united states afterpay s active customers grew 63 to 16 1 million in 2021 and it serves nearly 100 000 merchants worldwide square s cash app hit 40 million active customers in june up from 36 million at the end of 2020 merging those two high growth platforms together and adding afterpay s bnpl services to its platforms could significantly expand square s ecosystem should paypal be concerned paypal was already in a vulnerable position after its second quarter revenue growth and third quarter revenue forecast missed wall street s expectations it also warned that its loss of ebay to its dutch rival adyen which concludes its three year transition this year will throttle its near term revenue growth that slowdown raises doubts about paypal s ambitious plans to more than double its annual revenue by 2025 as well as concerns about its recent decision to hike its processing fees for u s merchants paypal operates in over 200 markets worldwide and its number of active accounts rose 16 year over year to 403 million in the second quarter its peer to peer payments app venmo serves more than 50 million active users paypal repeatedly cited its bnpl service as a growth engine during its latest conference call over seven million consumers have used its bnpl service for more than 20 million transactions so far the service has processed more than 3 5 billion in tpv total payment volume since its launch with 1 5 billion of that total processed in the second quarter alone that figure sounds impressive but 1 5 billion only accounted for 0 5 of paypal s total tpv of 311 billion during the quarter it also reveals its pay in 4 platform is still much smaller than afterpay which generated 15 6 billion in underlying sales comparable to paypal s tpv in fiscal 2021 paypal previously offered pay later options with its revolving credit line and an easy payments feature but pay in 4 marked its first step into the streamlined interest free bnpl market but it arrived late to the party afterpay was founded in 2014 while its australian rival zip was founded in 2013 the bottom line on its own square s takeover of afterpay won t derail paypal s long term growth bank of america estimates the market for bnpl apps will expand 10 15 fold by 2025 so there could be plenty of room for square and paypal to expand without trampling each other however square s massive acquisition of afterpay which instantly gives it a bigger share of the bnpl market than paypal highlights the key difference between the two fintech giants square is consistently more daring as seen with its early moves in bitcoin trades stock trades and the expansion of its seller services while paypal is more conservative therefore investors should question why paypal didn t buy afterpay first and if it needs to get more aggressive to hit its lofty growth targets for 2025 this

founder chief executive officer and director thank you hi everyone with me is rick costello our cfo and jed dolson our coo thank you for joining the call as the operator mentioned if you re joining us by phone today the presentation that accompanies this earnings call can be found on our web page at greenbrickpartners com at the top of our webpage click on investors governance then click on the option that says reporting and scroll down the page until you see the second quarter investor call presentation i ll give everybody a few seconds to do this with our all time record results achieved this quarter green brick s annualized q2 2021 return on equity hit a new high of 30 2 thanks to a great team effort we provided our investors some of the best returns in the industry even better we expect these returns to accelerate our total revenues were 1 1 billion on a trailing 12 month basis from q1 to q2 we increased homebuilding revenues by 54 and our eps doubled we continue to be confident that our revenues and earnings will continue to grow sequentially each quarter this year our core focus on land development and our dominant presence and reputation in our markets has resulted in a 133 increase in our lots owned and controlled from the prior year our superior capacity to source new land has allowed us to grow our units under construction an astounding 95 as compared to june 30 2020 and provides a ready supply of new housing to meet demand our gross margin reached 26 8 this quarter this is up 360 basis points from the prior year and up 140 basis points from the first quarter as green brick has achieved pricing power in our core markets of dallas fort worth and atlanta in order to capitalize on rising prices and demand we have paced sales by limiting our available homes for sale to generally those with at least the slab foundation poured we have also achieved price increases in excess of rising input costs we believe this focus on price over pace will sustain our industry leading margins and strong financial performance through the remainder of 2021 in addition to our prepared remarks on the call we will plan to provide more detailed insights into our growth strategy capital planning and operational initiatives driving the record results this quarter this event will also provide a unique opportunity in fielding questions to our division presidents and purchasing teams the investor day webcast will stream from 9 00 a m to 12 00 p m central daylight time and we encourage all of our attendees on today s call to register for this event through the investor day 2021 option under the investors governance section in our web page please flip to slide four of our presentation we are a diversified builder with eight brands in four major markets with a wide array of product types and price ranges we believe the stratification of products will continue to appeal to a broad base of homebuyers and expect that our entry level segment will continue to rapidly expand through the growth of our trophy signature and cb jeni brands as we have discussed in previous calls green brick operates under a much simpler ownership structure than seen in prior years as approximately 70 of our top line revenues are now generated by wholly owned builders and another 10 of our total revenues are generated by subsidiaries with a 10 to 20 minority interest the markets where green brick operates benefit from significant economic and demographic trends which we will explore in detail in the next two slides slide five quantifies the strong population growth over the past decade seen in texas colorado florida and georgia per the 2020 census data out of the 25 largest states in the united states these four states showed some of the highest percentage increases from their populations versus 10 years ago texas led the nation with its resident population expanding just under four million people this decade colorado florida and georgia all show double digit growth over the same period while the population for the u s grew only 7 3 we believe this positive population growth is evidence that our concentration in the sunbelt and sunbelt adjacent states is a winning strategy we expect that in migration to these states from california and the northeastern united states and the strong demographic profiles of the sunbelt will continue to generate positive population growth for many more years and will preserve robust housing demand in our future years on slide six we highlight the economic strength of our core markets and present the decline in active home listings seen in june 2021 from the prior year like every other economy in the country the covid 19 pandemic created a major disruption in commercial activity and led to a significant rise in unemployment early last year however as shown on the right side of the graph on this page atlanta and dallas fort worth have remained remarkably resilient with atlanta and dallas fort worth achieving the lowest and third lowest unemployment rates in may 2021 it is evident that our core markets continue to sustain a strong job market and labor force we believe these economic strengths will continue to support the strong demographic trends in our markets and reinforce housing demand for years to come looking at the left side of the graph you can see that dallas fort worth and atlanta had the largest 12 month decline in active listings as of june 30 2021 of the 10 largest msas with listings down 59 and 53 respectively this remarkable drop in listings is evidence of the booming housing demand in our markets and is an indicator of the pricing power green brick has in 2021 to capitalize on inventory shortages of existing homes we expect this imbalance between housing demand and supply in our markets to persist through 2022 providing green brick with continued pricing power to offset or even more than offset rising costs with 87 of our ending active communities in dfw and atlanta we believe that green brick is well positioned to succeed in 2021 and beyond additionally we believe that the strong bounce back from the high unemployment seen in april of 2020 and the rapid uptick in demand is further proof that our focus on business friendly pro growth markets is the correct and best choice that will continue to differentiate us from peers jed dolson our chief operating officer and executive vice president will now speak in greater detail to our growth drivers and land position jed jed dolson chief operating officer and executive vice president thanks jim on slide seven we demonstrate how our investment in land has translated to an increased capacity to generate top line growth as you can see from the chart on this slide a key driver behind our strong financial and operational results has been our ability to convert investments in land to future growth in revenue during the first half of 2021 our lots owned and controlled increased by 6 883 to end at 21 351 total lots a new all time high for the company this is a 48 increase from the start of the year after including land under option and lots optioned through joint ventures we expect nearly 88 of our current inventory of lots owned and controlled to be self developed by the company we believe this strong emphasis on land development should allow green brick s margins and returns to continue to represent one of the best growth opportunity profiles among our peers as these self developed lots avoid expensive premiums charged by third party land developers for those of you who are interested slide eight provides additional detail on the attractive submarkets in dallas fort worth and atlanta where our lot supply is located now follow me to slide nine and you will see that our communities and lots under development hit new highs this quarter with 42 communities under development our land pipeline is well established to meet our continued growth trajectory in the next several years these lots under development will shift toward the entry level market with over 1 3 of the lots under development located in more affordable submarkets in the next six months we expect to complete and release roughly 1 800 lots to our subsidiary homebuilders for new housing starts during fiscal year 2022 we expect to accelerate our delivery of finished lots by finishing 4 600 lots during the year with both our long term and short term land needs met we are confident green brick should be able to continue growing through fiscal year 2023 slide 10 highlights our ending units under construction our units under construction are up 40 over the past six months and 95 over the past 12 months while we have seen growth at virtually all our brands and price points our unit growth was primarily driven by starts in our trophy brand which increased its ending units under construction by 315 during the 12 months ended june 30 2021 as we go forward we expect the continued expansion of the trophy brand to establish larger communities with higher absorption rates and unit density additionally our pivot to these larger communities focused on entry level buyers has not been at the cost of increased risk for q2 2021 home closings saw an average fico score of 750 with 85 of our fundings exceeding a fico score of 700 per data from green brick s mortgage ventures the creditworthiness of our average buyer profile is the fundamental strength of many of the a markets where we operate which we believe we will continue to mitigate risk for our business in summary we feel we have a very strong land position in some of the best markets in america with strong demand from low risk buyers all while maintaining a conservative debt to capital ratio and achieving industry leading margins next rick costello our cfo will discuss our second quarter and annual results in more detail richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary thanks jed thank you everyone for joining us today to review our 2021 second quarter financial results before i talk about our record second quarter results i want to provide some additional context for the remarkable growth this quarter and take a more detailed look at how our trophy brand is well established for future growth slide 11 of our presentation provides an in depth look at trophy s share of green brick s performance metrics through june 30 2021 as you can see on this slide trophy s percentage of home closings has grown by 14 from 20 of our full year closings in fiscal year 2020 to 34 for the six months ended june 30 2021 however with 41 of our starts this year and 65 of our lots owned and controlled related to trophy we believe trophy has a clear runway to continue its growth trajectory in dallas fort worth while all our lots owned and controlled allocated to trophy has increased nearly 460 from a year ago it s important to note that the nearly 14 000 lots shown as of june 30 2021 includes two communities with more than 1 000 lots each that will have a much longer life cycle so excluding these two communities trophy s share of existing lots is still 54 which is 20 higher than trophy s 34 share of our home deliveries these past six months slide 12 of our presentation explains why we believe the growth of our trophy signature brand has the capacity to scale our bottom line results even faster than our top line results first with the average trophy community expected to be double the size of our other subsidiaries next year in terms of lot count per community we re able to increase our absorption pace without requiring growth in community count second trophy s business model allows for 100 utilization of purchase orders during construction with no changes allowed this process reduces our average standard cycle time by roughly 12 and allows for more efficient inventory turnover and stronger financial returns and finally trophy has seen an outsized improvement in its gross margin over the last 12 months increasing by 490 basis points this growth exceeds by 130 basis points our consolidated margin improvement of 360 basis points on the same year over year basis so this higher profitability is enhanced by trophy s lower sg a leverage this combination of higher margins shorter cycle times and better sg a leverage should generate higher returns on invested capital all in all we believe these strong fundamentals will continue through 2022 and make a strong case of our continued investment in trophy signature homes slide 13 of our presentation shows the continuation of our high levels of year over year growth in our home closings and home closings revenues on a last 12 months basis our closings grew 27 while related revenues grew 26 year over year quarter over quarter our closings grew by 37 and our home closing revenues grew by a remarkable 47 and as jim mentioned earlier we believe this volume of closings represents a new normal for the company that green brick can continue to grow further in the remaining quarters of this year while slide 13 looks at our historical revenue slide 14 pivots to our future closings and shows the year over year increases in net new orders and our ending backlog while net new orders are up 50 on the last 12 months basis year over year our q2 2021 net orders were just up 4 as the company successfully metered sales to better match construction schedules and buyer expectations and improve our ability to capture price volatility despite significant price increases taken by the company net new home orders were 210 over double of home deliveries during q1 of this year consequently we determined that price increases were not sufficient to limit demand for net new home orders as a result we metered sales during the three months ended june 30 2021 by limiting sales per community to better align the absorption rate of sales with the ability to deliver new homes like many of our peers we limit sales almost universally to homes that at least have a slab poured the absorption rate per average selling community per quarter of 6 8 homes during the three months ended june 30 2021 and 9 1 homes year to date exceed the 5 9 net home new orders during both the three months and six months ended june 30 2019 that s two years ago by 15 and 54 respectively this slowdown of our record sales pace seen in the previous three quarters has allowed us to shift our mix of sold versus spec units under construction nearly 500 basis points over the last three months that s something we haven t provided before but our mix of homes under construction is now at 33 spec homes at june 30 2021 which is up from only 28 as of march 31 21 but still far below the 44 spec home level as of the beginning of the year likewise our q2 2021 ending backlog is up 118 from a year ago prior but saw a small 2 decline sequentially despite closing a record number of homes during the quarter we will continue to normalize our pace and our level of spec versus backlog homes under construction and our total backlog levels as well as we drive closing volumes higher each successive quarter of this year bottom line we re holding back homes for sale so we have a better mix of presold backlog homes versus specs we think improving our mix will lead to higher margins and returns and less risk of construction costs prices are rising every month so selling some houses two or three months before completion will get us a better margin than selling all the houses seven months ahead the expected return to a higher level of spec units under construction should position us to capture increased sales prices managing this type of flow is a corporate strength and making decisions like this contribute to our superior gross margin and return on capital now let s move to slide 15 related to our financial highlights adjusted gross margin for q2 21 was up 360 basis points over q2 of 2020 and adjusted gross margin was up 320 basis points q over q sequentially gross margins were up 140 basis points from q1 for the six months ended june 30 2021 homebuilding gross margin and adjusted homebuilding gross margin were up 320 basis points and 270 basis points respectively from the same prior year period our robust year over year growth in gross margin is expected to continue over the next two quarters as we see the benefits of strong pricing power and our ending backlog translate to future closings turning to operating leverage our sg a expense was down 190 basis points at 9 1 for q2 of 21 with the prior year quarter at 11 our year to date q2 ratio of sg a expense to total revenues of 10 4 was down 140 basis points from 11 8 for the prior year so with increasing top line revenues expected through the remainder of this year we expect quarterly and full year operating leverage to continue to improve our interest coverage of 21 9 times for q2 21 represents a 53 growth over q2 2020 while our year to date interest coverage for q2 21 of 17 6 times was 56 higher than the prior same year period our strong interest coverage clearly demonstrates our capacity to generate positive cash flow well above our needs now the bottom line our q2 2021 diluted eps of 1 02 was a record for any quarter and represents a 55 increase over q2 of 2020 and is a doubling sequentially from 0 51 in q1 of this year for the six months ended june 30 our diluted eps of 1 53 was up 56 from the prior year period now if you ll recall during q2 of last year to q2 of 2020 we benefited from a 6 7 million tax benefit from energy tax credits related to open prior tax years so to get a better sense of our improvement in our operational income performance we really need to look at pre tax income pretax income grew 94 in q2 21 over the second quarter of 2020 and our annualized net income return on average book equity which jim referred to earlier grew an outstanding 610 basis points to reach 30 2 this quarter combined with our low debt leverage our risk adjusted returns are truly remarkable please move to slide 16 of our presentation where we compare our q2 21 gross margins with available peer data our gross margin reported for the quarter was 26 8 and 26 3 year to date this chart demonstrates that our performance is among the best in the industry we believe our superior margin experience is evidence of our conservative land underwriting operating efficiencies as we scale our business and prudent planning this is a winning strategy that has well prepared us to manage pace and price during the remainder of 2021 and beyond we expect gross margin to continue to rise sequentially during 2021 as we continue to realize the strong price appreciation in our backlog through future closings slide 17 visually demonstrates that we have grown our revenues and provided stable earnings by concentrating on several homebuyer segments for the six months ended june 30 2019 two years ago two segments accounted for more than 60 of our revenues fast forward two years and we now address six distinct and significant customer segments which all experienced strong revenue growth in the first six months of the year for the six months ended june 30 2021 our entry level segment plus our first time move up segment now combined to represent 41 of home closings revenues an increase of 2 500 basis points over two years ago when they combined to represent just 16 of home closings revenues now this expansion of our more affordable inventory was created through the intentional reallocation of capital to our trophy signature homes brand we expect to continue to expand our entry level segment in the remainder of 2021 which we believe should position green brick to capture an even greater portion of today s housing demand please turn to slide 18 here we have compared our performance versus our small and mid cap peers to demonstrate why we believe that our risk adjusted growth and returns are uniquely strong we have provided six measures five of the measures cover the 12 months ended june 30 2021 or the nearest period growth in homebuilding revenues gross margin percentage interest coverage pre tax income return on invested capital and growth in lots owned and controlled and the other measure which is debt to capital is as of a point in time june 30 2021 the with the strength of green brick s results for each of these metrics green brick continues to perform at or near the top of our peer group in fact our high gross margins exceed even some of the large cap peers as we discussed earlier our returns on capital are even more impressive when you consider our peer leading growth in lot supply which has included the investment of 180 million of land and lot acquisitions during the second quarter of this year alone and with our expected sequential growth in homebuilding revenues continuing for the balance of 2021 we expect income returns on capital to additionally elevate during the balance of the year lastly on the financial slides please look at slide 19 which focuses on our lower leverage we were able to achieve our record setting results while maintaining one of the lowest debt to capital ratios among small cap and mid cap builders again reminding you while funding 180 million of land and lot acquisitions during the quarter i ll now turn the call back to jim who will wrap up our part of the call prior to opening things up for q a jim james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director okay thanks rick our record results this quarter are the combination of years of diligent planning and hard work by our subsidiary builders and our corporate team we believe the outstanding results achieved this quarter are just the first step in green brick s remarkable growth story as the company swiftly moves to materially exceed 1 billion in revenues this year we believe green brick s prospects for continued top line and bottom line growth are truly unrivaled in our industry to better understand how green brick has achieved our impressive risk adjusted returns to date we invite each of you to join us tomorrow for our inaugural virtual investor day from 9 00 a m to noon central daylight time with our q2 2021 financial and operational results reaching new highs this quarter we believe this event will provide critical insight into the new inflection point in the company s growth story and hope that each of you will be able to attend to register please go to our website and click investor day 2021 under investors governance i ll now turn the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator our first question is from michael rehaut with j p morgan please proceed with your question margaret jane wellborn j p morgan analyst hi this is maggie on for mike thanks for taking my questions first i d like to dig a little bit more into how you re thinking about sales for the remainder of this year and into next year after three quarters of the elevated starts levels do you see this as more of a normalized starts pace going forward and also as you look at the back half of the year you ve got the pivot toward the higher absorption trophy communities you ve got kind of the increased mix of spec homes under construction but you ve also got that competing with the price increases so can you talk about how we should kind of balance all of those factors as we think about the next quarter or two james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director yes and this is jim and jed and both rick can chime in on this but we are having normalized starts and really it s a little bit more than normalized we re going to grow starts particularly in the trophy brand we are seeing still very strong demand i think some investors don t understand how really strong that demand is and we have intentionally delayed selling homes because we know that demand is going to be there there really aren t a lot of options for homebuyers we have one community in atlanta for example that is not a big community and we had 1 200 people show interest on like an 80 lot community that we haven t even considered really opening up for sales yet so we have a lot of indicators like this the demand is very strong and that s why we have not taken orders we could have probably presold that whole community but there s no point in doing that it s a community that we took a long time to entitle and there s no point in pre selling product in an inflationary cost environment when we can capture higher margins down the road and we have a lot of examples like that margaret jane wellborn j p morgan analyst got it and a richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary also maggie just to continue on that a little bit we ve ticked up from 28 to 33 spec that 5 500 basis point increase was very similar to what d r horton did this quarter as well there are some builders who have not started to meter their sales and they re getting fewer and fewer spec homes out there as a percentage of what they do our model is not based on having such a large number of backlog homes we leave money on the table we can t tell our customers with certainty when they re going to be closing we re by selling earlier in the process we re losing out on potential price increases so for us we seek to get back to those levels yes we re going to be closing a lot of houses in the back half of this year but we still want our backlog as a portion of what we ve got under construction to go down some margaret jane wellborn j p morgan analyst okay thank you and second on pricing could you give us an idea of how much you raised prices during the quarter and looking forward how much more runway you think you have to continue raising prices before you start to see some more pushback and also if you could maybe give any update on kind of where you think asp for the year might end up james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director jed why don t you take that since you manage this process jed dolson chief operating officer and executive vice president sure we on a monthly basis we ve been raising prices varying 3 to 5 per community per month i think the one thing that we re very excited about is really not price raising but because we do want to still provide an affordable product to the consumer but we are very excited about what lumber is doing and how the cost input side of our business is dramatically falling in some cases we ve seen lumber packs fall 20 000 in the past two months so we think there s still some room for that to fall we re excited about that and that should lead to increased margins going forward margaret jane wellborn j p morgan analyst got it and one more if i could sneak it in there i think you mentioned that trophy s gross margins improved above the company average for the quarter but on an absolute basis where are trophy s margins versus the rest of the company james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director maggie we don t by brand or by geography disclose gross margins we gave about the most information on so many areas in this call that we typically don t touch as you know we don t give guidance we came about as close as we can to giving guidance telling that we expect the rest of the year to be better hopefully the market will start paying attention to that but we don t give gross margins by brand or geography margaret jane wellborn j p morgan analyst okay thank you operator and our next question is from alex rygiel with b riley please proceed with your question alex rygiel b riley analyst thank you and very nice quarter gentlemen circling back to one of the earlier questions talking about building materials costs understanding that lumber has come down when might we see sort of the peak of lumber expense go through your p l so therefore when are we on sort of the backside of the curve is that right now or is that a little bit later in the third quarter and then how should we think about building material costs for all other products going into the house james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director okay i m going to take part of that question i would like to have jed chime in later we were able i think reacting very quickly and being in really strong markets and strong neighborhoods within our markets we are the lumber costs that went up we are able to more than pass on i ve read a number of other conference calls where people are concerned about the lagging effect of those lumber costs and how they re going to affect third and fourth quarter margins we don t see margin degradation in the third and fourth quarter because we were able to raise prices very quickly and so we are not seeing that in the third and fourth quarter this year in terms of building material costs i really hope that everyone on this call can attend our investor day jack wilkins is in town he s our national purchasing director all of our purchasing agents are going to be at the investor day and you re going to get really a very granular look in what we expect to see in purchasing and how we re operating our business but in a nutshell it s still a minefield out there in terms of bottlenecks and supply constraints but we think that we ve managed this process really well and tomorrow on the investor day you can meet the people that are doing that alex rygiel b riley analyst that s great and then turning over to land sales obviously it ticked up in the quarter can you talk a little bit about your intermediate and longer term land sales strategy james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director sure and jed i sure want you to chime in on this but it was a little bit of an odd month this year we had one large transaction and where we sold a retail site and a multifamily site to a multifamily institutional developer we ve done a lot of business with and we were how many lots were we left with jed dolson chief operating officer and executive vice president 250 james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director 250 lots after the sale so we made a nice gain on that we ve done business with these people and what we need to communicate to investors is that these 250 lots that we re still left with despite taking a nice land profit our basis in these lots on today s values these homes should produce higher margins than our company is producing already so we really don t plan on selling any more lots we may come into a situation where we have a unique opportunity to coordinate a large parcel where we ll sell off the retail or multifamily uses because we don t do that but we really don t plan on selling that many more lots jed do you have any jed dolson chief operating officer and executive vice president no additional comments alex rygiel b riley analyst it is very helpful thank you operator and our next question is from bill dezellem with tieton capital management please proceed with your question bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst great thank you and congratulations on an amazing quarter i m going to ask a couple of questions from a point of ignorance here if you will allow can you first of all talk about the 604 new homeowner orders in the second quarter being down from the 1 082 new home orders in the first quarter i mean i know you ve talked about limiting sales but that s really quite a dramatic falloff james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director yes it is a falloff but it was an intentional falloff and i think our investors are going to be very pleased at the end of the year when they see the results of that strategy because as we said we re seeing great demand and it doesn t make sense to sell 1 000 let s say we could have sold 1 100 let s say but it doesn t make sense in a rising price environment to sell 1 100 homes when we can when we see demand is there and we can harvest 3 or 4 greater margin by delaying that sales process richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary bill in the first quarter we sold 1 082 houses and closed 516 that s more than double and that s just really all it does is add to our backlog on deals that are further out in delivery where if we wait until later in the construction process which is our typical in our business is not to be a backlog builder but if we wait until later in the process we would have gotten even more price increases passed along to our customers so it s going to lead to better margins it s going to lead to better control of our construction and the ability to give our customers better visibility on the dates they re actually going to close james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director and in the homes we started it should relatively improve cycle times because we re not dealing with the customer during a lot of this processing bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst that s helpful so essentially this is the data point that highlights that what you ve been talking about on the call not only are you doing but you re doing it in a dramatic way james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director yes bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst okay thank you one more question again this is from a point of ignorance how do you see anticipate or accomplish having revenues and earnings growing sequentially when the backlog the backlog units and the starts are down versus the first quarter richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary well we had very strong starts for q3 of last year q4 or q1 and you ve really not seen that level of closings including the 757 deliveries i mean we were over 1 000 starts per quarter for three quarters in a row james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director we have the most homes built under construction i think we ve ever had by a considerable margin i think that s one of the things that investors are not really fully comprehending bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst and one of the things that we have noticed or identified is that the trailing four quarter starts is at a record high as are the under construction units as you point out so should we be paying more attention to the trailing four quarters starts than just any one individual james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director yes i think so and what you have to put in context of those trailing four quarters as we said it was intentional many of those starts we didn t want to sell because we would have to sell the house at current prices today and we think we can pick up margin with not a lot of risk because the demand has remained so strong in selling these homes two months before they re completed rather than trying to get a presale and actually and we re still trying to start more and more spec homes but because of the supply bottlenecks we just can t bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst great thank you congratulations again on a great quarter and for helping us understand how you re managing the pieces of the puzzle well done james r brickman co founder chief executive officer and director thank you bill richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary thank you bill operator and we have reached the end of the question and answer session i ll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks richard a costello chief financial officer treasurer secretary i thank everybody for joining the call today and again a reminder please go to our website under our investor page and sign up for tomorrow s

association slma has warned that the number of infections will increase in the coming weeks we are heading towards a crucial two weeks where a considerable number of delta variant cases could be detected in the community slma president dr padma guneratne said the number of cases reported daily is due to limited number pcr tests being conducted in a day there are five times of active cases undetected in the community dr guneratne explained there are many active delta variant cases undetected especially in the western province she said there are also concerns that health services could be subject to maximum capacity due to the increasing number of patients who are falling ill and are requiring hospitalisation this is particularly so with the delta variant which appears to afflict all ages with children also being severely affected covid 19 infection the covid 19 ward at the country s major children s hospital the lady ridgeway hospital lrh in colombo has reached maximum capacity hospital director dr g wijesuriya said seventy children are being treated at the lrh some children are now being transferred to other hospitals he said health minister pavithra wanniarachchi

ministry of health to enhance treatment facilities for children dr wijesuriya said urging parents to be cautious about exposing their children to infection dr wijesuriya noted that about 15 children are presenting daily the government is also considering providing updates regarding the pandemic to parliament health minister pavithra wanniarachchi said responding to a question from former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe minister wanniarachchi said weekly reports to parliament are being considered that no one is immune from the virus is now obvious previously minister wanniarachchi herself was infected with it now minister mahindananda aluthgamage is among the victims minister udaya gammanpila is also in self isolation after several staff members of his ministry were infected it is no secret that the government has now committed itself firmly to a policy of re opening the country to the rest of the world it plans to do so by optimising the vaccination drive and immunising as large a segment of the sri lankan population to minimise the risk from the pandemic in the rest of the world countries have tried to different strategies to deal with the virus some nations have opted to lockdown for long periods of time securing their borders with extremely strict quarantine laws thereby preventing the entry of travellers with the coronavirus to those countries sri lanka too adopted this approach last year with some degree of success around this time last year sri lanka s borders were sealed and the pandemic was well under control with only a few dozen infections and a handful of fatalities however it soon became obvious that this cannot be sustained even more developed countries such as the united states and the united kingdom which opted for lockdowns at some during the pandemic were unable to keep their economies viable during these period of closure they had to revert to reversing the lockdown status as soon as it became possible this these countries have done through effective immunisation the best example of this is the united kingdom the country initially suffered heavily from the pandemic with some 5 9 million infections and a staggering 130 000 deaths yet they have returned to a normal pre covid lifestyle lockdowns and welfare payments while developed countries supported their populations during periods of lockdown with welfare payments developing nations such as sri lanka can ill afford to do so ours is an economy that consists of millions of daily wage earners for whom a lockdown means no income at all in such a scenario after an initial lockdown period to minimise the spread of the virus a re opening of the country and its economy was inevitable this is what is due to happen now although it has been complicated by two issues the inadequacy of vaccines and the emergence of the delta strain the delta strain of the virus originating in india has been characterised by its rapid spread it is known to have been transmitted from even fleeting casual contact such as passing one another in a public place unlike other strains of the corona virus it is also known to affect younger people faced with this variant of the virus any re opening of the country would only be possible if there were adequate safeguards in the form of a significant percentage of the population being vaccinated this is what the government is now trying to achieve through a series of co ordinated measures at first sri lanka s vaccination programme against the pandemic hit several snags this was due to a lack of supply from two major vaccine suppliers pfizer and astra zeneca with a ready demand for their vaccines these manufacturers found dealing with developed countries far more lucrative the initial demand for vaccines was alleviated by responses from friendly countries offering help china provided stocks of the sinopharm vaccine while russia supplied the sputnik vaccine neighbouring india s offer of the maitree vaccine had to be curtailed due to high internal demand this situation led to some unsavoury incidents where the distribution of vaccines was not administered properly with allegation of the vaccine being available to a select few there were even allegations of some doctors using their authority to immunise extended family members demand for vaccines now however the demand for vaccines has changed to some extent that is partly because many developed nations have completed the bulk of their vaccination efforts it is also because the demand for the astra zeneca vaccine in some countries has declined due to reports of side effects it is in these changed market conditions that the sri lankan government finds itself now attempting to secure adequate stocks of vaccines two doses for each citizen it is also challenged with the task of distributing these vaccines efficiently and promptly within an extremely limited period of time one of the major controversies that arose early in the vaccination campaign was the shortage of the astrazeneca vaccines to those who had already received the first dose of the vaccine at one stage even a proposal to mix and match vaccines was being seriously considered by health authorities this issue has now been resolved with the country receiving adequate stocks of the astrazeneca vaccines for a second dose to those who had already received the first dose of that vaccine this campaign got underway no sooner the vaccines were received in the country early this week the first consignment of 728 460 vaccine doses was sent to colombo as a donation from the government of japan following a request from the sri lankan government the administering of these astrazeneca second doses began at twenty selected centres in the western province on sunday japan had decided to donate 1 456 million doses of the vaccine to sri lanka following president gotabaya rajapaksa s personal request to japan s prime minister yoshihide suga to provide astrazeneca vaccines to sri lanka in recognition of long standing friendship between the two countries the japanese ambassador in colombo akira sugiyama commended the entire vaccination programme in sri lanka the commencement of the vaccination drive within a few hours of receiving the vaccine consignment and the president rajapaksa s direct involvement in securing the vaccines due to this boost to the vaccination programme the colombo municipal council cmc has decided not to administer the first dose of sinopharm vaccine to city dwellers till the completion of administering second doses of astrazeneca and sinopharm mayor rosy senanayake said meanwhile state minister channa jayasumana revealed that the number of persons who have had at least one dose of the vaccine in sri lanka has now reached the ten million mark the total number of persons over 30 years of age in the country is 11 5 million minister jayasumana noted the target set by president rajapaksa is to vaccinate all those above 30 years by the end of august however we are confident that we have the potential to achieve that task even before that deadline state minister jayasumana said the next target group is those aged between 18 to 30 he said more and more experts and countries around the world realise that the key to successfully controlling and managing the pandemic is enhanced vaccination of populations this is what sri lanka is also doing it appears to be on target in that process and the country should reap dividends shortly
