dubai united arab emirates yemen s houthi rebels unleashed one of their most intense barrages of drone and missile strikes on saudi arabia s critical energy facilities on sunday sparking a fire at one site and temporarily cutting oil production at another the salvo marked a serious escalation of rebel attacks on the kingdom as the war in yemen rages into its eighth year and peace talks stall the attacks did not cause casualties the saudi led military coalition fighting in yemen said but struck sites belonging to one of the world s most important energy companies and damaged civilian vehicles and homes the coalition also said it destroyed a remotely piloted boat packed with explosives dispatched by the houthis in the busy southern red sea hours after oil giant aramco s ceo amin h nasser told reporters the attacks had no impact on oil supplies the saudi energy ministry acknowledged that a drone strike targeting the yanbu aramco sinopec refining co caused a temporary reduction in the refinery s production the disruption as oil prices spike in an already tight energy market will be compensated for from the inventory the ministry said without elaborating another aerial attack later in the day struck a fuel tank at an aramco distribution station in the port city of jiddah and ignited a fire later at night the roar and thump of missile interceptors rattled the port city as the saudi military coalition said it destroyed more projectiles over jiddah residents posted footage on social media showing streaks of light from missile defenses pierce the dark sky advertisement the relentless wave of strikes revealed the expanding reach and precision of the rebels and the persistent gaps in the kingdom s air defenses a sophisticated strike in 2019 on aramco oil facilities knocked out half the kingdom s oil production and threatened to ignite a regional crisis an attack that the u s and riyadh later alleged came from iran the attacks on sunday came as saudi arabia s state backed aramco the world s largest oil company announced its profits surged 124 percent in 2021 to 110 billion a jump fueled by renewed anxieties about global supply shortages and soaring oil prices aramco also known as the saudi arabian oil co released its annual earnings after weeks of intense volatility in energy markets triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine the international oil benchmark brent crude spiked over 107 on sunday after nearly hitting a peak of 140 earlier this month saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have so far resisted western appeals to increase oil production to offset the loss of russian oil as gasoline prices skyrocket yehia sarie a spokesman for yemen s iran backed houthis said the rebels had launched a wide and large military operation in retaliation for the saudi led aggression and blockade that has turned much of yemen into a wasteland the escalation followed a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend in oman s capital of muscat the u n special envoy for yemen hans grundberg met with the chief houthi negotiator and omani officials to discuss a possible truce during the holy month of ramadan in early april the u n mission said advertisement the white house condemned the attacks blaming iran for supplying the houthis with missile and drone parts as well as training and expertise it is time to bring this war to a close but that can only happen if the houthis agree to cooperate with the united nations said u s national security advisor jake sullivan the united states stands fully behind those efforts the saudi led military coalition reported aerial strikes on a range of facilities an aramco liquified gas plant in the red sea port of yanbu an oil storage plant in jiddah a desalination facility in al shaqeeq on the red sea coast and an aramco oil facility in the southern border town of jizan among others the extent of damage on saudi infrastructure remained unclear and the ministry said only the yanbu refinery saw a temporary drop in output a joint venture between aramco and china the 10 billion yanbu aramco sinopec refining co on the red sea pumps 400 000 barrels of oil a day the saudi press agency shared photos of firetrucks dousing leaping flames with water and a trail of rubble wrought by shrapnel that crashed through ceilings and pocked apartment walls other images showed wrecked cars and giant craters in the ground the barrage comes days after the saudi based gulf cooperation council invited yemen s warring sides for peace talks in riyadh an offer dismissed out of hand by the houthis who demanded that negotiations take place in a neutral country advertisement negotiations have floundered since the houthis have tried to capture oil rich marib one of the last remaining strongholds of the saudi backed yemeni government in the country s north yemen s brutal war erupted in 2014 after the iran backed houthis seized the country s capital sanaa saudi arabia and its allies launched a devastating air campaign to dislodge the houthis and restore the internationally recognized government but years later the war has settled into a bloody stalemate and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world coalition airstrikes have struck civilian targets in yemen like hospitals telecommunications centers and wedding parties drawing widespread international criticism repeated houthi cross border attacks have rattled world energy markets and raised the risk of disruptions to output at aramco sites as part of its 2021 report aramco said it stuck to its promise of paying quarterly dividends of 18 75 billion 75 billion last year due to commitments the company made to shareholders in the run up to its initial public offering nearly all of the dividend money goes to the saudi government despite saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman s increasing efforts to diversify the saudi economy away from oil the kingdom remains heavily dependent on oil exports to fuel government spending riding on its 2021 income surge aramco said it expects to raise its capital expenditure to between 40 and 50 billion this year to meet growing energy demand a sizable

washington just days before russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 president biden quietly dispatched a team to european union headquarters in belgium these were not spy chiefs or generals but experts in reading fine print and tracking the flow of money computer chips and other goods around the world their mandate inflict maximum pain on russian president vladimir putin making it harder if not impossible for him to fund a prolonged war in ukraine and denying him access to technologies at the core of modern warfare there were intense meetings in february in brussels paris london and berlin often running six hours at a time as the allies tried to craft the details of a historic economic blockade according to biden administration officials some of the exports the u s wanted to ban were met with reluctance by the europeans who would essentially be telling their own companies to forgo several billion dollars in annual revenues from russia when there was a deadlock u s negotiators would put commerce secretary gina raimondo on the phone you can say no now but when the body bags are coming out of ukraine you re not going to want to be a holdout raimondo said she told allied counterparts do the right thing everyone signed on and before the invasion advertisement raimondo said what ultimately drove the agreement and the fast timeline was the threat of putin s imminent attack on ukraine we all got religion fast that it was time to band together and stick together she said if you cause enough pain isolate putin it will bring this war to an end the wealthiest nations in the world outside of china are directly confronting putin on their preferred terms they have imposed sanctions in which their strengths intersect with russia s vulnerabilities russia is reliant on the u s the eu japan south korea and taiwan for cutting edge technologies and investment so the allies decided to cut moscow off it s a strategic play designed to trap putin in a downward spiral as foreign investors pull out their money in response to the atrocities it s also a remarkable show of unity that could be tested in the coming weeks by the allies own dependence on fossil fuels a group of economists estimated thursday that eu countries have transferred more than 13 3 billion euros 14 7 billion to russia for oil natural gas and coal since the war began essentially funding putin s war machine while the allied talks in the lead up to the war were critical the eu was not just waiting around for u s direction to act bloc members had been consulting for months advertisement one eu diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks outlined in an interview as far back as january potential penalties that included the export ban noting that the eu had held together its coalition on enforcing sanctions since russia s 2014 occupation of parts of the donbas region in ukraine but this time the u s and eu responded to russia s aggression with a novel set of policies to cripple putin s ability to fight by denying it access to the semiconductors computers telecommunications equipment lasers and sensors integral to war materiel this is a supply chain squeeze that will force russia to raid existing airplanes tanks and other gear for spare parts essentially eroding its military and economic capacity the same u s and eu officials dealing with their own supply chain challenges after the pandemic found a way to amplify the problem for russia through trade regulations in a sign of early success u s officials point to the closing of lada auto plants in russia and the more than 300 companies that have stopped doing business with russia the companies are not just starbucks but chipmakers such as germany s infineon that said it stopped all direct and indirect deliveries to russia as well as technical support within days of the invasion the allies blocked the foreign assets of russia s central bank two senior biden administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity said this option was not initially presented to allies out of concern that russia could move its money ahead of time they waited to present the asset freeze until the invasion started and the images of bombings and death compelled the europeans to almost immediately agree the freeze rendered half of the more than 600 billion in putin s war chest unusable while the russian stock market has been closed and the value of the ruble has plunged the sanctions are designed so that the financial effects tightens over time as long as ukraine is able to hold out with military aid against severe casualties the sanctions will do more to exhaust putin advertisement eu commission vice president valdis dombrovskis on thursday praised the very good coordination among nations and said the sanctions are biting hard russia s financial markets are close to collapse he also noted that the sanctions create costs for the allies though the price is much less than the consequences of the war spreading yet with every new round of sanctions the unity of the 27 eu members is tested ever more if imposing a ban on russian oil and gas comes up germany and italy both heavily dependent on russian energy will be in a tough spot to contain the drive of several eastern member nations like poland and the baltic states that want to hit putin as hard as possible as soon as possible the u s is less dependent on russian oil and natural gas making it easier for biden to ban those imports earlier this month there is also the risk that the sanctions will fail to stop putin or that russia can still find ways to bring goods into its economy trade data analyzed by importgenius show that china supplanted germany in 2021 as the leading source of exports to russia and u s officials say that russia has solicited help from the chinese government on twitter olivier blanchard former chief economist at the international monetary fund and now a fellow at the peterson institute of international economics equated the sanctions to the bombing of german factories during world war ii those bombings disrupted the german war machine in ways that made it impossible to prolong an extended fight and economists had a role in choosing the targets for all that has been done question remain about whether it is enough blanchard recommends expanding the export controls from defense related production to anything which disorganizes production in the russian economy if russian made refrigerators need a gasket made in the eu restricting access to that gasket makes it harder for the russian economy to function he said advertisement tania babina a finance professor at columbia university who was born in ukraine said that sanctions tend not to stop dictators and she warned that putin might ultimately become even more entrenched unless the u s and eu take more aggressive action she said europeans need to add sanctions that ban the use of russian oil and natural gas he is going to throw everything to win will send his grandma to fight if needed babina said he cannot lose ukraine that is why it is so paramount to cut off russia s energy export revenues but babina noted that there is another far more chilling cost to the allied strategy of sanctions ukrainian lives how many people do we let die before putin runs

right because i looked at 30 other apartments and they were all way too too much for us to afford lesley stahl so when your rent goes up 30 what s the impact are you having to give things up brittney house yeah our fridge is does not look the same as last year before our lease lesley stahl really brittney house it s yeah lesley stahl you re really cutting back on groceries brittney house yeah daryl fairweather it s pretty much universally true rents are going up all around the country but it s even more severe in migration destinations like the sunbelt of the country austin phoenix florida a lotta people are moving there and there s just more demand for rents daryl fairweather is the chief economist at redfin a nationwide real estate brokerage firm that pulls together real time statistics on both the sales and rental markets for example their numbers show that rents increased 31 in jacksonville last year 40 in austin texas lesley stahl what s causing this daryl fairweather we are not building enough housing for everybody who needs a place to live we built fewer homes in the 2010s than in any decade going back to the 1960s and at the same time millennials are the biggest generation and they re entering into home buying age millennials aren t living in their parents basement any more or shacking up with roommates they want a place of their own and we didn t build any housing for them in the last decade because we are still so traumatized by the last housing crisis we didn t put any investment into housing daryl fairweather in the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 construction of new housing came to a grinding halt but even when the economy recovered home construction didn t lesley stahl so how big is the rental shortage in the united states daryl fairweather the government has estimated that we are short about 4 million homes in this country and that number is likely growing especially since the pandemic lesley stahl 4 million shy daryl fairweather yes that s the hole that we re in that we need to build ourselves out of lesley stahl that number 4 million is that mainly in the south and southwest or does that include new york city and san francisco daryl fairweather that s the entire country with something as essential as housing in such short supply you d have to figure that wall street would see an opportunity buying modest single family houses the kind you d see on any middle class suburban street and then renting them out daryl fairweather in places like jacksonville atlanta charlotte investors are buying almost 30 of the homes that are available for regular home buyers gary berman this is a home we bought this is 3518 shiner drive in jacksonville lesley stahl right gary berman this home is 1 700 square feet lesley stahl how many bedrooms gary berman three bedrooms two baths it was built about three years ago gary berman is ceo of tricon residential a toronto based company that has quietly become one of the largest owners of single family homes in the united states gary berman so today we own about 30 000 single family rental homes across the u s largely in the sun belt and we ve got probably about 75 000 people living in our homes lesley stahl you are a multi billion dollar company you re publicly traded on the new york stock exchange gary berman correct lesley stahl and the gary berman toronto stock exchange lesley stahl toronto stock exchange i even read in one of your own documents that your revenue went up last year by 67 is that correct gary berman yeah we re expanding i mean when you think about it we have an incredible amount of demand for what we do so lesley in any given week we might have two or 300 homes available lesley stahl for renting gary berman for renting and we get about 10 000 leasing inquiries a week gary berman tricon is trying to buy 800 houses a month and there are companies even bigger invitation homes owns more than 80 000 rental houses american homes 4 rent close to 60 000 some of the all stars of finance goldman sachs jp morgan blackstone have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these companies they all offer rental homes online and all focus on the sunbelt gary berman our largest portfolio w would be in atlanta in charlotte in phoenix in tampa lesley stahl and those are the cities that young millennials are flocking to gary berman this is where americans wanna be we re finding that americans are moving from the northeast from the midwest to move to the sun belt because taxes are lower it s a friendlier business environment it s better weather and so there s a movement taking place and the pandemic unleashed powerful nesting trends and work from home trends lesley stahl nesting trends gary berman powerful nesting trends when we survey our residents why did they move to be with us the number one reason is they want more space lesley stahl big investment companies like yours are being blamed for this huge increase in rents across the country and you can set the rent any way you want really given the demand you re talking about gary berman first i mean corporate landlords represent 2 of all single family rental housing so there s a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes it s a very competitive and difficult environment it s true that big investors don t own nearly as many houses as mom and pop landlords people who might have just a few properties but big firms like tricon do play a larger and growing role in the sunbelt cities where they re active rent increases are all over the map 35 in new york but just 9 in chicago 29 in portland only 10 in la and in only one big city were rents actually down last year kansas city berman says tricon strictly caps how much it will raise rent on existing tenants when they renew their leases lesley stahl but let s say i had come in as a new renter here would the rent here be 30 more than it was about a year ago gary berman it could be because it we when we come in and buy a home we have to pay a market price for the home and then we have to set a market rent right here are two examples of homes tricon recently bought in jacksonville this one they re charging 40 higher rent than the previous owner asked this one 30 higher these before and after pictures taken by tricon show how they fix up many of the houses they buy they also have a fleet of trucks and technicians to service them gary berman this is a standard tricon home lesley stahl and you put in the kitchen these you put in the appliances gary berman this home was built three years ago we put in about 15 000 most of our homes are a little bit older we probably put in about twenty or 25 000 this is very typical of what our product looks like when you move into it it s in move in ready condition it s broom swept lesley stahl and if things go wrong if there s a leak gary berman if things go wrong lesley stahl we call you gary berman if we have a leaky faucet or the you know oven or microwave s not working you will call us you ll call and our maintenance techs will come and and service the home the houses tricon and other investors are buying in places like jacksonville are what might be called starter homes usually selling for about 300 000 when one of those comes on the market investors are ready with all cash offers heather kruayai i would say probably a third of the listings that i m putting up are getting investor offers heather kruayai heather kruayai is a redfin real estate agent in jacksonville she represents both buyers and sellers heather kruayai you are seeing a lot of these wall street investors that are coming in you know you put a house on the market and within an hour i m getting offers full price cash and so these the sellers are seeing that and oh okay cash we can close in 15 days it s very enticing to people when they see that offer come across lesley stahl so when you sell are you having to stage the house paint it put furniture in make it look really nice heather kruayai not now it s not necessary now in this this way the way the market s going now you really don t need to do anything to your house to sell it typically the investors never look at the home never lesley stahl they don t even look at the home heather kruayai they never look at it that plus the fact that investors often waive inspections puts would be first time home buyers at a serious disadvantage before they can even see a starter house it s gone justin blocki most people our age are not gonna be able to have 350 000 in liquid cash justin and brittney the young jacksonville couple facing steep rent increases are starting to lose hope they ll ever be able to buy a home even tricon s own presentation to investors says quote homeownership is increasingly out of reach gary berman in our portfolio the majority cannot buy a home cannot afford to buy a home or don t have the credit to buy the home so for example they may have student debt or they may have medical debt and therefore they can t qualify to get a mortgage and if they want access to a single family home which we think s incredibly important this is the best way to for them to obtain it i think if you asked a lot of millennials and that tends to be our primary resident they would probably tell you they don t necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car they ve grown up in the sharing economy and for what s important to them is lifestyle right and so if they can move into this what we call a turnkey or a hotel ready home and have a low maintenance lifestyle that s very compelling for them very compelling lesley stahl we were told by the head of one of these big companies that people your age want to rent that you re not as interested in buying a house justin blocki no i mean laugh i think the american dream is owning your own property and having your own dirt that you own and that s specifically why we moved here was to own a house brittney house i realize my first house is probably going to be a starter home it may not be that dream house but it s a house it s a home now the our dream is now unattainable it s it s very it s disturbing daryl fairweather most people desire that single family home with the picket fence and if they can t buy it because they can t afford it their only option is to rent it lesley stahl yeah but the investor s buying it daryl fairweather yeah and they re getting that wealth that normally or in previous years would ve gone to the person living there lesley stahl so what s happened to the american dream when we used to say that it meant owning a house what s the american dream now gary berman well if we think the american dream is is embodied in a suburban home with a yard and and a white picket fence then i think we re making the american dream much more accessible lesley stahl rent your american dream gary berman you can rent the american dream that is if you can afford the rent produced by rome

houston march 20 2022 prnewswire the windacre partnership llc windacre today stated that it fully supports the decision by the board of directors board of nielsen holdings plc nyse nlsn nielsen or the company to reject the 25 40 per share acquisition proposal received by the company as a long term nielsen shareholder windacre believes that the acquisition offer significantly undervalues the company specifically the offer price does not fairly value nielsen s unique and strategic position as critical measurement infrastructure supporting the 100 billion u s video advertising ecosystem does not reflect the company s progress on executing the nielsen one roadmap is unattractive relative to the valuation of information services peers that similarly have proprietary and essential data assets and mid single digit revenue growth in line with nielsen s medium term outlook and is significantly below nielsen s intrinsic value per share which windacre assesses at well in excess of 40 per share accordingly windacre informed the board that it would not support the proposed transaction that it intended to accumulate the shares required to block the acquisition and that it was confident in its ability to do so under uk law a scheme of arrangement requires the approval of the holders of at least 75 in value of the shares voting on the transaction with members of the acquiring consortium not eligible to vote their shares windacre currently owns 9 6 of nielsen s ordinary shares and has economic exposure equivalent to another 14 4 of the company s shares through cash settled swaps snehal amin managing partner of windacre said nielsen is and we believe will continue to be the currency for the video advertising ecosystem advertisers need the truth about who is watching their advertising across all screens and all platforms and only nielsen one has the promise to deliver that a series of unaudited unvalidated and often self serving measurement metrics that provide a glimpse of the audience only on certain screens or limited platforms simply won t suffice advertisers know that and in the end they are the ones who decide what currency to use we are confident it will be nielsen one amin continued we do not believe the offer comes close to recognizing nielsen s intrinsic value and we were not going to be forced out of our holding at this price we intended to block the transaction so that we could realize in time the intrinsic value of our investment we believe strongly that the board made the right decision in the face of an inadequate offer saving the company from

by christopher j petherick in mid march 2011 only days after a 50 foot high tsunami struck the fukushima daiichi nuclear reactor 130 miles north of tokyo knocking out its entire cooling system residents along the west coast of the united states and canada were advised to stock up on medicines in the event that a highly toxic radioactive cloud dispersed into the air over japan and headed east toward the united states thankfully that situation never happened but today there s a far worse scenario slowly making its way to the united states that comes courtesy of slow moving pacific ocean currents which are moving highly contaminated waters around japan s devastated nuclear plant east to hawaii and the west coast then splitting and going north and west to alaska and russia and south and west to the philippines the problem now is that scientists are at a loss as to how to contain this pending disaster what if large quantities of radioactive materials which leaked into the sea when fukushima went critical slowly poison seas around the world leading to contaminated seafood and widespread die offs of ocean life what will this do to living things on the west coast no one knows just how much radioactive material was dumped into the sea around fukushima as the japanese government has been characteristically tight lipped in late march japan s government said scientists took samples of seawater from the pacific ocean around fukushima the government admitted that just north of the reactor seawater was found to contain 1 150 times the safe limit of radioactive iodine south of the site that amount was 1 850 times but did that really show the true extent of the disaster in september 2011 london s telegraph daily newspaper reported on a gathering of japanese scientists with the meteorological research institute and the central research institute of the electric power industry these academics conceded that approximately 3 500 terabecquerels of cesium 137 were released into the sea directly from the plant between march 11 when the earthquake and tsunami struck and the end of may another 10 000 terabecquerels of cesium fell into the ocean after escaping from the reactors in the form of steam a becquerel bq is a standard measurement of radiation one terabecquerel tbq is the equivalent of a trillion bqs that s a huge amount of this deadly substance keep in mind that there is no precedent for this type of disaster the notorious meltdown at the three mile island nuclear reactor on march 28 1979 in dauphin county pa was located along the susquehanna river which somewhat limited the extent to which toxic materials could be carried to distant lands eventually three mile island was brought under control but not before an estimated 40 000 gallons of radioactive wastewater were dumped into the river pennsylvanians moved quickly to contain the problem but a decade later they were still cleaning up the mess which was estimated to cost around 1 billion the next major nuclear disaster occurred on april 26 1986 at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in ukraine located along the pripyat river which feeds into the dnieper river and in turn into the black sea at the time the soviets did their best to cover up the damage which many people believe actually made the disaster worse to this day a 20 mile exclusion zone remains in place around chernobyl but the fallout has not been limited to just ukraine according to published reports fish as far away as western europe were reportedly found to have radioactive levels above what is considered safe and 25 years later wild boars in germany still routinely exceed germany s accepted radiation limit in meat a report in annals of the new york academy of sciences published in 2009 estimated that nearly 1 million people have died over the years as a result of cancers attributable to chernobyl in the meantime environmentalists are pressuring japan to come clean about the damage to the pacific in october greenpeace activists in japan collected samples of fish sold along the east coast there they found that more than half of the products they purchased in grocery stores were contaminated with high levels of radioactive cesium 134 and cesium 137 the samples are well below the 500 becquerel per kilogram limit set by the authorities wakao hanaoka a greenpeace activist told agence france presse the contaminated seafood still represents a health risk the good news is scientists in the u s are quietly preparing for the likelihood that the u s coastline will be contaminated and how long will it be before fukushima s radioactive materials start washing up on america s shores the unfortunate answer is no one knows sandra patridge a spokeswoman for washington state s department of ecology told this writer that she has seen emails from scientists predicting that it could come as early as 2025

moving the climate campaign toward financial arguments over the past decade was american environmentalist and journalist bill mckibben whose 2013 do the math tour of australia resembled that of a rock star mckibben s central argument then was that much of the world s officially declared fossil fuel reserves would need to remain unburned for the world to keep temperature rises within 2 degrees investors were told they would be the ones burnt if they did not heed the warnings and swiftly divest mckibben s arguments had rung in the ears of investors for almost four years by the time yancoal bought rio s nsw coal mines with a plan to keep running them for decades asked by the australian financial review for his view on yancoal s five year journey in nsw and for his definition of stranded assets at a time of record fossil fuel prices mckibben was typically provocative i confess i don t have an answer to the issue of momentary booms and busts there are going to be amoral bottom feeders who figure out how to time things just right i guess and don t get their fingers burned he said in an emailed reply the stranded asset problem is for the economy and the society and the biosphere as a whole another product of the environment movement s decade of increased financial literacy is the organisation known as market forces a not for profit group that is a member of friends of the earth but which strikes a more corporate image with its greater focus on financial markets advertisement rather than hold placards outside the annual shareholder meetings of big companies market forces has taken the climate campaign inside the meetings proposing shareholder resolutions and questioning company directors on climate related topics clear compelling moral case asked whether the fossil fuel price boom had rendered toothless the warnings about stranded assets market forces executive director julien vincent was adamant the strategy to pursue financial arguments had been successful and remained valid we never tried to win the debate with financial arguments alone rather we broadened the scope of our work to include investors and big corporations as they would have a big role to play in solving climate change financial arguments help but at the core of our argument is a clear compelling moral case he said stranded asset risk has prevented lots of marginal coal mines being built so to some extent our successes are evident in the projects you don t see and the pollution that hasn t been emitted the risk is absolutely still there the most intelligent thing any of these companies could do is take the windfall they are getting from this particular moment and use it to invest in diversification strategies the environment movements adoption of financial arguments has had a big impact climate related financial disclosures have become a normal part of corporate reporting season and the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 has been adopted by everyone from blackrock to fossil fuel giants such as bhp glencore and bp vincent said yancoal s spend on the former rio mines was not over pointing to the hundreds of millions of dollars in rehabilitation work that would need to occur when the mines reached the end of their lives but when it comes to stranded assets vincent says the real debate is on the fossil fuel projects under construction today the greatest stranded asset risks in the fossil fuel sector at the moment are the big new expensive projects being sanctioned these investment decisions shouldn t be made on the back of short term commodity price spikes given they will take years to come online only to serve markets where the countries have made commitments to net zero emissions by mid century already he said they instead need to use credible projections of future demand and for any company or investor that claims to support the climate goals of the paris agreement those credible demand scenarios all lead to the same conclusions there is no room for new coal oil and gas projects and demand for fossil fuels must decline rapidly this decade if we re to have a fighting chance of limiting warming to 1 5 degrees advertisement those comments mean woodside s scarborough lng project which secured a final investment decision in november will be the next asset to risk being stranded before it can make a return on investment woodside said in november the payback period for scarborough would be six years assuming oil prices averaged us65 per barrel oil has in recent weeks surged above us100 per barrel and if russian oil is excluded from global markets long term prices could remain high and help scarborough deliver a return on investment sooner kicking goals the six year payback achieved by yancoal and promised by woodside may seem swift but it s nothing compared with the goal glencore will kick this year at colombia s cerrejón thermal coal mine the swiss miner agreed to spend us588 million buying bhp and anglo american out of the asset with effect from december 31 2020 after one year of ownership glencore was within us101 million 136 4 million of recouping its investment suggesting the punt on cerrejón will be in the black within 18 months of the acquisition taking effect with european energy utilities scrambling to wean themselves off russian fuels the coal produced in the americas by the likes of cerrejón coronado global resources and xcoal is in huge demand xcoal s ernie thrasher believes sovereign security of energy supply with take precedence over environmental goals for the next few years as the world s adjusts to russia s invasion of ukraine we have set the road to net zero back by at least a decade maybe longer because energy security and energy reliability is going to become a much more significant consideration in government energy policy he said but vincent believes a bigger focus on energy sovereignty will naturally favour energy sources that do not need to be transported across international borders and are not subject to the extreme price volatility witnessed recently in coal oil and gas markets when it comes to the security and sovereignty of energy you can t be much more secure than just relying on the resources that shower upon you every single day be it sun or wind he said
in ukraine today president volodymyr zelenskyy accused russia of war crimes over its continued bombardment of the port city of mariupol after reports of a military strike on an art school sheltering hundreds of civilians zelenskyy renewed his call for direct peace talks with vladimir putin as the west attempts to aid ukraine not with boots on the ground or air cover but with economic sanctions think of it as an economic shock and awe campaign never before has such a large modern economy been cut off so quickly from most of the world to better understand the biden administration s strategy we spoke with veterans of financial warfare against iran and north korea and the white house official who designed the current plan to batter nearly every facet of russia s economy on the first day of the war in ukraine it wasn t a general who briefed reporters at the white house it was daleep singh singh at february 24 briefing good to see all of you again but this is a briefing i never wanted to give singh is the deputy national security adviser for international economics credited with designing the sanctions that putin himself described as economic blitzkrieg daleep singh we met daleep singh last week steps from the white house where the administration was watching the impact of its assault on the russian economy play out in real time sharyn alfonsi what are the types of things that you can look at and say you know what the sanctions are working daleep singh you hear top russian officials describing the pain they re under the indications about how we re impacting putin s calculus are really evident when you you look at the ways in which they re trying to harden their defenses sharyn alfonsi what do you mean daleep singh well they re they re taking some desperate measures capital controls for example preventing people within russia from taking foreign currency out sharyn alfonsi how do you read that daleep singh i think it s a desperate move he s self isolating his economy russia is now on the fast track to a 1980s style soviet living standard it s looking into an economic abyss and that is the result of putin s choices and i can see from his reaction that s where it s headed this is the second time that daleep singh has engaged in financial combat against the kremlin singh was working at the treasury department in 2014 when russia annexed crimea he helped create the sanctions that followed that 2014 experience helped singh who has a degree in economics from duke and masters degrees in public administration and business from harvard and mit create a sanction doctrine a playbook on how to better wage financial war on putin so this time as troops massed on the ukraine border singh presented his plans to president biden a sanctions package so severe they hoped it would bring putin and the russian economy to its knees sharyn alfonsi putin s called the sanctions akin to a declaration of war is it daleep singh you know we need to stay sober with our rhetoric this is a moment for american resolve there s nothing more important right now i mean this is about the freedom of 44 million innocent people who are being terrorized by a dictator and no one in ukraine wants him there within 72 hours of the invasion the u s and its allies kicked most russian financial institutions out of swift the backbone of the global bank payments system then they froze the foreign bank accounts of dozens of russian billionaires and began seizing their toys such as a 700 million yacht with its own indoor swimming pool but the most dramatic strike was directed at the central bank of russia the u s and its allies cut the central bank off from 300 billion it had stashed in american european and asian banks so the russian government could pay its bills if it ever faced sanctions again sharyn alfonsi you knew that there were gonna be specific economic sanctions as you approached this invasion why not signal the specifics could that have been a deterrent daleep singh we signaled as clearly as we could that these were gonna be the most severe economic sanctions ever levied on russia and that we would take steps that we had not contemplated in 2014 sharyn alfonsi do you think that putin didn t believe you or didn t care daleep singh he probably thought he played chess better than we do we ve disarmed his central bank and that s why his economy s in free fall i don t think he planned for that sharyn alfonsi were you surprised how quickly the allies came onboard daleep singh it s unlike anything we ve seen in the sanctions context and you know maybe at the risk of there s a certain irony of quoting lenin but decades are happening in days you know switzerland broke centuries of neutrality to join these sanctions almost immediately the rouble turned to rubble losing a third of its value the moscow stock exchange shuttered russians lined up at atms and cleaned out stores credit agencies warned that russia is likely to default on its foreign loans something that hasn t happened since 1918 during the bolshevik revolution daleep singh the best projections i see out there right now are suggesting that russia s economy is gonna be half of its size that it was before this invasion and we take no pride in the suffering of the russian people this is putin s war these are putin s sanctions and this is putin s hardship he s putting on the russian people that pressure mounts everyday over the last few days australia added 11 banks to its sanctions list japan put another 15 russian officials in its crosshairs according to the brookings institution more than 30 countries have leveled a total of 2 500 sanctions on russian targets including vladimir putin himself sharyn alfonsi there s never been sanctions like this before is there any concern that vladimir putin is now in a corner and can t get out that there s nowhere else to go for him daleep singh look diplomacy is never dead there are always ways for us to step back from the brink but dictators have to pay a price for their aggression we ve always had two different tracks of effort deterrence and imposing costs as well as diplomacy that s still our strategy one official directly involved told us there was a back and forth between americans and financial technocrats inside russia but that line of communication mysteriously went silent two days after the war started daleep singh look we can t get into putin s mind he s he s a brutal tyrant all we can control all we can ensure is that this will be a strategic failure for putin it s ultimately sharyn alfonsi and what does a strategic failure look like today daleep singh it means his ability to project power and exert influence are fundamentally downgraded power is not the exercise of brute force sharyn alfonsi of land grabs daleep singh to acquire land that s not what it s all about in this century our view is power is much more closely tied to your economic strength your technological sophistication and your story can you attract ideas and talent and good will sharyn alfonsi what targets are left daleep singh we can broaden our sanctions so take the measures take the sanctions we ve already applied apply them in more targets apply them to more sectors sharyn alfonsi more banks daleep singh more banks more sectors that we haven t touched sharyn alfonsi like what daleep singh well the commanding heights of the russian economy it s it s mostly about oil and gas but there are other sectors too i don t wanna specify them but i think putin would know what those are daleep singh s plan got added firepower he didn t expect when private companies started fleeing russia coca cola which sold coke in every nation except north korea and cuba suspended operations in russia mcdonald s closed 850 restaurants boeing and airbus have cut off the spare parts russian airlines need to keep flying across a nation spanning 11 time zones in three weeks time 400 companies have left or closed their doors sharyn alfonsi is doing business in russia worth the aggravation dave schaeffer at this point the answer is no dave schaeffer david schaeffer is the ceo of cogent communications it provides high speed internet service in 170 countries including russia at this network operation center in washington employees monitor the flow of internet traffic around the world cogent has terminated its service to carriers linked to the russian government dave schaeffer we were concerned that the size of the connections that we provide to those companies could be used offensively sharyn alfonsi to launch a cyber attack dave schaeffer that s correct that was our number one motivation sharyn alfonsi was there specific intelligence that you were seeing or traffic that you were seeing that concerned you dave schaeffer so we are routinely attacked and we had in normal times been attacked by state actors and by the gru and we re particularly concerned that we were seeing unusual activity and the possibility of a much greater cyber attack the gru is the intelligence wing of the russian military it specializes in computer attacks schaeffer told us his decision to cut service in russia would cost the company less than 1 of their revenue about 10 million dollars so it wasn t worth the risk dave schaeffer we do not at this time have any physical equipment inside of russia that can be taken over we do have equipment as far east as kharkov in the ukraine that equipment has been taken offline that territory has been invaded by the russians and we had to equip our equipment with effectively a dead man switch so once we lost connectivity to it we had to disable the equipment in such a way that if the russians took it it would do them no good on friday in a case of audacious nation state spin the central bank of russia referred to the exodus of companies and the cratering economy as a large scale structural transformation days earlier during a televised address vladimir putin admitted his country s economy had taken a hit from the barrage of sanctions and warned it won t be easy for russians who should expect a rise in prices and unemployment richard nephew the idea is to put so much pressure on him that he has to make a change to his policy sharyn alfonsi but could all that pressure backfire richard nephew absolutely richard nephew richard nephew knows about dictators feeling cornered nephew worked on the iran sanctions during the obama administration and left the state department last month he told us sanctioning an autocrat such as putin comes with risk richard nephew a couple weeks ago they were talking about alerting their strategic nuclear forces they ve already talked about how this is economic warfare and that they will retain the ability to respond accordingly and if you think about that right now they re in the midst of actual warfare if their perception is that they re under attack from other countries that that s a pretty scary thought sharyn alfonsi it s a delicate walk richard nephew it s one where you don t actually have a guidebook there s no you know set of rules that tell you implement sanctions this far but not that far and take this step not that step sharyn alfonsi for russia what are the potential workarounds richard nephew well sanctions evasion is a long practiced activity there are ways in which they can work with other countries potentially those are subject to sanctions themselves venezuela iran they could potentially also try and increase their relationship with china and countries at one point have to make a decision are they really interested in helping out the russians or are they more interested in helping out themselves u s officials said russia asked china for financial support on friday president biden spoke with china s president xi jinping for two hours daleep singh we ve been very clear with china about any support for this invasion and any help it may provide russia in evading sanctions and we ve also made it clear what those consequences would be sharyn alfonsi what would the consequences be sanctions daleep singh that s that s gonna remain private sharyn alfonsi what is the first thing that vladimir putin needs to do so that you might lift sanctions daleep singh well we re nowhere near that point the first thing he has to do is to stop a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of ukraine that s not happening secretary of state antony blinken told national public radio that ending russia s economic isolation would require putin to stop his war and agree not to attack ukraine again daleep singh we re not cowboys and cowgirls pressing buttons to destroy an economy you know we ve spent hundreds of years in this country shaping military doctrine we ve spent a small fraction of that time shaping the doctrine of economic statecraft but we have one it s our objective to demonstrate resolve that sanctions should have the power to impose overwhelming costs on your target sharyn alfonsi there are people who think the sanctions are only about regime change that that s the ultimate goal daleep singh that s up to the people of russia our our cause our purpose is to make sure that putin s actions are remembered as a strategic failure that s what s within our control full stop produced by guy campanile associate

before bidding farewell to samuel aldrich crozer one of roanoke s pioneering industrial magnates some final keystrokes remain to be applied to that chapter of his biography and the accompanying history of his enterprises in this part of the world crozer a visionary 19th century philadelphia area investor had interests here that included iron and steel manufacture mining railroads and real estate crozer s operations were touched on in a previous column there it was pointed out that in addition to his vast skills in entrepreneurship and predicting business trends he was a man of exceptional piety whose contributions in both cash and kind to assorted charities associated with the baptist faith were legion which brings us to the may 31 1883 grand opening of the crozer furnace built in southeast roanoke just east of the norfolk western railway shops the location of the furnace was not far from the confluence of tinker and glade creeks noting raymond barnes july 30 1960 roanoke world news recapitulation of the furnace opening two populations of celebrants reported present that day were not likely to have met the approval of the new plant s owner or others of a similarly religious mind on the moment the oven was first fired some of the fundamentalists present viewed with satisfaction this sample of what the drunks weaving in and out of the crowd could expect hereafter unless reformation set in promptly that there were individuals known to be partial to strong libation present should be of no surprise to anybody familiar with the copious historical accounts of the young boomtown s sodden patronage of its sprawling saloon scene most of the usual vices were contained on the salem avenue corridor that was the heart of roanoke s merry making district yet remarkably the vice available was sometimes inadequate to the occasion and resupply had to be sought elsewhere evidently such was the case for the grand opening of crozer s furnace operation frowns were directed by the more serious minded at gay ladies sent to roanoke by madams of lynchburg to lend their charms to the celebration barnes wrote local services must have been under pressure on account of the crush of out of town dignitaries present for the grand opening one such dignitary most certainly not on the aforementioned list was crozer s daughter on hand for mistress of ceremonies duties for first firing of the furnace because she was the honorary torchbearer suggests she had been sent to serve as her father s representative for the occasion if samuel a crozer was present that day barnes left out any mention of it that may have been contained in contemporary accounts he sourced for his column it is unclear whether the elder crozer was ever in roanoke for any length of time given that he was known as a meticulous businessman the evidence being the vast multistate fortune he amassed it s hard to imagine he didn t stop by roanoke to check on his holdings at some point the local holdings were impressive details were provided in an excerpt from the virginias a mining industrial and scientific journal devoted to the development of virginia and west virginia volume 3 june 1882 unearthed by dyron knick at the virginia room of the roanoke library plant construction was contracted by witherow gordon of pittsburgh working according to the most modern and improved plan three whitwell patent hot blast furnace stoves 18 feet in diameter and 65 feet tall with 10 2 inch flues and boilers 34 feet long 46 inches in diameter a 75 by 150 foot stock house was a central structure with the ore and coke hoisted from there to the top of the oven by means of what was described as a set of crane s automatic engines other brick structures included cast and engine houses the cast house required a 150 by 50 foot iron roof a 60 foot chimney 8 feet in girth handled the exhaust the present plant is being built in such a manner that should occasion require it the building can be doubled in size one hundred tons of pig iron per day was the plant s initial production capacity with a labor force of 150 hands necessary to do it raw materials would come from crozer mines on cripple creek in wythe county elsewhere in washington county and material produced through ore rights at the old cloverdale furnace mines in nearby botetourt county the same publication that reported on the crozer project also introduced news of another new furnace to be located on property written about here before the oliver farm on tinker creek investors named van vorhis and stetson from new york had bought the iron lands of the farm there to build a furnace for the production of mill iron that project which was predicted to operate on an extensive scale and other similar operations were soon coming to the area the journal reported with that came a further prediction that matched a similar claim for another locality in the region in this case that roanoke would become the pittsburgh of the south not in name only but in fact other predictions had held that glasgow a town in rockbridge county of the same era would be the new pittsburgh of the south because of many of the same attributes that prompted the same prediction for the roanoke valley the boom and bust of glasgow was a topic for another column here as we now know neither grandiose prophesy came true glasgow and roanoke turned out all right anyway

the federal government has incurred n950bn new domestic borrowing between january 2022 and march 11 2022 the debt management office has revealed the fresh borrowing was disclosed on march 17 in the presentation of the public debt data as of december 31 2021 by the director general of the dmo patience oniha in the document oniha disclosed that the federal government was considering all options to raise funds externally she said all options for raising funds externally are being considered these include funding from multilateral and bilateral sources the international capital markets and the 3 35bn special drawing rights allocated by the international monetary fund to the central bank of nigeria according to the document the federal government still plans to borrow an additional n1 6tn while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing is n2 57tn there is also a plan to borrow n2 57tn from foreign creditors while n1 16tn is expected from multilateral bilateral drawdowns in total the federal government plans to add n6 3tn new debts to the current debt stock which would push the country s total debt stock to n45 86tn by december 2022 however the federal government in the national development plan 2021 2025 hopes to push the total debt stock to n46 63tn for 2022 a tabular illustration in the document showed that the government targets n39 59tn debt stock for 2021 n46 63tn for 2022 n50 22tn for 2023 n50 53tn for 2024 and n45 96tn by 2025 in march this year nigeria acquired 1 25bn eurobond debt from the international capital market making nigeria the first african country to access the icm in 2022 this happened a few days after the minister of finance budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed had told reuters that there was no plan to enter the eurobond market in 2022 the dmo said the proceeds of the eurobond would be used to finance critical capital projects in the budget in order to bridge the deficit in infrastructure and strengthen nigeria s economic recovery while the finance minister said that proceeds from the 4bn acquired from the eurobond market the previous year would be used to fund fuel subsidy the world bank has said that nigeria s debt which may be considered sustainable for now is vulnerable and costly according to the washington based global financial institution the country s debt is also at risk of becoming unsustainable in the event of macro fiscal shocks experts have kicked against the federal government s proclivity for debt which they have described as unsustainable speaking on the development an economist and chief executive officer of the centre for the promotion of private enterprise dr muda yusuf said the country is on the brink of debt distress he said nigeria is on the brink of debt distress because our debt profile now is not sustainable we had a debt service to revenue ratio getting to 76 per cent as of november last year the situation is likely to get worse because our deficit in the 2022 budget is n6 4tn and we need to borrow to finance the deficit also the federal government has submitted a supplementary budget proposal for subsidy for n2 55tn after the budget was passed adding that to the deficit we will get about n9tn how much is the revenue it is just about n10 7tn and we are not likely to get the full revenue maybe 70 per cent so we are getting to a point whereby the time we service our debts which should be around n4tn and spend another n4tn on subsidy this year we have consumed almost all our revenue for the year does that now mean that we are going to be using debt for personnel costs for overhead for capital budget that is where we are heading to he further lamented that instead of the country gaining from the increase in oil price like other oil producing countries the government was losing money on fuel importation and fuel subsidy with the increase in oil price the subsidy price will have to increase beyond what the nnpc requested while other oil producing companies are happy as their reserves are increasing and currency are getting stronger we are lamenting because we are not getting the full benefit of the oil windfall he added a professor of economics at the olabisi onabanjo university ago iwoye ogun state prof sheriffdeen tella criticised the federal government for the rate of increasing debt according to him the money spent on debt servicing is eating deep into the government s revenue which makes borrowing an unsustainable form of financing he said we are already in debt distress if we are spending a large proportion of our revenue on debt servicing we are in trouble and our revenue is not growing the minister of finance recently said we will borrow from eurobonds to finance subsidy what kind of economics is that the minister of finance deserves to be given an award for patronising the debt market she has made nigeria the most active debt in the world this is not good enough we are already in distress in terms of debts because we are spending our revenue which is declining on debt servicing and fuel importation it is unfortunate what is the money borrowed used for every time we hear of things being underfunded even the nnpc said they are underfunded which is why they were unable to meet up with the opec quota for oil production so what really is funded in this country he further urged the federal government to stop borrowing and focus on how to boost revenue especially by removing the fuel subsidy the federal government needs to be stopped from borrowing money they just borrow for consumption and not production how can you borrow for subsidy on fuel when people are using more diesel industries trains and trailers use diesel diesel is not enjoying subsidy so what subsidy are they paying on petrol which is for domestic use and not industrial use industries even have to use diesel steadily due to poor electric power supply we need to get our priority right tella said copyright punch all rights reserved this

the philippines is bracing for the indirect spillover impacts of the economic sanctions slapped on russia following its invasion of ukraine finance secretary carlos dominguez iii told bloomberg last week that given the philippines limited trade with both countries the financial and trade sanctions slapped on russia by western countries would have no direct impact on the domestic economy but we are quite concerned about the effects on the overall world economy he said we are concerned that there might be an effect on the vigorousness of the economies in western europe and the united states who are our trading partners dominguez worried that global trade disruptions affecting logistics and ease of doing business across borders that already started during the covid 19 pandemic would be prolonged further by the russia ukraine war in a report by the world bank s philippine office the conflict has rattled investor sentiment as reflected by a weakening of the local stock market and the philippine peso it also said philippine authorities should watch out for the extent that the conflict will contribute to a further increase in energy and food inflation dominguez said domestic inflation would likely be a bit higher due to high global commodity and food prices but we are ready to tackle it by giving away cash subsidies to vulnerable sectors as well as lowering tariffs on some food imports while thumbing down proposals to suspend oil excise taxes while we hope for a swift and diplomatic resolution to war russia started in ukraine we also have to be prepared to deal with the consequences if the conflict is drawn out just as europeans and americans are bracing for higher energy costs due to the multiple sanctions that have been slapped on russia so should filipinos who live halfway across the globe be prepared for the economic and trade ripples or waves that putin s war will most likely cause

to european union headquarters in belgium these were not spy chiefs or generals but experts in reading fine print and tracking the flow of money computer chips and other goods around the world their mandate inflict maximum pain on russian president vladimir putin making it harder if not impossible for him to fund a prolonged war in ukraine and denying him access to technologies at the core of modern warfare there were intense meetings in february in brussels paris london and berlin often running six hours at a time as the allies tried to craft the details of a historic economic blockade according to biden administration officials some of the exports the u s wanted to ban were met with reluctance by the europeans who would essentially be telling their own companies to forgo several billion dollars in annual revenues from russia when there was a deadlock u s negotiators would put commerce secretary gina raimondo on the phone you can say no now but when the body bags are coming out of ukraine you re not going to want to be a holdout raimondo said she told allied counterparts do the right thing everyone signed on and before the invasion raimondo said what ultimately drove the agreement and the fast timeline was the threat of putin s imminent attack on ukraine president joe biden speaks in the south court auditorium on the white house campus march 18 in washington biden quietly dispatched a team to nato headquarters in belgium just days before russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 what emerged from the meetings was an export ban and the groundwork to immobilize about half the foreign holdings of russia s central bank photo patrick semansky associated press we all got religion fast that it was time to band together and stick together she said if you cause enough pain isolate putin it will bring this war to an end the wealthiest nations in the world outside of china are directly confronting putin on their preferred terms they have imposed sanctions in which their strengths intersect with russia s vulnerabilities russia is reliant on the u s the eu japan south korea and taiwan for cutting edge technologies and investment so the allies decided to cut moscow off it s a strategic play designed to trap putin in a downward spiral as foreign investors pull out their money in response to the atrocities it s also a remarkable show of unity that could be tested in the coming weeks by the allies own dependence on fossil fuels a group of economists estimated thursday that eu countries have transferred more than 14 7 billion to russia for oil natural gas and coal since the war began essentially funding putin s war machine while the allied talks in the lead up to the war were critical the eu was not just waiting around for u s direction to act bloc members had been consulting for months one eu diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks outlined in an interview as far back as january potential penalties that included the export ban noting that the eu had held together its coalition on enforcing sanctions since russia s 2014 occupation of parts of the donbas region in ukraine but this time the u s and eu responded to russia s aggression with a novel set of policies to cripple putin s ability to fight by denying it access to the semiconductors computers telecommunications equipment lasers and sensors integral to war materiel this is a supply chain squeeze that will force russia to raid existing airplanes tanks and other gear for spare parts essentially eroding its military and economic capacity the same u s and eu officials dealing with their own supply chain challenges after the pandemic found a way to amplify the problem for russia through trade regulations in a sign of early success u s officials point to the closing of lada auto plants in russia and the more than 300 companies that have stopped doing business with russia the companies are not just starbucks but chipmakers such as germany s infineon that said it stopped all direct and indirect deliveries to russia as well as technical support within days of the invasion the allies blocked the foreign assets of russia s central bank two senior biden administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity said this option was not initially presented to allies out of concern that russia could move its money ahead of time they waited to present the asset freeze until the invasion started and the images of bombings and death compelled the europeans to almost immediately agree the freeze rendered half of the more than 600 billion in putin s war chest unusable while the russian stock market has been closed and the value of the ruble has plunged the sanctions are designed so that the financial effects tightens over time as long as ukraine is able to hold out with military aid against severe casualties the sanctions will do more to exhaust putin eu commission vice president valdis dombrovskis on thursday praised the very good coordination among nations and said the sanctions are biting hard russia s financial markets are close to collapse he also noted that the sanctions create costs for the allies though the price is much less than the consequences of the war spreading yet with every new round of sanctions the unity of the 27 eu members is tested ever more if imposing a ban on russian oil and gas comes up germany and italy both heavily dependent on russian energy will be in a tough spot to contain the drive of several eastern member nations like poland and the baltic states that want to hit putin as hard as possible as soon as possible the u s is less dependent on russian oil and natural gas making it easier for biden to ban those imports earlier this month there is also the risk that the sanctions will fail to stop putin or that russia can still find ways to bring goods into its economy trade data analyzed by importgenius show that china supplanted germany in 2021 as the leading source of exports to russia and u s officials say that russia has solicited help from the chinese government on twitter olivier blanchard former chief economist at the international monetary fund and now a fellow at the peterson institute of international economics equated the sanctions to the bombing of german factories during world war ii those bombings disrupted the german war machine in ways that made it impossible to prolong an extended fight and economists had a role in choosing the targets how many people do we let die before putin runs out of assets tania babina columbia university finance professor for all that has been done questions remain about whether it is enough blanchard recommends expanding the export controls from defense related production to anything which disorganizes production in the russian economy if russian made refrigerators need a gasket made in the eu restricting access to that gasket makes it harder for the russian economy to function he said tania babina a finance professor at columbia university who was born in ukraine said that sanctions tend not to stop dictators and she warned that putin might ultimately become even more entrenched unless the u s and eu take more aggressive action she said europeans need to add sanctions that ban the use of russian oil and natural gas he is going to throw everything to win will send his grandma to fight if needed babina said he cannot lose ukraine that is why it is so paramount to cut off russia s energy export revenues but babina noted that there is another far more chilling cost to the allied strategy of sanctions ukrainian lives how many people do we let die before putin runs out of assets she asked

four years have passed since the donald trump administration announced it would impose tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese exports on march 22 2018 together with various further investment restrictions on china yet statistics issued by both sides now reveal that china u s trade instead of cooling down owing to the trade war is heating up according to the u s department of commerce in 2021 bilateral trade jumped by 17 6 percent year on year as data from china s national bureau of statistics show it increased by 20 2 percent leading sino american trade turnover to rank first among u s trading partners ironically the countries trade growth well exceeds the 12 3 percent rate in 2017 four years of trade war prove that trying to contain china has been a faulty stroke on the part of the u s the china u s dispute touches on trade science and technology diplomacy geopolitics and international rules the joe biden administration inherited all hostile policies toward china from its predecessor including extra tariffs on chinese exports and has taken it one step further by linking trade with human rights values and ideologies this arguably marks an unspoken bipartisan consensus on curbing china s development china u s trade statistics for 2021 demonstrate that the u s government s political interference did little to curb china s growth except for raising obstacles to the bilateral trade and crippling transnational business in china the latter however remains the world s most vibrant major economy whereas the u s seemingly has shot itself in the foot the country s record high inflation is to large extent the result of higher tariffs on chinese goods given these additional charges will eventually pass on to u s consumers in the form of valued goods according to the u s china business council the trade war knocked 108 billion off u s gdp from 2018 to 2019 and cost 245 000 jobs at present the u s still imposes an average tariff of 19 3 percent on 66 4 percent of chinese exports whereas china levies a tariff of 20 7 percent on 58 3 percent of american exports to china higher than the average tariff of 3 1 percent before the trade war and also higher than the average tariffs china imposes on goods from other countries these rates might result in the loss of another 732 000 jobs in the u s this year truth be told many big u s corporations oppose the trade conflict a number of american businesses have already demanded the removal of extra tariffs by submitting written statements to the u s department of commerce and office of the u s trade representative hoping to maintain normal economic and trade ties with china a report released by the american chamber of commerce in china on march 8 points out that surveyed u s companies operating in china are optimistic about the chinese market and some 66 percent intend to increase their investments in the country 83 percent of which do not plan to move their manufacturing or purchasing business out of china yet their voices are unfortunately too often muted by american politicians and populists five decades of interaction have deeply intertwined chinese and american interests despite the trade dispute in the four years their trade exchanges remain the most important part of bilateral relations outweighing political and personal exchanges which have dropped to historical low due to u s china containment policies and the covid 19 outbreak even frequent shipments shuttling between the two countries keep the baltic dry index a proxy for dry bulk shipping stocks as well as a general shipping market bellwether high ever closer trade relations between china and the u s reveal that the conflict proves a drag on china u s cooperation the time has come for the u s to forgo its consistently backfiring china containment policy china today boasts the world s largest middle income population 400 million as well as the best opportunities and biggest market potential of its 1 4 billion population to tap into neither country stands to benefit from the trade war what they really need is a suitable free trade agreement

not all credit card companies are built the same in fact not all credit card companies are credit card companies at all perhaps the warren buffett way really is better that s the conclusion you could draw given the unexpected recent gains in one of berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 more uninteresting holdings anyway american express axp 0 09 shares are up almost 30 in the past 12 months priced within sight of new 52 week highs while the s p 500 gspc 1 20 is up a more modest 11 in the same timeframe better still american express is up a hefty 137 for the past five years surprising nearly everyone with sizable gains from a seemingly stodgy company what did buffett and his acolytes know that lots of other people didn t american express provides real value american express is not technically a credit card company rather it provides charge cards or a means of making purchases without the use of cash with the expectation that the charge will be paid in full at the end of the billing period the company handles a few billion consumer transactions every year each one of which generates a few cents worth of revenue for every dollar spent american express collected 25 7 billion of this sort of revenue in 2021 however for all intents and purposes american express is a credit card company and more importantly a credit card lender amex generated 8 8 billion worth of interest based revenue last year which only cost it 1 3 billion all told the company netted 7 7 billion in interest revenue in 2021 the numbers however still don t answer the question about why the shares of this organization operating in the highly competitive credit card industry are doing so well the differentiator is the perks and benefits ecosystem american express has built for cardholders most credit card issuers tack on niceties like cash back rewards points toward travel miles and the like to their service few of them do it as well as amex does though points are awarded for everyday things like shopping for groceries and eating at restaurants and cash is given back for purchases made at department stores certain cards even offer credit toward ride hailing services and free checked bags when flying and these aren t insignificant rewards for instance holders of american express s blue cash preferred card will get back 6 on as much as 6 000 of their supermarket purchases in the span of one year the perks are so sweet in fact that many consumers are willing to pay sizable annual fees just to use american express cards of amex s 2021 revenue of 42 4 billion 5 2 billion of it came from membership fees alone that s a high margin 5 2 billion worth of sales too costs linked to managing its rewards programs member services advertising and marketing are covered by the more typical credit card revenue sources like transaction fees and interest charges in simpler terms american express is very very good at adding real value for its cardholders the proverbial proof of the pudding lies in the numbers last year s 17 uptick in net revenue isn t just a post pandemic fluke at the company s recent investor day event american express said it s targeting revenue growth of between 18 and 20 this year and aims to generate annual revenue growth of more than 10 in 2024 and beyond earnings growth should roll in somewhere in the mid teens at that sales growth pace given everything we know about the company those results certainly seem achievable and perhaps here s the part buffett and berkshire s stock pickers like best past and projected profit growth is supporting similar dividend growth american express just upped its 2022 quarterly dividend payment again to 0 52 per share up 20 from last year s quarterly payout and a return to the rate of increase before the pandemic took hold buffett s patience is paying off a perfect stock no there s no such thing every stock has risk and since people run companies mistakes happen and inefficiencies exist then there are the unexpected hurdles that up end earnings like pandemics and recessions geopolitical tensions don t help matters either american express however is one of those solid stocks that s easily overlooked while hunting for more exciting investment prospects that s a big mistake a mistake that warren buffett didn t make he s held a stake in the company for a couple of decades now and rightly so you d do well to follow his lead
portland oregon united states march 20 2022 einpresswire com on the 16th of march 2022 the global critical research centre gcrc hosted a conference that discussed the impact of the ukraine crisis on europe at the gcrc meeting rachel blake editor in chief of the gcrc s current affairs research department moderated the discussion and made a keynote address on her recent project results that shows after the outbreak of the russian ukrainian conflict europe was the main bearer of economic social and security losses specifically there are the following three points 1 greater pressure on energy prices europe is heavily dependent on russian energy and sanctions on russian oil and gas will lead to a sharp rise in europeâ s reliance on expensive natural gas energy from the united states but even so the current u s production capacity simply cannot meet the gap of its allies therefore europe will inevitably face a state of energy shortage in the short term which may cause price increases or even lead to the collapse of industrial development in some european countries 2 higher inflation after the ukrainian war european stocks bonds and foreign exchange markets were battered coupled with the rise in oil and gas prices compounded europeâ s already sluggish economy as the euro depreciated massive european capital outflows to the u s pushing the safe haven dollar to its highest level since the coronavirus induced volatility 3 security instability ukraine is close to russia and europe but far from the united states so it is low cost and risk free for the u s to create a conflict in ukraine however europe has to bear the brunt as the situation in ukraine deteriorates refugee flows and regional unrest triggered by the ukraine crisis combined with the raging covid 19 pandemic will have a fatal impact on europe s security and economic development rachel further analyzed that though the eu longs for peace the decision to resolve the ukraine crisis is not in the hands of the eu during the discussion session researchers at the gcrc s current affairs research department shared their views accompanied by the corresponding case study as shown below u s secretary of state blinken has once said that if the polish government supplies ukraine with mig 29 fighter jets the united states will actively consider the possibility of replacing polish mig 29 with us made f 16 fighter jets but when poland offered to send its mig 29 fighter jets to ukraine via a u s airbase in germany the united states reneged on its previous vow to support fighter jets to ukraine saying poland s proposal raised serious concern moreover it even refused to let washington support or facilitate the exchange to avoid pulling the united states itself into the conflict rachel then summarized the discussion results and commented that the u s only offered economic sanctions and had benefited from this crisis but europe by contrast cannot afford a long war on its continent at the end of the conference mason wood made a concluding speech and proposed european strategic autonomy from the withdrawal of troops from afghanistan the aukus alliance to the ukraine crisis europe has a clearer understanding that it cannot rely entirely on the united states instead it should further promote european strategic autonomy in action to decrease its dependence on washington to make its own autonomic decisions the reality that the us strategic center of gravity is anchoring the asia pacific region has not changed europe should enhance its independent and autonomous status in the international community in various fields take practical actions on defense and security issues as soon as possible and play its role as an independent force in the international landscape so as to avoid becoming the object of passive use in the u s russian geopolitical struggle
the writer heads the sustainable development policy institute at the onset of the pandemic the experts warned about three challenges facing humanity covid 19 food crisis and a global recession while covid 19 inflicted unprecedented losses fortunately the world escaped a global recession and food crisis however that escape seemed short lived once again experts are warning of a food crisis and a global recession but this time the crises will not be triggered by a pandemic but due to the ongoing russia ukraine war consumers worldwide may not realise the gravity of the situation as the crisis is not reflected correctly through the retail prices of fuel and food yet however if a de escalation between russia and ukraine which seems unlikely as the situation stands now does not happen soon the world seems set to go into recession and face a food crisis in the next few months let me explain how first things first why would supply chain disruption from these two countries affect the global commodity prices russia is the world s largest second largest and third largest exporter of natural gas oil and coal hence it has the lion s share in the global energy supplies especially in europe where russia meets forty percent of the gas requirements and eighty percent of the coal requirements russia accounts for eleven percent of global wheat supplies one tenth of the world s aluminum and copper and one fifth of battery grade nickel america meets half of its uranium requirements for energy generation from russia moreover russia produces forty percent of the world s palladium and eighty percent of the world s vegetable oil russia along with belarus is an important source of the world s potash and phosphoric fertilizers ukraine too is one of the largest global exporters of wheat we have been importing from ukraine in the past and sunflower seeds it provides about half the world s neon russia and ukraine together cater to more than one quarter of the global export of wheat one sixth of corn one third of barley and about eighty percent of sunflower oil and sunflower seed meal global commodity prices were already on an upward trajectory due to an increased demand thanks to an earlier than expected recovery from covid 19 the war between russia and ukraine further aggravated the situation and the world observed its biggest commodity shock since 1973 overall indices of commodity prices are now 26 percent higher than at the start of 2022 brent crude oil which is currently hovering at around 100 a barrel as only the us had embargoed import of oil from russia had soared to 139 a barrel amid fear of joint sanctions by the us and eu here it is pertinent to mention that a complete global embargo enforced by the us could send the oil price towards 200 a barrel already european gas prices have trebled amid panic that russia may block the gas supply one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies since world war i is pushing the prices of wheat up likewise prices of palm and soybean oil are on the rise as a substitute for sunflower and vegetable oil more than 400 western brands and chains have closed their business in russia amidst sanctions by the west however while it has become clear that russia can survive without western finished goods for the rest of the world to survive without russian raw material is economically painful that is why russian raw material exports have been spared the kind of comprehensive sanctions the west has imposed on other sectors in an average year russia exports seven to eight million barrels of oil per day bpd experts say that even the combined additional oil supplies from the us up to 1m bpd opec members up to 1 2 m bpd and iran 1m bpd if sanctions are lifted from it would only compensate for half of the russian oil supplies these additional supplies would take at least one year to come into effect because most oil producers have not invested in new fields for years russia has threatened to cut off europe s energy supply in retaliation to western sanctions even if it does not do so and the west does not put a complete embargo on russian commodity exports the de facto sanctions are already there lenders insurers and shipping firms are reluctant to strike deals to carry russian cargoes due to the western sanctions on russian banks on the other hand most of the foreign banks including chinese ones wary of steep penalties are not issuing letters of credit for russian trade container operators like maersk and msc have pulled away from russia some vessels taking russian goods were intercepted by western navies while a few got hit by missiles in the black sea hence commercial shipping is almost suspended there and russian supply chains are already disrupted the volatility and uncertainty in the global stock markets is also contributing to the forthcoming recession oil prices moving in the range of 100 a barrel to 140 a barrel in a single week widely fluctuating wheat prices gas suppliers defaulting on their long term cargo supply contracts and a halt on the trading of metals in the major commodity exchange markets etc are signs of a giant storm the imf world bank and other top global lenders warned last friday of the extensive economic fallout of the ukraine crisis in a joint statement they have warned that the conflict is increasing poverty and pushing inflation up further the entire global economy will feel the effect of the crisis through slower growth trade disruptions and steeper inflation harming especially the poorest and most vulnerable global inflation already at seven percent may rise by another two to three percentage points to a level last seen for a sustained period in the early 1990s how could pakistan which is currently dealing with political turmoil be affected by this situation food and fuel are a larger part of our spending and both are bound to increase we saw our long term lng suppliers defaulting on two consignments of march compelling us to buy expensive gas from the spot market expect more such defaults in the months to come the prime minister gave his relief package when the crude prices were 88 a barrel those are now hovering around 100 and can quickly rise to us 150 with any wrong move by russian or nato forces freezing the prices of oil in pakistan is not only a huge fiscal challenge but is also contributing to our current account deficit cad which for the first eight months of the current fiscal year is 12 1 billion the import of oil forms a major chunk of it on the food front one is expecting to miss the yield target of wheat due to a shortage of urea fertilizer during the sowing season international wheat prices are bound to increase further globally higher wheat prices would be an added incentive for domestic investors to smuggle wheat to western neighbours any domestic wheat shortage would compel the government to import expensive wheat ultimately leading to an increase both in the domestic flour prices and cad the same is true for edible oil imports which would turn more expensive to meet the balance of payments we would require external assistance the result of the imf review mission as well as china s response to our 21 billion assistance request are awaiting the outcome of the no confidence motion against the pti government this anticipated food and fuel inflation would erode into the political capital of any party parties in power a consensus among all political forces on a minimalistic economic agenda is a must to minimise the ripple effects of the global recession and a looming food crisis difficult times are ahead for the winner in parliament on march 28 not only on the political front but also on the economic front twitter abidsuleri

from the time he bought starbucks in 1987 to the time he stepped down as chairman in 2018 howard schultz consistently and successfully fought attempts to unionize starbucks u s stores and roasting plants but schultz who was recently named starbucks interim chief executive never confronted a unionization movement as big and fast growing as the current one six u s starbucks stores have voted to unionize since december and at least 140 more in 27 states have filed petitions for union elections it s unclear how schultz will tackle the issue when he returns to the company in april starbucks ceo kevin johnson to retire howard schultz to return he took it really personally that his workers wanted to be part of a union because he thought with him in charge they wouldn t need it said pam blauman schmitz a retired union representative who worked to organize starbucks first stores in the early 1980s he would say stuff like maybe you need unions in the coal mines but not at starbucks stores starbucks announced march 16 that its ceo of five years kevin johnson was retiring the company tapped schultz to serve as interim ceo until it finds a permanent replacement by this fall schultz 68 who has held the honorary title of chairman emeritus since 2018 is also rejoining the company s board it is not yet clear if schultz will try to amp up the fight against unionization but timothy hubbard assistant professor of management at the university of notre dame s mendoza college of business said he is well positioned to do so my sense is that if they want to shut down the unions this is the best course of action hubbard said schultz has what it takes to tackle a hard topic like unions arizona starbucks becomes 1st outside new york to unionize schultz did not respond to attempts to contact him through his website or his family s foundation in a november letter to employees posted just before the first unionization votes at three stores in buffalo new york schultz said he tried to create the kind of company that his blue collar father never had the chance to work for he recalled the traumatic moment his family had no income after his father suffered a workplace injury and said that s why starbucks has benefits like health care free college tuition parental leave and stock grants for employees ticker security last change change sbux starbucks corp 85 17 0 25 0 29 no partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at starbucks and i am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now schultz wrote but to many union organizers who complain of inconsistent hours poor training understaffing and low wages shultz s words fell flat a lot of people felt like they were being lectured to by a disappointed father because they weren t grateful said jaz brisack a starbucks barista and labor organizer who heard schultz speak at an employee forum in buffalo last fall others say they ve seen outright anger from schultz over unions blauman schmitz said as soon as schultz bought starbucks in 1987 he reneged on a labor agreement that had been reached between the company and the united food and commercial workers union which represented six seattle area stores and a roasting plant schultz wanted a new contract with weaker benefits and job protections said blauman schmitz who has since retired from the union one day she said schultz spotted her passing out flyers in the roasting plant and rushed toward her screaming and red in the face anne belov was working part time in the roasting plant and sat on the union negotiating committee she had always gotten glowing performance reviews but after schultz took over she was suddenly being reprimanded constantly belov left the company in 1988 us labor unions finding new hope in younger workers you could see the writing on the wall as the company grew it was not going to continue to be possible to act on the good faith of the people who controlled all the power she said schultz soon swept the union out in his 1997 book pour your heart into it he recalled how a barista who opposed the union began a campaign to decertify it by 1992 the union no longer represented the stores or the roasting plant schultz saw that as a sign that workers trusted him if they had faith in me and my motives they wouldn t need a union he wrote still efforts to unionize starbucks didn t go away and the company continued to fight them starbucks had to reinstate fired workers or pay to settle labor law violations numerous times in the early 2000s last year the nlrb found that starbucks unlawfully retaliated against two philadelphia baristas who were attempting to unionize the nlrb said starbucks monitored the employees social media unlawfully spied on their conversations and ultimately fired them it ordered starbucks to stop interfering with workers right to organize and offer reinstatement to the two workers more recently on march 15 the nlrb issued a complaint against starbucks alleging that district and store managers in phoenix spied on and threatened workers who supported unionizing the complaint says starbucks suspended one union supporter and fired another starbucks did not make anyone available to comment click here to read more on fox business in a letter to employees in december starbucks north america president rossann williams said the company will respect the legal process and bargain in good faith but the company insists its stores function better when it works directly with employees the outcome of the current unionizing effort is unclear the number of stores that have petitioned for union elections is still only a fraction of starbucks 9 000 company owned stores in the u s and starbucks has the resources to keep fighting with annual revenue of 29 billion last year but brisack said this unionizing effort is also stronger than past ones which were thwarted by high worker turnover and resource starved unions organizers now have the backing of workers united an arm of the 2 million member service employees international union and a union friendly president in the white house brisack said the pandemic also fueled workers outrage the climate is also changing dan cornfield a labor expert and professor of sociology at vanderbilt said u s polling shows growing public support for unions since the great recession that s a big difference from the 1980s when starbucks first fought back unions get fox business on the go by clicking here by taking an anti union stand from the reagan era they are actually potentially jeopardizing their customer base cornfield said

hear top russian officials describing the pain they re under the indications about how we re impacting putin s calculus are really evident when you you look at the ways in which they re trying to harden their defenses sharyn alfonsi what do you mean daleep singh well they re they re taking some desperate measures capital controls for example preventing people within russia from taking foreign currency out sharyn alfonsi how do you read that daleep singh i think it s a desperate move he s self isolating his economy russia is now on the fast track to a 1980s style soviet living standard it s looking into an economic abyss and that is the result of putin s choices and i can see from his reaction that s where it s headed this is the second time that daleep singh has engaged in financial combat against the kremlin singh was working at the treasury department in 2014 when russia annexed crimea he helped create the sanctions that followed that 2014 experience helped singh who has a degree in economics from duke and masters degrees in public administration and business from harvard and mit create a sanction doctrine a playbook on how to better wage financial war on putin so this time as troops massed on the ukraine border singh presented his plans to president biden a sanctions package so severe they hoped it would bring putin and the russian economy to its knees sharyn alfonsi putin s called the sanctions akin to a declaration of war is it daleep singh you know we need to stay sober with our rhetoric this is a moment for american resolve there s nothing more important right now i mean this is about the freedom of 44 million innocent people who are being terrorized by a dictator and no one in ukraine wants him there within 72 hours of the invasion the u s and its allies kicked most russian financial institutions out of swift the backbone of the global bank payments system then they froze the foreign bank accounts of dozens of russian billionaires and began seizing their toys such as a 700 million yacht with its own indoor swimming pool but the most dramatic strike was directed at the central bank of russia the u s and its allies cut the central bank off from 300 billion it had stashed in american european and asian banks so the russian government could pay its bills if it ever faced sanctions again sharyn alfonsi you knew that there were gonna be specific economic sanctions as you approached this invasion why not signal the specifics could that have been a deterrent daleep singh we signaled as clearly as we could that these were gonna be the most severe economic sanctions ever levied on russia and that we would take steps that we had not contemplated in 2014 sharyn alfonsi do you think that putin didn t believe you or didn t care daleep singh he probably thought he played chess better than we do we ve disarmed his central bank and that s why his economy s in free fall i don t think he planned for that sharyn alfonsi were you surprised how quickly the allies came onboard daleep singh it s unlike anything we ve seen in the sanctions context and you know maybe at the risk of there s a certain irony of quoting lenin but decades are happening in days you know switzerland broke centuries of neutrality to join these sanctions almost immediately the rouble turned to rubble losing a third of its value the moscow stock exchange shuttered russians lined up at atms and cleaned out stores credit agencies warned that russia is likely to default on its foreign loans something that hasn t happened since 1918 during the bolshevik revolution daleep singh the best projections i see out there right now are suggesting that russia s economy is gonna be half of its size that it was before this invasion and we take no pride in the suffering of the russian people this is putin s war these are putin s sanctions and this is putin s hardship he s putting on the russian people that pressure mounts everyday over the last few days australia added 11 banks to its sanctions list japan put another 15 russian officials in its crosshairs according to the brookings institution more than 30 countries have leveled a total of 2 500 sanctions on russian targets including vladimir putin himself sharyn alfonsi there s never been sanctions like this before is there any concern that vladimir putin is now in a corner and can t get out that there s nowhere else to go for him daleep singh look diplomacy is never dead there are always ways for us to step back from the brink but dictators have to pay a price for their aggression we ve always had two different tracks of effort deterrence and imposing costs as well as diplomacy that s still our strategy one official directly involved told us there was a back and forth between americans and financial technocrats inside russia but that line of communication mysteriously went silent two days after the war started daleep singh look we can t get into putin s mind he s he s a brutal tyrant all we can control all we can ensure is that this will be a strategic failure for putin it s ultimately sharyn alfonsi and what does a strategic failure look like today daleep singh it means his ability to project power and exert influence are fundamentally downgraded power is not the exercise of brute force sharyn alfonsi of land grabs daleep singh to acquire land that s not what it s all about in this century our view is power is much more closely tied to your economic strength your technological sophistication and your story can you attract ideas and talent and good will sharyn alfonsi what targets are left daleep singh we can broaden our sanctions so take the measures take the sanctions we ve already applied apply them in more targets apply them to more sectors sharyn alfonsi more banks daleep singh more banks more sectors that we haven t touched sharyn alfonsi like what daleep singh well the commanding heights of the russian economy it s it s mostly about oil and gas but there are other sectors too i don t wanna specify them but i think putin would know what those are daleep singh s plan got added firepower he didn t expect when private companies started fleeing russia coca cola which sold coke in every nation except north korea and cuba suspended operations in russia mcdonald s closed 850 restaurants boeing and airbus have cut off the spare parts russian airlines need to keep flying across a nation spanning 11 time zones in three weeks time 400 companies have left or closed their doors sharyn alfonsi is doing business in russia worth the aggravation dave schaeffer at this point the answer is no dave schaeffer david schaeffer is the ceo of cogent communications it provides high speed internet service in 170 countries including russia at this network operation center in washington employees monitor the flow of internet traffic around the world cogent has terminated its service to carriers linked to the russian government dave schaeffer we were concerned that the size of the connections that we provide to those companies could be used offensively sharyn alfonsi to launch a cyber attack dave schaeffer that s correct that was our number one motivation sharyn alfonsi was there specific intelligence that you were seeing or traffic that you were seeing that concerned you dave schaeffer so we are routinely attacked and we had in normal times been attacked by state actors and by the gru and we re particularly concerned that we were seeing unusual activity and the possibility of a much greater cyber attack the gru is the intelligence wing of the russian military it specializes in computer attacks schaeffer told us his decision to cut service in russia would cost the company less than 1 of their revenue about 10 million dollars so it wasn t worth the risk dave schaeffer we do not at this time have any physical equipment inside of russia that can be taken over we do have equipment as far east as kharkov in the ukraine that equipment has been taken offline that territory has been invaded by the russians and we had to equip our equipment with effectively a dead man switch so once we lost connectivity to it we had to disable the equipment in such a way that if the russians took it it would do them no good on friday in a case of audacious nation state spin the central bank of russia referred to the exodus of companies and the cratering economy as a large scale structural transformation days earlier during a televised address vladimir putin admitted his country s economy had taken a hit from the barrage of sanctions and warned it won t be easy for russians who should expect a rise in prices and unemployment richard nephew the idea is to put so much pressure on him that he has to make a change to his policy sharyn alfonsi but could all that pressure backfire richard nephew absolutely richard nephew richard nephew knows about dictators feeling cornered nephew worked on the iran sanctions during the obama administration and left the state department last month he told us sanctioning an autocrat such as putin comes with risk richard nephew a couple weeks ago they were talking about alerting their strategic nuclear forces they ve already talked about how this is economic warfare and that they will retain the ability to respond accordingly and if you think about that right now they re in the midst of actual warfare if their perception is that they re under attack from other countries that that s a pretty scary thought sharyn alfonsi it s a delicate walk richard nephew it s one where you don t actually have a guidebook there s no you know set of rules that tell you implement sanctions this far but not that far and take this step not that step sharyn alfonsi for russia what are the potential workarounds richard nephew well sanctions evasion is a long practiced activity there are ways in which they can work with other countries potentially those are subject to sanctions themselves venezuela iran they could potentially also try and increase their relationship with china and countries at one point have to make a decision are they really interested in helping out the russians or are they more interested in helping out themselves u s officials said russia asked china for financial support on friday president biden spoke with china s president xi jinping for two hours daleep singh we ve been very clear with china about any support for this invasion and any help it may provide russia in evading sanctions and we ve also made it clear what those consequences would be sharyn alfonsi what would the consequences be sanctions daleep singh that s that s gonna remain private sharyn alfonsi what is the first thing that vladimir putin needs to do so that you might lift sanctions daleep singh well we re nowhere near that point the first thing he has to do is to stop a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of ukraine that s not happening secretary of state antony blinken told national public radio that ending russia s economic isolation would require putin to stop his war and agree not to attack ukraine again daleep singh we re not cowboys and cowgirls pressing buttons to destroy an economy you know we ve spent hundreds of years in this country shaping military doctrine we ve spent a small fraction of that time shaping the doctrine of economic statecraft but we have one it s our objective to demonstrate resolve that sanctions should have the power to impose overwhelming costs on your target sharyn alfonsi there are people who think the sanctions are only about regime change that that s the ultimate goal daleep singh that s up to the people of russia our our cause our purpose is to make sure that putin s actions are remembered as a strategic failure that s what s within our control full stop produced by guy campanile associate producer clare hymes broadcast associate elizabeth germino edited by peter m berman
washington just days before russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 president joe biden quietly dispatched a team to european union headquarters in belgium these were not spy chiefs or generals but experts in reading fine print and tracking the flow of money computer chips and other goods around the world their mandate inflict maximum pain on russian president vladimir putin making it harder if not impossible for him to fund a prolonged war in ukraine and denying him access to technologies at the core of modern warfare there were intense meetings in february in brussels paris london and berlin often running six hours at a time as the allies tried to craft the details of a historic economic blockade according to biden administration officials some of the exports the u s wanted to ban were met with reluctance by the europeans who would essentially be telling their own companies to forgo several billion dollars in annual revenues from russia russia invades ukraine live updates when there was a deadlock u s negotiators would put commerce secretary gina raimondo on the phone you can say no now but when the body bags are coming out of ukraine you re not going to want to be a holdout raimondo said she told allied counterparts do the right thing everyone signed on and before the invasion raimondo said what ultimately drove the agreement and the fast timeline was the threat of putin s imminent attack on ukraine we all got religion fast that it was time to band together and stick together she said if you cause enough pain isolate putin it will bring this war to an end chinese official calls sanctions on russia increasingly outrageous the wealthiest nations in the world outside of china are directly confronting putin on their preferred terms they have imposed sanctions in which their strengths intersect with russia s vulnerabilities russia is reliant on the u s the eu japan south korea and taiwan for cutting edge technologies and investment so the allies decided to cut moscow off it s a strategic play designed to trap putin in a downward spiral as foreign investors pull out their money in response to the atrocities it s also a remarkable show of unity that could be tested in the coming weeks by the allies own dependence on fossil fuels a group of economists estimated thursday that eu countries have transferred more than 13 3 billion euros 14 7 billion to russia for oil natural gas and coal since the war began essentially funding putin s war machine while the allied talks in the lead up to the war were critical the eu was not just waiting around for u s direction to act bloc members had been consulting for months russia ukraine war is a wake up call for us energy policy one eu diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks outlined in an interview as far back as january potential penalties that included the export ban noting that the eu had held together its coalition on enforcing sanctions since russia s 2014 occupation of parts of the donbas region in ukraine but this time the u s and eu responded to russia s aggression with a novel set of policies to cripple putin s ability to fight by denying it access to the semiconductors computers telecommunications equipment lasers and sensors integral to war material this is a supply chain squeeze that will force russia to raid existing airplanes tanks and other gear for spare parts essentially eroding its military and economic capacity the same u s and eu officials dealing with their own supply chain challenges after the pandemic found a way to amplify the problem for russia through trade regulations in a sign of early success u s officials point to the closing of lada auto plants in russia and the more than 300 companies that have stopped doing business with russia the companies are not just starbucks but chipmakers such as germany s infineon that said it stopped all direct and indirect deliveries to russia as well as technical support within days of the invasion the allies blocked the foreign assets of russia s central bank two senior biden administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy planning and spoke on condition of anonymity said this option was not initially presented to allies out of concern that russia could move its money ahead of time they waited to present the asset freeze until the invasion started and the images of bombings and death compelled the europeans to almost immediately agree the freeze rendered half of the more than 600 billion in putin s war chest unusable while the russian stock market has been closed and the value of the ruble has plunged the sanctions are designed so that the financial effects tightens over time as long as ukraine is able to hold out with military aid against severe casualties the sanctions will do more to exhaust putin eu commission vice president valdis dombrovskis on thursday praised the very good coordination among nations and said the sanctions are biting hard russia s financial markets are close to collapse he also noted that the sanctions create costs for the allies though the price is much less than the consequences of the war spreading the key to saving ukraine and defeating putin may lie in pennsylvania yet with every new round of sanctions the unity of the 27 eu members is tested ever more if imposing a ban on russian oil and gas comes up germany and italy both heavily dependent on russian energy will be in a tough spot to contain the drive of several eastern member nations like poland and the baltic states that want to hit putin as hard as possible as soon as possible the u s is less dependent on russian oil and natural gas making it easier for biden to ban those imports earlier this month there is also the risk that the sanctions will fail to stop putin or that russia can still find ways to bring goods into its economy trade data analyzed by importgenius show that china supplanted germany in 2021 as the leading source of exports to russia and u s officials say that russia has solicited help from the chinese government on twitter olivier blanchard former chief economist at the international monetary fund and now a fellow at the peterson institute of international economics equated the sanctions to the bombing of german factories during world war ii those bombings disrupted the german war machine in ways that made it impossible to prolong an extended fight and economists had a role in choosing the targets for all that has been done question remain about whether it is enough get fox business on the go by clicking here blanchard recommends expanding the export controls from defense related production to anything which disorganizes production in the russian economy if russian made refrigerators need a gasket made in the eu restricting access to that gasket makes it harder for the russian economy to function he said tania babina a finance professor at columbia university who was born in ukraine said that sanctions tend not to stop dictators and she warned that putin might ultimately become even more entrenched unless the u s and eu take more aggressive action she said europeans need to add sanctions that ban the use of russian oil and natural gas he is going to throw everything to win will send his grandma to fight if needed babina said he cannot lose ukraine that is why it is so paramount to cut off russia s energy export revenues click here to read more on fox business but babina noted that there is another far more chilling cost to the allied strategy of sanctions ukrainian lives how many people do we let die before putin runs out of assets she asked

summary brazil s current tightening cycle is the most extensive since 2000 is it already hurting the country s growth outlook some ems stayed on hold but can inflation surprises in thailand challenge the central bank s wait and see approach u s fed rate hikes global rate hikes continue to pile up in developed markets dm the u s federal reserve fed initiated its tightening cycle yesterday with a 25bps move and signaled a 25bps hike at every meeting in 2022 the bank of england raised its policy rate to 0 75 this morning to deal with the energy shock in emerging markets em brazil continued to tighten at a brisk pace delivering the expected 100bps rate hike yesterday as inflation pressures show few signs of abating brazil rate hikes and growth the current tightening cycle in brazil is already the most extensive since 2000 see chart below and the local swap curve prices in at least 160bps of additional hikes in may and june brazil s very high real policy rates based on expected

expected sequential contraction of brazil s economic activity in january is a stark reminder that policies even the good ones have side effects in this case the side effect is the deteriorating near term growth outlook the consensus currently expects brazil to expand by mere 0 5 in real terms in 2022 and the risks are clearly to the downside some survey participants expect recession em interest rate outlook we often say that em is not a monolith and some central banks stayed on the sidelines this week indonesia chose not to match the fed s hike arguing that fundamental price pressures are still under control the hungarian central bank is also in waiting mode evaluating the situation after aggressive frontloading in the previous months turkey thankfully also stayed on hold no more rate cuts but its policy setup remains extremely convoluted and the central bank now argues that price pressures will subside only when the conflict between russia and ukraine is over finally we keep a close eye on central banks in russia and thailand in russia the expectation is for a pause after the key rate was raised to 20 in thailand core inflation is nearly five standard deviations higher than

houston march 20 2022 prnewswire the windacre partnership llc windacre today stated that it fully supports the decision by the board of directors board of nielsen holdings plc nyse nlsn nielsen or the company to reject the 25 40 per share acquisition proposal received by the company as a long term nielsen shareholder windacre believes that the acquisition offer significantly undervalues the company specifically the offer price does not fairly value nielsen s unique and strategic position as critical measurement infrastructure supporting the 100 billion u s video advertising ecosystem does not reflect the company s progress on executing the nielsen one roadmap is unattractive relative to the valuation of information services peers that similarly have proprietary and essential data assets and mid single digit revenue growth in line with nielsen s medium term outlook and is significantly below nielsen s intrinsic value per share which windacre assesses at well in excess of 40 per share accordingly windacre informed the board that it would not support the proposed transaction that it intended to accumulate the shares required to block the acquisition and that it was confident in its ability to do so under uk law a scheme of arrangement requires the approval of the holders of at least 75 in value of the shares voting on the transaction with members of the acquiring consortium not eligible to vote their shares windacre currently owns 9 6 of nielsen s ordinary shares and has economic exposure equivalent to another 14 4 of the company s shares through cash settled swaps snehal amin managing partner of windacre said nielsen is and we believe will continue to be the currency for the video advertising ecosystem advertisers need the truth about who is watching their advertising across all screens and all platforms and only nielsen one has the promise to deliver that a series of unaudited unvalidated and often self serving measurement metrics that provide a glimpse of the audience only on certain screens or limited platforms simply won t suffice advertisers know that and in the end they are the ones who decide what currency to use we are confident it will be nielsen one amin continued we do not believe the offer comes close to recognizing nielsen s intrinsic value and we were not going to be forced out of our holding at this price we intended to block the transaction so that we could realize in time the intrinsic value of our investment we believe strongly that the board made the right decision in the face of an inadequate offer saving the company from

more ask a fund manager the motley fool chats with fund managers so that you can get an insight into how the professionals think in this edition monash investors portfolio manager sebastian correia reveals the asx share he d hold for years and the one he wished he had for years the asx share for a comfortable night s sleep the motley fool if the market closed tomorrow for four years which stock would you want to hold sebastian correia that question we ve been asked that in a variety of different ways before it s often the kiss of death for stocks a lot can change in four years right back in 2018 i don t think many of us would ve predicted we d have a global pandemic or even before it ended the biggest conflict in europe since world war ii but look all exogenous risks aside i d be happy to hold johns lyng group ltd asx jlg for four years because of all the points i mentioned above it ticks all the resilience points that i just mentioned around the pricing power cash flow generation and it s got strong tailwinds behind it it s got an untapped north american market which is about 100 billion at a much higher margin climate change influenced weather patterns are provided as a tailwind i don t like to factor that in my forecast but that s also just something to have on the back burner and because of inflation if they can pass on those pricing costs they can maintain their margins and therefore be even more strongly positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that come up in the market to acquire it s got a couple of adjacencies strata management for example i m very sceptical about synergies when management mentions them but there s a lot of plausible synergies i think have the potential to be exploited if they so choose so there s a lot there that you could get excited about the one thing about john lyng is that the market realises it s a high quality stock and therefore it could trade at a higher valuation than i would like with ofx group ltd asx ofx it s so easy to get that upside right with jlg they have to execute against the expectations that they ve set but they ve been able to do so for so long in the past having spoken to management several times i m quite confident that they can do that subject to some other crazy thing that would happen in the markets like another war or something mf the share price has cooled off a little bit this year sc yes exactly the ceo scott didier bought another million dollars worth of stock on market i think two weeks ago so he obviously sees that it s been oversold and i would tend to agree and the last thing i d mention on that one is just that four years based on current information is a long time when i d spoken earlier around monash when they set it up they had developed or observed a broad suite of recurring business situations and patterns of behaviour this is one of them that informs our idea generation that is john lyng consistently exceeded consensus earnings to expectations over the years for example in december 2019 the analyst consensus revenue forecast for financial year 2022 was about 465 million by the next year so by december 2020 this forecast for that same year had grown by 23 to 570 then three years on by december 2021 that same year fy 2022 s revenue forecast had grown by 70 so each year the analysts are forced to increase their earnings or the revenue expectations in this case for the stock because they just happened to hit their milestones so successfully looking back mf is there a move that you regret from the past for example a missed opportunity or buying a stock at the wrong timing or price sc yeah i ve got plenty it s a part of being a fund manager balancing conviction in a position while the price stands against you is quite hard so at monash we ve developed almost like a pre mortem selling discipline that i m exceptionally strict on following so if the facts of the investment thesis change even for a stock that i absolutely love i don t really have too much difficulty in selling to protect our investors capital so i don t really have too many regrets in that regard but i have quite a few opportunities that we knew about but failed to buy in at the time and ended up being multibaggers the one that came to mind when i thought about your question was an extremely valuable lesson to me it happened back in october 2019 and it involved a telecommunications company called opticomm opticomm before it got taken over by uniti group ltd asx uwl constructed and maintained an alternative network to the nbn arguably superior the beauty of the business was that the residential developers would pay opticomm to come in and build and integrate its network into the development project after the completion of the project and the residents moved in opticomm would then earn recurring revenue by providing the internet connectivity through an approved list of retail service providers that they managed so it was a phenomenal business model in essence it was getting paid to build an asset that they controlled and from which it received recurring revenue when someone else pays for your cap ex and you get to cop all revenue on the property mf daylight robbery sc yeah exactly so i was quite convinced at that time that it was going to be a success and i did the dcf valuation modelling and did all the due diligence and it was well above our investment hurdle of 60 upside but we didn t buy because we had some concerns around a large chunk of stock that was going to come out of escrow in the next few weeks or something like that and that was when it was about 3 and in less than a year it more than doubled before being acquired by uniti wireless group at a premium luckily i can say i learned from that mistake because i did a lot of due diligence into uniti when they acquired that and we took a stake in uniti but oh how i wish i could have been in there from the beginning

four years have passed since the donald trump administration announced it would impose tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese exports on march 22 2018 together with various further investment restrictions on china yet statistics issued by both sides now reveal that china u s trade instead of cooling down owing to the trade war is heating up according to the u s department of commerce in 2021 bilateral trade jumped by 17 6 percent year on year as data from china s national bureau of statistics show it increased by 20 2 percent leading sino american trade turnover to rank first among u s trading partners ironically the countries trade growth well exceeds the 12 3 percent rate in 2017 four years of trade war prove that trying to contain china has been a faulty stroke on the part of the u s the china u s dispute touches on trade science and technology diplomacy geopolitics and international rules the joe biden administration inherited all hostile policies toward china from its predecessor including extra tariffs on chinese exports and has taken it one step further by linking trade with human rights values and ideologies this arguably marks an unspoken bipartisan consensus on curbing china s development china u s trade statistics for 2021 demonstrate that the u s government s political interference did little to curb china s growth except for raising obstacles to the bilateral trade and crippling transnational business in china the latter however remains the world s most vibrant major economy whereas the u s seemingly has shot itself in the foot the country s record high inflation is to large extent the result of higher tariffs on chinese goods given these additional charges will eventually pass on to u s consumers in the form of valued goods according to the u s china business council the trade war knocked 108 billion off u s gdp from 2018 to 2019 and cost 245 000 jobs at present the u s still imposes an average tariff of 19 3 percent on 66 4 percent of chinese exports whereas china levies a tariff of 20 7 percent on 58 3 percent of american exports to china higher than the average tariff of 3 1 percent before the trade war and also higher than the average tariffs china imposes on goods from other countries these rates might result in the loss of another 732 000 jobs in the u s this year truth be told many big u s corporations oppose the trade conflict a number of american businesses have already demanded the removal of extra tariffs by submitting written statements to the u s department of commerce and office of the u s trade representative hoping to maintain normal economic and trade ties with china a report released by the american chamber of commerce in china on march 8 points out that surveyed u s companies operating in china are optimistic about the chinese market and some 66 percent intend to increase their investments in the country 83 percent of which do not plan to move their manufacturing or purchasing business out of china yet their voices are unfortunately too often muted by american politicians and populists five decades of interaction have deeply intertwined chinese and american interests despite the trade dispute in the four years their trade exchanges remain the most important part of bilateral relations outweighing political and personal exchanges which have dropped to historical low due to u s china containment policies and the covid 19 outbreak even frequent shipments shuttling between the two countries keep the baltic dry index a proxy for dry bulk shipping stocks as well as a general shipping market bellwether high ever closer trade relations between china and the u s reveal that the conflict proves a drag on china u s cooperation the time has come for the u s to forgo its consistently backfiring china containment policy china today boasts the world s largest middle income population 400 million as well as the best opportunities and biggest market potential of its 1 4 billion population to tap into neither country stands to benefit from the trade war what they really need is a suitable free trade agreement

dubai united arab emirates ap yemen s houthi rebels unleashed one of their most intense barrages of drone and missile strikes on saudi arabia s critical energy facilities on sunday sparking a fire at one site and temporarily cutting oil production at another the salvo marked a serious escalation of rebel attacks on the kingdom as the war in yemen rages into its eighth year and peace talks stall the attacks did not cause casualties the saudi led military coalition fighting in yemen said but struck sites belonging to one of the world s most important energy companies and damaged civilian vehicles and homes the coalition also said it destroyed a remotely piloted boat packed with explosives dispatched by the houthis in the busy southern red sea hours after oil giant aramco s ceo amin h nasser told reporters the attacks had no impact on oil supplies the saudi energy ministry acknowledged that a drone strike targeting the yanbu aramco sinopec refining company caused a temporary reduction in the refinery s production the disruption as oil prices spike in an already tight energy market will be compensated for from the inventory the ministry said without elaborating another aerial attack later in the day struck a fuel tank at an aramco distribution station in the port city of jiddah and ignited a fire later at night the roar and thump of missile interceptors rattled the port city as the saudi military coalition said it destroyed more projectiles over jiddah residents posted footage on social media showing streaks of light from missile defenses pierce the dark sky the relentless wave of strikes revealed the expanding reach and precision of the rebels and the persistent gaps in the kingdom s air defenses a sophisticated strike in 2019 on aramco oil facilities knocked out half the kingdom s oil production and threatened to ignite a regional crisis an attack that the u s and riyadh later alleged came from iran the attacks on sunday came as saudi arabia s state backed aramco the world s largest oil company announced its profits surged 124 in 2021 to 110 billion a jump fueled by renewed anxieties about global supply shortages and soaring oil prices aramco also known as the saudi arabian oil co released its annual earnings after weeks of intense volatility in energy markets triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine the international oil benchmark brent crude spiked over 107 on sunday after nearly hitting a peak of 140 earlier this month saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have so far resisted western appeals to increase oil production to offset the loss of russian oil as gasoline prices skyrocket yehia sarie a spokesman for yemen s iran backed houthis said the rebels had launched a wide and large military operation in retaliation for the saudi led aggression and blockade that has turned much of yemen into a wasteland the escalation followed a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend in oman s capital of muscat the u n special envoy for yemen hans grundberg met with the chief houthi negotiator and omani officials to discuss a possible truce during the holy month of ramadan in early april the u n mission said the white house condemned the attacks blaming iran for supplying the houthis with missile and drone parts as well as training and expertise it is time to bring this war to a close but that can only happen if the houthis agree to cooperate with the united nations said u s national security advisor jake sullivan the united states stands fully behind those efforts the saudi led military coalition reported aerial strikes on a range of facilities an aramco liquified gas plant in the red sea port of yanbu an oil storage plant in jiddah a desalination facility in al shaqeeq on the red sea coast and an aramco oil facility in the southern border town of jizan among others the extent of damage on saudi infrastructure remained unclear and the ministry said only the yanbu refinery saw a temporary drop in output a joint venture between aramco and china the 10 billion yanbu aramco sinopec refining company on the red sea pumps 400 000 barrels of oil a day the saudi press agency shared photos of firetrucks dousing leaping flames with water and a trail of rubble wrought by shrapnel that crashed through ceilings and pocked apartment walls other images showed wrecked cars and giant craters in the ground the barrage comes days after the saudi based gulf cooperation council invited yemen s warring sides for peace talks in riyadh an offer dismissed out of hand by the houthis who demanded that negotiations take place in a neutral country negotiations have floundered since the houthis have tried to capture oil rich marib one of the last remaining strongholds of the saudi backed yemeni government in the country s north yemen s brutal war erupted in 2014 after the iran backed houthis seized the country s capital sanaa saudi arabia and its allies launched a devastating air campaign to dislodge the houthis and restore the internationally recognized government but years later the war has settled into a bloody stalemate and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world coalition airstrikes have struck civilian targets in yemen like hospitals telecommunications centers and wedding parties drawing widespread international criticism repeated houthi cross border attacks have rattled world energy markets and raised the risk of disruptions to output at aramco sites as part of its 2021 report aramco said it stuck to its promise of paying quarterly dividends of 18 75 billion 75 billion last year due to commitments the company made to shareholders in the run up to its initial public offering nearly all of the dividend money goes to the saudi government despite saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman s increasing efforts to diversify the saudi economy away from oil the kingdom remains heavily dependent on oil exports to fuel government spending riding on its 2021 income surge aramco said it expects to raise its capital expenditure to between 40 and 50 billion this year to meet growing energy demand a sizable increase from last year s spending of 31 9 billion aramco

introduction what is vast ai vast ai is a cloud computing matchmaking and aggregation service focused on lowering the price of compute intensive workloads our software allows anyone to easily become a host by renting out their hardware our web search interface allows users to quickly find the best deals for compute according to their specific requirements what is the secure cloud only trusted datacenters filter vast ai partners with vetted datacenter providers all over the globe these partners have their equipment in certified locations that are current with iso 27001 and or tier 3 4 standards vast ai has verified that this equipment is in these facilities and that their certifications are up to date for sensitive or production workloads we recommend checking the secure cloud filter look for the blue datacenter label how does vast ai work in a nutshell hosts download and run our management software list their machines configure prices and set any default jobs clients then find suitable machines using our flexible search interface rent their desired machines and finally run commands or start ssh sessions with a few clicks what are vast s advantages vast ai provides a simple interface to rent powerful machines at the best possible prices reducing gpu cloud computing costs by 3x to 5x consumer computers and consumer gpus in particular are considerably more cost effective than equivalent enterprise hardware we are helping the millions of underutilized consumer gpus around the world enter the cloud computing market for the first time what operating systems are provided windows vast currently provides linux docker instances mostly ubuntu based no windows what interface is provided currently vast has ssh access for ssh instances jupyter instances with jupyter gui or a command only instance mode we do not provide remote desktop dlperf what is dlperf dlperf deep learning performance is our own scoring function it is an approximate estimate of performance for typical deep learning tasks currently dlperf predicts performance well in terms of iters second for a few common tasks such as training resnet50 cnns for example on these tasks a v100 instance with a dlperf score of 21 is roughly 2x faster than a 1080ti with a dlperf of 10 it turns out that many tasks have similar performance characteristics but naturally if your task is very unusual in its compute requirements the dlperf score may not be very predictive a single score can never be accurate for predicting performance across a wide variety of tasks the best we can do is approximate performance on many tasks with a weighted combination although far from perfect dlperf is more useful for predicting performance than tflops for most tasks rental types we currently offer two rental types on demand high priority and interruptible low priority on demand instances have a fixed price set by the host and run for as long as the client wants interruptible instances use a bidding system clients set a bid price for their instance the current highest bid is the instance that runs the others are paused are vast ai interruptible instances the same as aws spot or gce interruptible they are similar but have a few key differences aws spot instances and gce interruptible instances both can be interrupted by on demand instances but they do not use a direct bidding system in addition gce interruptible instances can only run for 24 hours vast ai interruptible instances use a direct bidding system but are otherwise not limited what happens when my interruptible instance loses the bid if another user places a higher bid or creates an on demand rental for the same resources then your instance will be stopped stopping an instance kills the running processes so when you are using interruptible instances it s important to save your work to disk also we highly recommend having your script periodically save your outputs to cloud storage as well because once your instance is interrupted it could be a long wait until it resumes instances how can i restart my programs once the instance restarts if you use the custom command option then your command will run automatically when the instance starts up however if you are using an ssh instance there is no default startup command you can put startup commands in root onstart sh this startup script will be found and run automatically on container startup i see my instance has a lifetime what does that mean every instance offer on the create page has a max duration when you accept an offer and create an instance this max duration becomes the instance lifetime and begins ticking down when the lifetime expires the instance is automatically stopped the host can extend the contract which will add more lifetime to your instance or they may not it s up to them assume your instance will be lost once the lifetime expires copy out any important data before then how can i set environment variables use the e docker syntax in the docker create run options for example to set the env variables tzc to utc and taskid to test 1 e tz utc e taskid test any environment variables you set will be visible only to your onstart script or your entrypoint for entrypoint launch mode when using the ssh or jupyter launch modes your env variables will not be visible inside your ssh tmux jupyter session by default to make custom environment variables visible to the shell you need to export them to etc environment add something like the following to the end of your onstart to export any env variables containing an underscore _ 1 env grep _ etc environment or to export all env variables 1 env etc environment how can i get the instance id from within the container the environment variable vast_containerlabel is defined in the container ex 1 2 root c 38250 echo vast_containerlabel c 38250 how can i stop the instance from within the instance a special instance api key should already be installed in your container you can just install the vastai cli and use the stop command 1 root c 38250 pip install vastai then test it by starting the instance which is a no op as the instance is already running 1 vastai start instance container_id if that works then you can stop the instance as well 1 vastai stop instance container_id if container_id is not defined check your environment variables using the env command if you are missing the predefined env variables from an ssh session you may need to add a command to export them to etc environment see above if you don t have the instance api key for whatever reason you can also generate it first run the following from inside the instance to create a special per instance api key and save it in the appropriate location 1 cat ssh authorized_keys md5sum awk print 1 ssh_key_hv echo n vast_containerlabel md5sum awk print 1 instance_id_hv head c 1 q ssh_key_hv instance_id_hv vast_api_key then install the cli with pip or download latest from github 1 apt get install y wget wget o vast chmod x vast how can i launch another docker container from within the instance vast currently does not currently support docker within docker due to security constraints you will need to launch each docker container on a separate instance networking how can i open custom ports add p arguments in the docker create run options box in the template configuration or image config editor pop up menu to open ports 8081 and 8082 use something like this 1 p 8081 8081 p 8082 8082 this will result in additional arguments to docker create run to expose those internal ports which will be mapped to random external ports any ports exposed in these docker options are in addition to ports exposed through expose commands in the docker image and the ports 22 or 8080 which may be opened automatically for ssh or jupyter after the instance has loaded you can find the corresponding external public ip port by opening the ip port info pop up button on top of the instance and then looking for something like 1 65 130 162 74 33526 8081 tcp in this case the public ip port 65 130 162 74 33526 can be used to access anything you run on port 8081 inside the instance as a simple test case you can run a simple minimal web browser inside the instance with the following command 1 python m 8081 which you would then access in this example by loading 65 130 162 74 33526 in your web browser how can i open an identity port map like 32001 32001 where external internal are the same just use an out of range port above 70000 1 p 70000 70000 p 70001 70001 jupyter i m getting very slow transfer speeds using the jupyter download upload you probably created a proxy instance which is the default the proxy instance is still useful for some use cases as you can get full speed downloading files with wget git external ftp cloud storage etc however the built in upload download buttons can be very slow especially when the proxy servers are overloaded so if you want full speed transfers using the jupyter upload download gui you need to create a direct instance on the create page select edit image config open your image template usually pytorch then select the direct mode under jupyter then create a new instance you will need to import a certificate see below what is this https website unsecure warning the jupyter direct https option is faster than the proxy option but it requires installing a new certificate in your browser download the certificate file then go into your browser certificate settings and add the new certificate in google chrome you click the little 3 dot menu in the top right corner then settings in the drop down menu then privacy and security on the left then security in the middle then scroll down to the advanced section and click on manage certificates then the authorities tab and finally the import button and select the certificate file you just downloaded jvastai_root cer i m deleting files in juypter but it s not freeing disk space how do i truly delete by design default the delete button in jupyter does not actually delete files it just moves them to the trash folder which is located at 1 local share trash so you can delete the trash folder in a terminal using rm r 1 rm r local share trash how do i run colab notebooks just select the recommended pytorch image which has the jupyter launch mode pre enabled select a gpu and start the instance once it loads click on the jupyter button on the bottom right of the instance card to start jupyter then download the colab notebook as a ipynb file and upload it to the instance in jupyter then just click on that to run the notebook depending on the notebook you may need to install additional dependencies with apt get or pip as of now we don t have a recommended colab emulating docker image i m getting some missing library or package error depending on the notebook you may have to install additional dependencies you can do this by opening a terminal in jupyter and then using regular apt get install package or pip install package how can i more easily download many files jupyter labs supports downloading multiple files by shift click to select multiple and then right click download option but jupyter notebook only supports downloading individual files and neither supports downloading folders directories you can use zip to more quickly download directories and large numbers of files first open a terminal and then in the terminal you can install zip and use that to zip up many files into a single package 1 apt get install y zip and then to zip all of the files in the images_out timetodisco only directory 1 zip all_images zip images_out timetodisco or zip all of the files in images_out including sub directories 1 zip r all_images zip images_out jupyter is ok but can i run colab directly with a vast instance yes please follow our colab guide ssh how do i connect to an ssh instance on linux mac on ubuntu or mac first you need to generate an rsa ssh public private keypair using the command 1 ssh keygen t rsa next you may need to force the daemon to load the new private key and confirm it s loaded 1 ssh add ssh add l then get the contents of the public key with 1 cat ssh id_rsa pub copy the entire output to your clipboard then paste that into the change ssh key text box under console account the key text includes the opening ssh rsa part and the ending user something part if you don t copy the entire thing it won t work example ssh key text 1 ssh rsa aaaab3nzac1yc2eaaaadaqabaazbaqddxwwxwn5lz7ubkmrxm57chhvzonzult5fhi7j8zfxcjhfr96w ccbobo2rtbbttrdlnjjisklgbcc3 jgyzhpunmfrvij7meqdehghfvuuv ubkb7rjbyyfcb4bcsyngguzkmnnongea3aqtbszt47bnugqkszs9bfacapftr9wo0b8p4iyil gfoy5kusvwkqrbcwrg53 t2rak 02mwnhxybktjau1q9qtwcyo68jtdd0sa 4apsu csjmbjs3fcddral3bcpikwrbckq n63ol4xdv3zqrebuc98cjph04gnc41w02lmdqfl2xg5u rv8 jm7cawkiiz3dbkv bob velocity you can use a few ssh keys by pasting in each on a new line how do i connect to an ssh instance from windows you can use windows subsystem for linux and then follow the ssh instructions for linux mac but some windows users prefer a gui tool so here is a quick guide to connecting to an ssh instance from windows using putty make sure you save the key in ssh rsa 2 format what is this tmux thing how do i create multiple bash terminals on my ssh instance we connect you to a tmux session by default for reliability you can create a new bash terminal window with ctrl b c press ctrl and b followed by c and switch with ctrl b n but google tmux cheat sheet or tmux guide for more info ok but how can i disable tmux we don t recommend this generally as ssh especially the proxy ssh connection can be unstable but if you know what you are doing and need raw ssh you can add the following to your onstart 1 touch no_auto_tmux security how do you protect my data from other clients clients are isolated to unprivileged docker containers and only have access to their own data how do you protect my data from providers there are many providers on vast ai ranging from tier 4 datacenters with extensive physical and operational security down to individual hobbyists renting out a few machines in their home our vetted datacenter partners can provide data security similar to other large cloud providers if data security is important for your use case you may want to rent only from our datacenter partners even though our smaller community providers generally do not have datacenter level physical or operational security they have little to gain and much to lose from stealing customer data it can take months for providers to accumulate trust and verified status on vast these verified providers are thus incentivized to maintain their reputational standing just like larger cloud providers hosts generally have many different clients and there are significant costs to identifying saving copying and exploiting any interesting datasets let alone any particular client s data you can also roughly see the relative age of a provider by their id billing how does billing work once you enter a credit card and an email address and both are verified you will receive a small amount of free test credit then you can increase your credit balance using one time payments with the add credit button whenever your credit balance hits zero or below your instances will be stopped automatically but not destroyed you are still charged storage costs for stopped instances so it is important to destroy instances when you are done using them your credit card will be automatically charged periodically to pay off any outstanding negative balance can you bill my card automatically so i don t have to add credit in advance you can set a balance threshold to configure auto billing which will attempt to maintain your balance above the threshold we recommend setting a threshold around your daily or weekly spend and then setting an balance email notification threshold around 75 of that value so that you get notified if the auto billing fails but long before your balance depletes to zero there is also an optional debit mode feature which can be enabled by request for older accounts when debit mode is enabled your account balance is allowed to go negative without immediately stopping your instances i didn t enable debit mode what are these automatic charges to my card your card is charged automatically regardless of whether or not you have debit mode enabled instances are never free even stopped instances have storage charges make sure you delete instances when you are done with them otherwise your card will continue to be periodically charged indefinitely how does pricing work there are separate prices and charges for active rental gpu costs storage costs bandwidth costs you are charged the base active rental cost for every second your instance is in the active connected state you are charged the storage cost which depends on the size of your storage allocation for every second your instance exists and is online regardless of what state it is in active inactive loading etc stopping an instance does not avoid storage costs you are charged bandwidth prices for every byte sent or received to or from the instance regardless of what state it is in the prices for base rental storage and bandwidth vary considerably from machine to machine so make sure to check them you are not charged active rental or storage costs for instances that are currently offline what is the billing frequency balances are updated about once every few seconds why should i trust vast ai with my credit card info you don t need to vast ai does not see store or process your credit card numbers they are passed directly to stripe which you can verify in the javascript do you support paypal what about cryptocurrency we currently support major credit cards through stripe and crypto payments through coinbase and crypto com data movement how do i upload download to from my instance you can use the cli copy command to copy from to directories on a remote instance and your local machine or to copy data between two remote instances you can use the copy buttons in the gui to copy data between two remote instances the copy command uses rsync and is generally fast and efficient subject to single link upload download constraints example 1 vast copy workspace 4330147 workspace currently one endpoint of the copy must involve a vast instance with open ports for a remote local copy or local remote copy the remote instance must be on a machine with open ports although the instance itself does not need open ports and the remote instance can be stopped inactive for instances on machines without open ports copy to from local is not available but you can still copy to a 2nd vast instance with open ports for a remote remote copy copy between 2 instances the src can be stopped and does not need open ports but the dst must be a running instance with open ports it is not sufficient that the instance is on a machine with open ports the instance itself must have been created with open port mappings if the instance is created with the direct connect option for jupyter or ssh launch modes the instance will have at least one open port otherwise for proxy or entrypoint instance types you can get open ports using the p option to reserve a port in the instance configuration under run options and you must also then pick a machine with open ports if your data is already stored in the cloud s3 gdrive etc then you should naturally use the appropriate linux cli or commands to download and upload data directly this generally will be one the fastest methods for moving large quantities of data as it can fully saturate a large number of download links if you are using multiple instances with significant data movement requirements you will want to use high bandwidth cloud storage and avoid any single machine bottlenecks if you launched a jupyter notebook instance you can use its upload feature but this has a file size limit and can be slow you can also use standard linux tools like scp ftp rclone or rsync to move data for moving code and smaller files scp is fast enough and convenient however be warned that the default ssh connection uses a proxy and can be slow for large transfers how do i upload download to from my instance using scp if you launched an ssh instance you can copy files using scp the default ssh connection uses a proxy and thus can be slow in terms of latency and bandwidth thus we recommend only using scp over the default ssh connection for smaller transfers less than 1 gb for larger inbound transfers a direct connection is recommended downloading from a cloud data store using wget or curl can have much higher performance the relevant scp command syntax is 1 scp p port local_file root ipaddr remotedir the port and ipaddr fields must match those from the ssh command the connect button on the instance will give you these fields in the form 1 ssh p port root ipaddr l 8080 localhost 8080 for example if connect gives you this 1 ssh p 7417 root 52 204 230 7 l 8080 localhost 8080 you could use scp to upload a local file called myfile tar gz to a remote folder called mydir like so 1 scp p 7417 myfile tar gz root i m getting a connectionreseterror downloading files this seems to be due to bugs in the urllib3 and or requests libraries used by many python packages we recommend using wget to download large files it is quite robust and recovers from errors gracefully how can i download a kaggle dataset using wget first you need to get the raw link using the chrome browser on the kaggle website go to the relevant dataset or competition page and start downloading the file you want then cancel the download and press ctrl j to bring up the chrome downloads page at the top is the most recent download with a name and a link under it right click on the url link and use copy link address then you can use wget with that url as follows 1 wget url no check certificate o filename notice the url needs to be wrapped in single quotes examples disco diffusion disco diffusion is powerful free and open source ai image generator which is easy to use on vast ai with the right settings and powerful gpus it can generate artist quality high res images for a wide variety of subjects there are numerous options for running disco diffusion on vast but two good options are 1 using the pytorch docker image and a slightly modified notebook or 2 using a custom docker image fork made specifically to run dd in docker such as jinaai discoart the latter custom docker image can spin up somewhat faster and has a number of advanced features beyond the original notebook but currently requries cuda 11 6 which limits machine options the disco diffusion notebooks were created for colab but they will run in docker on vast using the common pytorch image with some slight modifications to install a few required libs you can use one of our slightly modified dd notebooks 5 6 5 4 5 2 to get started quickly here is a quick video tutorial you ll want to create a jupyter instance with the pytorch image and you ll probably want about 30 gb of disk to store the various models and to save all the beautiful high res images you will be generating this is important make sure to choose a storage allocation before creating the instance as you currently can not resize the instance disk allocation and running out of space can be catastrophic download the notebook 5 6 5 4 5 2 as a ipynb file then upload it to your jupyter instance created from the pytorch pytorch image click on the notebook to run it then just run fast forward the notebook or step through each cell it can take 15 minutes or so to download the models depending on instance internet speed the cell 4 diffuse near the end shows the in progress output image by default it only updates every 50 steps but you can change this via the display_rate variable in that cell setting it to 1 shows the result of each iteration instead of the pytorch image you can use the custom jinaai discoart docker image for this image we recommend adding the environment variable option e jupyter_dir discoart or jupyter_dir to your docker run options directly under the image tag this will instruct jupyter to start in a more sensible directory rather than app which is basically empty if you set this env variable you ll see the discoart ipynb notebook file is already there in the discoart folder no need to upload if you are using jupyter labs you can select multiple files using the shift key and then download all of them one after another jupyter notebook only supports downloading individual files and neither labs nor notebook support downloading folders to more conveniently download folders or a number of files you can use the command line zip tool first open a new terminal and then in the terminal run the following apt get install y zip and then to zip all of the files in the default images_out timetodisco directory zip all_images zip images_out timetodisco note do no use spaces in your folder names they cause headaches on linux use the _ underscore instead for discussion help advice running dd on vast find us on our discord and make sure to check out the main dd discord stable diffusion stable diffusion is a newer image diffusion generator which is generally much faster that disco diffusion and requires less ram it is easy to use on vast ai with the automatic111 web ui simply select the stable diffusion recommended template to do so navigate to the create page click the edit image config button and then the recommended tab from there the stable diffusion template is visible once selected it will then load the correct image and port settings for the web ui to load select a 1x gpu instance once the instance starts up simply click the open button to open the web ui interface nvidia glx desktop nvidia glx desktop is a docker image which provides a virtual desktop with gpu acceleration on some but not all machines it requires specifying an external webrtc turn server to run this image on vast just use the recommended docker image navigate to the create page click the edit image config button and then the recommended tab select the glx template the default username is user and the default password is mypasswd you can change these with e env variables see the linked page for details nvidia glx requires a fast internet connection on both the host and local machines make sure to use a inet up and inet down filter set appropriately to 300mbps open the readme file on the glx template for more information bittensor bittensor is a decentralized blockchain based machine learning network the latest recommended template uses bittensor version 3 70 finney and installs cubit on start vast has a wide variety of affordable gpus which are ideal for running the bittensor gpu miner the setup is mostly straightforward bittensor expects an open port which is identity mapped external and internal are the same which is possible on vast using out of range virtual ports that is handled in the recommended template using p to setup the virutal ports navigate to the create page click the edit image config button and then the recommended tab pick the bittensor recommended docker image that will configure the latest version of bittensor along with the correct port settings open up the readme file associated with the template follow the instructions to create a cold and hot wallet on your local machine and to then run bittensor the first step is to register on the bittensor network for more info see the bittensor installation documentation troubleshooting all my instances keep stopping switching to inactive status even though i didn t press the stop button what s going on check your credit balance if it hits zero or below your instances will be stopped automatically i keep getting this error spend_rate_limit what s going on there is a spend rate limit for new accounts the limit is extremely small for unverified accounts so make sure to verify your email the limit increases over time so try a cheaper instance type or wait a few hours if you are still having trouble use the online support chat in the lower right i tried to connect with ssh and it asked for a password what is the password there is no ssh password we use ssh key authentication if ssh asks for a password typically this means there is something wrong with the ssh key that you entered or your ssh client is misconfigured on ubuntu or mac first you need to generate an rsa ssh public private keypair using the command 1 ssh keygen t rsa next you may need to force the daemon to load the new private key and confirm it s loaded 1 ssh add ssh add l then get the contents of the public key with 1 cat ssh id_rsa pub copy the entire output to your clipboard then paste that into the change ssh key text box under console account the key text includes the opening ssh rsa part and the ending user something part if you don t copy the entire thing it won t work example ssh key text 1 ssh rsa

n6sol4xdv3zqrebuc98cjph04gnc41w02lmdqgl2xg5u rv8 jm7cawkiiz3dbkv bob velocity i stopped my instance and now when i try to restart it the status is stuck on scheduling what is wrong when you stop an instance the gpu s it was using may get reassigned when you later then try to restart the instance it tries to get those gpu s back that is the scheduling phase if another high priority job is currently using any of the same gpu s your instance will be stuck in scheduling phase until the conflicting jobs are done we know this is not ideal and we are working on ways to migrate containers across gpus and machines but until then we recommend not stopping an instance unless you are ok with the risk of waiting a while to restart it hosting how much money can a host make it s complicated it depends on many factors hardware performance price reliablity etc you can estimate your hardware s earning potential by comparing to similar hardware already rented on vast ai pricing statistics over time are tracked on 500farm or got to the create console page select include unavailable offers and the nvidia opencl image to see most instance types including those fully rented hosts can run low priority jobs on their own machines so there is always a fallback when high priority jobs are not available how and when will i be paid for hosting for users in the us and internationally we support payout to a bank account ach via stripe connect check to see if your country is supported here hosts can also receive payout through paypal or wise due to various transaction fees there is a minimum payout of 20 or equivalent in other currencies host billing runs on a regular weekly schedule every friday host invoices are then paid out the following week depending on bank transfer times do you support payout in any crypto currencies no not at this time what is the revenue fee structure hosts receive 75 of the revenue earned from successful jobs with 25 kept by vast ai what happens if i turn off my machine or just lose internet during a compute job hosts are expected to provide reliable machines we track data on disconnects outages and other errors this data is then be used to estimate a host machine s future reliability these reliability score estimates are displayed on the listing cards and also used as a factor in the default auto ranking criteria what security measures protect my machine and my network guests are contained to an isolated operating system image using linux containers containers provide the right combination of performance security and reliability for our use case the guest only has access to devices and resources explicitly granted to them by their contract will guests be able to determine my ip address we do not by default prevent a guest from finding your router or nat s external facing ip address by visiting some third party website as this would require a full proxy network and all the associated bandwidth charges it is essential that guests be able to download large datasets affordably for many users a properly configured nat firewall should already provide protection enough against any consequences of a revealed ip address for those who want additional peace of mind we suggest configuring a separate network for your hosted machines but do make sure they can reach each other locally how do i set prices there are two prices to consider the max price and the min price the max price is what on demand rentals pay and as a host you can set that price on the host machines page with the set prices button as a host you can set a min bid price for your machine by creating an idle job at that price on the host create job page if you don t want to setup a true mining idle job you can just use ubuntu as the image and bash as the command see the host setup page for more info on idle jobs someone is renting my machine for less than my price what s happening they are using a bid the price that hosts set on the host machines page is not the rental price it is the maximum rental price on demand instances pay the max price but interruptible instances use a bidding system you can control the min bid price by setting up an idle job alternatively you can use the cli to set a per machine min bid reserve price how do i remove a gpu from my machine removing gpus is currently not supported if you really need to remove a gpu you will need to unlist the machine and wait for 0 rentals then when it is safe you can recreate the machine you can do this by deleting the file var lib vastai_kaalia machine_id what will the stability of earnings be like the demand for dl compute has grown stably and significantly in the last few years this growth is expected to continue for the forseeable future by most market analysts and nvidia s stock has skyrocketed accordingly demand for general gpu compute is less volatile than demand for cryptocurrency hashing the stability of any particular host s earnings naturally depends on their hardware relative to the rest of the evolving market the slowdown in moore s law implies that hardware will last longer in the future amazon is still running tesla k80 s profitably now almost 4 years after their release and the kepler architecture they use is now about 6 years old what operating systems are supported for hosting initially we are supporting ubuntu linux more specifically ubuntu 16 04 lts we expect that deep learning is the most important initial use case and currently the deep learning software ecosystem runs on ubuntu if you are a windows or mac user don t worry ubuntu is easy and quick to install if you are a current windows user it is also simple to setup ubuntu in a dual boot mode our software automatically helps you install the required dependencies on top of ubuntu 16 04 hardware what are the hardware requirements for hosting technically if our software detects recent decent nvidia gpus gtx 10xx series we will probably allow you to join but naturally that doesn t guarantee any revenue what truly matters is your hardware s actual performance on real customer workloads which can be estimated from benchmarks deep learning is gpu intensive but also requires some io and cpu performance per gpu to feed them with data multi gpu systems are preferable for faster training through parallelization but also require more total system performance in proportion and parallel training can require more pcie bandwidth per gpu in particular rendering and many other workloads have similiar requirements what kind of hardware works best for deep learning it depends heavily on the model and libraries used it s constantly evolving it s complicated we suggest looking into the various deep learning workstations offered today for some examples and see this in depth discussion on hackernews gpu workstations built for deep learning are similar to those built for rendering or other compute intensive tasks

houston march 20 2022 prnewswire the windacre partnership llc windacre today stated that it fully supports the decision by the board of directors board of nielsen holdings plc nyse nlsn nielsen or the company to reject the 25 40 per share acquisition proposal received by the company as a long term nielsen shareholder windacre believes that the acquisition offer significantly undervalues the company specifically the offer price does not fairly value nielsen s unique and strategic position as critical measurement infrastructure supporting the 100 billion u s video advertising ecosystem does not reflect the company s progress on executing the nielsen one roadmap is unattractive relative to the valuation of information services peers that similarly have proprietary and essential data assets and mid single digit revenue growth in line with nielsen s medium term outlook and is significantly below nielsen s intrinsic value per share which windacre assesses at well in excess of 40 per share accordingly windacre informed the board that it would not support the proposed transaction that it intended to accumulate the shares required to block the acquisition and that it was confident in its ability to do so under uk law a scheme of arrangement requires the approval of the holders of at least 75 in value of the shares voting on the transaction with members of the acquiring consortium not eligible to vote their shares windacre currently owns 9 6 of nielsen s ordinary shares and has economic exposure equivalent to another 14 4 of the company s shares through cash settled swaps snehal amin managing partner of windacre said nielsen is and we believe will continue to be the currency for the video advertising ecosystem advertisers need the truth about who is watching their advertising across all screens and all platforms and only nielsen one has the promise to deliver that a series of unaudited unvalidated and often self serving measurement metrics that provide a glimpse of the audience only on certain screens or limited platforms simply won t suffice advertisers know that and in the end they are the ones who decide what currency to use we are confident it will be nielsen one amin continued we do not believe the offer comes close to recognizing nielsen s intrinsic value and we were not going to be forced out of our holding at this price we intended to block the transaction so that we could realize in time the intrinsic value of our investment we believe strongly that the board made the right decision in the face of an inadequate offer saving the company from

you re reading an excerpt from the today s worldview newsletter sign up to get the rest including news from around the globe interesting ideas and opinions to know sent to your inbox every weekday financial markets rallied friday after russian officials made vital transfers to foreign investors sidestepping what would have been moscow s first sovereign debt default in nearly two and half decades but despite the collective sigh of relief on the floors of global stock exchanges the risk of a new russian debt crisis still looms large the problem with russian debt today is far different than in 1998 when financial turmoil and a cash crunch forced moscow to renege on payments to domestic bondholders in a financial event that rippled across the globe this time russia has plenty of cash but a big chunk of its reserves has been frozen by u s european and japanese officials as punishment for its invasion of ukraine advertisement to blunt the negative impact on the global financial system the u s treasury has said it will allow moscow to transfer frozen funds to cover its foreign bond payments until may 25 but think of that as only a limited insurance policy one could run out at any minute that s partly because russian president vladimir putin has suggested foreign creditors in hostile nations may be paid in undesirable rubles instead of dollars or euros importantly the russians didn t move in that direction last week but moscow has nearly 2 86 billion in interest and bond payments due by april 4 according to the institute of international finance iif an industry association if moscow does try to pay in the lowly ruble such a move will be tantamount to a sovereign default rating agencies have said it would be russia s first on its foreign held debt since the bolsheviks halted payments in 1918 advertisement such events in the past have infected the global system through contagion or a financial domino effect that spreads as panicked investors yank money from foreign countries upending their borrowing costs stock markets and currency rates there s some good news now the global economy is significantly more stable today than it was in 1998 a tumultuous time when russia s default was sandwiched between the 1997 asian financial crisis and a far more devastating 2001 debt default in argentina back then many emerging markets were plagued by fragile currency systems and high foreign debt loads in dollars financial risks that many nations have since reduced large western money managers pension funds and other institutions that hold significant amounts of russian debt will feel the sting but russia is not even a top 10 global economy as measured by gross domestic product and the pain is projected to be relatively contained russia owes foreign creditors 62 5 billion including 21 5 billion that requires repayment in dollars and euros that s not much in the global scheme of things advertisement most likely a big chunk of it will have to be written off elina ribakova deputy chief economist at the institute of international finance iif an industry association told me it will be unpleasant and there are global pension funds you know in the united kingdom europe and the u s that are involved in this but we re watching for signs on the market and we re not seeing any big dislocations but there are some pretty big wild cards to consider too share this article share we live now in an era of exotic financial instruments such as credit default swaps or contracts that allow investors to hedge their financial bets that can go toxic quickly and cause a financial crisis to mushroom as the world learned during 2008 u s subprime mortgage meltdown few are predicting a repeat of that now but the full extent of the global exposure to swaps and other liabilities tied to russian debt is still hard to assess advertisement carmen reinhart the world bank s chief economist raised the specter of long term capital management ltcm a hedge fund that required a massive bailout due to the 1998 russian default remember ltcm that wasn t necessarily on anyone s radar screen at the outset of the russian default in august 1998 reinhart told bloomberg news those things start to surface exposures are opaque in addition the financial pain of the war will particularly hit countries closely linked to russia and ukraine through trade ties including turkey the czech republic hungary and poland the bigger war fallout on the global economy remains russia s impact on commodity prices moscow is a major exporter of oil gas metals and grains and trade disruptions because of the war and western sanctions have already sent commodity prices soaring worsening an already bad bout of global inflation domestically russia is also now likely to face years of financial isolation as foreign investors avoid it its heavily indebted corporations are also confronting new barriers to credit and fears are mounting over the climbing risks of russian corporate defaults advertisement russian defaults either by its government its corporations or both could have other knock on effects by accelerating currency fluxes and already climbing borrowing rates in a host of countries putting pressure on the ability of nations to finance social programs build infrastructure and pay back their own debts in 1998 the russian debt crisis sparked a run on the brazilian real and soaring interest rates even the u s dollar took a massive plunge against the japanese yen following ltcm s russia related losses global monetary policy is largely more stable now than it was then but borrowing costs globally are already climbing as the federal reserve moves to hike interest rates and end what had been a global flow of cheap money it comes at a time when the pandemic era saw a historic rise in national debt loads especially for emerging markets as countries struggled to deal with economic downturns and exploding health care and social costs sri lanka for instance is now mired its worst economic crisis since its 1948 independence requiring financial lifelines from india and potentially the international monetary fund borrowing costs for emerging markets have crept higher since the russian invasion especially for countries with high exposure nearby georgia has suffered most but so has egypt which is heavily reliant on ukrainian and russian grain exports they won t be the only ones to feel the pain especially in the event of a full russian default
pam blauman schmitz who was a union rep at starbucks in the mid 1980 s poses for a photo in front of a starbucks coffee shop tuesday feb 22 2022 in seattle starbucks now facing union elections at more than 100 u s stores has spent decades fighting unionization ap photo elaine thompson from the time he bought starbucks in 1987 to the time he stepped down as chairman in 2018 howard schultz consistently and successfully fought attempts to unionize starbucks u s stores and roasting plants but schultz who was recently named starbucks interim chief executive never confronted a unionization movement as big and fast growing as the current one six u s starbucks stores have voted to unionize since december and at least 140 more in 27 states have filed petitions for union elections it s unclear how schultz will tackle the issue when he returns to the company in april he took it really personally that his workers wanted to be part of a union because he thought with him in charge they wouldn t need it said pam blauman schmitz a retired union representative who worked to organize starbucks first stores in the early 1980s he would say stuff like maybe you need unions in the coal mines but not at starbucks stores starbucks announced march 16 that its ceo of five years kevin johnson was retiring the company tapped schultz to serve as interim ceo until it finds a permanent replacement by this fall schultz 68 who has held the honorary title of chairman emeritus since 2018 is also rejoining the company s board it is not yet clear if schultz will try to amp up the fight against unionization but timothy hubbard assistant professor of management at the university of notre dame s mendoza college of business said he is well positioned to do so my sense is that if they want to shut down the unions this is the best course of action hubbard said schultz has what it takes to tackle a hard topic like unions schultz did not respond to attempts to contact him through his website or his family s foundation in a november letter to employees posted just before the first unionization votes at three stores in buffalo new york schultz said he tried to create the kind of company that his blue collar father never had the chance to work for he recalled the traumatic moment his family had no income after his father suffered a workplace injury and said that s why starbucks has benefits like health care free college tuition parental leave and stock grants for employees no partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at starbucks and i am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now schultz wrote but to many union organizers who complain of inconsistent hours poor training understaffing and low wages shultz s words fell flat a lot of people felt like they were being lectured to by a disappointed father because they weren t grateful said jaz brisack a starbucks barista and labor organizer who heard schultz speak at an employee forum in buffalo last fall others say they ve seen outright anger from schultz over unions blauman schmitz said as soon as schultz bought starbucks in 1987 he reneged on a labor agreement that had been reached between the company and the united food and commercial workers union which represented six seattle area stores and a roasting plant schultz wanted a new contract with weaker benefits and job protections said blauman schmitz who has since retired from the union one day she said schultz spotted her passing out flyers in the roasting plant and rushed toward her screaming and red in the face anne belov was working part time in the roasting plant and sat on the union negotiating committee she had always gotten glowing performance reviews but after schultz took over she was suddenly being reprimanded constantly belov left the company in 1988 you could see the writing on the wall as the company grew it was not going to continue to be possible to act on the good faith of the people who controlled all the power she said schultz soon swept the union out in his 1997 book pour your heart into it he recalled how a barista who opposed the union began a campaign to decertify it by 1992 the union no longer represented the stores or the roasting plant schultz saw that as a sign that workers trusted him if they had faith in me and my motives they wouldn t need a union he wrote still efforts to unionize starbucks didn t go away and the company continued to fight them starbucks had to reinstate fired workers or pay to settle labor law violations numerous times in the early 2000s last year the nlrb found that starbucks unlawfully retaliated against two philadelphia baristas who were attempting to unionize the nlrb said starbucks monitored the employees social media unlawfully spied on their conversations and ultimately fired them it ordered starbucks to stop interfering with workers right to organize and offer reinstatement to the two workers more recently on march 15 the nlrb issued a complaint against starbucks alleging that district and store managers in phoenix spied on and threatened workers who supported unionizing the complaint says starbucks suspended one union supporter and fired another starbucks did not make anyone available to comment in a letter to employees in december starbucks north america president rossann williams said the company will respect the legal process and bargain in good faith but the company insists its stores function better when it works directly with employees the outcome of the current unionizing effort is unclear the number of stores that have petitioned for union elections is still only a fraction of starbucks 9 000 company owned stores in the u s and starbucks has the resources to keep fighting with annual revenue of 29 billion last year but brisack said this unionizing effort is also stronger than past ones which were thwarted by high worker turnover and resource starved unions organizers now have the backing of workers united an arm of the 2 million member service employees international union and a union friendly president in the white house brisack said the pandemic also fueled workers outrage the climate is also changing dan cornfield a labor expert and professor of sociology at vanderbilt said u s polling shows growing public support for unions since the great recession that s a big difference from the 1980s when starbucks first fought back unions by taking an anti union stand from the reagan era they are actually potentially jeopardizing their customer base cornfield said pam blauman schmitz who was a union rep at starbucks in the mid 1980 s poses for a photo in front of a starbucks coffee shop tuesday feb 22 2022 in seattle starbucks now

dpa ap images beirut governments should ensure that the conflict in ukraine does not worsen the food crisis in the middle east and north africa and protect the right to affordable adequate food for everyone human rights watch said today both ukraine and russia are leading exporters of agricultural products to many middle eastern and north african countries and disruptions related to the war are already exacerbating already rising food prices and deepening poverty global food chains demand global solidarity in times of crisis said lama fakih executive middle east and north africa director at human rights watch without concerted action to address the supply and affordability of food the conflict in ukraine risks deepening the world s food crisis particularly in the middle east and north africa under international human rights law everyone has the right to access sufficient and adequate food needed to live a healthy and active life to protect this right governments are obligated to enact policies and provide appropriate support to ensure that all people can afford safe and nutritious food at all times russia s invasion of ukraine has already led to increases in the price of bread and other basic foods particularly in the middle eastern and north african countries highly dependent on grain from ukraine and governments should act with urgency to protect the right to food the black sea area affected by the ukrainian crisis exports at least 12 percent of the food calories traded in the world ukraine has one third of the world s most fertile soil according to the un food and agriculture organization fao and 45 percent of its exports are agricultural related it is among the world s leading exporters of sunflower oil rapeseed and barley corn wheat and poultry a large part of the country s wheat production comes from areas of eastern ukraine where the current conflict is most intense on march 9 2022 ukraine banned exports of grain and other food products to prevent a domestic humanitarian crisis even if these supply chain disruptions are resolved soon the problems would most likely persist because farmers are fleeing the fighting and the conflict is destroying infrastructure and equipment the fighting could also gravely diminish the coming harvest particularly if it continues into the start of the planting season in april essential food prices were already increasing globally because of disruptions in the food supply chain caused by the pandemic and the conflict has added to that according to the fao many countries in the middle east and north africa are especially reliant on ukrainian grain and seed oil and vulnerable to food price shocks about 80 percent of the wheat that lebanon imported in 2020 the last year for which data is available came from ukraine according to the lebanese government s customs website lebanon only has capacity to store reserves for one month as a result of the august 2020 explosion in beirut s port that destroyed the capital s grain silos bread and other grain products make up 35 percent of the population s caloric intake egypt imports over half its sunflower oil from ukraine and the government had already reduced subsidies for sunflower and soybean oil by 20 percent in june 2021 in response to an increase in prices maize exports from ukraine to some european and asian countries are used for animal feed and disruptions can have secondary impacts on poultry and pig feedstock imported corn is also an important food source for many african countries and supply constraints can increase prices across the board further exacerbating food insecurity which is the lack of access to adequate safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development moreover russia is the world s largest supplier of wheat and one of the biggest producers of fertilizers and the crisis could also disrupt this supply egypt the world s largest wheat importer is especially vulnerable as half of its imports come from russia and another 30 percent from ukraine on march 4 russia s trade and industry minister recommended halting fertilizer exports in response to economic sanctions even countries not dependent on ukraine or russia for agricultural imports may still see a rise in food prices for example due to an increase in fuel prices that affect food transport costs a reduced supply of fertilizers and shrinking global agricultural productivity and supply the pandemic disruptions had already contributed to global food price increases and deepening poverty climate change driven weather extremes also damaged harvests of some crops in 2021 global food prices rose by more than 30 percent in the last year and the ukraine crisis further drove up prices to reach the highest they ve been since 1974 when adjusting for inflation according to the fao nearly one in three people in the middle east and north africa did not have access to adequate food in 2020 an increase of 10 million people in just one year click to expand image 2022 human rights watch following russia s invasion of ukraine grain futures such as for wheat corn and soybean have already increased futures markets are where commodities are bought and sold for delivery at future dates enabling speculation in food that un human rights experts have found exacerbates exclusion and inequality many countries in the middle east and north africa have severely inadequate social protection systems that do not protect people s economic rights to help people cope with an increase in prices countries already grappling with crisis and widespread food insecurity such as yemen lebanon and syria are particularly at risk all governments should immediately and systematically act to protect everyone s rights to an adequate standard of living and in particular the right to food a global food crisis can only be addressed through international cooperation food exporting countries should address their national needs but should also work with import dependent countries to establish alternative supply chains as soon as possible exporting governments should carefully balance export restrictions to protect the right to food domestically while minimizing to the extent possible impacts on food supply and prices for other countries sanctions on russia or corporate divestment from the country should take into account the impact on agricultural related exports insofar as that will impact food security for many populations governments should adopt safeguards to minimize negative impacts or complementary measures to offset the anticipated and monitored impact of sanctions on food security importing governments should also work to ensure that nutritious food is affordable and accessible to everyone especially since food prices are surging many governments in the region have removed food and bread subsidies in recent years and those that still maintain them such as egypt and tunisia are considering or are in the process of removing or reducing them the current crisis underscores the risks that such changes by raising the price of food can exacerbate food insecurity particularly if they are not coupled with robust social protection that ensures an adequate income to all to purchase food some countries such as libya have introduced or strengthened price controls to cope with this crisis in that context the crisis in ukraine further highlights the critical need for governments in the middle east and north africa to establish expand or increase social protection systems so everyone in the region can realize their rights to an adequate standard of living including the right to food and the right to social security governments and international institutions should increase humanitarian assistance to countries that lack adequate resources to provide people with the support they need to protect their right to food the international community including the united nations world food programme wfp and food and agriculture organization have recognized the massive disruption to the food supply chain and should provide assistance to governments struggling to get wheat and other food supplies both have said that they have scaled up their activities in response to the crisis and the wfp is seeking additional funds to support its work although the immediate focus has understandably been on helping ukrainians both remaining in and fleeing the country russia s invasion of ukraine has exacerbated a food crisis that caused 10 million people in the middle east and north africa region to lose their ability to get enough food in 2020 alone said sarah saadoun senior researcher at human rights watch focused on poverty and inequality governments should do everything in their power to protect people s right to food such as by providing adequate subsidies or by intervening to control prices or by providing proper social protection lebanon the impact of potential food price rises exacerbated by the conflict will be acutely felt in lebanon in 2020 about 80 percent of lebanon s total wheat imports came from ukraine and another 15 percent from russia according to lebanese customs figures on february 25 the economy minister said that lebanon has wheat reserves sufficient for just one month as beirut s grain silos which previously held four months of wheat reserves were destroyed in the august 4 2020 explosion at the capital s port the war in ukraine further exacerbates the suffering of millions because of the ongoing economic crisis more than 80 percent of the population has been plunged into poverty despite the economic crisis the lebanese authorities have repeatedly delayed the rollout of two social protection programs that would provide cash to vulnerable families and cushion them from the price increases the government started cash transfers to 150 000 extremely poor households on march 14 under a world bank funded program the emergency social safety net which was approved by the world bank in january 2021 the economy minister announced that the government was making plans to purchase an additional one month supply of wheat stepping in for private importers for the first time in decades currently the central bank subsidizes the purchase of wheat by private importers at a cost of us 20 million per month to lower the price of bread to consumers however the economy minister noted that the central bank has no capacity to pay higher prices prompting fears over whether lebanon can continue subsidizing wheat to maintain the same prices for consumers and supply in the midst of the crisis the industry minister tweeted on march 5 that lebanon will begin rationing wheat only allowing it to be used for bread until alternative supply sources can be found the government is attempting to import wheat from canada australia and the united states on march 13 turkey announced that it will donate more than 500 000 tons of food aid to lebanon libya libya relies on ukraine for over 40 percent of its wheat imports within the first week of russia s full scale invasion of ukraine the price of wheat and flour soared as merchants wary of supply disruptions raised prices up to 30 percent the ministry of economics and trade on february 26 said that the country had strategic reserves for soft wheat to last six months but could not prevent a flour supply crisis in several libyan cities on march 7 the ministry decided to impose measures to prevent a full scale crisis that included punitive measures such as freezing the commercial registration of flour companies and mills that did not adhere to the distribution mechanism approved by the ministry which maintains a single price on flour other decisions included increasing the strategic stock of wheat to enable flour mills to operate at full production capacity for at least three months restricting the distribution of flour to bakeries through the general syndicate of bakeries and setting 110 libyan dinars about us 22 as a maximum for a 50 kilogram bag of flour the government also promised to address financial and customs concerns for companies affected by these measures after a decade of intermittent armed conflicts political deadlock implosion of central authority and emergence of unaccountable warlords large segments of the population are in need of support and are prone to food insecurity according to the world food programme wfp prior to the crisis in international food markets from the ukraine conflict 12 percent of libyans or 511 000 people would need assistance in 2022 according to the un international organization for migration there are 635 051 migrants asylum seekers and refugees in libya one fourth of whom are considered moderately or severely food insecure according to the wfp egypt egypt relies heavily on subsidized imports to ensure affordable access to bread and vegetable oil with more than 70 million egyptians relying on subsidized bread egypt is also the world s largest buyer of wheat and the largest importer of wheat from both russia and ukraine in 2021 approximately 80 percent of egypt s wheat imports came from russia and ukraine on february 23 prime minister mostafa madbouly stated in a cabinet meeting that egypt s current stockpile of wheat in silos is sufficient for four months in mid april local production will be harvested extending the stockpile to approximately nine months egypt s general authority for supply commodities has cancelled two tenders for the purchase of wheat since the start of russia s invasion due to high prices and a low number of bids on march 10 the government announced an immediate three month ban on the export of wheat flour and other staples the government has said it can secure wheat from alternative sources and so will most likely avoid an immediate shortage of wheat supplies but the direct impact could be a sharp increase in prices its export ban could impact other countries such as yemen should prices of wheat increase so would need for subsidies to maintain the cost to the population at a time when the government was already looking to cut bread subsidies in august 2021 president abdel fattah el sisi declared that the annual 3 billion in bread subsidies would be removed although the specifics of this plan have yet to be formally announced the egyptian government had already reduced subsidies for sunflower and soybean oil by 20 percent and unblended vegetable oil by 23 5 percent in july 2021 due to rising prices the government has not released a plan to ensure that food is affordable especially during the conflict until it has a clear plan to keep food affordable it should refrain from cutting subsidies further as cuts would potentially leave millions unable to access sufficient affordable food and should significantly expand social safety net interventions to protect against sharply increasing prices the price of subsidized bread has remained at 5 piastres us 0 003 a loaf since the 1980s bread subsidies are notoriously politically sensitive since the 1977 bread riots that erupted after president anwar sadat s announcement lifting subsidies on flour rice and cooking oil syria syria already has severe wheat shortages because of a debilitating economic crisis and the destruction of infrastructure due to a decade of armed conflict in 2021 the syrian government has allowed the discriminatory distribution of bread alongside corruption and restrictions on how much subsidized bread people can buy which caused people to go hungry the syrian government primarily relies on russia to close the shortfall in importing wheat in december 2021 the government reached an agreement with russia to import 1 million metric tons of wheat in 2022 financed by a russian loan according to the world food programme 13 4 million people in syria are food insecure in december 2021 the un food and agricultural organization estimated that syria s wheat production in 2021 was around 1 6 million metric tons under projected needs in part due to syria experiencing an acute drought the ukraine russia conflict is likely to exacerbate the current crisis in syria especially because the deal between russia and syria to import wheat was suspended on february 24 the syrian government issued measures to mitigate the economic ramifications of the conflict on syria such as fuel price increases and shortages of essential foodstuffs and other commodities for example the authorities adopted measures to ration reserves of foodstuffs including wheat and fuel they also committed to prioritize funding wheat imports northwest and northeast syria are likely to face similar issues including an inability to import sufficient amounts of wheat and rising prices the authorities in northwest syria supply the region with wheat and flour procured through turkey but turkey imports 90 percent of its wheat from ukraine yemen due to the ongoing conflict there yemen remains one of the world s worst humanitarian crises more than half of the population faces food insecurity and many face persistent and severe fuel shortages the war in ukraine is likely to worsen food insecurity as the country imports at least 27 percent of its wheat from ukraine and 8 percent from russia skyrocketing food prices in recent years have left more than half of the population in need of food assistance while the sharp depreciation of the yemeni rial has made imported food oil and other necessities more expensive and has dramatically reduced households purchasing power

houthi rebels unleashed a barrage of drone and missile strikes on saudi arabia early sunday that targeted a liquified natural gas plant water desalination plant oil facility and power station saudi state run media reported saudi press agency via ap dubai united arab emirates yemen s houthi rebels unleashed one of their most intense barrages of drone and missile strikes on saudi arabia s critical energy facilities on sunday sparking a fire at one site and temporarily cutting oil production at another the salvo marked a serious escalation of rebel attacks on the kingdom as the war in yemen rages into its eighth year and peace talks stall the attacks did not cause casualties the saudi led military coalition fighting in yemen said but struck sites belonging to one of the world s most important energy companies and damaged civilian vehicles and homes the coalition also said it destroyed a remotely piloted boat packed with explosives dispatched by the houthis in the busy southern red sea hours after oil giant aramco s ceo amin h nasser told reporters the attacks had no impact on oil supplies the saudi energy ministry acknowledged that a drone strike targeting the yanbu aramco sinopec refining company caused a temporary reduction in the refinery s production the disruption as oil prices spike in an already tight energy market will be compensated for from the inventory the ministry said without elaborating another aerial attack later in the day struck a fuel tank at an aramco distribution station in the port city of jiddah and ignited a fire later at night the roar and thump of missile interceptors rattled the port city as the saudi military coalition said it destroyed more projectiles over jiddah residents posted footage on social media showing streaks of light from missile defenses pierce the dark sky the relentless wave of strikes revealed the expanding reach and precision of the rebels and the persistent gaps in the kingdom s air defenses a sophisticated strike in 2019 on aramco oil facilities knocked out half the kingdom s oil production and threatened to ignite a regional crisis an attack that the u s and riyadh later alleged came from iran the attacks on sunday came as saudi arabia s state backed aramco the world s largest oil company announced its profits surged 124 in 2021 to 110 billion a jump fueled by renewed anxieties about global supply shortages and soaring oil prices aramco also known as the saudi arabian oil co released its annual earnings after weeks of intense volatility in energy markets triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine the international oil benchmark brent crude spiked over 107 on sunday after nearly hitting a peak of 140 earlier this month saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have so far resisted western appeals to increase oil production to offset the loss of russian oil as gasoline prices skyrocket yehia sarie a spokesman for yemen s iran backed houthis said the rebels had launched a wide and large military operation in retaliation for the saudi led aggression and blockade that has turned much of yemen into a wasteland the escalation followed a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend in oman s capital of muscat the u n special envoy for yemen hans grundberg met with the chief houthi negotiator and omani officials to discuss a possible truce during the holy month of ramadan in early april the u n mission said the white house condemned the attacks blaming iran for supplying the houthis with missile and drone parts as well as training and expertise it is time to bring this war to a close but that can only happen if the houthis agree to cooperate with the united nations said u s national security advisor jake sullivan the united states stands fully behind those efforts the saudi led military coalition reported aerial strikes on a range of facilities an aramco liquified gas plant in the red sea port of yanbu an oil storage plant in jiddah a desalination facility in al shaqeeq on the red sea coast and an aramco oil facility in the southern border town of jizan among others the extent of damage on saudi infrastructure remained unclear and the ministry said only the yanbu refinery saw a temporary drop in output a joint venture between aramco and china the 10 billion yanbu aramco sinopec refining company on the red sea pumps 400 000 barrels of oil a day the saudi press agency shared photos of firetrucks dousing leaping flames with water and a trail of rubble wrought by shrapnel that crashed through ceilings and pocked apartment walls other images showed wrecked cars and giant craters in the ground the barrage comes days after the saudi based gulf cooperation council invited yemen s warring sides for peace talks in riyadh an offer dismissed out of hand by the houthis who demanded that negotiations take place in a neutral country negotiations have floundered since the houthis have tried to capture oil rich marib one of the last remaining strongholds of the saudi backed yemeni government in the country s north yemen s brutal war erupted in 2014 after the iran backed houthis seized the country s capital sanaa saudi arabia and its allies launched a devastating air campaign to dislodge the houthis and restore the internationally recognized government but years later the war has settled into a bloody stalemate and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world coalition airstrikes have struck civilian targets in yemen like hospitals telecommunications centers and wedding parties drawing widespread international criticism repeated houthi cross border attacks have rattled world energy markets and raised the risk of disruptions to output at aramco sites as part of its 2021 report aramco said it stuck to its promise of paying quarterly dividends of 18 75 billion 75 billion last year due to commitments the company made to shareholders in the run up to its initial public offering nearly all of the dividend money goes

national food and drug surveillance institute invima among its functions authorizes marketing certifies imports and performs post marketing surveillance invima like the european union uses a risk based classification system and classifies medical devices in colombia into four classes i low risk iia moderate risk iib high risk and iii very high risk 11 the decrees that regulate medical devices in the country are decree 3770 2004 sanitary registry of diagnostic reagents 12 decree 4725 2005 sanitary registry of sanitary products 13 decree 1011 2006 guarantee of quality of medical of health 14 resolution 4815 2008 national technovigilance program 15 decrees 581 and 582 2017 simplification of procedures for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic reagents 16 decree 3275 of 2009 modification of decree 4725 2005 17 obtaining market clearance for a medical device at invima is fast and predictable invima requires notification for low risk class i and iia devices additionally it requires a certificate of free sale in the country of origin or a reference country u s canada the european union japan and australia for class iib and iii devices invima issues an administrative act after a legal and technical review of the application decree 3275 of 2009 s provision homologates the following documents for class iib medical devices technical studies and analytical verifications sterilization methods disposal methods or final disposals and clinical studies in colombia the regulatory approval time to obtain market clearance for a medical device ranges from 15 to 90 days in other countries in the region such as argentina it is approximately 200 days and in brazil about 360 days 18 the validity of an invima sanitary registration is 10 years allowing foreign manufacturers to be the title holders of the registration certificate as opposed to in other countries where they must use the services of a third party registration holder the fact that colombia allows foreign entities to hold the title of the invima registration certificate enables foreign companies to fully control any amendments to the registration and add or remove distributors 19 the colombian government has an online public procurement mechanism called colombia compra eficiente 20 the best approach is for foreign manufacturers to partner with local distributors experienced in selling through public bids for the construction and equipping of hospitals and clinics 21 trends market outlook the makeup of the medical device market in colombia is the following consumable products 30 diagnostic imaging 13 orthopedic and prosthetic products 16 patient aids 12 dental products 5 and other types of medical devices 24 the colombian medical device market the third largest in latin america after brazil and mexico has an estimated average annual growth rate between 2020 and 2024 of 5 3 percent and will likely reach about 1 6 billion in 2023 colombia has a strong reliance on imports and these represent over 80 percent of the total sales this is one of the reasons that bring up great opportunities for local production to gain competitiveness diminish the effect of wide currency exchange rate fluctuations against the us dollar 18 the united states is the leading importer of medical devices in colombia the european union asia and oceania constitute large medical device supply markets for colombia although some multinational companies manufacture medical devices in colombia the most imported items are diagnostic reagents 15 surgical instruments 12 catheters 9 electro medical devices 4 and other products 60 22 colombia s capital city bogota is the center of the medical device industry in colombia and represents over 75 of the sales in the country 18 a free zone has encouraged international companies to manufacture locally and enter the market within the capital in its most recent evaluation called american cities of the future 2021 2022 the financial times magazine fdi cataloged the colombian capital as the second most important city in latin america for foreign direct investments surpassed only by mexico city 14 conclusion colombia is now poised to become the fastest growing economy in latin america in 2021 the colombian economy grew the most in 115 years bloomberg analysts predict that the colombian economy will grow 4 this year outpacing brazil mexico peru and chile 23 colombia is an attractive market for medical device makers because the health system dynamics have allowed universal coverage in the provision of health services including surgical procedures and other expensive interventions in addition there is lavish spending on health personnel hospital infrastructure medical services equipment and consumables colombia has the fastest regulatory approval times in latin america it has free trade agreements with the united states and the european union facilitating the rapid importation of medical devices colombia is now the third largest medical device market in the region and needs to import the great majority of the medical devices it needs a challenge however is that although health coverage is increasingly universal approximately 95 of the population with the expansion and updating of the health benefit plan it is still insufficient to meet the needs of 76 of the colombian people which includes the recent incorporation of venezuelan immigrants into the health system 24 it is strongly recommended that u s companies process the registration under their name and not under the local distributor name or else the u s company will not be able to change or add distributors during the lifetime of the registration which is 10 years 25 references about the author julio g martinez clark is co founder and

in response to growing resistance within the working class internationally to falling living standards brutal working conditions and the ongoing disaster triggered by the covid 19 pandemic the ruling class is reviving all its old methods of repression and class war including lockouts mass firings and anti strike court injunctions early sunday morning canadian pacific cp railway shut down operations as a 72 hour lockout deadline previously issued by the company was reached the 3 000 workers at the railroad the sixth largest in north america had voted nearly unanimously for strike action last month determined to overturn work schedules that do not allow adequate rest and to secure major improvements to wages and pensions the teamsters union which has kept workers in the dark about its talks with cp throughout negotiations belatedly issued a strike notice on thursday aware of the anger among workers over the company s arrogant and dictatorial moves the union in an attempt at saving face announced saturday night that it was initiating a strike in addition to the company s lockout canadian and us business interests are both braying for the government of liberal prime minister justin trudeau to intervene to shut down the work stoppage canadian chamber of commerce president perrin beatty called on liberal labour minister seamus o reagan to immediately bring forward legislation forcing a return to work saying this work stoppage will have a deep and adverse impact for all canadian businesses both big and small who rely on rail for their supply chain this severe damage to canadian supply chains at a time of heightened global uncertainty will extend beyond our borders and harm our reputation as a reliable partner in international trade last week several us republican senators and the governor of north dakota also sent separate letters demanding trudeau intervene to block a work stoppage pointing to the sharp run up in fuel prices and agricultural supply shortages due to the war in ukraine as justification canadian pacific carries goods as far south as kansas city in the us and is a major transporter of crude oil and potash a critical fertilizer ingredient behind the cynical professions of concern for the impact of rising gas and food prices on consumers the ruling class is more and more demanding that austerity be imposed and workers struggles suppressed in service of the national interest and preparations for war with russia the ruthless moves of canadian pacific management on the one hand and the determination of rail workers to improve their living and working conditions on the other are part of a broader intensification of the class struggle internationally in britain p o ferries fired its entire 800 person workforce on the

repeatedly defying government back to work orders and threats of mass arrests the walkout has taken place in opposition to roughly two dozen trade unions which bowed before the injunction and refused to sanction the strike the workers are demanding that the agency be merged with the state government to secure better pay and benefits as well as compensation to the families of 700 workers who have died from covid 19 msrtc has fired over 2 216 of the strikers and suspended another 12 207 in spain an estimated 75 000 truck drivers launched an indefinite strike last monday over surging fuel prices and poor working conditions the spanish state helmed by a coalition government between the socialist party psoe and pseudo left podemos party has responded ferociously last week a 33 year old striker was shot and seriously wounded by an undercover cop and the psoe podemos government has announced it is mobilizing more than 23 000 police to crush the strike in the us a federal judge last month upheld an anti strike injunction against 17 000 bnsf rail workers the court ruling basing itself on the reactionary railway labor act stipulated that workers were barred from authorizing encouraging permitting calling or otherwise engaging in any strikes work stoppages picketing slowdowns sickouts or other self help against bnsf or its operating rail subsidiaries earlier this year workers voted overwhelmingly to strike against a widely hated and punitive hi viz attendance policy which the company unilaterally imposed on february 1 on sunday the democratic party dominated minneapolis public schools board issued their last best and final offer for educational support professionals in a bid to end a strike by roughly 4 500 educators provocatively the school board announced that raising wages even modestly for support staff who are paid so little that some are forced to sleep in their cars would be predicated on 10 million in cuts to the budget next year with a rapidly escalating war drive by the us and its nato allies underway the trade unions are redoubling their efforts to impose the dictates of the corporations and the state either blocking strikes or if unable to seeking to keep them isolated in turn capitalist governments particularly the biden administration are relying ever more heavily on the largely discredited unions to try to suppress resistance in canada the trudeau government has thus far held off on directly intervening to end the rail work stoppage instead pressuring the teamsters to come to a deal with the company or accept binding arbitration in the us the white house met with united steelworkers officials to block a strike by 30 000 oil refinery and petrochemical workers and impose the dictates of the energy giants which are profiteering from an explosive run up in oil prices the usw has since touted the deal as one which is responsible and does not add to inflationary pressures a torrent of propaganda has been released in the western media presenting the war in ukraine as a struggle for democracy and freedom but contrary to these hypocritical claims the democratic rights of workers in the united states and among its allies increasingly count for nothing to the extent that workers carry out strikes and other struggles to raise their living standards they will increasingly be blackguarded as putin s stooges and a threat to the national interest as striking london tube workers have experienced recently the ruling elites confront an intractable social economic and political crisis supply chains are increasingly tattered a consequence of the disastrous response of the major capitalist countries to the pandemic and more recently the reckless incitement of military conflict in ukraine and unprecedented economic sanctions against russia which threaten to erupt into open world war at the same time stock values remain both inflated near all time highs and extremely fragile with frenzied speculative investment fueled by the handout of virtually free money by the central banks since the pandemic began under these conditions the imposition of low wages and labor discipline is a vital necessity for the ruling class which will deploy all the resources and methods of state repression at its disposal to secure them in announcing that interest rates would rise last week federal reserve chairman jerome powell pointed to the need to lower inflation to counter growing demands for higher wages saying workers pay is moving up in ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time adding we need to use our tools to guide inflation down to 2 percent workers all over the world increasingly find themselves in a political struggle against a ruling class that has nothing to offer the population but an unending pandemic low wages unbearably long hours austerity and war but the same underlying contradictions which are driving the ruling elites onto the disastrous path of war are enormously intensifying class tensions and radicalizing wide layers of the population over the last few years growing numbers of workers have rebelled against the unions efforts to impose concessions voting overwhelmingly to reject union endorsed agreements at warrior met coal volvo deere dana corp frito lay kellogg s and elsewhere in 2021 alone to break out of the isolation imposed by the pro corporate trade unions on their struggles workers require new organizations rank and file factory and workplace committees which base themselves on the methods of class struggle and an unrelenting fight for the needs of all workers at the same time the growing ruthlessness of the ruling class and its state demonstrates the need for workers to adopt a political perspective and program of their own one which is dedicated to the mobilization of the working class internationally in the struggle for socialism and social equality and against war

sanctions will stop putin from using his war chest european commission president ursula von der leyen pledged on february 26 days after russia launched its invasion of ukraine we will paralyze the assets of russia s central bank and indeed since attacking ukraine russia has been hit with the harshest sanctions it has faced since the end of the cold war already on february 22 the day after russia recognized the territorial claims of the self declared separatist republics in the donbas region of eastern ukraine the united states and its allies blocked major russian firms and elites from western markets four days later after russia launched a full scale attack on its southern neighbor the united states the united kingdom canada and the european union sanctioned russia s central bank and kicked russian banks off of swift the messaging platform for clearing international bank transactions and as the invasion s second week drew to a close and russian forces encircled ukrainian cities u s president joe biden banned the import of russian oil natural gas and coal into the united states depriving the kremlin of vital revenue though russia has thus far escaped an eu ban on its critical oil and gas exports its banishment from global financial markets has already hammered its economy the february 26 sanctions sent international investors racing from russian markets in mere hours the ruble lost nearly a third of its value barred from selling its foreign currency reserves russia s central bank hiked interest rates from 9 5 percent to 20 percent to staunch ruble selling and slow the currency s depreciation while the government ordered russian exporters to disgorge 80 percent of their foreign currency revenues such measures will help the regime conserve dollars in the short run but by massively raising the cost of business capital and consumer borrowing they will inflict a powerful blow to russia s capacity to sustain a lengthy major war by all appearances russian president vladimir putin grossly underestimated the scale and scope of the sanctions response to his invasion having amassed 630 billion in foreign reserves putin was confident in his ability to weather whatever the west would throw at him but now because of the sanctions placed on russia s central bank he is cut off from his mountain of money or is he our research suggests that russia may have stashed tens of billions of dollars in reserve assets in opaque offshore accounts where it holds dollar denominated securities beyond the reach of international sanctions and asset freezes we see indications in fact that across two different periods one in mid 2018 and the other late last year as russia built up troops on the ukrainian border russia may have secluded up to 80 billion in treasury securities offshore russia s total offshore dollar holdings of course could be higher still and there are signs too that russia may have moved some of its dollars with help from a foreign government if the west aims to make putin pay for and end his illegal aggression then it should as the saying goes follow the money and it may need new measures to prevent him from using that money to prolong the war for months while continuing to fund russia s economy hidden in plain sight though today s financial emergency may be the worst to befall russia since the ruble crisis of 1998 when moscow was forced to restructure over 70 billion in debt the west s sanctions may be less watertight than media reports and the comments of world leaders suggest if the united states and its allies are determined to use financial strangulation to force russia out of ukraine and possibly to force putin from power they need to consider the ways in which the russian government may have prepared to soldier on under even these historic restrictions importantly we believe putin s regime may actually hold tens of billions of dollars worth of u s treasuries that cannot currently be traced to russia back in 2018 there were startling reports in western media that russia had dumped nearly all of its treasury debt u s treasury department statistics at the time showed russia s holdings plunging from 96 billion to 15 billion over two months we were skeptical that russia had sold the 81 billion difference after all most international trade and nearly 90 percent of foreign exchange transactions involves u s dollars given that treasuries are the investment of choice for any government with an imminent need for dollars a selloff that size seemed implausible the treasury department s data however did not mean that russia had necessarily sold the entire 81 billion of securities russia could simply have moved the treasuries outside the united states we therefore examined figures from russia s central bank which suggested a far smaller figure for treasury sales about 43 billion that left 38 billion unaccounted for where had it gone putin s regime may hold tens of billions of dollars worth of u s treasuries that cannot currently be traced to russia we then examined holdings of treasuries in the two most popular offshore centers the cayman islands and belgium the latter being home to the international custodial bank euroclear which holds securities on behalf of depositors over the same two months of russia s alleged dumps in 2018 we found anomalously large rises in cayman holdings of 20 billion and belgian holdings of 25 billion the 45 billion total was more than enough to account for the missing russian holdings the treasury department does not disclose the identities of those actually purchasing securities nor would u s officials necessarily have this information government surveys of brokers and custodians do not collect it euroclear itself might not even know the ultimate owners of securities it handles instead of dealing directly with euroclear the russian central bank could for instance transfer its securities to a financial intermediary such as a private bank a shell corporation or even a foreign government and direct that entity to deposit them with the custodian such maneuvering could obscure russia s involvement altogether regardless in 2018 it should have been no surprise that russia would move treasuries offshore as it was widely known that this option was available and effective it had long been believed that china was parking treasuries at euroclear to disguise their ownership and shield them from scrutiny in china s case it may have offshored the bonds to mask its interventions in foreign exchange markets as it had long managed the renminbi s dollar value by buying and selling reserves stored in the form of treasury securities russia s motivations however would be different stashing dollar denominated securities in offshore accounts makes them harder to target for u s sanctions the kremlin has keenly felt the threat from sanctions since its 2014 annexation of crimea and subsequent military backing of pro russian separatists in eastern ukraine when western countries froze russian assets and restricted its trade for this reason then hiding treasuries offshore would be an attractive option for putin his 38 billion stash of dollar assets if still hidden in belgium the caymans or another haven could be critical for russia s ability to purchase essential imports or meet interest payments on its sovereign debt putin s war chest once putin began preparing for a major invasion of ukraine the stage was set for another big move in russia s treasury stash according to u s treasury department numbers published on february 15 belgium s that is euroclear s treasury bond holdings surged in december 2021 by a whopping 47 billion the cayman holdings stayed flat that month that spike is belgium s largest one month rise since early 2014 china was almost certainly behind the 2014 surge throughout that year the assets of its central bank the people s bank of china pboc rose in tandem with belgian treasury holdings the pboc was evidently building up its war chest of dollar reserves and storing them in treasuries held through euroclear in 2021 however the pboc s reserves stayed flat indicating a different source for the sudden rise in belgium s holdings if the west aims to make putin pay for his illegal aggression then it should follow the money that source is likely russia by december the kremlin undoubtedly anticipated that if it invaded ukraine harsh western sanctions would choke off its access to dollars to stave off the worst effects of such sanctions it would make sense for russia prior to invasion to buy up dollar denominated assets and stash them in offshore accounts that would explain the massive uptick in belgian treasury holdings in any case no other single country with motive to disguise its holdings from u s authorities could possibly account for it following western sanctions euroclear has stopped clearing purchases of russian securities and other ruble denominated transactions these moves align with other western companies steps to counter russia s invasion and as far as we can tell euroclear has followed all of its obligations under existing sanctions but euroclear has not announced restrictions on anyone selling non russian securities such as treasury bonds and although the sanctions have banned transactions with major russian banks moscow could easily have used non russian intermediaries when placing its treasury holdings with euroclear in other words the russian central bank could have structured its transactions to bypass sanctions altogether mere months before being slapped with allegedly comprehensive financial sanctions then russia may have secluded yet another 40 billion or more in treasuries from which it can draw in a pinch china s helping hand it is not yet clear which intermediaries russia would have used to stash treasuries offshore one strong possibility however is china with which putin now appears allied in december 2021 at the same time that belgium s treasury holdings surged by 47 billion russia s central bank reported a massive 41 billion increase in its currency and deposits held at other national central banks that jump dwarfed all other monthly changes in this statistic since russia began reporting it in 2005 and the most likely recipient of those deposits is the pboc the russian central bank and sovereign wealth fund hold an estimated 140 billion in chinese bonds about four times the total in early 2018 data from june 2021 also show china holding 14 2 percent of russia s foreign reserves the largest share of any country and their partnership extends well beyond the financial arena late last year russia and china held a series of joint military exercises and issued joint diplomatic statements aimed at the west it would make sense therefore for russia to deposit 41 billion in renminbi or assorted currencies with the pboc the pboc could have then exchanged the currencies for dollars crediting russia for a 41 billion deposit and used the dollars to buy treasuries for storage at euroclear chinese president xi jinping who just last week condemned western sanctions as harmful to all sides appears fully supportive of that sort of maneuvering this money would not necessarily leave a clear trail in the pboc s massive 3 2 trillion balance sheet as the central bank could have spread it across multiple line items the pboc could for example have deposited some with state controlled banks and directed them to buy treasuries for safekeeping at euroclear such an arrangement would explain why the pboc s currency and deposits with china headquartered banks jumped by an unprecedented 13 billion last december at the same time that the anomalous belgian and russian financial data were recorded alternatively the pboc might have kept the transaction off its balance sheet altogether it is impossible based on the information we have now to know how russia and china might have structured such an arrangement but regardless russia would be able to withdraw the dollars whenever it pleases the pboc would simply sell the treasuries and transfer the proceeds to russia western authorities would be none the wiser while western financial institutions would not necessarily have violated any sanctions policies and by circumventing sanctions this way china and russia would work to erode western financial and political influence seal the gaps in early december the biden administration disclosed intelligence reports that foresaw putin s invasion of ukraine yet the u s government only published its data on the soaring belgian bond stash nine days before russia launched its attack in february had u s authorities been able to monitor euroclear s changing holdings in real time it would have added to the early indications that moscow was planning to go ahead with an invasion there are clear limits to the financial detective work that we can do from our desktops but our research suggests that western governments may not be doing all they can and should to choke off russia s access to the dollars it needs to fund its war in ukraine the keys we believe lie in russian money flowing through brussels and beijing as financial sanctions become the west s weapon of choice in facing down aggressive autocracies the united states and its allies need to better integrate cross border follow the money strategies into their diplomatic and military arsenal to ensure success such strategies can help authorities close loopholes in existing sanctions detect and restrict evasive transactions through financial intermediaries and penalize state and third party actors that undermine global restrictions moreover they can buttress conventional intelligence efforts in predicting and countering adversary behavior sanctions programs that do not root out large scale evasive money flows however will prove too porous to deter or reverse targeted behavior

students at the university of michigan s school of social work msw are walking out of classes today to demand compensation for their internships which are currently unpaid and required for graduation there are approximately 700 students in the social work program matt dargay one of the organizers of the payment for placement movement at the university of michigan spoke with tim rivers from the world socialist web site about monday s demonstration and the demands of the p4p organization tr matt first thank you for speaking with the world socialist web site could you explain the situation that students of social work confront what provoked your demonstration md the situation right now is that social work students must fulfill a field placement which is basically an internship as a condition for graduation the vast majority of social work students work a minimum of 900 hours at our field placement site completely without pay the majority of us are doing the type of tasks an msw therapist or case manager or other social worker does i ve talked to a lot of people who have observed that if not for their labor and other students that agency would not be able to operate so we view it as a fundamental workers injustice and a barrier that is keeping low income people from entering the social work profession what we are asking is to be paid for our fieldwork so that my colleagues students in need can be made whole economically and so that future generations of social workers can be more diverse economically and socially tr what are the wages of an msw level therapist md starting wage at the msw level from the university of michigan is about 45 000 a year that is not a lot of money to begin with most people can crack the 60 000 territory by the end of their career but it is not a lucrative profession tr you have to have a master s degree in order to get into msw level therapy is that right md if you really want to call yourself a therapist you have to get a master s degree if you want to get hired by any agency in a professional capacity you have to have a master s we are paying a significant sum to get through this program and we are essentially paying to work the university of michigan master s program costs 15 000 a semester for a four semester program for a total of 60 000 tr who are the clients of the agencies md it s quite diffuse and complex social workers in community based settings are serving people from working class and poor backgrounds a lot of us in this program were ourselves once in a place of need or hardship and we were served by a social worker who inspired us to join this field tr would you say the agencies and the university takes advantage of that commitment md i would say the university does i m a little bit more sympathetic to some of the agencies this really speaks to the whole society wide lack of investment in care labor since it can t really be labor that generates a profit we have decided on a national level not to invest as much into education preventative public health measures and social work as we really should there is just not as much funding available for social work agencies as there should be they end up competing with each other for measly grants and dollars and a lot of agencies probably would want to pay their student but simply cannot it would break the bank if they were to attempt that without any help from an outside source that outside source i believe should be the university of michigan system because the university system on top of being fabulously wealthy also already provides stipends for law students and public policy students who work for public interest firms these are firms that not unlike social work agencies are operating for the common good or are profit making and don t have a great revenue stream we believe that u of m has the capacity and should use its capacity to invest in social work tr please explain what you mean by fabulously wealthy md u of m has an endowment of 17 billion it has grown by 40 percent since last fiscal year tr the endowment has grown by 40 percent in a single year md yeah in fiscal year 2021 it grew by 40 percent i don t know the entirety of its portfolio but it invests in the stock market for instance and perhaps some of its stocks performed extremely well that s part of it really the pool of money that is called the unrestricted endowment can be spent on literally anything that is 5 7 billion tr were you part of the e pivot md i signed on to the letter of support for the e pivot but i was not one of the organizers behind it tr now three months later it s basically back to normal masks optional md more or less yes i did not know the word immunocompromised prior to the start of the pandemic the decision to return to normal was made in too premature a fashion the omicron variant was described in the popular media as virulent and contagious but relatively harmless but for someone whose immune system is not as strong as others that might not be the case tr now it s ba 2 and it is much more deadly not that ba 1 was mild and not deadly that was a lie md we still are seeing quadruple digit death totals across the country during the wave of the so called less harmful variant tr the walkout that is scheduled for monday are all the students going to participate md we are seeing some great totals right now in my best estimation there are about 90 students who have classes at the time and right now 70 of them have rsvp d to walk out we have a robust figure of students who have committed to this we are going to have students who are not in class joining us on the u of m diag for our rally i think we re going to crack triple digit figures in terms of attendance tr you are building a network across the country md we have chapters at wayne state university in detroit hunter college in new york city which is part of the city university of new york university of georgia and san diego state university those all come to mind tr are they participating in the walkout md they are not to my knowledge they will be sharing our information and cheering us on tr you said you identify as part of a rising movement of working class struggle against inequality and mistreatment md absolutely we do we identify as one piece in the puzzle of the struggle against inequality we have within our ranks passionate people who care a lot about social justice ever since reagan fired patco the union movement has been absolutely decimated by actions at the highest levels of government

we arrived at emazabekweni the birthplace of raymond zondo almost a week after his appointment as our new chief justice by president cyril ramaphosa the road leading to the village is made of gravel and is almost impenetrable during heavy rains youth mill around the road doing nothing the main source of income here is social grants and some of the villagers supplement it by planting their own gardens many residents here especially the young said they didn t know zondo personally but they often hear about him on the news but there were a few elders who had intimate knowledge of him read in daily maverick bravo judge zondo south africa now needs a total reboot the house in which zondo grew up only has walls still standing in the late 1980s when zondo was a human right s lawyer at the legal resources centre in durban it was torched during the political violence between the inkatha freedom party and supporters of the anc zondo s family members fled the area and established another home in jolivet about 30km away mebbie zondi 63 lives in a house across the dirt road from the burnt down zondo house she said she knew the zondo family as they grew up together raymond was not in politics as he was interested in church and his studies he was a hard worker polite and friendly she said zondi said she was working in durban when the zondo homestead was burnt down my mother told me that the mobs came at night and she had to hide in the pit latrine toilet when they burnt down the zondo home the mobs were burning houses indiscriminately busisiwe miya 71 said she came to know zondo when she married her husband in 1975 her husband was a local from emazabekweni at the time his father had passed on and his mother who was not well health wise was struggling to raise the children she often held piece jobs here and there to put the food on the table ray and his mother ntombi hellen zondo were regulars at the church in fact he was an altar boy or server in our church at school he was very bright an a class student who passed his classes with flying colours everybody in the church in the community wanted to help him succeed after finishing primary school at emazabekweni primary he was enrolled at st mary s seminary in ixopo where catholic priests and other clergy were taught on holidays he came to help in people s fields to help his mother to put food on the table i remember he became very close to my husband tilling fields and helping with other work in the fields he was very industrious said miya the schools that zondo went to snenjabulo sithole a teacher at

looting as people descended on the town centre targeting and cleaning out retail supermarkets liquor and food outlets hardware furniture and appliances stores clothing outlets and other shops the locals suffered for weeks and months afterwards as they had to travel far and wide for basic services such as social grants and basic foods ironically it was zondo a local ixopo born and bred jurist who had run out of patience with the dilly dallying and failure of former president jacob zuma to appear at the commission of inquiry into state capture and had taken him to the constitutional court for contempt the court imposed a 15 month sentence and zuma was hauled out of his nkandla compound and taken to the estcourt correctional centre to start his sentence read in daily maverick july

four years have passed since the donald trump administration announced it would impose tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese exports on march 22 2018 together with various further investment restrictions on china yet statistics issued by both sides now reveal that china u s trade instead of cooling down owing to the trade war is heating up according to the u s department of commerce in 2021 bilateral trade jumped by 17 6 percent year on year as data from china s national bureau of statistics show it increased by 20 2 percent leading sino american trade turnover to rank first among u s trading partners ironically the countries trade growth well exceeds the 12 3 percent rate in 2017 four years of trade war prove that trying to contain china has been a faulty stroke on the part of the u s the china u s dispute touches on trade science and technology diplomacy geopolitics and international rules the joe biden administration inherited all hostile policies toward china from its predecessor including extra tariffs on chinese exports and has taken it one step further by linking trade with human rights values and ideologies this arguably marks an unspoken bipartisan consensus on curbing china s development china u s trade statistics for 2021 demonstrate that the u s government s political interference did little to curb china s growth except for raising obstacles to the bilateral trade and crippling transnational business in china the latter however remains the world s most vibrant major economy whereas the u s seemingly has shot itself in the foot the country s record high inflation is to large extent the result of higher tariffs on chinese goods given these additional charges will eventually pass on to u s consumers in the form of valued goods according to the u s china business council the trade war knocked 108 billion off u s gdp from 2018 to 2019 and cost 245 000 jobs at present the u s still imposes an average tariff of 19 3 percent on 66 4 percent of chinese exports whereas china levies a tariff of 20 7 percent on 58 3 percent of american exports to china higher than the average tariff of 3 1 percent before the trade war and also higher than the average tariffs china imposes on goods from other countries these rates might result in the loss of another 732 000 jobs in the u s this year truth be told many big u s corporations oppose the trade conflict a number of american businesses have already demanded the removal of extra tariffs by submitting written statements to the u s department of commerce and office of the u s trade representative hoping to maintain normal economic and trade ties with china a report released by the american chamber of commerce in china on march 8 points out that surveyed u s companies operating in china are optimistic about the chinese market and some 66 percent intend to increase their investments in the country 83 percent of which do not plan to move their manufacturing or purchasing business out of china yet their voices are unfortunately too often muted by american politicians and populists five decades of interaction have deeply intertwined chinese and american interests despite the trade dispute in the four years their trade exchanges remain the most important part of bilateral relations outweighing political and personal exchanges which have dropped to historical low due to u s china containment policies and the covid 19 outbreak even frequent shipments shuttling between the two countries keep the baltic dry index a proxy for dry bulk shipping stocks as well as a general shipping market bellwether high ever closer trade relations between china and the u s reveal that the conflict proves a drag on china u s cooperation the time has come for the u s to forgo its consistently backfiring china containment policy china today boasts the world s largest middle income population 400 million as well as the best opportunities and biggest market potential of its 1 4 billion population to tap into neither country stands to benefit from the trade war what they really need is a suitable free trade agreement

tokyo japan has broken with years of precedent in its tough response to the ukraine invasion and the conflict could reshape tokyo s defense strategy as it confronts china s regional ambitions analysts say when russia last pushed into ukraine in 2014 japan s response was seen as lukewarm but this time around it has marched in lockstep with western allies on unprecedented sanctions and tough rhetoric even sending non lethal military aid advertisement and the crisis is already impacting debates on security spending and capacity in a country whose constitution limits its military to defence japan has been accused before of paying its way out in a way just giving money but not being directly involved in any crisis said valerie niquet an asia expert at france s foundation for strategic research think tank this time tokyo is putting a lot of emphasis on what they are doing to show that they are not just sitting by and waiting to see how things will evolve and the speed with which tokyo has moved on measures such as individual sanctions has been completely remarkable said tobias harris a senior fellow at the center for american progress this is much further than i thought we would see the japanese government go in part that reflects the extraordinary nature of the conflict but several other key factors are at play including the departure of former prime minister shinzo abe who long sought closer ties with moscow abe who resigned in 2020 had hoped warmer relations would lead to a breakthrough over disputed islands held by russia which moscow calls the kurils and japan calls the northern territories advertisement but with abe gone and years of deadlock on the dispute japan s government has felt freer to act against moscow though fears about energy needs have so far stopped tokyo from pulling out of joint energy projects with russia eye on china looming even larger though is china with its growing ambitions in the region including its desire to reunify taiwan and its claims to disputed islands it calls the diaoyu known as the senkaku in japan in the past tokyo worried aggressive actions on russia could push moscow into beijing s arms said james d j brown an associate professor of political science at tokyo s temple university now however that s completely flipped around he told afp instead the view is that japan has to be tough on russia because otherwise it sets a precedent and perhaps encourages china to think that they could do the same thing in the immediate term japan is expected to completely overhaul its view of russia in its national security strategy due later this year definitely russia will be very much described as a threat said niquet in the last one in 2013 russia was seen more as if not an opportunity certainly not a threat that will change completely nuclear sharing discussion and the ukraine crisis is likely to strengthen the hand of those calling for more defence spending in campaigning last year the ruling liberal democratic party set a long term goal of raising the defence budget to more than two percent of gdp up from its traditional one percent that is now something that they can realistically push towards said brown discussion of obtaining a strike capacity such as attack drones that could carry out first strikes against an enemy has been controversial given the constitutional limits on japan s military but the images we ve seen out of ukraine are going to be useful for people who want japan to have a more robust national defence harris said self defence is going to look increasingly like a fig leaf i suspect even more controversially japan s ruling party is set to debate nuclear deterrence after suggestions from lawmakers including abe that the possibility of nuclear sharing be considered that is likely to remain a bridge too far at least for now while japan relies on the us nuclear umbrella its long standing policy bars it from producing possessing or hosting the weapons but even a discussion of the issue in a country that suffered the hiroshima and nagasaki bomb attacks indicates the far reaching effects of the ukraine crisis i think we haven t seen fully the impact this war will have on japan s internal discussions harris said related stories orphans moved from mariupol clinic to russia held territory flow of ukrainian refugees testing limits of central europe s capacity us fighters say they felt calling to join ukraine s cause your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up france freezes 850 million euros of russian assets

now that s a truly great divergence the world s two economic superpowers dispensed with any significant nuance or qualification regarding their policy course the u s central bank declared war on inflation wednesday while chinese authorities indicated that recession is their foe the federal reserve not only raised its benchmark interest rate but projected hikes at all remaining meetings of the federal open market committee this year and alluded to quite a few in 2023 covid 19 has been almost written out of the picture the rapid pace of price increases is the new villain hours earlier beijing pledged to boost growth and markets sending stocks soaring and alleviating concerns the communist party was deaf to concerns that the once impressive recovery was petering out the benefits to the global economy from these twin assaults are substantial if central bank chair jay powell and people s bank of china governor yi gang get it right the fed wants to tame the most elevated inflation in four decades something policy makers considered months ago to be transitory china s lauded bounce from an economic contraction early in the pandemic is being undercut by new crackdowns on covid outbreaks morgan stanley predicts no growth in china this quarter both economies are aiming for softness through dramatic shifts in word and deed powell is trying to engineer a gentle landing for the u s one that wrings inflation without clubbing the expansion central bankers the world over talk about this but rarely succeed more common is that rate hikes are left too late and authorities then overdo it taking the economy down china is trying to stave off an economic and financial winter it s not very long ago that officials fretted publicly about debt and the need to rein in industries from technology to private tuition that were seen as falling foul of president xi jinping private sector analysts were forecasting a relatively mild easing of monetary and fiscal policy can that really be the case now until recently one lesson china internalized from massive stimulus during the financial crisis of 2008 is that industries can become too leveraged and threaten the system that is still a legitimate concern it s worth asking how long these stances can be sustained the fed s projections take the main interest rate beyond estimates of neutral a nirvana like place where borrowing costs neither hamper nor juice the economy it s clearly prepared to stray into difficult terrain powell dismissed the chances of a recession the economy may look robust too much so today but with energy prices climbing dramatically after russia s invasion of ukraine and some tightening of financial conditions it s a bold call that such vigor will be continued most american slumps aren t declared until many months after they have arrived by which point it s too late in another sign of a new era at the fed covid has been kicked into the long grass for the better part of two years powell has been saying that the course of the economy is dependent on the virus language often placed very high in fed communications verbal and written not any more for washington the pandemic is yesterday s story not so for china where big urban centers are locked down disrupting companies from shanghai to shenzhen same day different priorities it could be promising for the global economy provided neither overreaches send questions comments to the editors

docusign inc nasdaq docu has come full circle after riding the remote workforce trend to the 300 level last summer the e signature leader has seen its share price return to this story originally appeared on marketbeat docusign inc nasdaq docu has come full circle after riding the remote workforce trend to the 300 level last summer the e signature leader has seen its share price return to where it all began earlier this month the stock traded below 100 for the first time since april 2020 on fears that the company s best days are over like other big pandemic winners docusign isn t likely to experience the growth it did in 2021 extreme demand for e signature among employers scrambling to go paperless drove a 49 surge in sales yet the long term outlook is as solid as ever for a software pioneer that enjoys a significant first mover advantage the global shift to digital document solutions was only accelerated by the pandemic it is not going away the reset button has been pressed on docusign as if its covid boost never happened but with plenty of growth still ahead investors have a great opportunity to sign up for the next big run why did docusign stock fall docusign gapped below 80 on march 11th in the wake of the company s fourth quarter report revenue growth slowed from 42 in the previous quarter to 35 in q4 and earnings per share eps of 0 47 came in a dime below consensus the shortfall was compounded by a weak first quarter forecast that implies 24 top line growth at the midpoint management s forecast for 2 48 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue or 18 growth was the last straw for many investors who had grown accustomed to 40 plus growth it didn t help matters that docusign s disappointing year end update and outlook came at a time when the market was on edge because of the russia ukraine war recent geopolitical risks have forced high growth stocks to be perfect or face a barrage of selling what are docusign s growth prospects the world s top e signature provider is much more than the flagship software that has become commonplace in online business transactions e signature is at the core of what is a comprehensive document platform known as the docusign agreement cloud it is an ecosystem that drives the preparation signing and management of documents from start to finish despite the company s inroads most of today s agreement processes remain manual and disconnected in recognition of the need to reduce waste and costs docusign is developing new solutions tailored to specific workflows faster more efficient e signature software for manufacturing retail education and life sciences are just some of its newest offerings after ushering an additional 280 000 customers into the digital document age last year docusign s customer base has reached nearly 1 2 million what s more impressive than the sheer size of the customer base is the broad industry representation from blue chip tech companies like apple and microsoft to healthcare giants like roche and mckesson docusign is a trusted name for the entire economy much of the growth will come from overseas where docusign remains in the early stages of expansion in q4 less than one fourth of revenue came from outside the u s but international revenue growth was 55 with most of europe asia and south america yet to be introduced to docusign the growth opportunities are vast is docusign stock a buy hold or sell as ceo dan springer stated workers may be returning to the office but they are not returning to paper this says it all docusign is still a transformative business driving the global transition to cloud based documentation it operates in a 50 billion market in which it has a leading position and strong brand recognition as google is to internet search the word docusign has evolved into a verb synonymous with signing agreements electronically from a financial perspective this means that docusign will continue to generate recurring revenue that gives investors good visibility into cash flows even if at a slower pace than the unusual 2020 2021 period subscription additions from existing and new customers will only fortify these revenue streams in the high margin software business margin expansion is everything and docusign is achieving it gross margins expanded from 79 in fy21 to 82 in fy22 amid slowing growth yes but a greater portion of revenue is reaching the bottom line translation increasing shareholder value what also screams value is docusign s recently announced 200 million repurchase program this should provide a floor for the stock and keep it trending higher from the post earnings bottom it shouldn t come as a surprise that docusign s growth is slowing the unprecedented growth sparked by the pandemic was never going to be sustainable more importantly 20 growth shouldn t be dismissed nor should the length of docusign s growth trajectory even though this long term growth story remains intact it remains to be seen if docusign can regain favor with a market that has all but labeled it a pandemic has been with the bar now set much lower and management s guidance more likely to get beat buying activity could heat up fast investors that take the chance and sign on the dotted line here are getting a good deal

four years have passed since the donald trump administration announced it would impose tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese exports on march 22 2018 together with various further investment restrictions on china yet statistics issued by both sides now reveal that china u s trade instead of cooling down owing to the trade war is heating up according to the u s department of commerce in 2021 bilateral trade jumped by 17 6 percent year on year as data from china s national bureau of statistics show it increased by 20 2 percent leading sino american trade turnover to rank first among u s trading partners ironically the countries trade growth well exceeds the 12 3 percent rate in 2017 four years of trade war prove that trying to contain china has been a faulty stroke on the part of the u s the china u s dispute touches on trade science and technology diplomacy geopolitics and international rules the joe biden administration inherited all hostile policies toward china from its predecessor including extra tariffs on chinese exports and has taken it one step further by linking trade with human rights values and ideologies this arguably marks an unspoken bipartisan consensus on curbing china s development china u s trade statistics for 2021 demonstrate that the u s government s political interference did little to curb china s growth except for raising obstacles to the bilateral trade and crippling transnational business in china the latter however remains the world s most vibrant major economy whereas the u s seemingly has shot itself in the foot the country s record high inflation is to large extent the result of higher tariffs on chinese goods given these additional charges will eventually pass on to u s consumers in the form of valued goods according to the u s china business council the trade war knocked 108 billion off u s gdp from 2018 to 2019 and cost 245 000 jobs at present the u s still imposes an average tariff of 19 3 percent on 66 4 percent of chinese exports whereas china levies a tariff of 20 7 percent on 58 3 percent of american exports to china higher than the average tariff of 3 1 percent before the trade war and also higher than the average tariffs china imposes on goods from other countries these rates might result in the loss of another 732 000 jobs in the u s this year truth be told many big u s corporations oppose the trade conflict a number of american businesses have already demanded the removal of extra tariffs by submitting written statements to the u s department of commerce and office of the u s trade representative hoping to maintain normal economic and trade ties with china a report released by the american chamber of commerce in china on march 8 points out that surveyed u s companies operating in china are optimistic about the chinese market and some 66 percent intend to increase their investments in the country 83 percent of which do not plan to move their manufacturing or purchasing business out of china yet their voices are unfortunately too often muted by american politicians and populists five decades of interaction have deeply intertwined chinese and american interests despite the trade dispute in the four years their trade exchanges remain the most important part of bilateral relations outweighing political and personal exchanges which have dropped to historical low due to u s china containment policies and the covid 19 outbreak even frequent shipments shuttling between the two countries keep the baltic dry index a proxy for dry bulk shipping stocks as well as a general shipping market bellwether high ever closer trade relations between china and the u s reveal that the conflict proves a drag on china u s cooperation the time has come for the u s to forgo its consistently backfiring china containment policy china today boasts the world s largest middle income population 400 million as well as the best opportunities and biggest market potential of its 1 4 billion population to tap into neither country stands to benefit from the trade war what they really need is a suitable free trade agreement
neither ukraine nor russia is a significant bilateral trade partner of pakistan in 2020 together they accounted for less than 1 billion out of our total trade of about 68 billion nevertheless the conflict would have a significant effect on our economy the reason is that export restrictions on russia and supply disruptions from ukraine are seriously impacting global energy and food prices with its existing energy and food insecurity pakistan is more vulnerable to the adverse impact of these factors than other regional countries since the russian invasion of ukraine oil prices have been soaring on march 7 2022 the weighted average of the opec basket oil prices which serves as a reference point jumped to 126 51 per barrel although since then the price has dropped to around 100 per barrel it is still the highest since 2014 even before the conflict began in the first eight months of current financial year from july 2021 to february 2022 pakistan s import of petroleum had jumped from 6 5 billion to 13 billion or 100 compared to the corresponding period of last year if the price stays around this level the import bill for oil would likely surpass 20 billion or more than double that of the previous year similarly food items figure high in our import bill in 2020 21 their imports amounted to 8 billion or about 16 of the total although the food import bill has not shown a similar escalation as oil its increase during the past eight months was also significant from 5 3 billion to 6 4 billion or over 20 among food items relevant to pakistan are wheat and palm oil the conflict would seriously disrupt wheat supply since russia and ukraine together account for over 30 of the world s wheat exports on march 7 2022 wheat prices in international markets reached the highestever level although they have eased a little since then fortunately due to pakistan s record wheat crop in 2021 and considerable imports all sourced from ukraine and russia this commodity s prices have been relatively stable there were also favourable prospects for the 2022 crop to be harvested from april onwards but due to shortage of fertiliser the expected size of the crop may not materialise in order to build stocks and avoid shortages the government is planning to import about 2 million tons of wheat but it would not be easy this year as russia has already announced suspension of all grain exports until august 2022 to protect domestic food markets ukraine expects wheat plantations to decrease by 39 or 4 7 million hectares this spring this situation will be further compounded by the prevailing drought conditions in north america as far as palm oil is concerned due to 50 increase in prices this year our imports during the last eight months jumped from 1 58 billion to 2 44 billion or 53 pakistan is the world s fourth largest importer of this commodity and refined palm oil accounts for 98 of pakistan s total edible oil imports although palm oil is sourced entirely from indonesia and malaysia due to the disruption of sunflower seeds supply from ukraine and russia prices of other sources of edible oil are going up as with petroleum pakistan has no choice but to import these essential products despite efforts for import substitution through local production pakistan s oilseed production has declined production of cotton hence cottonseed has been falling over the years moreover due to competition from major crops ie wheat and sugarcane which are provided guaranteed support prices by the government there has not been any shift to oilseed production even before the price escalation in these commodities inflation in pakistan has been high throughout the last three years it reached a record high of 13 in january 2022 if the war prolongs and the commodity prices escalate further we may soon see hyperinflation engulfing the country besides bringing misery to the people higher inflation in pakistan compared to other competing countries is further eroding our competitiveness and exports pakistan may soon face fuel food and financial crises with all these difficulties sri lanka is currently going through this crunch huge crowds have been protesting against shortages and the government s incompetence in handling them let s hope we can avoid such a situation our best hope should be for an early end to the ukraine crisis and the world regaining some normality the writer has served as pakistan s ambassador to wto and fao s representative to the united nations at geneva
reports of my death have been vastly exaggerated said mark twain more than a hundred years ago i am reminded of it because ever since the west started the sanctions on russia there has been a torrent of articles predicting the collapse of the post second world war international order devised and supervised by the west led by the us the argument goes that the sanctions are causing a lot of collateral damage which will weaken pax americana as countries question the us decisions that hurt them this presumes that the americans haven t thought it all through really and is

by michael snyder food prices in the u s have already been soaring and now we are on track for an absolutely horrible winter wheat harvest of course this comes at a time when the war on the other side of the globe is going to greatly reduce wheat exports from russia and ukraine over the last 12 months the price of wheat has already risen 69 percent and now this crisis threatens to go to an entirely new level in all my years of writing i have never seen anything like this and i am deeply concerned about what the months ahead will bring due to extreme drought winter wheat is in very bad shape in states such as kansas oklahoma and texas the following comes from one of the most prominent agricultural websites in the entire country some farmers in southwestern kansas the top u s wheat producing state have not received much measurable rain or snow since october winter wheat is planted in autumn lays dormant in winter and begins sending up green shoots in spring proper soil moisture is critical at this stage for the crop to thrive more than half of kansas was classified as under severe drought or worse as of march 8 the driest conditions since 2018 according to the national drought mitigation center severe drought is also covering three quarters of oklahoma and more than two thirds of texas both of which also are large wheat producers if that sounds really bad that is because it is really bad farmers are praying for rain because they desperately need it that same article also discussed the fact that winter wheat was severely damaged by a wind storm that brought dust bowl conditions to kansas the coming weeks will be critical for the southern plains wheat crop said lucas haag extension agronomist at kansas state university many farmers apply fertilizer to maximize crop potential but moisture is needed to carry nutrients to plant roots he said wheat plants damaged by the december wind storm that brought dust bowl conditions to kansas face additional drought problems because plants have been weakened either by the sand blast effect of blowing dust and dirt or by soil nutrient loss from the 100 mph 161 kph winds how many years have i been warning that dust bowl conditions would return to the middle of the country now it has happened and forecasters are telling us that abnormally dry conditions will likely continue across much of the nation for the foreseeable future abnormally dry to exceptional drought conditions are expected to persist across 60 of the continental u s as spring in the northern hemisphere begins forecasters expect little to no rain for certain parts of the western u s through june from april to june above average temperatures are expected from southwest to the east coast and north through the midwest according to a new outlook published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa s map shows a greater than 50 chance of drought persistence for nearly 60 of the continental u s we have been witnessing very strange weather patterns all over the globe in recent months and that is one of the reasons why major agricultural commodity prices have been spiking dramatically over the past year wheat prices are up 69 percent among other major food exports of russia and ukraine corn prices are up 36 percent and barley 82 percent now war in ukraine has created an immense supply shock and this is going to have ripple effects that are felt all across the planet ukraine is normally one of the key breadbaskets of the world but now the invasion has changed everything we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us ukraine s top agricultural export products are corn and wheat before the invasion ukraine was the second largest supplier of grains for the european union and one of the largest suppliers for emerging markets in asia and africa breaking down the numbers ukraine produced 49 6 of global sunflower oil 10 of global wheat 12 6 of global barley and 15 3 of global maize collectively russia and ukraine typically account for a very large chunk of all global agricultural exports for the global food market there are few worse countries to be in conflict than russia and ukraine over the past five years they have together accounted for nearly 30 percent of the exports of the world s wheat 17 percent of corn 32 percent of barley a crucial source of animal feed and 75 percent of sunflower seed oil an important cooking oil in some parts of the world so what are we going to do now i haven t found a single person that has a reasonable solution to that question when it comes to wheat there are a whole bunch of countries that usually get most of their wheat from russia and ukraine armenia mongolia kazakhstan and eritrea have imported virtually all of their wheat from russia and ukraine and must find new sources but they are competing against much larger buyers including turkey egypt bangladesh and iran which have obtained more than 60 percent of their wheat from the two warring countries what are they supposed to do due to an unprecedented spike in the price of fertilizer the outlook for global agricultural production was already extremely grim before the war erupted and now we truly are staring into an abyss those that have been following my articles on a regular basis already know that global hunger has been escalating rapidly over the past few years and one un official just admitted that this crisis is now reaching a crescendo for the last three years global rates of hunger and famine have been on the rise with the russian invasion we are now facing the risk of imminent famine and starvation in more places around the world fakhri said in a statement read that part about imminent famine and starvation again in other words there isn t going to be nearly enough food for everyone this is exactly what we have been warned about and we will soon see the global price of food reach heights that would have once been unimaginable in light of these developments i am encouraging all of my readers to take action stock up while food prices are still relatively stable because it looks like things are about to start getting really crazy
a video circulated on china s social media showed that local authorities in weifang shandong province ordered peasants to remove trees to make the land available for grain production this comes as many in china fear food shortages will soon become a serious problem in the video a peasant who recorded it as a selfie said we just received a notice that we are required to cut down these trees and grow grains instead even if financially it ends up being a loss commodity prices are so high nowadays fertilizers pesticides and prices are ridiculously high in the background many trees had already been chopped down some with roots exposed other peasants had removed a large area of mature trees at the same time a speaker in the village was making an announcement saying that trees are not allowed to be planted in farmland and land cannot be used for fish ponds or fruit trees the trees must be cut down within a limited timeframe otherwise they will be forcibly killed by the authorities then another man who identified himself as a man in jining shandong province said that local authorities forced them to remove trees to grow crops as china is having a food shortage crisis chainsaws for cutting trees are now out of stock at local stores in the past we were told if you want to get rich first of all plant some trees now they told us we are forbidden to plant trees the man said a local government official in the province told the chinese language epoch times even fish ponds must be filled to grow crops anyway you have to do what the chinese communist party requires you to do japan based current affairs commentator yang si pointed out that most soil in shandong province is yellow soil and the area is prone to drought removal of trees can easily lead to soil erosion moreover the land where the trees had stood will have to get a more than average amount of fertilizers and pesticides to be able to produce a good harvest he said peasants will have a hard time making any profit due to the increasing costs of fertilizers and pesticides yang explained file photo of a farm in ningxia province china china photos getty images impact of war the russian ukrainian war also impacted china s food imports in a march 17 article china s feed industry information network reported that due to the war russia has suspended grain exports such as wheat and corn while ukraine has banned the export of wheat and bulk commodities the article also admitted that china s self sufficiency rate in grains corn and soybeans is relatively low by 2021 ukraine replaced the united states to become china s largest supplier of corn partially because of the u s china trade war according to chinese customs data 70 percent of china s corn imports came from ukraine in 2021 ukraine is also china s main supplier of barley some 54 percent of ukraine s barley exports were sold to china from 2020 to 2021 accounting for 28 percent of china s total barley imports according to data from china s general administration of customs the country imported a total of 164 539 million tons of grain in 2021 a year on year increase of 18 1 percent the imports accounted for 24 1 percent of the total grain output of 682 85 million tons this means that china s dependence on foreign crop imports is as high as 19 4 percent a worker next to a machine transporting newly harvested paddy grains to a storage warehouse in yangzhou jiangsu province china on oct 25 2019 stringer reuters xue chi a scholar on china issues told the epoch times that china s food crisis is deeply rooted in the chinese communist party s ccp incompetent governance the ccp has never successfully established a modern agricultural production system its agriculture development is far behind its industrial development xue said not only is its agriculture industry unable to compete with developed countries it cannot even meet the domestic demand this is caused by the ccp system he said zhang sutian a u s based independent commentator with 20 years of experience in the food industry told the epoch times that the ccp s fraud and corruption are the main drivers of the food crisis in china many grain depots are actually empty due to corruption he said but the situation has been covered up a problem that is getting more and more serious year after year zhang pointed to a previous incident when the central commission for discipline inspection dispatched a team to inspect the china grain reserves for the first time in may 2013 soon after 78 grain depots directly under china grain reserves in heilongjiang province caught on fire china s grain reserves are equivalent to a huge bad debt with too many interest groups involved zhang said xue believes that historically natural disasters pandemics and famines have often been intertwined and this time there is no exception on top of that due to the ccp s deception fraud and all kinds of messy conducts the food crisis in today s china is among the

the rules based international order as in our way or the highway is unraveling much faster than anyone could have predicted the rules based international order as in our way or the highway is unraveling much faster than anyone could have predicted the eurasia economic union eaeu and china are starting to design a new monetary and financial system bypassing the u s dollar supervised by sergei glazyev and intended to compete with the bretton woods system saudi arabia perpetrator of bombing famine and genocide in yemen weaponized by u s uk and eu is advancing the coming of the petroyuan india third largest importer of oil in the world is about to sign a mega contract to buy oil from russia with a huge discount and using a ruble rupee mechanism riyadh s oil exports amount to roughly 170 billion a year china buys 17 of it compared to 21 for japan 15 for the u s 12 for india and roughly 10 for the eu the u s and its vassals japan south korea eu will remain within the petrodollar sphere india just like china may not sanction blowback is on the offense even a market casino capitalism darling such as uber nerd credit suisse strategist zoltan poznar formerly with the ny fed imf and treasury dept has been forced to admit in an analytical note if you think that the west can develop sanctions that will maximize the pain for russia by minimizing the risks of financial stability and price stability for the west then you can also trust unicorns unicorns are a trademark of the massive natostan psyops apparatus lavishly illustrated by the staged completely fake summit in kiev between comedian ze and the prime ministers of poland slovenia and the czech republic thoroughly debunked by john helmer and polish sources poznar a realist hinted in fact at the ritual burial of the financial chapter of the rules based international order in place since the early cold war years after the end of this war money will never be the same especially when the hegemon demonstrates its rules by encroaching on other people s money and that configures the central tenet of 21st century martial geopolitics as monetary ideological the world especially the global south will have to decide whether money is represented by the virtual turbo charged casino privileged by the americans or by real tangible assets such as energy sources a bipolar financial world u s dollar vs yuan is at hand there s no surefire evidence yet but the kremlin may have certainly gamed that by using russia s foreign reserves as bait likely to be frozen by sanctions the end result could be the smashing of the petrodollar after all the overwhelming majority of the global south by now has fully understood that the backed by nothing u s dollar as money according to poznar is absolutely untrustworthy if that s the case talk about a putin ippon from hell it s gold robbery time as i outlined the emergence of the new paradigm from the new monetary system to be designed by a cooperation between the eaeu and china to the advent of the petroyuan a serious informed discussion erupted about a crucial part of the puzzle the fate of the russian gold reserves doubts swirled around the russian central bank s arguably suicidal policy of keeping assets in foreign securities or in banks vulnerable to western sanctions of course there s always the possibility moscow calculated that nations holding russian reserves such as germany and france have assets in russia that can be easily nationalized and that the total debt of the state plus russian companies even exceeds the amount of frozen reserves but what about the gold as of february 1 three weeks before the start of operation z the russian central bank held 630 2 billion in reserves almost half 311 2 billion were placed in foreign securities and a quarter 151 9 billion on deposits with foreign commercial and central banks not exactly a brilliant strategy as of june last year strategic partner china held 13 8 of russia s reserves in gold and foreign currency as for the physical gold 132 2 billion 21 of total reserves remains in vaults in moscow two thirds and st petersburg one third so no russian gold has been frozen well it s complicated the key problem is that more than 75 of russian central bank reserves are in foreign currency half of these are securities like government bonds they never leave the nation that issued them roughly 25 of the reserves are linked to foreign banks mostly private as well as the bis and the imf once again it s essential to remember sergei glazyev in his groundbreaking essay sanctions and sovereignty it is necessary to complete the de dollarization of our foreign exchange reserves replacing the dollar euro and pound with gold in the current conditions of the expected explosive growth in the price of gold its mass export abroad is akin to treason and it is high time for the regulator to stop it this is a powerful indictment of the russian central bank which was borrowing against gold and exporting it for all practical purposes the central bank could be accused of perpetrating an inside job and subsequently they were caught flat footed by the devastating american sanctions as a moscow analyst puts it the central bank had delivered some volumes of gold to london in 2020 2021 this decision was motivated by a high price of gold at that time near 2000 per ounce and could hardly be initiated by putin if so this decision can be qualified as very stupid or even part of a diversionist tactic most of the gold delivered to london was not stored but sold and transferred into foreign currency reserves in euro or pounds which were frozen later no wonder a lot of people in russia are livid a quick flashback is in order in june last year putin signed a law canceling requirements for the repatriation of foreign exchange earnings from gold exports five months later russia s gold miners were exporting like crazy a month later the duma wanted to know why the central bank had stopped buying gold no wonder russia media erupted with accusations of an unprecedented robbery now it s way more dramatic ria novosti described the american dictated freeze as what else a robbery and duly predicted global economic chaos as for the central bank it s back on the gold buying business none of the above though explains some missing gold that de facto is not under the possession of the russian central bank and that s where a somewhat shady character such as herman gref comes in let s check this out with state duma deputy mikhail delyagin who had a few things to say about the gold exported to london bonanza this process has been going on for the past year exported according to some estimates 600 tons nabiullina said whoever wants to sell gold to get cash or if you mine gold and trade it keep in mind that the state in my person will not buy gold from you at a market price we will take it at a big discount if you want to get honest money for it please export it the world center of gold trading is london accordingly everyone began to export and sell gold there including mr gref the head of the formally state owned sberbank sold a huge part of his gold reserves look here for fascinating details about sberbank s gref shenanigans watch for the gold backed ruble it may be a case of too little too late but at least the kremlin has now established a committee with authority over the central bank nerds to handle the serious stuff it boggles the mind that the russian central bank does not answer to the russian constitution as well as to the judicial system but in fact is subordinated to the imf a case can be made that this cartel designed financial system implying zero sovereignty simply cannot be tackled head on by any nation on the planet and putin has been trying to undermine it step by step that includes of course keeping elvira nabiullina on the job even as she duly follows the washington consensus to the letter and that brings us back to the ultra high stakes possibility that the kremlin may have wanted from the start to go no holds barred forcing the atlanticists to reveal their true hand and exposing their system in a the king is naked spectacular for a worldwide audience and that s where the eaeu china new monetary financial system comes in under glazyev supervision we can certainly envision russia china and vast swathes of eurasia progressively divorcing from casino capitalism the ruble reconverted to a gold backed currency and russia focused on self sufficiency productive domestic investment and trade connectivity with most of the global south way beyond its confiscated foreign reserves and tons of gold sold in london what matters is that russia remains the ultimate natural resource powerhouse shortages a little austerity for a little while will take care of it nothing as dramatic as the national impoverishment under the neoliberal 1990s and extra boost would come from exporting natural resources at premium discount prices to other brics and most of eurasia and the global south the collective west has just fabricated a new tawdry east west divide russia is turning it upside down to its own profit after all the multipolar world is rising in the east the empire of lies won t back down because it does not have a plan b plan a is to cancel russia across the western spectrum so what russophobia racism 24 7 psyops propaganda overdrive cancel culture online mobs that don t mean a thing facts matter the bear has enough nuclear hypersonic hardware to shatter nato in a few minutes before breakfast and teach a lesson to the collective west before pre dinner cocktails there will come a time when some exceptionalist with a decent iq will finally understand the meaning of indivisibility of security the views of individual contributors do not necessarily represent those of the strategic culture foundation
