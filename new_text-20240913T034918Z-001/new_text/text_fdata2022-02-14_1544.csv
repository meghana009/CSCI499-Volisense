after a stellar run during the so called reopening trade from late 2020 the small cap sector has turned into a major laggard in 2022 the sector s popular benchmark the russell 2000 index has tanked 9 7 in the year to date compared with a milder 3 8 decline by the s p 500 with a cross section of analysts such as j p morgan warning that this isn t just a stock market correction but a full bodied bear market the small fry stock trade fizzled by q2 of 2021 as inflation began to bite into corporate margins and the federal reserve bank became more hawkish client conversations have recently focused on the dramatic underperformance of the russell 2000 small cap index small cap firms generally have weaker balance sheets lower profit margins and less market power all of which make them highly sensitive to economic growth environments writes goldman sachs chief u s equity strategist in a client note jpm strategist marko kolanovic has recommended buying the dip saying small caps nysearca iwm and cyclicals nysearca xli nysearca xle nysearca xlf nysearca xlb nysearca xly offer buying opportunities goldman s david j kostin is less sanguine about small cap prospects saying tightening financial conditions slowing growth and a flattening yield curve will continue to pressure russell 2000 returns relative to the s p 500 nevertheless kostin has not written off the entire universe of small caps and recommends buying small caps that can demonstrate strong growth high profit margins and undemanding valuations kostin s top small cap picks are marathon digital holdings

tivity health nasdaq tvty and sun country airlines nasdaq sncy here are our top small cap oil and gas picks 1 northern oil and gas market cap 1 8b ytd returns 12 2 minnetonka minnesota based northern oil and gas inc nyse nog is an independent energy company that engages in the acquisition exploration exploitation development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties in the united states nog has a rather unique modus operandi in that it invests in oil producing properties acting as a financial partner to exploration and production names the company has more than 6 000 gross producing wells primarily in the bakken nog stock ever since the company announced that it had agreed in 2020 to acquire its first non operating interest in the delaware basin in a 12m deal that piece of news would have hardly turned heads if the buyer was an exxon or a chevron the fact that a financial distressed company with more than a billion dollars in long term debt and a high debt to equity ratio made such a bold move still deep in the throes of the crisis means that nog really believed that an oil price rebound remained firmly in the cards in which case its latest purchase could end up being a massive bargain further nog upped its production guidance the ongoing oil price rally has vindicated the company s decision further nog s marcellus shale acquisition is expected to return an average 18 fcf yield on the investment making the shares appear deeply undervalued despite the recent run last year northern oil and gas announced it acquired reliance marcellus llc s non operated interest in appalachia natural gas assets according to the company the acquisition will generate 125 million of free cash flow over the next four years with an average 18 fcf yield on the investment

primarily holds interests in alberta cardium light oil plays in wilson creek pembina alder flats and garrington and lochend areas in alberta it also owns viking light oil resource plays in redwater in alberta although tamarack s debt has surged after making several accretive acquisitions it could come down by nearly 50 with the current high level energy prices last year tamarack valley energy

nyse cpg explores develops and produces light and medium crude oil and natural gas reserves in western canada and the united states the company s crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets are located in the provinces of saskatchewan alberta british columbia and manitoba crescent point shares once traded above 45 per share and even paid out a generous dividend compared to the current 5 15 share price unfortunately the 2014 oil price meltdown left the company battling plunging cash flows and high debt levels that forced the company to heavily trim dividends and the shares have never fully recovered even after this year s 120 gain crescent point shares are trading 80 below 2014 levels thankfully the ongoing oil price rally has allowed crescent point to start generating healthy cash flows and make several strategic acquisitions that said this stock is likely to remain volatile and any setbacks in the near future could send the shares crashing again 4 ring energy market cap 278m ytd returns 23 7 ring energy inc nyse rei is an exploration and production company that engages in the acquisition exploration development and production of oil and natural gas in texas and new mexico advertisement as of december 31 2020 the company proved reserves consisted of approximately 76 5 million barrels of oil equivalent boe as well as interests in 45 000 net developed

entered into a purchase and sale agreement on its delaware basin acreage consisting of approximately 20 000 net acres with a sale price of 31 5 million the company has received a 500 000 non refundable deposit and had received 5 5 million in non refundable deposits or 17 of the original purchase price by the time the deal fell through in october 2020 the considerable non refundable deposits that ring energy received painted it in a good light by proving the value of its assets to shareholders the company is also likely to receive considerably more for the same asset in the future given that oil prices have climbed more than 30 since then 5 pdc energy market cap 5 8b ytd returns 24 1 last year j p morgan picked seven narratives playing out in oil and gas e ps one of j p morgan s fall playbook for oil and gas exploration and production companies are those with the highest potential return of significant levels of free cash flow to equity holders rather than merely using it for reducing debt as most oil and gas companies have done this year indeed jpm says that since the end of 2020 companies in the firm s coverage group have cut net debt by 9 65 billion through balance sheets of june 30 pdc energy nasdaq pdce is one such company that has announced cash return strategies beyond normal dividends pdc energy is an independent exploration and production company that produces crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids in the united states the company s operations are primarily located in the wattenberg field in colorado and the delaware basin in texas as of december 31 2020 it owned interests in approximately 3 727 productive gross wells jpm also favors pdce as a top pick because we think that the current price environment remains a sweet spot with demand gradually recovering from covid 19 and the opec shale market share war remaining fairly subdued largely driven by public company shale discipline by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads

with rising inflation taking hold across the globe stock markets will continue to be affected by inflationary pressures photo andrew kelly reuters global stock markets have had a rollercoaster ride since the outbreak of covid 19 two years ago from the crash in march 2020 when the world went into lockdown to a stellar tech rally and from a meme stock frenzy to the reopening of the economy as the world moves back to some form of normality there are a number of themes that may counteract a positive return aegon asset management has highlighted four challenges for performance in the equity markets in 2022 inflation uk inflation soared to a 30 year high of 5 4 in the year to december thanks to rising energy costs strong demand for goods and services and ongoing supply chain disruption meanwhile the consumer prices index in the eurozone rose at an annual rate of 5 1 in january compared with 5 in december according to eurostat the european union s statistics office in addition to this it was revealed on thursday that us consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since the early 1980s household prices were up 7 5 in the 12 months to january according to data from the labour department watch what is inflation and why is it important with rising inflation taking hold across the globe stock markets will continue to be affected by inflationary pressures inflation is expected to remain high for the next few months and then decline into year end the european central bank ecb has constantly reiterated the belief that current inflation hikes are only temporary however inflation remains an uncertainty and markets hate uncertainty many of the pressures that allowed inflation to rise sharply could ease in the coming quarters particularly as consumers move from goods to services the surprise to the market could be that inflation recedes quicker than expected stephen jones global cio multi assets solutions and equities at aegon asset management said read more uk economy posts fastest growth since second world war central bank decisions central banks across the globe are tightening monetary policy and hiking interest rates in a bid to combat inflation and the rising cost of living this is set to remain a major theme for financial markets over this year this month the bank of england boe doubled uk interest rates to 0 5 after it put rates up in december from record lows of 0 1 to 0 25 it was the second increase since the start of the pandemic and marked the first back to back hike since 2004 the bank also predicted that households were set to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago due to this it is expected that threadneedle street will tighten monetary policy again in the near future with strong price pressures and further rises in inflation over the coming months a near certainty traders are betting on at least one 50 basis point increase by may which would take the base rate to 1 watch will interest rates stay low forever jesús cabra guisasola senior associate at validus risk management said the case for another rate hike from the boe in march is already priced in by most market participants nevertheless it will be important to observe by how much given there were four policymakers who wanted to act faster and voted for a 50bps hike during the february meeting to curb inflation expectations meanwhile a bigger than expected jump in us inflation in january has fanned expectations that the federal reserve will embark on a more aggressive campaign of monetary tightening key for investors will be how aggressively the us federal reserve tightens policy over the course of 2022 jones said post the most recent federal reserve meeting there is a reasonable probability of seven rate hikes this year as well as quantitative tightening although this remains fluid global economic growth global growth is expected to decelerate in 2022 from 5 5 to 4 1 according to the world bank due to the continued disruption caused by covid 19 as well as supply bottlenecks last month the international monetary fund imf also warned that the global economy is entering 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected as it downgraded its outlook largely due to slower recoveries in the united states and china read more european stock markets slide despite uk economy posting strong growth although the global economy should continue to slowly rebound as the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic the pace of the expansion will differ by country and industry equity markets have already seen the tech sector grow at pace in the last few years while sectors such as travel leisure retail and hospitality suffered amid covid strains lockdowns and various restrictions the easing of supply chain disruptions will also have an effect on equity markets this year aegon asset management said production should be supported by employees returning to the workforce and this should help ease supply chain bottlenecks however governments played a major role in supporting demand over the last couple of years and the removal of this support will likely cause the pace of economic growth to ease geopolitical risks imf first deputy managing director gita gopinath warned in january that rising geopolitical tensions and social unrest also pose risks to the outlook a potential invasion of ukraine by russia would hit a number of markets including energy prices such as natural gas and oil grains and wheat the region s sovereign dollar bonds and stock markets although tensions between the two countries are likely to be a slow burn and not a full blown conflict the risks are on the rise read more energy prices could rise further because of opec failures warns iea russia has repeatedly denied any plans to invade ukraine despite having more than 100 000 troops near the border while it has begun military drills with neighbouring belarus ukraine has also accused russia of blocking its access to the sea if this risk abates this will remove an uncertainty for the markets which would ease investors concerns stephen jones of aegon asset management said our base case remains on no significant escalation in eastern ukraine in the near term but expect tensions to continue as troops and equipment continue to be moved ultimately the cost might be too high and the reward too doubtful for russia to launch a full blown invasion watch does sunak s stance on inflation crisis lay bare a leadership ambition

composite image with background photo by oleksandr filon istock getty images plus overlay stock photo st george news st george a washington city man is in jail on multiple first degree felony charges following an incident involving the alleged recovery of marijuana from a vehicle with juveniles in the car at the time of the arrest the suspect also had two open felony cases one of which was a 14 000 theft from a local car sales business the first case involves an incident that took place on friday when an officer was out on patrol on south bluff street shortly after midnight and noticed a vehicle stopped at the gas pumps of a convenience store located near the intersection of bluff and main street that belonged to a person who had a number of outstanding warrants according to charging documents filed with the court the officer ordered the driver out of the car which is when the officer noted there were four juvenile occupants also inside of the vehicle that were between the ages of 12 15 with another juvenile approaching the car all occupants were ordered out of the car and the officer had each of the youths contact their parents to come and pick them up the report also states a glass pipe reportedly fell out of the car as the occupants exited which also had a strong odor of burnt marijuana the report said meanwhile the car s owner later identified as 21 year old jessie mario angel clark arrived on scene and while speaking with officers the suspect allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana with one of the juveniles before adding the youths may have taken some of the marijuana from his house prior to the stop officers also had previous interactions with clark and reportedly knew him to frequently carry a firearm and when asked the suspect told police he didn t have a gun with him that he left them at home the officer also noted the suspect admitted to having marijuana without a medical marijuana card which made him a firearm restricted person additionally during the interview clark said he had purchased the glass bong from a shop in nevada along with the marijuana reportedly found inside a witness told officers the juveniles were allegedly known to frequent the suspect s residence where alcohol and marijuana were left out in the open the report also states that officers determined clark had allegedly left the marijuana and the pipe in the car where kids could access it the officer noted clark was arrested and the vehicle was searched officers recovered multiple marijuana related items during a search of his vehicle along with an oval pill that turned out to be hydrocodone the officer also noted the suspect deliberately gave 4 juveniles illegally possessed drugs and allowed them to leave with them officers then executed a search warrant on the suspect s residence where they recovered a shotgun from the closet of the suspect s bedroom along with ammunition and multiple thc cartridges still in the packaging in the top dresser drawer they located a large scale along with a notebook appeared to be a ledger outlining what he was purchasing as well as potential profits leading officers to believe the suspect was dealing in primarily thc cartridges edibles and electronic cigarettes containing thc items reportedly purchased from a dispensary in nevada according to the report similar controlled substances were also recovered from a juvenile s room located inside of the home where police say the smoke alarm had been removed the suspect was transported to purgatory correctional facility facing five first degree felony counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in a drug free zone along with five third degree felony counts of causing or permitting a child to be exposed to a controlled substance clark also faces a third degree felony charge of possession of a firearm by a restricted person additionally officers ran a check on the suspect that revealed two open cases still active in the courts including a case filed in connection with a disorderly call reported on jan 21 when uintah county deputies responded to a disorderly call in progress near a residence in gusher the call came into emergency dispatch from a woman reporting that a man later identified as clark went onto her property and attempted to start a physical altercation with one of the residents charging documents also stated that responding officers were also advised there may have been a knife involved two of the witnesses at the scene told officers they recognized the suspect as clark one of the men said he was at home finishing his lunch when the suspect started yelling at him so he ignored clark as he continued across the street to return to work clark then ran over to where he was working with a knife clark continued pacing acing back and forth on the edge of the property accusing the man of saying something to him and the party also told officers the suspect was welding the knife as he threatened to stab him multiple times a witness also told deputies the suspect continued yelling at the man telling him he was going to kill him which is when the reporting party took the knife from clark that was later recovered by police officers located the suspect a short while later at his residence and he was arrested and booked into uintah county jail on third degree felony aggravated assault another pending case was filed in washington county following an investigation into a theft reported nearly two months earlier at an automobile dealership in st george according to charging documents filed in that case an employee of the dealership told authorities that back in november clark had gone to a large car dealership where he purchased a mustang for more than 18 100 which he reportedly paid for by check the check bounced a few days later as did the second check the suspect provided in december in the meantime clark went into another local car dealership to sell the car telling the employee he wanted to sell his car immediately that same day according to the report after providing the title and then signing the agreement stating he owned the vehicle the car salesperson gave him a check for 14 000 which the suspect cashed that same day on dec 7 the following day the car dealership where the mustang was sold contacted the car lot that bought the vehicle since both checks had bounced at which point the mustang was returned to the dealership the car was purchased from the car lot that was out the 14 000 attempted to make arrangements with clark to pay the money back however the report states he never showed up the employee also told police the suspect reportedly told the the employee that he knew the checks he had written to purchase the car were bouncing and also said he would come into the dealership to make things right by paying the 14 000 back when the suspect failed to do so the dealership called the police during an interview clark denied knowing that the second check to the dealership had bounced and even when asked how the suspect would not know if that much money left his account or not clark reportedly stated he would notice if 18 000 left his account or not which police say contradicted his initial statement the suspect also told officers he had tried to make arrangements to pay the car sales lot back but claimed the owner had threatened to cause him physical harm so he never returned to the lot when officers returned to the car sales lot they read the text messages sent between the employee and clark which did not include any physical threat just a comment of urgency that he needed to make right the situation and would call police if he did not the suspect was charged with second degree felony count of theft by deception and arrested shortly thereafter that case is still working its way through the courts as well following the arrest on friday the suspect remains in custody without bail this report is based on information provided by law

new york rising inflation in the united states and around the world is forcing investors to assess the likely effects on both risky assets generally stocks and safe assets such as us treasury bonds the traditional investment advice is to allocate wealth according to the 60 40 rule 60 per cent of one s portfolio should be in higher return but more volatile stocks and 40 per cent should be in lower return lower volatility bonds the rationale is that stocks and bond prices are usually negatively correlated when one goes up the other goes down so this mix will balance a portfolio s risks and returns during a risk on period when investors are optimistic stock prices and bond yields will rise and bond prices will fall resulting in a market loss for bonds and during a risk off period when investors are pessimistic prices and yields will follow an inverse pattern similarly when the economy is booming stock prices and bond yields tend to rise while bond prices fall whereas in a recession the reverse is true but the negative correlation between stock and bond prices presupposes low inflation when inflation rises returns on bonds become negative because rising yields led by higher inflation expectations will reduce their market price consider that any 100 basis point increase in long term bond yields leads to a 10 per cent fall in the market price a sharp loss owing to higher inflation and inflation expectations bond yields have risen and the overall return on long bonds reached 5 per cent in 2021 over the past three decades bonds have offered a negative overall yearly return only a few times the decline of inflation rates from double digit levels to very low single digits produced a long bull market in bonds yields fell and returns on bonds were highly positive as their price rose the past 30 years thus have contrasted sharply with the stagflationary 1970s when bond yields skyrocketed alongside higher inflation leading to massive market losses for bonds but inflation is also bad for stocks because it triggers higher interest rates both in nominal and real terms thus as inflation rises the correlation between stock and bond prices turns from negative to positive higher inflation leads to losses on both stocks and bonds as happened in the 1970s by 1982 the s p 500 price to earnings ratio was eight whereas today it is above 30 more recent examples also show that equities are hurt when bond yields rise in response to higher inflation or the expectation that higher inflation will lead to monetary policy tightening even most of the much touted tech and growth stocks aren t immune to an increase in long term interest rates because these are long duration assets whose dividends lie further in the future making them more sensitive to a higher discount factor long term bond yields in september 2021 when ten year treasury yields rose a mere 22 basis points stocks fell by 5 7 per cent and the fall was greater in the tech heavy nasdaq than in the s p 500 this pattern has extended into 2022 a modest 30 basis point increase in bond yields has triggered a correction when total market capitalisation falls by at least 10 per cent in the nasdaq and a near correction in the s p 500 if inflation were to remain well above the us federal reserve s target rate of 2 per cent even if it falls modestly from its current high levels long term bond yields would go much higher and equity prices could end up in bear country a fall of 20 per cent or more more to the point if inflation continues to be higher than it was over the past few decades the great moderation a 60 40 portfolio would induce massive losses the task for investors then is to figure out another way to hedge the 40 per cent of their portfolio that is in bonds there are at least three options for hedging the fixed income component of a 60 40 portfolio the first is to invest in inflation indexed bonds or in short term government bonds whose yields reprice rapidly in response to higher inflation the second option is to invest in gold and other precious metals whose prices tend to rise when inflation is higher gold is also a good hedge against the kinds of political and geopolitical risksthat may hit the world in the next few years lastly one can invest in real assets with a relatively limited supply such as land real estate and infrastructure the optimal combination of short term bonds gold and real estate will change over time and in complex ways depending on macro policy and market conditions yes some analysts argue that oil and energy together with some other commodities can also be a good hedge against inflation but this issue is complex in the 1970s it was higher oil prices that caused inflation not the other way around and given the current pressure to move away from oil and fossil fuels demand in those sectors may soon reach a peak while the right portfolio mix can be debated this much is clear sovereign wealth funds pension funds endowments foundations family offices and individuals following the 60 40 rule should start to think about diversifying their holdings to hedge against rising inflation nouriel roubini professor emeritus at new york university s stern school of business is chief economist at atlas capital team an asset management and fintech firm specializing in hedging against inflation and other tail risks copyright

startup sees first florida launch end in heartbreak and loss of 4 satellites poseidon is 4 satellites richer following an unsuccessful rocket launch from up and coming space company astra the launch was the first time for the company operating out of cape canaveral florida and was expected to be a landmark occasion announcing their entry into the east coast space race rocket 3 was carrying 4 satellites from the nasa elana 41 mission on a trip cut far too short shortly after the 1st stage disengaged from the rocket rocket 3 appeared to fall out of its previous trajectory as the cameras on the ground showed a small dot from the camera aboard the rocket the second stage was shown to ignite and almost immediately tumble end over end recording for a few seconds before cutting out entirely the satellites included are of course unrecoverable lost somewhere in the sea the first of the losses was the bama 1 cubesat by the university of alabama which was testing a drag sail meant to evaluate a deorbit accessory for end of life satellite termination the second was new mexico state university s ionospheric neutron content analyzer a satellite that would have studied the neutron spectrum in low orbit the third was the qubesat from uc berkeley it would have tested the effects of space on quantum gyroscopes lastly the r5 s1 satellite from the johnson space center was a cheap technology demonstrator designed to evaluate certain equipment for further use testing out better hardware improved transmission capability and improved software astra has not released their statement yet and what exactly went wrong remains to be seen the failure follows another no go from a week previous when rocket 3 scrubbed the second attempted launch only 50 minutes into the short 3 hour launch window astra stood down that day with ceo and founder chris kemp saying that out of an abundance of caution we are giving the team time to complete a more complete review of the data under the tweet a plethora of detectives began dissecting every bit of media available from the launch one noted the on board camera catching a brief weight shift that they surmise was an unsecured element either payload or equipment they noted the shift happening just after the cutoff of the 1st stage which was then followed by the 2nd stage rotation just before its ignition other theories included the possibility of moisture buildup around the explosive bolts caused by the wait time in the humid florida atmosphere the explosive bolts being iced over could have led to a failure during stage separation which would account for the tumble if the rocket was subjected to asymmetric thrust unfortunately for the small startup failure in all its forms is punished quite harshly by the market over the last week astra stock tumbled from around 5 29 on february 9th to 3 28 2 days later the ceo s apology tweet became a battlefield for earnest space enthusiasts accepting the difficulty of making rockets from scratch and angry day traders smarting from their wounds i ve now lost 120 000 investing in astra said one investor i feel they entered the public trading market far too soon and people like me have suffered i know it s my fault for not understanding spaceflight so i am not blaming astra others echoed the sentiment the most unlucky astra buyers being those who bought in at 19 55 in february 2021 many remain optimistic noting the growing pains inherent to every space venture ideally the lessons learned from rocket 3 will prevent future occurrence of a repeat failure and astra seems set on acing the next one
esther howland was 20 years old when she started working at her father s stationery store on summer street in worcester massachusetts it was 1848 and the burgeoning community had just been incorporated as a city according to worcesterhistory org howland had graduated from mount holyoke college the year before about 52 miles west a note decorated in victorian style lace and ornamentation arrived in the mail from england it was a valentine greeting from her father s colleague the card left an indelible impression on the young woman she got some paper and set out to recreate the card that had been sent to her dad throughout the next year howland formed a business dedicated to creating valentine s day greeting cards and hired a team of women to cut lace trim hearts and stencil flowers the washington post reports howland was soon turning out thousands of valentines to meet demand she later incorporated her business sold it for a profit to george c whitney and made a name for herself among the few female entrepreneurs at the time the post writes though howland never married her cards helped ignite the romantic sparks for countless lovers at a time when valentine s day was becoming increasingly popular a tradition of exchanging cards every feb 14 had begun and over time she became known as the mother of the valentine the tradition of exchanging valentines began in the 1600s but the origins of the holiday date back much farther 1 500 years to be exact the man who inspired it was a third century roman priest known as st valentine a rendering of what st valentine may have looked like history com who was st valentine as a priest valentine would often perform secret marriages for couples because the reigning emperor at the time outlawed marriage the emperor wanted soldiers in his army and he figured married men would be distracted so he made the practice of matrimony illegal eventually valentine s secret marriage ceremonies were discovered the emperor sentenced him to death and put him in jail while in jail valentine fell in love with a woman who happened to be his jailor s daughter she would visit him on a regular basis and send him love letters prior to his death valentine had written a letter to this woman affectionately signed from your valentine this greeting would forever establish him as one of the most romantic figures in history which is why valentine s day is a day of romance christians would later name valentine a saint the fact that valentine s day falls on february 14 is also significant it happens to be the day valentine was executed it was also the date of an old pagan fertility festival in which a group of priests would get together and sacrifice a goat in case you didn t know a goat was believed to symbolize fertility the roman priests would take the hide of the goat shave it into small strips and slap their women around with them no joke the women considered this a special honor because it meant the following year would be more fertile for them and as we all know nothing says i love you like a good slap across the face on that note happy valentine s day on monday

listed companies covered by brokers in the fnarena database graincorp had the largest percentage gain in target price after the guidance range for fy22 earnings and profit were beats of 28 44 and 40 67 respectively versus the ubs forecast ranges the company is experiencing increasing demand and prices for australian grain during a period of supply challenges in the northern hemisphere however morgans downgrade to hold from add is wary of near perfect trading conditions across both grain marketing and processing ubs agrees and suggests the current time probably represents peak cycle earnings and retains its neutral rating macquarie is more positive and keeps an outperform rating and lifts it target price by 18 to 9 48 meanwhile cimic group had the largest percentage fall in target price last week the group s fy21 profit result was less than macquarie s forecast and was at the bottom end of prior guidance by management the broker keeps a neutral rating while awaiting increased earnings and the delivery of improved cash conversion with leighton asia the key in that regard credit suisse neutral believes recent contract wins ensure a robust pipeline of work macquarie was responsible for the next biggest percentage fall in target price after slashing nearmap s 12 month target to 1 30 from 2 20 and lowering its rating to underperform from neutral the analyst sees competition building from peer aerometix in the a nz aerial mapping market of which nearmap has an 80 share for the more fragmented north american market the broker is concerned about the expenditure and litigation risk required to build upon a 3 share nearmap also featured fifth on the list of companies experiencing the largest percentage fall in forecast earnings last week leading that unfortunate list was star entertainment group after macquarie cut its fy22 earnings forecast by 15 in response to a pre release of first half results as indicated by macquarie s outperform rating there appears no cause for alarm as the market is expected to look through fy22 covid disruptions ubs buy and ord minnett accumulate seem to agree and retain their respective ratings and target prices next up was megaport after the release of second quarter results while most of the five brokers in the fnarena database are buoyant about the company s prospects the spectre of rising interest rates weighs upon morgans view additionally ord minnett voices concerns around an investment for growth which management expects to bear fruit in the current half though the broker feels fy23 may be more likely mineral resources reported first half earnings 50 below morgan stanley s forecast which was already 16 below the consensus estimate the miss was due to higher costs and lower revenues for iron ore and higher costs at mt marion lithium in addition management guided to increased capital expenditure across all assets forecast earnings by brokers for alliance aviation services also suffered following a weaker than expected first half result and guidance for fy22 morgans investment thesis predicated on strong fy23 earnings growth is still expected credit suisse agrees on the timing for the earnings uplift which should flow from an expanded fleet due to a data glitch it s best to ignore the position of ooh media atop the table for the largest percentage increase in forecast earnings graincorp was the true leader for the same reasons put forward above to explain the company s largest percentage gain in target price set by brokers in the fnarena database last week forecast earnings for st barbara also benefited last week after credit suisse amended its calculations pertaining to the company s hedge book as a result fy22 forecast profits rose to 46m from 24m and to 62m from 17m in fy23 the broker warns not to expect an interim dividend as the company will likely conserve capital ahead of an increased capital spend finally six brokers in the fnarena database adjudicated on james hardie s third quarter and generally agreed results were in line with expectations while morgan stanley nods approvingly to increased fy22 guidance and favourable fy23 guidance the old chestnut of a rising interest rate environment and its impact on housing activity is uppermost in thoughts the broker retains its equal weight rating total buy recommendations take up 58 39 of the total versus

follow us today if you saw our headline and figured we would be doing an overly technical evaluation of ev charging times or range reduction due to winter weather you are mistaken all evs have the same challenges in winter in this regard did you assume we would be doing some waist high snow driving to highlight the ioniq 5 s htrac all wheel drive system nope this vehicle is not designed for that duty we re sure its awd system is as good for on road winter driving as any other battery electric vehicle is in this story we are going to break down the 56k ioniq 5 s winter convenience features click here for the accompanying tiktok video winter weather driving and tires we drove the ioniq 5 during snow and on roads treated and plowed it was great normal just like most all wheel drive cars or crossovers with awd are tires make the biggest difference in winter on snow and on ice the tire hyundai chose is an all season touring tire not a bad choice but not the best choice either although hyundai selected high quality michelin brand tires it opted for a tire that isn t snow rated tire rack rates these tires 8 4 for light snow 7 7 for deep snow traction and 7 3 for ice traction michelin s crossclimate2 tire with its three peak mountain snowflake rating for severe snow duty would have been a better choice in our opinion this vehicle and its tires will be fine for most winter commutes but if you are going to own this car and take it skiing or to your winter cabin getaway or let s say you are an essential worker in a field that goes to work in all weather conditions you are going to need to swap rubber twice a year the crossclimate2 earns a rating from tire rack of 9 4 for light snow 9 0 for deep snow and 8 7 for ice traction and based on our testing has no downsides if the low profile tires should suffer damage there is no spare in the ioniq 5 yes we know that many other models from many other brands also commit this sin of deletion but you can get a spare in the audi e tron and all toyota rav4 primes have one heck there are wrangler 4xe models with standard matching full size spares good luck with your aaa tow and then finding a tire in stock during these unusual times remember that tire mobility slime in your trunk will be as hard as diamond when temps hit the single digits wiper blades here in new england vehicle owners who arrive at work in the morning during a snow sleet or ice storm will usually pull up the wipers the idea is to pull the wipers up so they stand proud of the windshield and then don t get frozen to the window under three inches of solid ice the ioniq 5 s wiper blade design won t allow you to do that heated windshield one feature all three of the vehicles i personally own forester highlander cx 5 have is heating wires in the front windshield glass they do two things first they keep your wipers from getting frozen when you drive in a sleet storm second they help you get going after ice and snow have built up after a storm the ioniq 5 limited doesn t appear to have this common feature sure you can bust out the scraper and then look through scratched glass forevermore but new englanders generally don t scrape we pull up the wipers and turn on the windshield de icer heated seats and steering wheel the ioniq 5 we tested had a price before dealer markups and ev incentives of 56 145 we would expect any vehicle in this price range to come with heated seats and a heated steering wheel and the ioniq 5 does they are very effective and there are some smart modes you can employ so they work when you want them to however there is no mechanical knob or switch to turn them on and off instead you use the touch screen by our count it takes five touches tapping through three menus to turn them on or off watch our tiktok video posted above to see all of the steps we understand that buttons may seem old school to many ev shoppers but to those who actually use heated seats you know that they tend to be a feature you control manually since your body and the seats heat up and cool down at rates that may not jive no rear wiper where is the rear wiper that is a question common to all ioniq 5 fan clubs on social media we have no good answer for this based on our testing snow and ice and raindrops do form on the ioniq 5 s rear glass the backup camera can also be obscured by snow and ice after driving please be aware that we think the ioniq 5 is a fantastic new vehicle from the brand we feel has done the most to provide affordable bevs this third bev model from hyundai is a leap ahead of anything else in its price class on sale now except the kia ev6 which is a similar vehicle we like the mustang mach e and the id 4 has its merits but the ioniq 5 is the hot model for q1 2022 we in new england have learned to take winter very seriously tell us in the comments below what you think of our real world analysis of the ioniq 5 s usability in winter weather for more of our observations

equity market losses accelerate as friday progresses yields remain calm on friday as 10 year drops below 2 risk off back on as nasdaq dumps over 3 as consumer confidence falls equity markets resumed the theme of 2022 after yet another shockingly high inflation number on thursday if not for last friday s strong employment number then we would be staring stagflation straight in the face and looking at a probable inversion in the yield curve as it is we may be headed for inversion anyway as the 10 year 2 year spread narrowed to 42 bps after the cpi data equity markets attempted to keep calm and carry on in early trade on friday but once the brief rally failed it was a case of rising panic selling and position closing the net results a 3 loss for the nasdaq and just under 2 for the s p 500 of course the university of michigan sentiment number gave bears the reason they needed to squeeze any lingering hope for bulls this number should not have come as a surprise given recent weakness in other consumer indicators but the reaction was telling bears are in control now s p 500 spy forecast we had identified 458 as a key level numerous times during the week and it did indeed prove key to the sell off yet another test on thursday before the cpi a case of the pump and then the dump now that level is far in the distance the spy will look to test our other key level at 428 this really does need to be broken to maintain the trend and set a lower low perhaps a move to 423 or more likely 414 before we can then rally nothing goes down in a straight line remember spy chart daily fund flows just in time for the sell off we saw net inflows to equity etf s last week the biggest gainer according to refinitive lipper alpha was spy ivv sp500 core and schd a dividend etf meanwhile the russell 2000 iwm saw the biggest outflow investor sentiment this will get worse but the latest investor survey from the american association of individual investors shows a rebound for sentiment last week well not exactly a rebound as bulls dropped off but investors became more neutral perhaps waiting for the cpi as this data is up until wednesday expect next week s number to worsen then source aaii com s p 500 spy earnings refinitiv lipper alpha notes 358 companies from the s p 500 have now reported and 78 2 have beaten estimates the problem is the worsening outlook for many next week only 59 companies report from the s p 500 block as earnings season draws to a close source benzinga pro economic releases a relatively light week next in terms of both macro and micro related data earnings season drops off and only retail sales really look interesting next week the next period revolves around yield watching until the march fed meeting risk is likely to be off growth and meme stocks will suffer and we expect value and energy to continue to outperform also do not forget financials higher and ever higher rates should be a tailwind for some
another hotter than expected inflation report jolted markets this week on thursday the labor department released the latest consumer price index report the cpi surged 7 5 in january from a year earlier that exceeded most forecasts and marked a new four decade high for consumer price increases brian cheung of yahoo finance gives his take on the situation brian cheung price s are rising in the united states across the board by 0 6 on a month over month basis if you index it over a year over year period 7 5 was the growth that we had seen in the report that is well above the street s estimates of 7 3 and continues to ratchet up we ve seen joe biden talk very frequently lately anytime he has the podium about the impact of inflation on americans that s because this is becoming a huge and already is becoming a huge political issue for him now of course all eyes are not just on the white house in congress where they engineer fiscal policy from the federal reserve as well where the extraordinary monetary stimulus has obviously led to some sort of demand push that is leading to inflation that is not fading as fast as federal reserve officials had originally hoped or messaged in the beginning of 2021 that s going to be a very interesting story as we get to that mid march meeting where the fed is expected to start raising rates rising prices are a reflection of a falling currency the u s dollar is rapidly losing value as the federal reserve keeps ultra loose monetary policy in place fed officials are of course talking about tightening they are widely expected to finally begin lifting interest rates at their march meeting expectations are growing for a 50 basis point hike instead of the typical quarter of a percent hike the fed hasn t executed such a move since 2000 st louis federal reserve bank president james bullard said he now supports raising interest rates by a full percentage point over the next three policy meetings that would imply at least one half percent hike bond yields rose sharply on the news while stocks gave back gains precious metals markets also reacted to the threat of steeper fed rate hikes but gold and silver managed to hang on to most of their gains from earlier in the week through thursday s close it s possible that metals rallies will continue to be capped until the fed does make it official and raise rates next month the psychology of markets is such that fear of something happening triggers selling pressure but when the adverse event actually occurs traders often breathe a sigh of relief and cover their short positions markets typically move before the news rather than in response to it today s trading now reflects an expected 50 basis point rate hike with more hikes to follow unless something totally unexpected occurs during the fed s next meeting there s no reason for investors to make drastic adjustments to their core positions the fundamental case for owning gold and silver is strong and will remain so after the fed starts hiking with inflation now running at 7 5 officially the central bank would have to initiate 15 rate hikes of 50 basis points each in order to get out in front of it there s no chance that will happen meanwhile the supply and demand dynamics for metals are trending positive on wednesday the silver institute reported that it expects demand for physical silver to reach a record high of over 1 1 billion ounces this year that would represent an 8 increase from 2021 and likely outpace any mining supply growth the silver institute cites rising industrial demand as the global economy emerges from supply chain bottlenecks longer term it expects continued demand growth from green energy projects including solar panels that are being installed at a record pace and the kicker for the silver market is that investment demand is expected to grow even faster than industrial uses the silver institute forecasts sales of silver bullion products to surge 13 higher in 2022 we continue to see robust buying of silver coins and rounds here at money metals exchange some who are new to precious metals investing may be confused about the difference between coins and rounds they both have the same sizing and purity and sometimes even feature similar design elements the only real difference is that coins are produced by a government mint and generally have a face value meaning they are legal tender a round is produced by a private mint it won t have a face value a round isn t legal tender in any particular government currency does the legal tender value of an american silver eagle for example make it superior to a privately minted round the answer is not really the intrinsic metal value of a silver eagle far exceeds its face value the face value is never likely to come into play in any conceivable sale or trade coins such as american eagles tend to have significantly higher premiums than rounds by opting for rounds or bars for that matter instead of coins you get more ounces for your money in other news money metals is moving forward aggressively in about a dozen states to promote sound money policies including repeal of unjust sales and income taxes on gold and silver sound money defense league director up cortez travelled to nashville tennessee this week to testify in a state house committee hearing in support of sales tax repeal legislation pending there chairman hicks members of the finance ways and means house subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today my name is jp cortez and i am the policy director for the sound money defense league i ask you to please vote yes on house bill 1874 a measure that removes sales taxation from gold and silver coins and bullion just two months ago the tennessee advisory commission on intergovernmental relations released a report on the feasibility of creating a state gold depository while the report concluded that a bullion depository would not be feasible in tennessee at this time tacir pointedly concluded that the state should consider a sales tax exemption from precious metals coins and bullion there is a national trend to remove sales taxation from precious metals according to tacir s report 42 states have already done so in whole or in part mississippi hawaii kentucky and new jersey are expected to consider measures to remove sales taxation from precious metals in the upcoming weeks tennessee has considered measures similar to house bill 1874 for seven years while it has failed so far to pass this commonsense measure six other states have ended the practice of taxing precious metals over the same amount of time wv oh la nc ks ar under current law tennessee citizens are discouraged from insuring their savings against the devaluation of the dollar because they are penalized with taxation for doing so house bill 1874 removes the disincentives to holding gold and silver for this purpose here are a few reasons why i strongly urge you to vote yes on house bill 1874 taxing gold and silver is a de facto investment penalty on tennessee citizens usually of humble means who seek to hold some of their savings in real assets that are insulated from inflation and financial turmoil it s also discriminatory because purchases of stocks bonds mutual funds etfs real estate and every other financial instrument are not subject to sales tax from the tacir report anyone buying and storing precious metals in tennessee owes tennessee s sales tax and state and local rates combined can be as high as 9 75 purchasers of precious metals are not consuming them making a sales tax and or use tax inappropriate in the first place precious metals purchasers are holding these metals for resale or exchange like a currency or investment the exchange of one dollar for four quarters is a nontaxable event exchanging dollars for the only form of money mentioned in the u s constitution should not be taxed taxing the purchase of monetary metals also undermines tennessee businesses and reduce tennessee state revenues many tennesseans will buy and or store their precious metals in nearby alabama georgia missouri north carolina and virginia which do not charge sales tax on precious metals studies have shown that states actually lose revenue when they tax the purchase of gold and silver washington and nebraska considered repealing longstanding exemptions on precious metals in their states but legislators realized the major policy error this would entail and the measure didn t make it out of committee in either state louisiana and ohio both briefly imposed a sales tax on precious metals recently but the legislatures in both states quickly reversed course after one year when businesses coin conventions and state revenues left the state that s why any revenue collected from precious metals sales taxes would almost certainly be surpassed by the tax revenue lost from coin conventions businesses and other economic activity leaving the state by voting yes on house bill 1874 you will be following an example set by 42 other states which have already reduced or eliminated sales taxes on precious metals honoring the only form of money mentioned in the u s constitution and lowering the tax burden on your constituents jp cortez and his team have been hard at work advocating for these important policies

people in the united states must recognize the suffering their country continues inflicting in afghanistan during visits to kabul afghanistan over the past decade i particularly relished lingering over breakfasts on chilly winter mornings with my young hosts who were on their winter break from school seated on the floor wearing coats and hats and draped with blankets we d sip piping hot green tea as we shared fresh warm wheels of bread purchased from the nearest baker but this winter for desperate millions of afghans the bread isn t there the decades long u s assault on afghanistan s people has now taken the vengeful form of freezing their shattered starving country s assets the u s confiscation of 9 4 billion in afghanistan s currency reserves has already plunged the country into an economic and humanitarian crisis on january 10 the biden administration announced an executive order which will allow 3 5 billion in frozen assets from afghanistan s central bank to be distributed for humanitarian assistance in the country but measures aiming to provide humanitarian assistance will not address the reality of an economy on the verge of collapse if the afghan bank can t pay teachers health care workers and civil servants those people won t have money to buy food and if the farmers can t sell their crops they can t afford to cultivate the land with some 23 million people in extreme hunger and a million children under age five in immediate danger of starvation the u s should unfreeze all of afghanistan s central bank assets after visiting afghanistan late last year dominik stillhart head of the international committee of the red cross said he felt livid over the collective punishment being imposed on afghans through the freezing of the country s assets referring to 9 5 billion dollars of afghan assets presently frozen by the united states he recently emphasized that economic sanctions meant to punish those in power in kabul are instead freezing millions of people across afghanistan out of the basics they need to survive the myopic effort to punish the taliban by freezing afghan assets has left the country on the brink of starvation these 9 5 billion of frozen assets belong to the afghan people including those going without income and farmers who can no longer feed their livestock or cultivate their land this money belongs to people who are freezing and going hungry and who are being deprived of education and health care while the afghan economy collapses under the weight of u s sanctions recently i received an email from a young friend in kabul living conditions are very difficult for people who do not have bread to eat and fuel to heat their homes the young friend wrote a child died from cold in a house near me and several families came to my house today to help them with money one of them cried and told me that they had not eaten for forty eight hours and that their two children were unconscious from the cold and hunger she had no money to treat and feed them i wanted to share my heartache with you forty eight members of congress have written to u s president joe biden calling for the unfreezing of afghanistan s assets by denying international reserves to afghanistan s private sector including more than 7 billion belonging to afghanistan and deposited at the federal reserve the u s government is impacting the general population the congressmembers added we fear as aid groups do that maintaining this policy could cause more civilian deaths in the coming year than were lost in twenty years of war for two decades the united states support for puppet regimes in afghanistan made that country dependent on foreign assistance as though it were on life support 95 percent of the population more than three quarters of whom are women and children remained below the poverty line while corruption mismanagement embezzlement waste and fraud benefited numerous warlords including u s military contractors after the united states invaded their country and embroiled them in a pointless 20 year nightmare what the united states owes the afghan people is reparations not starvation the eminent human rights advocate and international law professor richard falk recently emailed u s peace activists encouraging an upcoming february 14 valentine day s initiative which calls for the unfreezing of afghan assets lifting any residual sanctions and opposing their maintenance professor falk acknowledges that the disastrous u s mission in afghanistan amounted to twenty years of expensive bloody destructive futility that has left the country in a shambles with bleak future prospects after the experience of the past twenty years falk writes in the email it seems time for the afghans to be allowed to solve their problems without outside interference i am sure many people of good will tried to help afghanistan achieve more humane results than were on the agenda of the taliban but foreign interference particularly by the united states is not the way to achieve positive state building goals several friends and i were able to send a small amount of money to the friend who wrote and shared with us her heartache over being unable to help needy neighbors thank you for hearing our afghan pain she and her spouse responded now is a crucial time to listen and not to look away kathy kelly syndicated by peacevoice is an author and was a co founder of voices in the wilderness and voices for creative nonviolence who helps coordinate the ban killer drones campaign

note there will be no weekly column next week due to the annual forecast webinar taking place on sunday february 20 review and preview consumer prices in january surged more than expected over the past 12 months indicating a worsening outlook for inflation and cementing the likelihood of substantial interest rate hikes this year the consumer price index which measures the costs of dozens of everyday consumer goods rose 7 5 compared to a year ago the labor department reported thursday jeff cox inflation rises 7 5 even more than expected and the highest since 1982 www cnbc com february 10 2022 so how s the u s government s grand experiment in modern monetary theory turning out not well the inflation pain might have been lessened if the fed had begun to withdraw its pandemic money rush more than a year ago but washington had grown to believe that a new era of cost free spending and low interest rates had dawned the old fiscal and monetary verities no longer held and those who warned about inflation were proclaimed to be dinosaurs from the reagan era inflation haunts the biden economy wall street journal review and outlook february 11 2022 with thursday s ultra hot inflation report during the mutable sign quarter moon in gemini that same day it was just too much for the recent rally off the low of january 24 mercury retrograde midpoint to continue it didn t help that tensions also escalated surrounding the threat of a russian invasion into ukraine with the great bear s war exercises with all that mutable cosmic energy plus jupiter approaching its conjunction to neptune in pisces the whipsaw behavior between the irrational exuberance and hysteria of investors led to a sudden jolt in global equity markets mid week first the stock indices raced to their highest level since the lows of january 24 then they abruptly reversed and fell hard on thursday and friday but not without some short lived efforts to rally along the way now the worry is that the fed will raise interest rates as early as next month and not by a modest 1 4 but very possibly 1 2 as hard as that was for equity markets to digest it was no problem for gold the combination of rising inflation and war threats jolted the yellow metal up to 1865 on friday its highest level since november 19 just two weeks ago it was trading at 1780 it was also no problem for crude oil which also thrives on that combination of worries for investors crude oil soared to a high of 94 66 on friday its highest level since august 22 2014 and up nearly 50 from its primary cycle low on december 2 this is further confirmation the bullish effect of jupiter in pisces approaching neptune all of these are geocosmic factors related in the association with crude oil bitcoin and ethereum followed a course similar to stocks with recovery highs reached on thursday february 10 after which they declined somewhat sharply into friday the question in both cryptos and equities is whether the rally is over and the next leg down to new multi month lows is just starting or will this decline just be a correction of the rally that took place over the past two weeks and if the former how much pain will the federal reserve board be willing to let americans experience before they change their mind and walk back from their intent to raise rates several times in the next few months short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts americans took on more new debt in 2021 than in any year since before the 2008 2009 financial crisis total household debt rose by 1 02 trillion last year boosted by higher balances on home and auto loans orla mccaffrey household debt rose by 1 trillion in 2021 wall street journal february 9 2022 a nickel ain t worth a dime anymore yogi berra pluto rules debt and pain and the u s is now encountering its first pluto return so let s first off clarify a statement made last week that february 22 2022 was the fourth passage of the 248 year pluto return that is not technically correct it was the fourth passage of pluto over the usa s natal moon pluto conjunction based on the july 2 1776 founding chart that we use which posits the usa moon at 25 09 of capricorn and pluto at 27 36 capricorn pluto crossed the u s natal moon s position for the first time on january 30 2021 shortly after president biden took office it will cross the natal pluto position for the first time on february 22 2022 the series of six passes over these two planets three times over each moon and pluto position ends on december 29 2022 yet as with all matters involving a pluto transit the events associated with the decisions or choices made under a pluto transit often take 1 3 years afterwards to manifest as pluto s nature has an incubation like process for an in depth discussion of what this means please refer to the chapter on the pluto return contained in the forecast 2022 book in fact the opening pages of that book also address the significance of pluto transiting over its natal moon pluto position in the july 2 1776 chart which is based upon the date when the vote for the declaration of independence was completed and not july 4 1776 which was when it was delivered to general george washington and the u s war of independence commenced we will have more to discuss about the usa pluto return in our february 20 annual webinar to the world for instance pluto is in opposition to president biden s natal jupiter which is his ruling planet it is also in a t square to vice president kamala harris sun moon opposition as we have stated many times in this column no one escapes a hard pluto transit unscathed president trump did not escape it and biden harris and the usa are not escaping it unscathed either all will require a major adjustment a radical transformation of their current path in order to get through this transit stronger than before in fact it requires a surrender of the ego before the healing can start without a major change of behavior by choice the choice will be made by others that can transform one s path with pluto one experiences the profound humility that comes from encountering this major life lesson shorter term we are about to enter a very interesting and potentially positive period over the next three weeks it begins with the first of two conjunctions between venus and mars in capricorn on the full moon of february 16 followed by the sextile of jupiter and uranus on february 17 venus and mars in capricorn may relate to political efforts to negotiate an agreement to de escalate the threat of military actions jupiter sextile uranus indicates some new proposal that is inventive and original it is a very clever and smart combination offering up new and yet practical ideas that could result in an agreement it may take until the second conjunction of venus and mars in aquarius sign ruled by uranus on march 6 to finalize thus a two step dance may be underway to manifest a rather brilliant plan to return to diplomacy at least for a while if not then venus and especially mars conjunct pluto in late capricorn on march 3 may instead blow it all up that s what pluto can do with mars the stakes are very high but there is hope if all sides are really serious about reaching an agreeable compromise mars and pluto aren t always that willing but venus is usually open to compromise for the sake of peace it s right there and the cosmic energy switches as venus and mars ingress from capricorn into aquarius on march 6 that is the same degree in which the jupiter saturn conjunction occurred on december 21 2020 and began the new aira in astrological terminology a term invented by mmta graduate kat powell because it re started the series of 20 year jupiter saturn conjunctions in air signs for the next 140 years it s all about the choices our beleaguered leaders make now and venus is the planet most representative of choices and the one planet that has the most difficulty making a decision even though it wishes for choices given that president putin is a libra which is ruled by venus one can only imagine the stress he and all librans might be going through these next two weeks regarding their alliances it is a make or break time for them or anyone with natal planets in very late cardinal or very early fixed signs as the hippies and flower children used to say in the late 1960 s this is the time to make love not war it makes one wonder where have all the flowers gone since then

earlier this week we discussed the news that sweden was putting an end to free covid testing for all of its citizens and also terminating most covid related restrictions and mandates that idea seems to be catching on in that part of europe because now their neighbors to the west in norway are following suit the norwegian prime minister announced yesterday that almost all remaining covid restrictions are being lifted as his government no longer sees a major health threat to the citizens of his country some members of the eu are still holding out but this seems to be quickly turning into a pattern so are they following the science or just realizing that their people are simply done with this and may settle the matter for themselves before long associated press he justified the move by saying that norwegians are well protected by vaccines against the covid 19 pandemic and the proportion of citizens who end in up in hospital has remained low despite the spread of the omicron variant this is the day we have been waiting for said norwegian prime minister jonas gahr stoere during a news conference in oslo on saturday we are removing almost all coronavirus measures norway says it is lifting almost all remaining covid restrictions as it doesn t see a major health threat to citizens any more even though the omicron variant is still spreading in the nordic nation starting today norwegians are no longer required to wear masks even in crowded public spaces anyone still wishing to wear a mask is free to do so but nobody will be accosted by law enforcement if they choose to go maskless the country s three foot social distancing rule is similarly abolished also there will no longer be a requirement for forced self isolation and quarantine rules have been dropped now the government simply recommends that anyone testing positive stay home for four days was that really so difficult they ve vaccinated all of the people who are willing to take the vaccine and that s about the best that they can do everyone is being tasked with being responsible to make their own choices and live with the results or not live with them in some cases unfortunately norway has been faced with increasingly loud public protests against such restrictions just like many other nations it sounds as if the prime minister wanted to get out in front of the problem before he wound up with a freedom convoy on his hands while this sort of common sense has yet to take hold in the american federal government private entities seem to be coming to the same conclusion in new york city the new york stock exchange dropped its mask mandate for vaccinated workers and visitors yesterday and several of the largest investment banking firms on wall street did the same the new york stock exchange is withdrawing its mask mandate for fully vaccinated people effective immediately a source said on friday after several large u s banks also dropped their mask requirements at their u s offices the nyse which is owned by intercontinental exchange inc ice n is now making masks optional on the trading floor and other public areas for fully vaccinated personnel and visitors a person with knowledge of the matter told reuters adding that the existing covid 19 policies would still remain in place there will still be some restrictions in place on wall street particularly for those without proof of vaccination but we always knew this was going to happen in stages these firms can t afford to permanently lose the number of people they would drive away with permanent mandates particularly if some of their competitors remove restrictions entirely and begin hiring them all and we ve already seen this happening in other market sectors it s hard to avoid the feeling that a reckoning is on the way those in power both in government and in the private sector can see the writing on the wall the country has to get back to normal and they will not live in fear under a state of emergency forever i will confidently predict that we ll see a different sort of reckoning this november for those who continue to cling to these autocratic powers

it was as predictable as the sunrise that establishment economists abetted by the establishment media would find a way to exonerate old joe biden and his handlers of any responsibility for the disastrous economy it would even be a stretch for them to blame their all purpose whipping boy donald j trump at this point however so a new scapegoat had to be found you yahoo finance s alexandra semenova announced friday that us consumers are in a deep funk and that s why the economic news is so unremittingly bad nothing to do with the puppet of the extreme left in the white house you see advertisement the problem as leftist economists see it is that inflation is making consumers less confident which leads them to spend less as concerns around inflation soar semenova explains american consumers outlook on the trajectory of the u s economy has deteriorated worrying some experts that negative attitudes could dampen expenditure and put a dent in economic growth of course it s not the galloping inflation that is dampening expenditure and putting a dent in economic growth but the consumers negative attitudes change the attitudes and voila the economy will be healed this theory is presented seriously amid all manner of dire information the university of michigan s preliminary consumer sentiment index dropped to 61 7 in the first half of this month the lowest since october 2011 from a final reading of 67 2 in january reports reuters the consumer sentiment index fell as u s inflation accelerated last month in the fastest rise since 1982 with prices across a wide range of goods and services soaring further amid lingering shortages and supply chain disruptions meanwhile on super bowl sunday chicken wings alone are running as much as 26 higher steaks are up 23 and hamburgers are up 17 nevertheless the learned economists at the university of michigan have determined in their infinite leftist wisdom that the decline in consumer confidence has been driven not just by the least favorable long term economic outlook in a decade and weakening personal financial prospects amid rising inflation but also by less confidence in the government s economic policies see what we have now is not a crisis of inflation or the result of putting a gang of socialists with no real world experience in charge of the world s mightiest economy no what we have is a crisis of confidence if we just trust old joe one of the world s least trustworthy men all will be well advertisement related delusions of grandeur biden brags about the economy christopher s rupkey chief economist of fwdbonds a financial markets research organization warned of the consequences if we don t start trusting that biden s handlers know what they re doing as they trash the economy and pronto incredibly the consumer is polling negatively on almost everything when it comes to the economy and if their confidence doesn t improve the economy could be headed towards the cliff of recession we almost have to recheck our figures because the consumer is clearly in a deep funk and if they decide to call it quits then the economic growth we have seen is going to fade fast rupkey added a downbeat consumer in retreat risks sending the economy over the cliff if they don t start spending more at the shops and malls so would you just cheer up already the people who wrecked the economy are surely going to put it back together again with superb aplomb so what are you so down in the dumps about you re making the economic masters of the universe nervous the big drop in consumer sentiment through february is concerning said bill adams chief economist for comerica bank all else equal the recent drop in consumer sentiment could signal serious trouble ahead the bottom line is that if we would just stop noticing how expensive everything is and start buying again the economy will get going and all will be well but if we keep on paying attention to prices that are galloping ever higher and tighten our belts then old joe biden and his team could get mauled in the midterms and no leftist economist wants to see that what s more if you spend yourself into bankruptcy you can become a ward of the state dependent upon the democrats generosity to you which is based on their appropriation of money from people who actually produce something so for the left there is no downside advertisement stop destroying biden s beautiful economy start spending

hall of heroes desmond t doss info from here and here desmond t doss february 7 1919 march 23 2006 was the first conscientious objector to receive the medal of honor and one of only three so honored the others are thomas w bennett and joseph g lapointe jr he was a corporal private first class at the time of his medal of honor heroics in the u s army assigned to the medical detachment 307th infantry 77th infantry division he died the same day as another medal of honor recipient david bleak desmond doss refused to kill or carry a weapon into combat because of his personal beliefs as a seventh day adventist he thus became a medic and by serving in the pacific theatre of world war ii helped his country by saving the lives of his comrades while also adhering to his religious convictions his medal of honor was earned by the risks he took to save the lives of many comrades he is the subject of the award winning documentary the conscientious objector desmond t doss was 23 years old when he was drafted into the u s army in 1942 the lanky lynchburg va native was much like other young men of the greatest generation but one thing set desmond apart from the other new troops he was a devout seventh day adventist and refused to touch a weapon some of the men in his training unit made jokes about him others threatened him but desmond held firm to his beliefs the army considered discharging him but desmond objected i d be a very poor christian if i accepted a discharge implying that i was mentally off because of my religion he told the review board i m sorry gentlemen but i can t accept that kind of a discharge he was granted conscientious objector status and the former cabinetmaker trained as a medic desmond was assigned to the 307th infantry regiment of the 77th infantry division and sent to the pacific theater in 1944 he participated in the amphibious assault on guam and tended to wounded soldiers though two weeks of hard jungle fighting after the island was secured desmond was awarded the bronze star after several more combat landings the 77th faced its most deadly challenge in operation iceberg the battle for okinawa the battle began on april 1 1945 and the typhoon of steel quickly became one of the highest casualty engagements of the war japanese defenders resisted to the last man from a system of cave complexes and underground tunnels by the end of april army and marine forces had become bogged down before formidable enemy defenses along a 400 foot high jagged ridgeline called the maeda escarpment the 307th infantry regiment was assigned to storm the ridgeline and break the back of the japanese position on the morning the assault was launched desmond suggested to his platoon leader lieutenant goronto that the men say a prayer i believe prayer is the best life saver there is he said the men should really pray before going up fellows come over here and gather around the lieutenant said doss wants to pray for us actually desmond had meant that each man should observe his own moment of prayer but the men of the unit humored him and stood by while desmond read a passage from his bible then they set about their grim business according to one participant the assault on maeda escarpment was all hell rolled into one it was seven days and nights of bitter struggle with rifles bayonets hand grenades knives and fists the men of desmond s battalion advanced to the top eight times and each time they were driven back by furious japanese counterassaults but the ninth assault held and the ridge was taken yet at a terrible cost the battalion had arrived on april 29 with 800 men a week later there were 324 left standing desmond was in the thick of things throughout the only medic assigned to the attack as the battle line shifted across the top of the escarpment desmond stayed behind retrieving wounded men in the face of enemy fire he carried them to the edge of the escarpment and lowered them one by one on a litter suspended from a rope others who were too badly wounded to move he treated on the spot sometimes within yards of enemy held caves officers motioned for desmond to come off the ridge but he refused throughout the brutal assault when wounded soldiers cried medic desmond doss came pfc doss continued his heroic actions through the battle on okinawa suffering numerous wounds on may 21 during a night attack he was giving aid to wounded soldiers when a grenade landed nearby and seriously wounded his legs five hours later litter bearers came to rescue him but on the way to an aid station they were attacked by an enemy tank and desmond gave his place in the litter to a more seriously wounded troop while awaiting help he was wounded in the arm by a sniper and knowing he could not stay any longer on the battlefield he fashioned a splint out of a rifle stock and crawled 300 yards to safety the men of his unit who had thought desmond was dead wept when they saw him return desmond doss left the army as a corporal missing one lung six ribs and classified as 90 percent disabled his heroism had not gone unnoticed in october 1945 president truman presented doss with the medal of honor at a white house ceremony he was credited with saving at least 75 lives on okinawa the citation read that his name became a symbol throughout the 77th infantry division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty he was the first conscientious objector to receive this high honor i wasn t trying to be a hero desmond said in a 1987 interview i loved my men and they loved me i

concentration of artillery mortar and machinegun fire crashed into them inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back pfc doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire swept area with the many stricken carrying all 75 casualties one by one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands on may 2 he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards 180 m forward of the lines on the same escarpment and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave advancing through a shower of grenades to within 8 yards 7 3 m of enemy forces in a cave s mouth where he dressed his comrades wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety on may 5 he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer he applied bandages moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and while artillery and mortar shells fell close by painstakingly administered plasma later that day when an american was severely wounded by fire from a cave pfc doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet 7 6 m from the enemy position rendered aid and carried him 100 yards 91 m to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire on may 21 in a night attack on high ground near shuri he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade rather than call another aid man from cover he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover the trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and pfc doss seeing a more critically wounded man nearby crawled off the litter and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man awaiting the litter bearers return he was again struck by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm with magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards 270 m over rough terrain to the aid station through his

overall the nineteenth century saw women continue to fight to improve their own roles as well as the rights of others like slaves women participated in a series of conventions and protests to advocate for these rights as well as for those such a slaves america at this point in the lead up to the american civil war was growing evermore divided eventually these rowing tensions over slavery led the nation to war and pitted americans against americans growing tensions over slavery led the nation to war and pitted americans against americans for women the civil war and reconstruction periods ultimately redefined their role within the united states the pennsylvania anti slavery society in 1851 10 years before the outbreak of the american civil war made up of women and men spartacus educational before the american civil war women focused on slavery issue the anti slavery convention of american women which met in new york city in may of 1837 demonstrated the combined belief in the injustices of slavery as well as the subservient nature they were forced to endure for example during the conference sisters s m grimké and a e grimké referenced the 1793 fugitive slave act which stated that run away slaves be returned to their masters they stated that this law contradicted the principles of liberty that had given the united states the moniker of being the freest nation in the world since a large group of people living within the united states were enslaved a e grimké also said that slavery was religiously immoral for example she stated a daring infringement on the divine commands thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant that is escaped from his master unto thee however throughout the convention speakers also questioned and challenged beliefs within their religious texts a e grimké and lucretia mott both argued that women were entitled to the moral rights within society and should not have to be subservient to their husbands which had been written within their scripture another event that showed women s actions to secure rights for all women was the seneca falls convention in 1848 headed by elizabeth cady stanton mimicking the rhetoric of the declaration of independence the convention put forward a declaration of sentiment that stated the grievances made against women in society for example the declaration stated he has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise this grievance describes women s legal inability to vote within elections according to a video by eric foner this was the first organized women s suffrage gathering which directly highlighted these issues within american society the declaration further assesses other injustices women had been subjected to throughout history such as the inability to own their property being denied educational opportunities and laws regarding divorce women continued to conduct conferences and fairs to promote their agenda for example women continued to promote both abolitionists ideals and rights through these fairs which were funded by abolitionist supporters harriet tubman is probably the most famous slave of the american civil war which ended with freedom for so many slaves silvio adobe stock women of color before and during the american civil war the experiences of women of color during the period leading to the american civil war demonstrated the racial and gender differences existing within society for example harriet jacobs described her experience of being sexual abused by her master jacobs recounted my master met me at every turn reminding me that i belonged to him and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to him jacobs experience highlights the inability of enslaved women to escape as well as the psychological torment they were subjected to additionally jacobs described that enslaved women were unable to disclose that their masters were fathers of their children and that her master had fathered eleven slaves native american women were also forcibly placed within slavery for example nancy a cherokee woman was taken from her family and wrongly enslaved in addition to being enslaved nancy also faced discrimination on both fronts for being both native american and african since both groups were negatively viewed however during this period women also fought against these struggles to escape their harsh living conditions enslaved women were among a large number of women who would run away known as truants and absentees louisiana possessed the largest percentage of female runaways at twenty nine percent other enslaved women would help runaways survive and stay hidden for example aunt fanny of virginia would prepare food that she would give to runaways women also legally fought for their freedoms in court for example two native american women coincidently named nancy fought for their liberties citing that they had wrongfully been enslaved some women used their religious devotion to persevere during this period for example elizabeth a former slave from maryland exemplified the struggle and determination to survive despite the psychological abuse of being taken from her family and physical torment she received for running away to find them elizabeth found solace in faith after having a religious revelation elizabeth described herself as a new creature in christ and dedicated her life to spreading his message regardless of her living situation women working at the u s arsenal watertown massachusetts filling cartridges during the american civil war from harper s weekly july 1861 library of congress when the civil war began women took on many roles when war finally broke out and the nation officially divided many women from the north and the south assumed roles traditionally held by men within the south particularly in virginia and tennessee the war reached the home front of many women although there was a large majority of women in disbelief that the war had come to their doorstep women who had once lamented if only i were a man and could fight were now able to do things to support their cause sarah morgan from louisiana expressed joy in the confederacy because by exclaiming i confess myself a rebel body and soul confess i glory in it thus demonstrating her enthusiasm for the war despite the negative connotation of being associated with the confederacy women within these communities formed soldiers aid societies known as angels of the confederacy to provide supplies to men at the front and shifted to areas where soldiers needed assistance mary boykin chestnut a southern author and observer in richmond virginia noted one saw a man too weak to hold his musket she took it from him and helped the poor wounded fellow along they were able to transform homes and churches into hospitals where women also provided food and nursed the wounded most women on the northern home front did not directly experience the war s violence at their doorstep however many struggled financially after their male relatives or spouses went away to war much like the women of the south northern women found jobs in cities and towns in war related industries such as munitions factories in washington d c women took desk jobs once held by men in departments of the federal government like women in the south northern women assisted the war effort from the home front by making and gathering supplies for the troops albeit more materials were produced in the north thus northern women were able to supply more supplies to the union army women also worked as nurses on the home front for example clara barton became a well respected nurse who aided soldiers in massachusetts this experience would ultimately lead her to founding the american red cross cornelia hancock a union nurse described her surroundings at the battle of gettysburg despite the difficult and disturbing scenery in which she would cry when writing to the wives of wounded soldiers her efforts still helped save lives through the supervision of the freedmen s bureau northern teachers traveled into the south to provide education and training for the newly freed population public domain after the civil war women s rights grew stronger still following the civil war women s evolving role continued as they advocated for their own rights as citizens for example many women would petition for suffrage or the right to vote in an 1866 petition to the senate and house of representatives women argued that as a group they represent fifteen million people within the united states that did not have the right to vote furthermore since the constitution recognizes everyone within the united states as free people by law women were entitled to the same rights as men under the law african american women also played a prominent role in advancing women s roles following the civil war for example harriet tubman who served as a nurse during the war sent a petition to the united states congress arguing for payment for her services which demonstrated that women were entitled to compensation for services similar to their male counterparts african american woman ruled by white southern men would no longer be tolerated freed women would argue their cases in court albeit unsuccessfully due to the increasing racial divide but also through self defense these events showcase the changing gender role identity within southern society the period before the american civil war was the beginning of massive change for women white colored and native across the united states which continued to mount during the war and afterwards top image young happy woman standing by an american civil war canon in manassas national battlefield park

vpn setup is secure working correctly and not leaking we also advise people to properly research the company behind the vpn service this article is not a recommendation of any kind this year s questions and answers are listed below we have included all vpn providers we contacted that don t keep extensive logs or block lawful torrent traffic on all of their servers the order of the providers is arbitrary and doesn t carry any value note the responses below were received in 2023 some companies failed to respond and are therefore excluded 1 do you keep or share with third parties any data that would allow you to match an ip address and a timestamp to a current or former user of your service if so exactly what information do you hold share and for how long 2 what is the name under which your company is incorporated parent companies if applicable and under which jurisdiction does your company operate 3 what tools are used to monitor and mitigate abuse of your service including limits

it s noteworthy to mention that torguard has always been faithful to its origins never having changed ownership and continues to function under the governance and principles set by its founding companies 3 we use a simplified edition of nagios to oversee hardware utilization uptime and latency associated with our vpn proxy devoid of any extra modules torguard enforces a real time limit of eight simultaneous connections for each user and each session is instantly cleared as soon as the user disconnects in instances where a user fails to disconnect or gets inadvertently disconnected our system has the capability to automatically discard these obsolete sessions within a few minutes 4 we host our own analytics using matamo an open source platform and have ensured it doesn t retain referral ip addresses we utilize anonymized data from matamo analytics to enhance our understanding and optimize our website and service offerings all customer support processes are managed in house without the use of third party tools as for email delivery it is managed via sendgrid 5 in the event of receiving a legitimate dmca removal notice our legal team would be responsible for addressing it however owing to our stringent no log policy and shared ip network it s impossible for us to relay any such requests to a specific user 6 when we receive a court order it s immediately subjected to a review by our legal team to validate its jurisdictional legitimacy in cases where the order is validated our legal representation would be compelled to expound on the details of our shared ip network and our firm policy against storing any identifiable logs or timestamps considering the design of our network and the substantial volume of traffic it accommodates any modifications to record user activity are unfeasible this is a circumstance we ve never had to confront in the course of our operations our network at torguard is specifically engineered to operate with minimal server resources rendering it inherently incapable of retaining user logs the structure of our shared vpn servers and the high traffic volume that circulates through our network make it virtually impossible to maintain such logs 7 all servers with the exception of those located in the usa and on our residential and streaming ip network permit torrent traffic the exclusion of bittorrent traffic on usa servers is a measure taken in response to a legal settlement in 2022 furthermore torguard provides port forwarding for all ports exceeding 2048 the only port we restrict outgoing is the smtp port 25 as a measure to prevent misuse 8 we employ stripe to process credit or debit card transactions and have our own btcpay system for handling bitcoin and litecoin transfers torguard also accepts all types of cryptocurrency through nowpayments and paymentwall is used for gift card payments and local bank transfer options to ensure the utmost protection of our users privacy torguard has taken considerable steps including extensive modifications to our billing system to accommodate various payment providers 9 for enhanced security we suggest deploying openvpn with aes 256 gcm sha512 incorporating our stealth vpn protocol as an additional protective layer this can be done through torguard s desktop or mobile applications 10 indeed our kill switch has a unique design that directs all traffic into a black hole should the user experience connectivity loss or if the application crashes for any reason we are currently developing a dual stack for ipv4 ipv6 which will be launched once ipv6 adoption becomes more prevalent among users 11 while we do host servers at third party locations we only choose these sites after a thorough review based on strict security criteria we employ disk encryption and operate part of the network on virtual ram disks regular audits are conducted on our servers and we ensure no keys are stored on the endpoints that could risk traffic compromise moreover any remote access like ipmi is either disabled or stringently restricted and monitored we offer secure public dns but we also furnish our internal dns on every endpoint which directly queries root vpn servers 12 currently we maintain three virtual locations taiwan greece and russia although torguard generally prefers to avoid virtual locations there are instances when we can t find a bare metal data center that satisfies our stringent security criteria in such cases we choose not to compromise on security torguard website 1 we do not store any logs relating to traffic session dns or metadata there are no logs kept for any person or entity to match an ip address and a timestamp to a current or former user of our service in summary we do not log period privacy is our policy 2 private internet access inc is an indiana corporation under the parent company kape technologies plc a leading privacy first consumer software provider 3 we have an active proprietary system in place to help mitigate any abuse however we re pleased to announce that earlier this year we rolled out unlimited simultaneous device connections for all our users in order to help pia to deliver even better value with one subscription and to allow customers to benefit from the privacy and security of a vpn across all their devices 4 we use google apps suite and google analytics on our website only with interest and demographics tracking disabled and anonymized ip addresses enabled we use zendesk for our support team 5 primarily we stress that our service is not intended to be used for illegal activities and copyright infringements and we request our users to comply with this when accepting our terms of use in this respect as in all others we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers while following the letter of the law 6 pia has a strict 100 no usage logs policy which has twice been proven in court last year our no logs policy also underwent an independent audit by big four firm deloitte which found that pia s server configurations align with internal privacy policies and confirmed that our infrastructure is not designed to identify users or pinpoint their activities as part of our commitment to transparency we provide a semi annual report containing details about any recent requests made to our legal department as always pia has nothing to share in response to these inquiries as we keep no logs of our customers our company would fight a court order that requires us to do any sort of logging 7 bittorrent and file sharing traffic are not discriminated against or throttled we do not censor our traffic period pia does offer port forwarding and information on how to enable port forwarding can be found here 8 our current payment providers methods include stripe paypal bitpay apple itunes googleplay amazon and paygarden payment details are only linked to accounts for billing purposes ip assignments and other user activity on our vpn servers aren t linkable to specific accounts or payment details because of our strict and demonstrated no log policy 9 at the moment the most secure and practical vpn connection and encryption algorithm that we recommend to our users would be our cipher suite of aes 256 rsa4096 sha256 over openvpn more information for customers can be found on our support portal 10 our users gain access to a plethora of additional tools including but not limited to a robust kill switch ipv6 leak protection and dns leak protection pia s mace feature is also included as standard and offers a dns based ad blocker that helps protect users from ads trackers and malware pia s other security features include identity guard allowing users to monitor whether their emails have been involved in data breaches and an optional privacy first antivirus product offering users additional security online 11 our bare metal servers are located in third party data centers that are operated by trusted business partners with whom we have completed serious due diligence if countries or data centers fail to meet our high privacy standards we remove our vpn server presence often in these instances we would be able to offer virtual server locations instead where the registered ip address matches the country you ve chosen to connect to while the server is physically located in another country usually nearby in addition all of our servers are ram only so any information that has passed through them is erased every time the server reboots 12 pia s server network covers 84 countries and 140 locations including in all 50 us states our full list of server locations can be found here we have been upgrading our servers to superior nextgen servers with 10gbps network cards which help provide reduced server downtime better speeds and security for our users all our servers themselves are physical we do also offer virtual locations as explained above private internet access details 1 no expressvpn doesn t keep any connection or activity logs including never logging browsing history data content dns requests timestamps source ips outgoing ips or destination ips this ensures that we cannot ascertain whether a given user was connected to the vpn at a certain time assumed a particular outgoing ip address or generated any specific network activity kpmg also recently conducted an independent audit which confirmed that our vpn servers are in compliance with our privacy policy this means that users can be confident that we will never know what they do online when connected to our service and that we do not have such sensitive information to share even if compelled to 2 express technologies ltd is a british virgin islands bvi company being under bvi jurisdiction helps to protect user privacy as the bvi has no data retention laws is not party to any 14 eyes intelligence sharing agreements and has a dual criminality provision that safeguards against legal overreach as of september 2021 expressvpn is part of the kape technologies group 3 we reserve the right to block specific abusive traffic to protect the server network and other expressvpn customers with regards to limits on the number of devices simultaneously connected no timestamps or ip addresses are ever logged our systems are merely able to identify how many active sessions a given license has at a given moment in time and use that counter to decide whether a license is allowed to create one additional session this counter is temporary and is not tracked over time 4 we use zendesk for support tickets and snapengage for live chat support we have assessed the security profiles of both and consider them to be secure platforms we use google analytics and cookies to collect marketing metrics for our website and several external tools for collecting crash reports only if a user opts in to sharing these reports 5 as we do not keep any data or logs that could link specific activity to a given user expressvpn does not have the ability to identify or report users 6 legally our company is bound to respect subpoenas and court orders when they originate from the british virgin islands government or in conjunction with bvi authorities via a mutual legal assistance treaty regarding a demand that we log activity going forward were anyone ever to make such a request we would refuse to re engineer our systems in a way that infringes on the privacy protections that our customers trust us to uphold we never store any data that could match an individual to specific network activity or behavior thus we may only inform law enforcement that we do not possess logs of connections or user behavior that could associate a specific end user with an infringing ip address timestamp or destination this was proven in a high profile case in turkey in which law enforcement seized a vpn server leased by expressvpn but could not find any server logs that would enable investigators to link activity to a user or even determine which users or whether a specific user were connected at a given time 7 we do not believe in restricting or censoring any type of traffic on any of our vpn servers including bittorrent traffic we do not support port forwarding 8 expressvpn accepts all major credit cards paypal and a large number of local payment options we also accept bitcoin which we recommend for those who seek maximum privacy with relation to their form of payment as we do not log user activity ip addresses or timestamps neither expressvpn nor any external party can link payment details entered on our website with a user s vpn activities including ip assignments 9 by default expressvpn automatically chooses the protocol best suited to your network depending on a variety of factors for example our in house modern protocol lightway uses a 4096 bit ca with aes 256 gcm and chacha20 poly1305 encryptions d tls 1 2 on udp or tls 1 3 for tcp and sha256 signatures to authenticate traffic 10 yes our network lock feature which is turned on by default prevents all types of traffic including ipv4 ipv6 and dns from leaking outside of the vpn such as when your internet connection drops or in various additional scenarios we do not currently support ipv6 routing through the vpn tunnel expressvpn also protects users from data leaks in a number of ways 11 our vpn servers are hosted in trusted data centers with strong security practices where the data center employees do not have server credentials leased vs co located is not the salient factor in determining security the efforts we take to secure our vpn server infrastructure are extensive and include among other things our proprietary trustedserver technology unique keys per server vpn servers that don t store user data and carefully engineered our apps and vpn servers to categorically eliminate sensitive information we run our own logless dns on every server meaning no personally identifiable data is ever stored we do not use third party dns most recently we were the first vpn provider to pull our servers from india because of the recent directives requiring all vpn providers to store user information for at least five years to ensure that we are delivering the best protections to users we also recently invited both kpmg and cure53 to separately conduct independent audits on our systems and core server technologies 12 expressvpn has servers in 94 countries and also recently upgraded to 10gbps servers for faster speeds and more reliable connections for more than 95 of our servers the physical server and the associated ip addresses are located in the same country for countries where it is difficult to find servers that meet expressvpn s rigorous standards we use virtual locations the specific countries are published on our website here expressvpn website 1 each time a user connects to the service we only obtain a timestamp of the last successful login attempt this gets overwritten each time a user successfully logs in this does not contain any identifying information such as ip addresses or locations we retain this limited information to protect user accounts from password brute force attacks however we do not share any of this data with third parties 2 proton ag 3 users are required to create an account in order to use our service we keep accounting data to see how many sessions are being opened by a given user in order to allow only the number of sessions corresponding to their subscribed plan 4 we use zendesk to collate and respond to support requests or bug reports 5 our anti abuse and legal team investigates the complaints we receive in that regard with all evidence available and make a decision on whether there is good cause to believe that the mentioned accounts are involved in such activities in which case they are suspended we always use swiss law as our reference for such complaints 6 this type of request has never been made for proton vpn that said proton vpn is based in switzerland meaning it would be illegal for us to cooperate with any foreign law enforcement or court unless specifically requested to do so by the swiss authorities however even in this scenario the only information we would have access to would be the username email address and billing information for existing users this data is deleted when an account is deleted 7 some of our servers are optimized for p2p file sharing this feature comes with fast download speeds and unlimited bandwidth 8 we allow users to pay by credit card debit card paypal bitcoin or cash we rely on third parties to process credit card and paypal transactions and we do not save full credit card details 9 we use only the highest strength encryption and would recommend others do the same this means all network traffic is encrypted with aes 256 key exchange is done with 4096 bit rsa and hmac with sha384 is used for message authentication we use only vpn protocols that are known to be secure ikev2 ipsec openvpn and wireguard proton vpn does not have any servers that support pptp and l2tp ipsec even though they are less costly to operate 10 all of our clients support kill switch functionality 11 while we own our secure core entry servers we do also utilize rented infrastructure we only use physical servers that we can fully control as opposed to virtual servers meaning the hardware is dedicated solely to proton vpn giving us a higher degree of control and making it more secure all rented proton vpn servers are secured with block level disk encryption by implementing full disk encryption on all our servers we can protect our certificates and mitigate the risk of mitm attacks and yes all our servers implement dns servers 12 as part of proton ag we share with proton mail the core infrastructure where our websites and databases are hosted this infrastructure is hosted in switzerland and owned by proton ag as part of the vpn infrastructure we own the vpn secure core servers and rent dedicated physical vpn servers across the globe protonvpn website 1 no we do not keep or share with third parties any data that would allow us to match an ip address and a timestamp to a current or former user of our service 2 airvpn in italy no parent company companies 3 no monitoring tools are used in order to limit the amount of simultaneous connections from a single account a counter is kept each new connection increases the counter and each new disconnection decreases the counter if the counter exceeds the amount of concurrent connections allowed purchased for an account a new connection is refused in this way no logging or inspection activity is necessary 4 no we do not use any external email providers analytics or support tools that hold information provided by users 5 they are ignored if they pertain to p2p they are processed verified and handled accordingly rejected or accepted if they pertain to websites or ftp services etc hosted behind our vpn servers 6 a we would co operate to the best of our abilities although we can t give out information we don t have b we are unable to comply due to technical problems and limitations c the scenario in case b has never occurred the scenario in case a has occurred multiple times but our infrastructure does not monitor inspect or log customers traffic so it is not possible to correlate customer information if we had it with customers traffic and vice versa 7 a yes bittorrent and other file sharing traffic are allowed on all servers airvpn does not discriminate against any protocol or application and keeps its network as agnostic as possible b yes we provide remote inbound port forwarding service c outbound port 25 is blocked 8 we accept payments via paypal major credit cards apple pay google pay giropay ideal eps and bancontact we also accept bitcoin litecoin bitcoin cash dash doge and monero by accepting directly various cryptocurrencies without intermediaries we get rid of additional fees and above all privacy issues including correlations between ip addresses and payments by accepting monero we also offer the option to our customers to pay via a cryptocurrency that protects transactions with a built in layer of anonymity 9 chacha20 poly1305 and aes 256 gcm 10 we provide network lock in our free and open source software it can prevent traffic leaks both ipv4 and ipv6 dns leaks included even in case of application or system processes wrong binding in case of upnp caused leaks wrong settings webrtc and other stun related methods and of course in case of unexpected vpn disconnection b yes we do provide ds ipv4 ipv6 access including ipv6 over ipv4 pure ipv4 and pure ipv6 connections in this way even customers whose isp does not support ipv6 can access ipv6 services via airvpn 11 we do not own our datacenters and we are not a transit provider so we buy traffic from tier 1 tier 2 and only occasionally tier 3 providers and we house servers in various datacenters the main countermeasures are exclusive access to ipmi etc via our own external ip addresses or a specific vpn for the ipmi etc reboot inhibition usb support eliminated from kernel all data stored in ram disk and some other methods we prefer not to disclose however if server lines are wiretapped externally and transparently and server tampering does not occur there is no way inside the server to prevent or be aware of ongoing wiretapping wiretapping prevention must be achieved with other methods on the client side some of them are integrated into our software for example vpn over tor tor over vpn etc 12 no we do not offer virtual locations and or vps we declare only real locations of real bare metal servers airvpn website 1 no we do not keep any connect disconnect timestamps or similar information we explain exactly what we don t log and what we monitor in our privacy policy 2 oeck limited we are registered in hong kong as the data retention laws are still in favor of vpn companies and the location is still friendly towards vpn services when and if we need to we can quickly move oeck to singapore if anything in hong kong changes 3 though we allow account sharing for our customers we do limit their total concurrent connections to six this is monitored in real time and there is no logging of this information whatsoever we also do ask that our customers use a designated p2p region if they are going to be doing any torrenting or other p2p activity 4 we use aws for our outbound email however email is never used for correspondence we have a support ticket system that our customers must use in order to communicate with us which is custom made and part of our website tickets are deleted 48 hours after resolution we use matomo for our analytics we went down this path as matomo is hosted by us and no other party has access to it 5 if possible we temporarily suspend usage of the port on the vpn node specified in the complaint that s all we can do as there is no way for us to match anything to any customer the suspension of the specified port on the specified server is lifted after 31 days 6 this has never happened to us however in this event we would only be able to provide a customer s username email address and any possible billing information from our payment providers receipts of payment etc billing information will be impossible if the customer has chosen to pay by cash if we were forced by authorities to log activity moving forward we would simply turn off our servers in the affected jurisdiction we own all of our own hardware even the routers in the datacenter and our exit nodes run without any storage media we will simply turn the switch off we also make use of a warrant canary 7 yes we allow our customers to torrent via our torrent region as it is optimized for that technology although we do not block torrenting in our other regions we do suggest that users use the torrent region when torrenting we provide a very advanced port forwarding service to all of our customers no ports are blocked 8 we use stripe paypal and coinbase commerce for online payments we also accept cash in the mail the only detail we have is if a customer has paid their account or not as far as what the payment providers log they log everything they possibly can we encourage payments via cash if possible 9 we offer openvpn with rsa 4096 and aes 256 gcm 10 our apps come with a kill switch feature for users who choose not to use our apps and use a third party openvpn client instead we have made available socks5 proxies that work just like a kill switch these can only be accessed via our vpn they can be used via a browser app or system wide proxy 11 no all of our hardware is owned by us even the routers are owned by us we do not log any vpn activity our vpn exit nodes do not have hard drives or other storage capabilities everything runs off ram our upstream providers do not have access to our network as our stuff begins at our own routers we only ever use our own dns servers 12 we have a real time monitor of our servers that is a list of our available vpn regions that users can connect to the graph is displaying the information as a per region display this is because we node balance our servers so users always have the best connection though we don t offer virtual locations we do offer residential ip proxies as part of our service there are over 30 regions available and these are used for our smart routing feature oeck website 1 we do not store or log any data that would indicate the identity or the activities of a user 2 the name of the company is cyberdock it solutions gmbh and the jurisdiction is germany 3 the number of connections devices at the same time is not limited because we do not track it in case of malicious activity towards specific targets we block ip addresses or ranges so they are not accessible from our vpn servers additionally we have limits on new outgoing connections for protocols like ssh imap and smtp to prevent automated spam and brute force attacks we do not use any other tools 4 our websites use google analytics to improve the quality of the user experience and it s gdpr compliant with anonymized ip addresses you can prohibit tracking with just one click on a provided link in the privacy policy if a customer has a problem with google he has the possibility to disable the tracking of all google domains in trackstop i believe we are the only vpn provider that offers this possibility all other solutions like email support and even our affiliate program is in house software and under our control 5 because we do not host any data dmca notices do not directly affect us however we generally answer inquiries we point out that we do not keep any data that would allow us to identify a user of the used ip address 6 if we receive a german court order we are forced to provide the data that we have since we don t log any ip addresses timestamps or other connection related data the only step on our side is to inform the inquiring party that we do not have any data that would allow the identification of a user based on that data should we ever receive a legally binding court order that would require us to log the activity of a user going forward we d rather shut down the servers in the country concerned than compromise our user s privacy there have been incidents in the past where perfect privacy servers have been seized but no user information was compromised that way since no logs are stored in the first place and additionally all our services are running within ram disks a server seizure will never compromise our customers although we are not subject to us based laws there s a warrant canary page available 7 with the exception of our us servers and french servers bittorrent and other file sharing software is allowed we offer port forwarding and do not block any ports 8 we offer bitcoin paypal and credit cards for users who prefer these options and over 60 other payment methods of course it is guaranteed that payment details are not associated with any ip addresses the only thing you know about a person is that he or she is a customer of perfect privacy and which email address was used 9 the most secure protocol we recommend is still openvpn with 256 bit aes gcm encryption with our vpn manager for mac and windows you also have the possibility to create cascades over four vpn servers this multi hop feature works tunnel in tunnel if you choose countries for the hops which are known not to cooperate with each other well you get the idea on top of that you can activate our neurorouting feature which changes the routing depending on the destination of the visited domain and dynamically selects different hops for the outgoing server to ensure it is geographically close to the visited server 10 yes our servers support full dual stack ipv4 ipv6 functionality even when your isp does not support ipv6 our vpn manager has a kill switch which has configurable protection with three security levels 11 we run dedicated bare metal servers in various data centers around the world while we have no physical access to the servers they all are running within ram disks only and are fully encrypted 12 currently we offer servers in 25 countries worldwide all servers are located in the city displayed in the hostname there are no virtual locations for full details about all servers locations please check our server status site as we are constantly adding new servers perfect privacy website 1 no we don t keep any logs we have developed our system with an eye on our customers privacy so we created a distributed vpn cluster with independent public nodes that do not store any customer data or logs at all 2 hide me vpn is operated by eventure limited and based in malaysia with no legal obligation to store any user logs at all 3 we do not limit or monitor individual connections to mitigate abuse we deploy general firewall rules on some servers that apply to specific ip ranges 4 our website does not include third party tracking tools for live support we embed zendesk in a privacy friendly two click solution so it does not load by default and no personal data is shared 5 since we don t store any logs and or host infringing copyright material on our services we ll reply to these notices accordingly 6 although it has never happened in such a scenario we won t be able to entertain the court orders because our infrastructure is built in a way that it does not store any logs and there is no way we could link any particular cyber activity to any particular user in case we are forced to store user logs we would prefer to close down rather than putting our users at stake who have put their trust in us 7 there is no effective way of blocking file sharing traffic without monitoring our customers which is against our principles and would be even illegal usually we only recommend our customers to avoid the us uk locations for file sharing but it is on a self regulatory basis since these countries have strong anti copyright laws in place 8 we support a wide range of popular payment methods including all major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin litecoin ethereum dash monero paypal credit cards and nank transfer all payments are handled by external payment providers and are linked to a temporary payment id this temporary payment id can not be connected to the user s vpn account activity after the payment is completed the temporary payment id will be permanently removed from the database 9 after all modern vpn protocols that we all support like wireguard ikev2 openvpn softethervpn and sstp are considered secure even after the nsa leaks we follow cryptographic standards and configured our vpn servers accordingly in order to support a secure key exchange with 8192 bit key size and a strong symmetric encryption aes 256 for the data transfer 10 our desktop client supports security features such as multihop double vpn kill switch firewall to limit apps to vpn firewall to limit all connections to vpn split tunnel auto connect auto reconnect etc which makes sure that the connection is always secure above all we have put in some additional layers of security which include default protection against ip and dns leaks hide me is one of the few vpn providers that supports dual stack ipv4 and ipv6 so our customers do not need to worry about potential ip leaks 11 we operate our own non logging dns servers to protect our customers from dns hijacking and similar attacks we do not own physical hardware but in case there is intrusion detection and other various security measures in place to ensure the integrity and security of all our single servers furthermore we choose all third party hosting providers very carefully so we can assure that there are certain security standards in place iso 27001 and no unauthorized person could access our servers among our reputable partners are nforce m247 psychz networks and many more similar to apple s private relay our dynamic multihop double vpn feature allows us to route tunnel the connection over multiple server locations neither the incoming or outgoing server can match users activity which provides an extra layer of security 12 our servers are located in countries all over the world hide me website 1 trust zone doesn t store any logs therefore we have no data that could be linked and attributed to the current or former user all we need from customers is an email to sign up 2 trust zone is under seychelles jurisdiction the company is operated by internet privacy ltd 3 our system can understand how many active sessions a given license has at a given moment in time this counter is temporarily placed in ram and never logged or saved anywhere 4 trust zone has never used any third party tools like google analytics live chat platform support tools or others 5 if we receive any type of dmca requests or copyright infringement notices we ignore them trust zone is under offshore jurisdiction out of 14 eyes surveillance alliance there is no data retention law in seychelles 6 a court order would not be enforceable because we do not log information and therefore there is nothing to be had from our servers trust zone supports warrant canary trust zone has not received or been subject to any searches seizures of data or requirements to log any actions of our customers 7 bittorrent and file sharing traffic is allowed on all trust zone servers moreover we don t restrict any kind of traffic trust zone does not throttle or block any protocols ip addresses servers or any type of traffic whatsoever we offer port forwarding to increase download speeds for torrents 8 all major credit cards are accepted paypal alipay wire transfer and many other types of payments are available as we don t store any logs there is no way to link payment details with a user s internet activity 9 we use the most recommended protocols in the vpn industry wireguard openvpn ikev2 ipsec l2tp ipsec softether socks5 proxy trust zone uses aes 256 encryption by default 10 trust zone supports a kill switch function we also own our dns servers and provide users with the ability to use our dns to avoid any dns leaks all features listed above are also available with our free plan which doesn t require a credit card to start we also provide users with additional recommendations to be sure that there are no webrtc leaks dns leaks or ip leaks 11 we have a mixed infrastructure trust zone owns some physical servers and we have access to them physically in locations with lower utilization we normally host with third parties but the most important point is that we use dedicated servers in this case only with full control by our network administrators dns queries go through our own dns servers 12 we are operating with 200 dedicated servers in 100 geo zones and are still growing we also provide users with dedicated ip addresses and port forwarding the full map of the server locations is available here trust zone website 1 no 2 windscribe limited ontario canada 3 byte count of all traffic sent through the network in a one month period as well as a count of parallel connections at any given moment 4 no everything is self hosted 5 our transparency policy is available here 6 under canadian law a vpn company cannot be compelled to wiretap users we can be legally compelled to provide the data that we already have as per our tos and we would have to comply with a valid canadian court order since we do not store any identifying info that can link an ip to an account the fact that emails are optional to register and the service can be paid for with cryptocurrency none of what we store is identifying 7 we allow p2p traffic in most locations yes we provide port forwarding for all pro users only ports above 1024 are allowed 8 stripe paypal coinpayments paymentwall ip addresses of users are not stored or linked to payments 9 the encryption parameters are similar for all protocols we support aes 256 cipher with sha512 auth and a 4096 bit rsa key we recommend using ikev2 as it s a kernel space protocol that is faster than openvpn in most cases we also support wireguard 10 our desktop apps have a built in firewall that blocks all connectivity outside of the tunnel they also have split routing per process or network level mac address spoofing and external dns server support in an event of a connection drop it fails closed nothing needs to be done the firewall protects against all leaks ipv4 ipv6 and dns we only support ipv4 connectivity at this time 11 we lease servers in over 150 different datacenters worldwide some datacenters deploy networking monitoring for the purposes of ddos protection we request to disable it whenever possible but this is not feasible in all places even with it in place since most servers have dozens hundreds of users connected to them at any given moment your activity gets lost in the crowd each vpn server operates a recursive dns server and performs all dns resolution locally 12 our server overview is available here we don t offer virtual locations windscribe website 1 no all details are explained in our no logging data policy update april 2023 mullvad was subject to a search warrant but the company reports that customer data wasn t compromised 2 mullvad vpn ab swedish the parent company is amagicom ab swedish 3 we mitigate abuse by blocking the usage of ports 25 137 139 and 445 due to email spam and windows security issues openvpn number of connections each vpn server reports to a central service when a customer connects to a vpn server the server asks the central service to validate the account number whether or not the account has any remaining time if the account has reached its allowed number of connections and so on everything is performed in temporary memory only none of this information is permanently stored on disk wireguard number of connections each vpn server reports public keys connected to a central service if a key is abused it will be revoked our servers send two types of data to our monitoring system aggregated application data such as the total number of current vpn connections and generic system metrics such as cpu load per core and total bandwidth used by the server we log the total sum of each of these statistics in order to monitor the health of each individual vpn server we ensure that the system isn t overloaded and we monitor the servers for potential attacks bugs and network issues we also monitor the real time state of total connections per account as we only allow for five connections simultaneously as we do not save this information we cannot for example tell you how many connections your account had five minutes ago for wireguard we have a limit of a maximum of 5 keys i e 5 devices 4 we have no external elements at all on our website except for pulling in external elements when customers select stripe payments these elements are not loaded until the user selects pay by and a method that stripe supplies we do use an external email provider for those who want to email us we encourage them to use pgp encryption which is the only effective way to keep email somewhat private the decrypted content is only available to us 5 as explained here there is no such swedish law that is applicable to us 6 from time to time we are contacted by governments asking us to divulge information about our customers given that we don t store activity logs of any kind we have no information to give out worst case scenario we would discontinue the servers in the affected countries the only information at all possible for us to give out is records of payments since these are stored at paypal banks etc 7 all traffic is treated equally therefore we do not block or throttle bittorrent or other file sharing protocols port forwarding is allowed update may 2023 it is now disabled 8 we accept cash bitcoin bitcoin cash bank wire credit card paypal giropay eps transfer bancontact ideal przelewy24 and swish we encourage anonymous payments via cash or one of the cryptocurrencies we run our own full node in each of the blockchains and do not use third parties for any step in the payment process from the generation of qr codes to adding time to accounts our website explains how we handle payment information you can also pay in app on the apple store using the mullvad ios app 9 we offer openvpn with rsa 4096 and aes 256 gcm and we also offer wireguard which uses curve25519 and chacha20 poly1305 10 we offer a kill switch and dns leak protection both of which are supported in ipv6 as ipv4 while the kill switch is only available via our client app we also provide a socks5 proxy that works as a kill switch and is only accessible through our vpn 11 at 14 of our locations 4 in sweden 1 in denmark 1 in amsterdam 2 in norway 1 in the uk 2 in finland 1 in germany 1 in paris 1 in zurich we own and have physical control over all of our servers in our other locations we rent physical dedicated servers and bandwidth from carefully selected providers keep in mind that we have 3 locations in the uk and 3 in germany the servers we physically own are the ones hosted by 31173 se they start with gb lon 0 and de fra 0 and gb4 wireguard gb5 wireguard de4 wireguard and de5 wireguard all servers are 10gbps yes we use our own dns servers all dns traffic routed via our tunnel is hijacked even if you set accidentally select another dns our dns will anyhow be used except if you have set up dns over https or dns over tls or if you use a custom dns in our app 12 we don t have virtual locations all locations are listed here mullvad website 1 no we believe that not logging vpn connection related data is fundamental to any privacy service regardless of the security or policies implemented to protect the log data specifically we don t log traffic dns requests connection timestamps and durations bandwidth ip address or any account activity except simultaneous connections 2 privatus limited gibraltar no parent or holding companies 3 we limit simultaneous connections by maintaining a temporary counter on a central server that is deleted when the user disconnects we detail this process in our privacy policy 4 no we made a strategic decision from day one that no company or customer data would ever be stored on third party systems all our internal services run on our own dedicated servers that we set up configure and manage no third parties have access to our servers or data we don t host any external scripts web trackers or tracking pixels on our website we also refuse to engage in advertising on platforms with surveillance based business models like google or facebook 5 our legal department sends a reply stating that we do not store content on our servers and that our vpn servers act only as a conduit for data in addition we inform them that we never store the ip addresses of customers connected to our network nor are we legally required to do so we have a detailed legal process guideline published on our website 6 if asked to identify a customer based on a timestamp and or ip address then we would reply factually that we do not store this information if legally compelled to log activity going forward we would do everything in our power to alert the relevant customers directly or indirectly through our warrant canary 7 we do not block any traffic or ports on any servers update port forwarding will be gradually removed 8 we accept bitcoin cash monero paypal and credit cards when using cash there is no link to a user account within our system when using bitcoin the transaction is processed through our self hosted btcpay server we store bitcoin transaction ids in our system if you wish to remain anonymous to ivpn you should take the necessary precautions when purchasing bitcoin we accept monero directly to our self hosted wallet and no third party has access to payment information when paying with paypal or a credit card a token is stored that is used to process recurring payments but this is not linked in any way to vpn account usage or ip assignments 9 we offer and recommend wireguard a high performance protocol that utilizes state of the art cryptography alternatively we also offer openvpn with rsa 4096 aes 256 gcm which we also believe is more than secure enough for the purposes for which we provide our service 10 yes the ivpn client offers an advanced vpn firewall that blocks every type of ip leak possible including ipv6 dns network failures webrtc stun etc our vpn clients work on a dual stack ipv4 ipv6 but we currently only support ipv4 on our vpn gateways full ipv6 support is in the pipeline 11 we use bare metal dedicated servers leased from third party data centers in each country where we have a presence we install each server using our own custom images and employ full disk encryption to ensure that if a server is ever seized the data is worthless we also operate an exclusive multi hop network allowing customers to choose an entry and exit server in different jurisdictions which would make the task of legally gaining access to servers at the same time significantly more difficult we operate our own network of log free dns servers that are only accessible to our customers through the vpn tunnel 12 we have servers in 32 countries no virtual locations the full list of servers is available here ivpn website 1 if the question relates to the vpn server s ip address and a user s online activity while connected to vpn then the answer is no 2 atlas vpn is incorporated under peakstar technologies inc we operate in delaware s usa jurisdiction 3 we use an automated system that monitors the number of simultaneous connections per account yet we do not store this information the free version of our service is limited to 2 concurrent connections worth noting that our premium subscription does not limit the number of concurrent connections 4 we mainly use zendesk to communicate with our users we also use google analytics and appsflyer to monitor application and website data 5 atlas vpn is considered to be a transmission service provider as per 512 a of the digital millennium copyright act dmca and not a storage service provider transmission service providers have no obligations to react to take down notices or enable counter notices 6 we would comply with a justified court order in a manner that would be deemed appropriate after consultation with legal counsel it would naturally depend on the court order on what steps we would need to take to ensure compliance as far as logging future activity we would do whatever it takes to protect our users privacy we can not say how the process would unfold as we have never received any court order of this nature 7 yes it is allowed no port forwarding services are provided smtp ports are blocked to prevent email abuse 8 stripe as well as google pay for the convenience of our users paypal as well as reseller services such as google play and app store the details can be linked with account usage as far as app analytics go they can be linked with ongoing sessions this linkage is deleted as the vpn session is terminated 9 it depends on the platform of the application we use the ipsec ikev2 protocol and depending on the platform we recommend diffie hellman group 20 and 256 bit chacha20 poly1305 with 128 bit icv 10 yes these are implemented using platform tools we do support dual stack functionality 11 all of our servers are hosted by third parties we perform proper due diligence to ensure that the partners are reliable even if partners tried snooping they would not be able to do so since inbound and outbound traffic from the client is encrypted we do use our own dns servers 12 they are located in the countries that are shown in our applications at any given time no virtual locations are offered atlasvpn website 1 no we do not share any user information with any third party we do not store or log any information about which users accessed which domain names or ip addresses we do not log customers ip addresses 2 connectify inc operating under us jurisdiction 3 we monitor with a set of self hosted open source tools including prometheus and grafana 4 we don t use third party analytics tools our help desk is built on helpscout messages are automatically deleted after a time period 5 we politely reply that we do not collect enough information to be of any use 6 we properly respond to law enforcement and offer the information which is in our logs which as previously noted is not helpful for connecting users to activity we would fight any order that attempted to force us to log a user activity going forward we have received subpoenas for information about various ip addresses before we have never been asked or ordered to attempt to log information about any user going forward 7 speedify has dedicated servers for p2p traffic most of our servers do not allow bittorrent traffic we do provide port forwarding and static ip address services with our dedicated vpn servers only port 25 is blocked as unencrypted smtp is dangerous and insecure even to the sender and has no legitimate use 8 speedify offers a variety of ways to pay including apple app store google play store recurly paypal and fastspring purchases through apple app store and google play store do not provide us with any information about the purchaser unless the user provides it to us directly 9 we default to 256 bit aes encryption those concerned about security may wish to turn on the killswitch to ensure traffic does not go out while the vpn is not connected 10 yes we support killswitch it is not on by default but it s available in the settings menu yes we have built in dns and ipv6 leak protection the software supports dual stack ipv4 ipv6 but not all our deployed servers are on ipv6 it s rolling out to more and more servers as we speak 11 speedify vpn servers are hosted by third parties on the vpn side traffic is entirely encrypted internet traffic from clients is run through a server side tcp proxy to erase hints in ip and tcp headers such as rtt which a sophisticated opponent could otherwise use to tease apart traffic from different operating systems then the traffic is nated together often 1000 users sharing a single ip address to make individuals impossible to trace we proxy the dns before forwarding it to trusted privacy oriented dns partners 12 our servers are constantly changing in areas with few users we will use virtual servers but in most cases we will use hardware servers speedify website 1 cyberghost has a strict no logs policy so none of our traffic or dns servers log or store any user info customers can rest assured that we keep absolutely no logs of any of our customers activities 2 cyberghost has been part of kape technologies a leading privacy first consumer software provider since 2017 3 our dedicated team monitors the whole service and infrastructure for any abuse of service we have several tools in place from cdn protection to firewalls and our own server monitoring system concurrent connections limits are monitored also enforced via our systems to avoid such types of abuses 4 we use google analytics for website analytics zendesk for customer support and iterable for customer communications 5 back in 2011 we were the first in the vpn industry to publish a transparency report it s something we still do today when we launch our reports quarterly our latest transparency report for q1 2023 can be found here regardless of the number of dmca takedown notices or legal requests we receive our reply is always the same we keep no user logs and so we cannot comply with the request 6 since we store no logs such requests do not affect us under romanian law data retention is not mandatory this allows us to give our ghosties complete digital privacy 7 many of our servers do support bittorrent and cyberghost offers servers that are optimized for private and secure file sharing and safe and anonymous access to torrent sites for legal downloads in some countries local legislation prevents us from offering adequate service for torrenting other locations have performance constraints we currently do not support port forwarding services what s more specific ports related to email services are also blocked as an anti spam security measure 8 our current payment providers are cleverbridge stripe bitpay braintree and paddle we do not store any payment details these are handled by our payment providers which are entirely payment card industry data security standard compliant 9 we generally favor the aes 256 encryption platform protocol wide for its good balance of performance and security 10 cyberghost features an automatically integrated kill switch as a robust and reliable security feature this is turned on by default protecting users should their vpn connection ever be disrupted cyberghost does not support dual stack 11 we use disk encryption to make sure no third party can access the contents of our vpn servers furthermore we have additional server authenticity tests in place to eliminate the risk of man in the middle attacks we use self managed dns servers to ensure the e2e protection of online activity 12 most of our servers are physically located within the borders of the specified country we do also offer virtual locations for countries or locations where physical servers are not possible our server fleet now covers over 90 countries and over 115 different locations allowing our users to browse safely and anonymously across the world more details are available here cyberghost website 1 no information is shared with any third parties apart from the method of payments through our affiliate program the only information fastestvpn processes are email addresses and payment methods no amount of identifiable data is stored that could be led back to any user 2 fastest technologies is the parent company that operates under the jurisdiction of the cayman islands being placed under this location makes it easier to protect user privacy and prevent data retention under bound policies our jurisdiction is not among any of the 14 eyes country alliances 3 the maximum number of connections that fastestvpn allows is 10 multi connections if or when our system detects an unusual number of unsubscribed connections with our service the user is notified and the account is temporarily suspended until a solution is brought up here are the tools we utilize maxmind for fraudulent payment detector cloudflare for websites to prevent ddos attack bugsnag for error logging radius for limited connection control 4 postmark for transactional emails google analytics for website monitoring tawk to for customer services and bugsnag do not store identifiable data all third party services associated with us are bound by legal contract never to misuse or compromise any stored minute data 5 it never comes to the point of being handled due to dmca notices not being applicable to the cayman islands jurisdiction 6 it hasn t we neither store nor share any sensitive data from our users we have ram based servers that never store any amount of data received all our servers are also audited by an independent firm altius it which has ensured that we do not keep users data 7 no fastestvpn does not restrict access to bittorrent or p2p based services and is supported on most of our servers however on the matter of port forwarding we do not offer it 8 fastestvpn uses a payment method service from fastspring that is a well know payment gateway service provider we make sure that the details of the payments taken from our users are charged completely on the user s consent and decision we ensure that all payments are issued according to the subscription a user has chosen 9 by default fastestvpn has auto protocol enabled which again depends on the server you choose and according to the network connection you ve enabled our auto protocol option detects and connects you with the best protocol for your network other than that all apps and protocols are secured with aes 256 bit encryption with the inclusion of our latest wireguard technology 10 yes fastestvpn does support a kill switch option for all our apps we also support dns ipv6 leak protection right now fastestvpn apps support both by converting ipv6 to ipv4 which means if we receive an ipv6 connection request we convert it to ipv4 11 we have physically hosted servers in major countries few servers are virtual but ram based this means no data can be maintained or logged on either side apart from that yes we have our own dns servers 12 we have physical servers in 40 countries including the usa uk canada australia germany france and all the major countries our virtual servers are in india russia and the uae fastestvpn website 1 no we do not record or store any logs related to our services we do not log traffic user activity timestamps ip addresses number of active and total sessions dns requests or similar data 2 the registered company name is netbouncer ab and we operate under swedish jurisdiction there are no data retention laws for vpn providers in sweden 3 we take extra security steps to harden our servers they are prepared by removing their hard drives their custom base image runs in ram the operating system is hardened with a method we call blind operator 2 0 which means that local tty or remote ssh access is blocked the servers are completely headless after deployment and it is not possible to log in to them as for abuses such as incoming ddos attacks filtering on the attacker s source port is used to mitigate them 4 no we do not rely on and refuse to use third party vendors we run our own email infrastructure and encourage people to use pgp encryption when contacting us the ticketing support system website analytics matomo with anonymization settings and other tools are all open source or custom software hosted in house 5 we inform the sender that we do not keep any logs and cannot identify a user 6 a court may issue an order requiring us to identify a user in this case we will first ensure that the order is valid we will then inform the other party that because of our unique infrastructure we cannot identify any current or former user of our service if they force us to give them physical access to a server they will not be able to do anything the reason for this is that the servers block local tty and remote ssh access as part of blind operator 2 0 making it impossible to log in to a server to date we have never received a court order and have never provided any personal information 7 yes bittorrent peer to peer and file sharing traffic is allowed and treated the same as any other traffic on all of our servers we do not offer port forwarding services yet but we are working on it and expect to release it in the coming weeks 8 anonymous payment methods include cryptocurrencies or sending cash through the mail available cryptocurrencies include bitcoin litecoin monero and a few others traditional payment methods such as paypal with or without recurring payments credit cards visa mastercard and american express via stripe and swish are accepted we do not store any sensitive payment information on our servers only an internal reference code for order confirmation all transaction information is deleted from our database after six months 9 we recommend the use of our wireguard servers wireguard is a lightweight and powerful modern vpn protocol our custom applications are available for windows android macos and ios otherwise it is preferable to use official tools on linux macos and routers using openwrt or dd wrt 10 we provide easy to use and similar looking custom vpn applications for windows android macos and ios that do not require any configuration file manipulation we plan to add a kill switch and dns leak protection to our desktop applications in the future we provide our users with a full dual ipv4 ipv6 stack on all servers this eliminates the need for loose ipv6 leak protection in the coming weeks it will also be possible to connect to our wireguard servers via a native ipv6 line 11 we physically own all of our servers in all of the locations we offer our team ships them to data centers that meet our strict criteria such as the availability of neutral and privacy conscious internet providers and closed racks for security we also host our non logging local dns servers in each location our vpn tunnels use them by default static dns servers are also available 12 we currently have 78 servers in 25 locations in the past year we have added new servers in finland hong kong singapore and 3 new locations in the united states there are no virtual locations azirevpn website 1 we do not 2 dnsfilter inc united states of america 3 no limits on concurrent connections though we may introduce bandwidth throttling if we notice huge amounts being consumed we still won t track just would limit speeds in such cases 4 zendesk so if you send an e mail to support it will have a help ticket for the inquiry you ve sent no analytics 5 we simply block the port that they allege was in use we do not retain any useful records and thus have no further action to take 6 we have not had such a case occur if one were to happen we would engage with our legal counsel on how to fight it 7 we currently have no terms for or against specific types of traffic if a dmca request is filed and says a specific port is being used for file sharing activity we will block the port 8 we use apple s in app purchase system on ios and stripe on the web our payment authorization systems are separated from our vpn credential generation systems 9 we offer ikev2 as mentioned above but are now also offering wireguard and encourage our users to consider using it 10 we currently only support ipv4 with ipv6 on our roadmap we do not support what may be deemed a kill switch in a traditional sense due to the limitations of ios 11 we use 1 1 1 1 for dns and we use bare metal servers not shared vms on our hosting provider we are in the process of setting up our own data centers 12 we have servers located in the united states canada brazil france germany italy netherlands switzerland united kingdom japan singapore and australia guardian website 1 our entire infrastructure and vpn service is built to ensure that no logs can be stored anywhere our servers are locked in cabinets and operate without any hard drives we use a tailored version of alpine which doesn t support sata controllers usb ports etc 2 ovpn integritet ab org no 556999 4469 we operate under swedish jurisdiction in may 2023 opvn was acquired by pango 3 we don t monitor abuse in order to limit concurrent connections our vpn servers validate account credentials by making a request to our website our web server keeps track of the number of connected devices this is stored as a value of 0 4 where it is increased by one when a user connects and decreased by one when a user disconnects 4 for website insights we use matomo piwik an open source solution that we host ourselves the last two bytes of visitors ip addresses are anonymized hence no individual users can be identified automatic emails from the website are sent using postmark intercom is used for support 5 since we don t store any information such requests aren t applicable to us 6 ovpn has proven in court that no logs are stored furthermore a court wouldn t be able to require logging in our jurisdiction but in case that changes in the future we would move the company abroad ovpn has insurance that covers legal fees as an additional layer of safety which grants us the financial muscles to refute any requests for information 7 we don t do any traffic discrimination as such bittorrent and other file sharing traffic are allowed on all servers we do provide port forwarding services as incoming ports are blocked by default the allowed port range is 49152 to 65535 for other ports we recommend users to purchase our public ipv4 add on 8 paypal credit cards via braintree bitcoin via coinpayments ethereum via coinpayments monero via coinpayments cash in envelopes as well as a swedish payment system called swish we never log the ip addresses of users so we can t correlate an ip address to a payment 9 ovpn s default setting is to use wireguard as vpn protocol 10 our desktop client provides a kill switch as well as dns leak protection all our servers support dual stack ipv4 ipv6 our browser extension blocks webrtc leaks 11 we own all the servers used to operate our service all vpn servers run without any hard drives instead we use tmpfs storage in ram writing permissions for the openvpn processes have been removed as well as syslogs our vpn servers do not support physical console access keyboard access or usb access the servers are colocated in various data centers that meet our requirements ovpn does not rent any physical or virtual servers we operate our own dns servers 12 we do not offer any virtual locations all our regions are listed here we have photos of our servers at all locations which are viewable by clicking on the region names ovpn website 1 ivacy vpn does not keep any personally identifiable information on any of its users since we do not keep such information there is no way to share private information with third parties the only bit of information we collect is email address against which the account is bound and payment details which are necessary in order to issue a paid subscription plus we also offer more anonymous ways of making a transaction if you re concerned about your privacy like cryptocurrencies as for what information is collected none contains any identifiable information or user data like dns requests traffic details or ip addresses the only thing known is the countries where users originate from 2 the company is registered as ivacy vpn and is a part of pmg pte ltd ivacy mainly operates from singapore with some remote resources working from other parts of the world as such we re only answerable to singaporean laws 3 we employ a few essential tools which are as follows firebase crashlytics google analytics and itunes 4 apart from the tools mentioned above we also utilize third party tools like zendesk customer service support ticketing and livechat help desk software to provide outstanding customer support and quick delivery of service we keep a record of all our correspondence this includes a record of complaints questions and compliments submitted via our website extensions or apps 5 when a user connects with ivacy he she becomes anonymous therefore we cannot connect specific activities with specific users since we don t keep any logs or records however if a case is forwarded to our legal department appropriate measures will be taken to address the issue promptly 6 as mentioned earlier ivacy vpn does not keep any personally identifiable information on any of its users which is also in accordance with the gdpr because of this we do not have any information to give to anyone even if it is a court order such scenarios have never played out in the past because ivacy vpn is a gdpr complaint vpn provider 7 yes bittorrent and other file sharing traffic are allowed on our p2p optimized servers ivacy also keeps striving to improve its product and as such new p2p servers within the same country and new countries with p2p protocols will keep on adding in the future we do offer port forwarding services as well however all ports are blocked by default and need to be enabled by users according to their needs and requirements 8 ivacy vpn utilizes the following payment systems providers debit credit cardm paypal bitpay coingate and perfectmoney please note ivacy vpn utilizes third party payment processors these third party payment processors are evaluated regularly ensuring our users data is not used for any other purpose except for processing payments it is important to note though that the payment data provided rests with the respective payment processors therefore in those instances where we process data it is passed on to the processor without keeping any record of it at our end 9 openvpn with the aes 256 gcm encryption

christopher porter s research group at the monash institute of pharmaceutical sciences mips and is expected to commence formal preclinical studies in h2 of 2022 in preparation for clinical studies in 2023 the rationale for the proposed transaction the directors of vtl through their capital raising efforts for the company to date have received a clear message from investors that vtl s combination of both a human consumer health business and a drug development business is difficult for most investors to understand there are investors who understand and are interested in investing in a human consumer health business which has the potential to generate imminent revenues from product sales and there are other investors who understand and are interested in investing in a drug development business which has the potential to generate massive growth in company value through achievement of clinical development and corporate transaction milestones however it is seldom that both these groups of investors intersect further the drug development business is more suitable for listing on a stock exchange which caters better for capital intensive high growth companies in the biotechnology sector therefore the directors see the proposed transaction as beneficial to vtl as it allows the company to focus all of its resources on the commercialisation of nutraceutical products globally and to target the appropriate investor base for this type of business at the same time the equity stake which vtl has in ivbhl through this transaction will allow vtl s shareholders to share in any value generated by ivbhl should the drug development activities bear fruit without the need for vtl to invest heavily in ivbhl s drug development program about vgi health technology limited vgi health technology limited nsx vtl is an australian public listed biotechnology company developing and commercialising novel dietary supplements and prescription medicines based on natural products tocotrienols which have wide therapeutic potential including delayed onset muscle soreness muscle recovery exercise endurance non alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld non alcoholic steatohepatitis nash

to the target tissues the company has a product development program for evidence based nutraceuticals and a clinical development program for prescription medicines related companies

overseas and domestic individual investors have been at opposite ends of the spectrum since october at one end foreigners have been selling indian stocks relentlessly at the other retail investors have been mopping up the share supply by overseas funds cushioning the impact of their selling on the market the contrasting investment strategies have raised questions on who could end up being right this time the foreign selling in february so far has extended to the fifth month in a row since october they have dumped shares worth almost 80 000 crore foreigners have sold more only on two other occasions 2008 and 2018 big outflows have mostly resulted in sharp market falls in the past but this time the impact has been relatively gentle the nifty has been swinging wildly in the past few weeks but in a 750 1000 point range while the volatility has wiped out several derivative traders especially the newcomers who jumped on to the bandwagon amid the bull run in the past 20 months the downsides in the portfolios of a wider section of individual investors have been limited compared to the past instances when foreigners sold at this pace the foreign selling is not an india specific event the outflows have been driven by emerging market em exchange traded funds etfs a lot of which is essentially hot money and chases performing markets the redemptions from em etfs started after the sell off in chinese stocks following beijing s clampdown on its technology giants and new age businesses coupled with the evergrande crisis eroding values of these funds the underperformance of china which has the highest country weightage on the em index of 32 dragged down em funds what compounded the problems for ems is the dollar strengthening following the hawkish turn in us fed s commentary with inflation becoming stickier and surging oil prices specific to india its rich share valuations went against it discouraging long term foreign funds from bringing in fresh money though they have not sold in a big way in recent months many em value investors prefer china over india these days because of cheaper valuations global macro watcher ritesh jain is more bullish on ems with positive real interest rates like china and brazil which have the room to cut rates as the us fed prepares to start unwinding its covid era stimulus programme and even tighten rates in the face of strong consumer inflation the highest since 1982 there are conflicting views on the impact of tighter us monetary policy on emerging markets one version is that historically emerging markets have mostly performed well after the american central bank increased rates a recent charles schwab study of em performances a year after the first fed rate hike since 1988 showed that the msci em index has risen on four out of the six occasions since 1999 msci em has risen on all three such instances some on wall street are also taking a view that the fed cannot afford to raise rates too aggressively and allow a run away rally in the us dollar as that would hurt the economic recovery the central bank might be wary of jolting the financial markets too a big risk off could lead to tightening of markets including a sharp equity sell off and widening of credit spreads the other camp believes that the fed has no option but to raise rates rapidly because of decade high inflation levels chatter of an inter meeting rate hike by fed before the next review on march 16 is getting louder on wall street after last week s inflation reading as global investors try to navigate tricky waters locals are raising their bets on stocks as seen in mutual fund flow numbers in the past four months domestic investors who are going all out into richly valued equities now might be underestimating the simmering risks in the global financial markets in the past 14 years the market has been quite used to regular fed interventions in a crisis which has been followed by outsized returns in risk assets with inflation pressures building and the fed being perceived to be way behind the curve in its response to rising prices the worry is that the american central bank might not have the same firepower to keep markets ticking up investors haven t seen anything like this in recent years
