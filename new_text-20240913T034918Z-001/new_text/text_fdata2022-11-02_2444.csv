quarter of 2022 reflecting higher margins and increased production sales third quarter financial results were much improved compared to the third quarter of 2021 as semiconductor and other supply shortages had a pronounced impact on prior year volumes 2023 is expected to be a strong year with higher sales margins earnings and free cash flow 1 compared to 2022 compared to 2022 net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio continues to strengthen ratio continues to strengthen quarterly cash dividend of 0 05 declared overview pat d eramo president and chief executive officer stated our third quarter financial results were a solid improvement over our second quarter performance on better production sales and a higher adjusted operating income margin 1 compared to last quarter third quarter results benefitted from improved volume and mix a reduction of launch related costs and continued improvements in our martinrea operating system or lean activity we also continue to make good progress on recovering inflationary costs through commercial negotiations with our customers i am proud of the work our team has done here these negotiations have a lot of layers and are never simple but we have concluded several agreements on acceptable terms and we expect to see additional progress as the year comes to an end he added overall our third quarter results were as expected and we expect a strong finish to the year with good momentum into 2023 having said that we continue to face a challenging environment on several fronts while we have seen a steady improvement in the production environment since last year we continue to deal with supply related disruptions from several of our customers inflationary cost pressures continue energy costs remain a significant headwind in our european business interest rates have risen and cut into our free cash flow the good news is we continue to expect that 2023 will mark the beginning of a strong cycle for our business with the majority of our plants running at full or near full capacity fred di tosto chief financial officer stated sales for the third quarter excluding tooling sales of 67 0 million were 1 127 1 million and adjusted net earnings per share 1 was 0 56 adjusted operating income 1 of 69 7 million and adjusted ebitda 1 of 140 2 million were much improved over the second quarter up approximately 53 and 23 respectively adjusted ebitda 1 was a quarterly record for the company overall a strong quarter in a challenging environment free cash flow 1 was 64 1 million up sharply over the prior quarter reflecting higher adjusted ebitda 1 and positive working capital flows we expect free cash flow 1 to be positive for the full year of 2022 he continued net debt 1 was approximately flat quarter over quarter at 928 2 million net debt would have actually decreased by greater than 40 million if not for foreign exchange translations recall that under our amended lending agreements with our banking syndicate that we announced earlier this year adjusted ebitda 1 is ignored for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 with the remaining quarters in the trailing twelve month period pro rated when calculating net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 for covenant purposes on this basis our calculated net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio under the revised terms was 2 17x in the third quarter down from 2 38x in the second quarter a comfortable level and well below the covenant maximum our leverage ratio should naturally continue to improve in the coming quarters as we generate an increasing amount of adjusted ebitda 1 and free cash flow 1 a portion of which we will use to pay down debt in sum our balance sheet is in good shape we have strong relationships with our lenders and we thank them for their continued support rob wildeboer executive chairman stated our third quarter financial results were outstanding with record sales record adjusted ebitda 1 excellent free cash flow 1 and solid net earnings quite the accomplishment especially in the context of the challenging world in which we live headwinds remain from continued production volatility and stubbornly high input costs as such we are updating our 2023 outlook we now expect 2023 total sales to be between 4 8 and 5 0 billion adjusted operating income margin 1 to be between 6 7 and free cash flow 1 to be between 150 200 million next year is shaping up to be the best year in our history given anticipated volumes from a sales earnings and cash flow perspective we don t have a crystal ball and we know we live in a turbulent world but we are confident that we will navigate our way through challenges as we have in the past challenges are often opportunities and they make us better we are very positive about our industry and our future _______________________________________________ 1the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs however the company

winnemucca nev nov 1 2022 prnewswire hycroft mining holding corporation nasdaq hymc hycroft or the company a gold and silver exploration and development company which owns the hycroft mine in the prolific mining region of northern nevada announces that it has filed its 10 q for the third quarter of 2022 diane garrett president and ceo commented we continued to make excellent progress in the third quarter of 2022 as we have had zero reportable injuries this year and as of october 28 2022 our twelve month trailing total recordable injury frequency rate is zero we are extremely pleased with this outstanding safety performance and i want to personally acknowledge the great team we have at hycroft who make safety our number one priority each and every day and work diligently to deliver value to our shareholders the initial assay results reported this quarter from our exploration drilling program delivered significantly higher grades as compared to our current modeled resource grade and in addition we are demonstrating improved continuity in the targeted higher grade areas as we complete residual leaching we recovered more gold and silver ounces than projected to be recovered from the leach pads and ended the quarter with a very healthy 153 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents during the quarter we also added talent in the organization to focus on hycroft s largest exploration program in nearly a decade as we focus on higher grade opportunities that are important for hycroft s next phase of operations third quarter 2022 highlights safety hycroft s safety performance continued to improve with a 0 26 trailing 12 month total reportable incident frequency rate trifr at the end of the third quarter of 2022 this represents an approximate 59 reduction in trifr compared with 0 64 at the end of 2021 the twelve month trailing trifr at october 28 2022 is zero hycroft s safety performance continued to improve with a 0 26 trailing 12 month total reportable

october 28 2022 is zero leach pad operations gold recoveries for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 were 3 480 and 14 404 ounces respectively and silver recoveries were 3 473 and 34 258 ounces respectively processing of ore on leach pads continued through august 2022 when the company determined it was no longer economic to continue to apply cyanide to the leach pads as a result the company expects to continue to recover gold and silver ounces from the drain down solutions through the end of 2022 with immaterial residual recovery of ounces through the first quarter of 2023 gold recoveries for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 were 3 480 and 14 404 ounces respectively and silver recoveries were 3 473 and 34 258 ounces respectively processing of ore on leach

2023 exploration in july 2022 the company initiated the 2022 2023 exploration program which is the largest exploration program at the hycroft mine in nearly a decade hycroft s focus during the quarter was to follow up on higher grade opportunities identified during the 2021 drill program to help the company better understand the controls to mineralization since initiation and through september 30 2022 the company has completed approximately 41 000 feet of reverse circulation rc drilling and approximately 2 300 feet of core drilling management s observations as well as the assay results received to date have helped establish continuity in the higher grade zones within the vortex and brimstone areas these results will be used to further identify targets in upcoming drilling additionally the company initiated targeted infill drilling within the existing deposits where there is limited drilling based on the geology and surrounding drill results the company is optimistic that the additional limited drilling could convert material currently modeled as waste to an ore classification in the resource model this would reduce the strip ratio haulage costs equipment costs and increase revenue in the ongoing engineering and design work furthermore based upon the results of the additional infill drilling inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to higher resources classifications inside and adjacent to the current pit limits in july 2022 the company initiated the 2022 2023 exploration program which is the largest exploration program at the hycroft mine in

consistent with the processing assumptions used in the february 22 2022 technical report the company continues to provide additional flotation samples for the remaining variability test work that is designed to determine key process characteristics including flotation and pressure oxidation pox reagent consumption mass pull and sulfide sulfur levels this test work is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023 and the results will be incorporated into the overall design of the milling process flow sheet about hycroft mining holding corporation hycroft is a us based gold and silver

capital expenditures of 16 million total liquidity of approximately 450 million as of september 30 2022 successfully completed major turnarounds at two facilities during past three months repurchased approximately 7 million shares during the third quarter we delivered strong top and bottom line growth as compared to last year despite executing two turnarounds in this year s third quarter versus one in last year s third quarter stated mark behrman lsb s president and ceo we continued to benefit from higher selling prices compared to last year and our strategic commercial initiatives that enabled us to optimize our sales mix in the face of a rapidly changing market environment pricing remains well above year ago levels and there are multiple supply and demand factors currently at play that we expect will continue to support strong pricing for the final two months of 2022 and for 2023 if not longer even with the reduced volumes resulting from our third quarter scheduled maintenance activities at our pryor and el dorado facilities we once again generated meaningful positive operating cash flow our increasingly strong balance sheet enabled us to complete a total of 100 million of share repurchases for a total of approximately 7 6 million shares since the program began in may these repurchases included 5 5 million shares that we bought from our largest shareholder efficiently returning capital to our shareholders while not diminishing the liquidity of our stock mr behrman continued over the next several years we believe we have an opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value through ongoing improvement of our operating rates continued product optimization and potential debottlenecking projects we believe these projects could materially increase the production capacities of our facilities enhancing our profit margins as we capitalize on the operating leverage inherent in our business model we expect to formalize and announce our debottlenecking plans in early 2023 in addition we continue to advance our decarbonization activities in april we announced our co 2 capture and sequestration or blue ammonia project at our el dorado facility where we intend to initially capture approximately 450 000 tons of co 2 annually we have made significant advancements on data collection necessary for a class vi permit application and expect to file that application in the second quarter of 2023 additionally in may we announced a feasibility study for a zero carbon or green ammonia project at our pryor facility and we are in the final stages of completing that study we will report on the results of the feasibility study when it is complete mr behrman concluded as we head into the final months of 2022 we are highly enthusiastic about our near and longer term prospects for profitable growth free cash flow generation and increased shareholder value given the favorable outlook for our markets coupled with the company specific initiatives we have underway supporting that belief on monday we announced an increase of 75 million to our share repurchase program bringing the total repurchase program to 175 million ______________________ 1 this

driven by stronger pricing for all of our products for sales made at both spot pricing as well as those related to a rise in the tampa ammonia benchmark price to which many of our contracts are tied the benefit of stronger pricing was partially offset by lower sales volumes due largely to turnarounds at two of our facilities that took place in the third quarter of 2022 versus only one turnaround in the third quarter of 2021 the year over year improvement in operating income and adjusted ebitda primarily resulted from higher selling prices partially offset by higher natural gas feedstock

to 100 million on august 8 2022 capital expenditures were approximately 16 1 million for the third quarter of 2022 for the full year 2022 total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 65 million outlook market conditions remain intact to keep fertilizer prices above historical averages for the remainder of 2022 and full year 2023 farmer economics continue to be very favorable as a result of strong global demand for corn in the face of constrained supply key factors include the impact on global corn supplies of dry conditions in south america the western u s and parts of europe coupled with continued high demand for corn from china as a result corn prices remain above 10 year averages and farmer profitability is meaningfully positive despite inflation across their cost inputs in order to maximize yield in 2023 to capitalize on these favorable economics we expect demand for agricultural ammonia to be strong through november and into december as farmers seek to replenish the nitrogen in their soil in advance of the coming spring planting season natural gas costs in europe continue to be a major driver of high fertilizer prices while down from the peak levels reached in august which caused operations at numerous european ammonia facilities to cease due to prohibitively high production costs natural gas prices in europe remain well above historical averages moving into the winter heating season it appears possible that european gas prices could rise again if temperatures are below average for periods of time as supply remains tight this would limit or prevent many of the continent s ammonia facilities from resuming production keeping nitrogen fertilizer prices high despite energy cost inflation in the u s domestic natural gas prices remain a fraction of those in europe giving u s ammonia producers a substantial cost advantage in the global market the impact of the russian invasion of ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the region has contributed to the constraints to both global grain and ammonia supplies as well as an aggravating factor to europe s high gas prices ukraine is one of the world s largest exporters of corn while russia is among the world s largest exporters of wheat and ammonia and was historically a major supplier of gas to much of europe at this point it seems likely that even if the current unstable geopolitical situation in the region were to be resolved soon the global supply of these commodities would still be short to meet demand throughout the entirety of 2023 and beyond with respect to industrial markets demand remains stable from domestic end use markets while orders from customers producing products largely for export to europe and asia have softened to a degree given weakening international economies importantly in addition to our contractual agreements with industrial customers that specify minimum volumes our product mix flexibility helps us mitigate the impact of a reduction in demand from certain end markets by shifting production to products with stronger demand an example would be our ability to reduce our nitric acid volumes in favor of increased production of ammonium nitrate relative to this we have been experiencing favorable trends in our mining business as rising global consumption of coal has strengthened demand and pricing for ammonium nitrate a product we sell to mining services companies for use in aggregates and metals mining operations overall despite growing global recessionary forces our industrial and mining business remains stable as

calculated using gaap amounts in our consolidated financial statements ebitda and adjusted ebitda reconciliation ebitda is defined as net income loss plus interest expense less gain loss on extinguishment of debt plus depreciation and amortization d a which includes d a of property plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and other assets plus provision benefit for income taxes adjusted ebitda is reported to show the impact of non cash stock based compensation one time non cash or non operating items such as one time income or fees loss gain on sale of a business and or other property and equipment certain fair market value fmv adjustments and consulting costs associated with reliability and purchasing initiatives initiatives we historically have performed turnaround activities on an annual basis however we have moved towards extending turnarounds to a two or three year cycle rather than being capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit our accounting policy is to recognize the costs as incurred given these turnarounds are essentially investments that provide benefits over multiple years they are not reflective of our operating performance in a given year we believe that certain investors consider ebitda a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance in addition we believe that certain investors consider adjusted ebitda as more meaningful to further assess our performance we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain items ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income operating income

ability to pay rent or service debt when due make capital expenditures and expand its business these non gaap financial measures also may help investors to make comparisons between ta and other companies and to make comparisons of ta s financial and operating results between periods the non gaap financial measures ta presents should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss

net income loss adjusted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders ebitda and adjusted ebitda are meaningful disclosures that may help investors to better understand ta s financial performance by providing financial information that represents the operating results of ta s operations without the effects of items that do not result directly from ta s normal recurring operations and may allow investors to better compare ta s performance between periods and to the performance of other companies ta calculates ebitda as net income loss before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense as shown below ta calculates adjusted ebitda by excluding items that it considers not to be normal recurring cash operating expenses or gains or losses in addition ta believes that because it leases a majority of its travel centers presenting adjusted ebitdar may help investors compare the value of ta against companies that own and finance ownership of their properties with debt financing since this measure eliminates the effects of variability in leasing methods and capital structures this measure may also help investors evaluate ta s valuation if it owned its leased properties and financed that ownership with debt in which case the interest expense ta incurred for that debt financing would be added back when calculating ebitda adjusted ebitdar is presented solely as a valuation measure and should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income loss because it excludes the real estate rent expense associated with ta s leases and it is presented for the limited purposes referenced herein ta calculates ebitdar as net income loss before interest income taxes real estate rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense and adjusted ebitdar by excluding items that it considers not to be normal recurring cash operating expenses or gains or losses ta believes that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted net income loss ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar and that net income loss per

entirety of management s discussion and analysis the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and all other items contained within this quarterly report on form 10 q note on general business and economic conditions the outbreak of covid 19 has had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses and reduced consumer spending the company has taken and continues to take a number of precautionary steps to safeguard its customers business and employees from covid 19 most of the company s employees have been working remotely with only certain operationally critical employees working on site at various locations in november 2021 the company extended its work from home policy indefinitely under the new mercury s my workplace policy allowing most of its employees to work from anywhere in the u s beginning january 2022 the company s automobile line of insurance business experienced a rapid drop in loss frequency in the second quarter of 2020 due to reduced driving following the outbreak of the pandemic since then loss frequency has increased and is now near pre pandemic levels inflationary trends have accelerated to their highest level since the 1980s in 2022 with the most recent consumer price index increase of 8 2 excessive inflation has led to significant increases in loss severities related to vehicle repairs and bodily injuries the covid 19 pandemic also created more uncertainty and the total effect on losses occurring 24 table of contents during the covid 19 era will not be known for several years the company expects more late reported claims and a prolonged settlement period the sustained high loss severity combined with loss frequency at near pre pandemic levels have negatively impacted the company s results of operations and the company has submitted private passenger automobile rate filings in many states requesting rate increases in addition the company is taking various non rate actions to improve profitability the federal open market committee started raising the federal funds rate in march 2022 as a response to inflationary pressures the ensuing increases in market interest rates combined with the high inflation the supply chain and labor issues and the russia ukraine war have placed significant strain on financial markets leading to market volatility and turmoil the fair values of the company s equity securities have reflected such market volatility and the fair values of its fixed maturity securities have decreased significantly as a result of increases in market interest rates during the first nine months of 2022 the company believes that it will continue to have sufficient liquidity to support its business operations without the forced sale of investments based on its existing cash and short term investments future cash flows from operations and 75 million of undrawn credit in its unsecured credit facility the company will continue to monitor the effects of covid 19 and its variants the high inflation and interest rates the supply chain and labor issues the russia ukraine war and the legislative relief programs including the inflation reduction act of 2022 signed into law in august 2022 the extent of these effects on the company s business and financial results will depend largely on future developments including the duration of the high inflation and interest rates and the war most of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in october 2022 the company reduced its workforce by approximately 40 employees and a one time cost of approximately 3 million associated with the workforce reduction will be recorded as an expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 the company anticipates

examinations the examining doi generally reports findings to the company the california doi has not approved a private passenger automobile rate filing from any major insurer since the beginning of the pandemic the california doi recently requested information from insurers to determine if in its view pandemic related premium refunds were adequate the california doi is reviewing the information provided by insurers in conjunction with their rate filings although california courts have ruled that the california doi lacks the authority to order such refunds the california doi is not approving rate increases until it has gone through this review process while delays in obtaining indicated rates can adversely impact results of operations in any environment that impact is especially severe in the current inflationary environment the company and other insurers have expressed in private discussions and in written arguments submitted by trade groups that the california doi has a statutory duty to review and approve rate filings it is not reasonably possible to predict if or when the california doi will approve the company s pending rate filings the company is from time to time named as a defendant in various lawsuits or regulatory actions incidental to its insurance business the majority of lawsuits brought against the company relate to insurance claims that arise in the normal course of business and are reserved for through the reserving process for a discussion of the company s reserving methods see the company s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 the company establishes reserves for non insurance claims related lawsuits regulatory actions and other contingencies when the company believes a loss is probable and is able to estimate its potential exposure for loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible the company also discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made in addition the company accrues for anticipated legal defense costs associated with such lawsuits and regulatory actions while actual losses may differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of the company s pending actions is generally not yet determinable the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flows in all cases the company vigorously defends itself unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate for a discussion of any additional regulatory or legal matters see the company s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 and note 12 contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this quarterly report d critical accounting estimates loss and loss adjustment expense reserves loss reserves preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management s judgment and estimates the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and therefore the loss reserve that is required a key assumption in estimating loss reserves is the degree to which the historical data used to analyze reserves will be predictive of ultimate claim costs on incurred claims changes in the regulatory and legal environments results of litigation medical costs the cost of repair materials and 26 table of contents labor rates among other factors can impact this assumption in addition time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim the more variable the ultimate settlement amount could be accordingly short tail claims such as property damage claims tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims the company calculates a loss reserve point estimate rather than a range there is inherent uncertainty with estimates and this is particularly true with loss reserve estimates this uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns changes in the regulatory and legal environments uncertainty over inflation rates and uncertainty for unknown items the company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties rather it considers them in establishing its loss reserve by reviewing historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current loss reserves the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the loss reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors expected average costs per claim inflation trends expected loss ratios industry data and other relevant information the company also engages independent actuarial consultants to review the company s loss reserves and to provide the annual actuarial opinions under statutory accounting principles as required by state regulation the company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss paid loss average severity coupled with the claim count development methods and the generalized linear model glm described below when deciding among methods to use the company evaluates the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of insurance business or coverage within a line of insurance business the company may also evaluate qualitative factors such as known changes in laws or legal rulings that could affect claims handling or other external environmental factors or internal factors that could affect the settlement of claims when establishing the loss reserve the company will generally analyze the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on a single method while these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the company s policies there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes the company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves the incurred loss method analyzes historical incurred case loss case reserves plus paid losses development to estimate ultimate losses the company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses the company believes that the incurred loss method provides a reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses particularly in the company s larger more established lines of insurance business which have a long operating history the paid loss method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid the average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and or incurred losses divided by closed claims and or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim from this the expected ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated the average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provide meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the company believes is useful in establishing loss reserves the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts the glm determines an average severity for each percentile of claims that have been closed as a percentage of estimated ultimate claims the average severities are applied to open claims to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid the glm utilizes operational time determined as a percentile of claims closed rather than a finite calendar period which neutralizes the effect of changes in the timing of claims handling the company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non catastrophe losses for catastrophe losses the company generally determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on loss reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes for catastrophe losses on individual properties that are expected to be total losses the company typically establishes reserves at the policy limits at september 30 2022 and december 31 2021 the company recorded its point estimate of approximately 2 43 billion and 2 23 billion 2 41 billion and 2 19 billion net of reinsurance respectively in loss reserves which included approximately 1 18 billion and 1 03 billion 1 18 billion and 1 02 billion net of reinsurance respectively of incurred but not reported loss reserves ibnr ibnr includes estimates based upon past experience of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates unreported claims that occurred on or prior to september 30 2022 and december 31 2021 and estimated future payments for reopened claims management believes that the liability for loss reserves is adequate to cover the 27 table of contents ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date however since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provisions the company evaluates its loss reserves quarterly when management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires a decrease for previously reported accident years favorable development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period if the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years unfavorable development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period for a further discussion of the company s reserving methods see the company s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 results of operations three months ended september 30 2022 compared to three months ended september 30 2021 revenues net premiums earned and net premiums written for the three months ended september 30 2022 increased 6 0 and 1 9 respectively from the corresponding period in 2021 the increase in net premiums earned was primarily due to increases in the number of policies written outside of california and rate increases in the california homeowners line of insurance business and in certain lines of insurance business in some states outside of california partially offset by a decrease in the number of private passenger automobile policies written in california the increase in net premiums written was primarily due to increases in the number of policies written outside of california and rate increases in certain lines of insurance business in some states outside of california partially offset by a decrease in the number of private passenger automobile policies written in california net premiums earned included ceded premiums earned of 22 8 million and 17 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively net premiums written included ceded premiums written of 22 8 million and 17 3 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the increases in ceded premiums earned and ceded premiums written resulted mostly from higher reinsurance coverage and rates and growth in the covered book of business net premiums earned a gaap measure represents the

third quarter of 2022 and 2021 was affected by favorable development of approximately 1 million and 8 million respectively on prior accident years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the favorable development for the third quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to lower than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the commercial property and umbrella lines of insurance business the favorable development for the third quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to lower than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the homeowners and private passenger automobile lines of insurance business the 2022 loss ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 18 million of catastrophe losses excluding unfavorable development of approximately 1 million on prior years catastrophe losses primarily due to the impact of hurricane ian in florida which caused 11 million in losses and rainstorms in texas and oklahoma the 2021 loss ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 27 million of catastrophe losses excluding favorable development of approximately 2 million on prior years catastrophe losses primarily due to wildfires in california and the impact of hurricane ida in new jersey and new york excluding the effects of estimated prior periods loss development and catastrophe losses the loss ratio was 77 3 and 72 2 for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in loss severity in the automobile line of insurance business inflationary trends have accelerated to their highest level in decades in 2022 which has had a significant impact on the cost of auto parts and labor as well as medical expenses for bodily injuries and supply chain and labor shortage issues have lengthened the time to repair vehicles bodily injury costs are also under pressure from social inflation these inflationary pressures and the supply chain and labor shortage issues have led to a significant increase in automobile loss severity and increased losses and loss adjustment expenses for the insured events of the current accident year for the three months ended september 30 2022 compared to the corresponding period in 2021 the company has filed for rate increases in many states and is taking various non rate actions to improve profitability expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses by net premiums earned the expense ratio for the three months ended september 30 2022 decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2021 primarily due to lower advertising and other expenses combined ratio is equal to loss ratio plus expense ratio and is the key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry a combined ratio under 100 generally reflects profitable underwriting results and a combined ratio over 100 generally reflects unprofitable underwriting results income tax benefit was 30 6 million and 4 7 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to a 125 5 million increase in total pre tax loss tax exempt investment income a component of total pre tax loss remained relatively steady with the corresponding period in 2021 the company s effective income tax rate can be affected by several factors these generally relate to large changes in the composition of fully taxable income including net realized investment gains or losses tax exempt investment income non deductible expenses and periodically non routine tax items such as adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits related to tax uncertainties tax exempt investment income of approximately 19 million coupled with pre tax loss of approximately 129 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 23 7 above the statutory tax rate of 21 for the three months ended september 30 2022 and tax exempt investment income of approximately 18 million coupled with pre tax loss of approximately 3 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 138 1 for the corresponding period in 2021 29 table of contents

any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty the company will be required as primary insurer to discharge all obligations to its policyholders in their entirety c invested assets portfolio composition an important component of the company s financial results is the return on its investment portfolio the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation within a total return framework the investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified investment grade fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve return on capital and profitable growth the company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults the company believes that this strategy enables the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and consistent asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive liquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions the following table presents

of contents rates anticipated prepayments risk reward characteristics liquidity needs tax planning considerations or other economic factors short term instruments include money market accounts options and short term bonds that are highly rated short duration securities and redeemable within one year a primary exposure for the fixed maturity securities is interest rate risk the longer the duration

resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration the company s portfolio is heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds fixed maturity securities purchased by the company typically have call options attached which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline the holdings that are heavily weighted with high coupon issues are expected to be called prior to

income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or

the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur

and 2021 as well as for the three months ended june 30 2022 and reflect adjusted operating income as determined in accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting this press release includes the non gaap financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent each segment is then adjusted to reflect the unique tax attributes of that segment such as permanent differences between u s gaap and tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance products included in the company s enact segment the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the operating performance of its enact segment because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force for the company s enact segment insurance in force is a measure of the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of the respective reporting date for loans insured by the company s u s mortgage insurance subsidiaries risk in force is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of the operating performance of its enact segment because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses included in the company s enact segment the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business included in the company s u s life insurance segment the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses management also regularly monitors and reports adjusted operating income from in force rate actions in the long term care insurance business included in the company s u s life insurance segment adjusted operating income from in force rate actions includes premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on its long term care insurance products implemented since 2012 which are net of estimated premium tax commissions and other expenses on an after tax basis estimates for in force rate actions reflect certain simplifying assumptions that may vary materially from actual historical results including but not limited to a uniform rate of coinsurance and premium taxes in addition to consistent policyholder behavior over time actual behavior may differ significantly from these assumptions in addition estimates exclude reserve updates resulting from profits followed by losses the company considers adjusted operating income from in force rate actions to be a measure of its operating performance because it helps bring older generation long term care insurance blocks closer to a break even point over time and helps bring the loss ratios on newer long term care insurance blocks back towards their original pricing these operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources statutory accounting data

our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap this press release contains non gaap financial measures including adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and unlevered free cash flow we believe these non gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because they eliminate certain items that affect period over period comparability and provide consistency with past financial performance and additional information about our underlying results and trends by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business results of operations or outlook non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results this information should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap there are limitations to these non gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items or events being adjusted in addition other companies may use different measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures as tools for comparison a reconciliation is provided at the end of this press release for each historical non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with gaap we do not provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward looking non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable gaap measures due to the high variability and difficulty to predict certain items excluded from these non gaap financial measures in particular the effects of stock based compensation expense taxes and amounts under the exchange tax receivable agreement deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and restructuring and transaction expenses we expect the variability of these excluded items may have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future gaap financial results we define adjusted operating income as income from operations plus i impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue ii amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles iii equity based compensation expense iv restructuring and transaction related expenses and v integration costs and acquisition related compensation we define adjusted operating income margin as adjusted operating income divided by the sum of revenue and the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue we define adjusted net income as adjusted operating income less i interest expense net ii other income expense net excluding tra liability remeasurement expense benefit and iii income tax expense benefit including incremental tax effects of adjustments to arrive at adjusted operating income and current tax benefits related to the tra we define adjusted net income per share as adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding we define unlevered free cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities less i purchases of property and equipment and other assets plus ii cash interest expense iii cash payments related to restructuring and transaction related expenses and iv cash payments related to

as doctors and hospitals around the country struggle to deal with a rising number of children hospitalized with the respiratory syncytial virus they may be without one of the most popular antibiotics used to fight off secondary infections caused by the virus three of the top companies that manufacture amoxicillin are reporting supply concerns according to the hill most of the supply issues involve the liquid form of the drug which is most commonly given to children a spokesperson for one of the companies hikma told the hill that they have enough supply to fill current orders but are limiting the sale of new orders we are managing distribution to make sure we continue to fully meet our existing supply commitments spokesman steve weiss said our number one priority is to honor the commitments we have to our current customers and allocation allows us to achieve this nbc news reports drug wholesalers are limiting the amount of amoxicillin they sell to pharmacies to one bottle per day that doesn t cut it very well brian caswell owner of wolkar drug in baxter springs kansas said so we re going to be ordering one bottle every day whether we need it or not to just try to stock up because we don t know how long this situation is going to last
june waller grew up in a mostly black neighborhood and went to a mostly white catholic high school in new york but her home today features a much better blend she lives in colorado springs colorado according to a study out of berkeley that measured america s largest cities for racial integration colorado springs was the most integrated city in the country stephen menendian authored the study he compared cities in 2019 with how they looked in 1990 he found that 80 of them had in that time become more segregated we really are a balkanized society we re really separate we re really separated in all of our lives menendian said most cities and regions are heavily divided different races populate different neighborhoods but in colorado springs affordable housing and traditional housing flow seamlessly around each other that s by design which waller helped the city create nearly five decades ago we didn t want to have families stacked on top of each other he said we didn t want to have more than two houses on a block by houses she means homes subsidized by the government so we need to open up opportunities and open up neighborhoods to people who would be otherwise excluded so it s about distribution of affordable housing stock and making sure that we re just not continuing to put low income housing and highly segregated neighborhoods because then the government is actually reinforcing what the private market and government 100 years ago created menendian said there s another element here one that connects colorado springs with the only other american city menendian labeled as integrated port st lucie florida both are home to thousands of servicemembers and families of the military the military truly is one of our most diverse institutions menendian said so any city or municipality that has a large military footprint as a proportion of its population is going to be more integrated than american society as a whole to be sure an american city without a military presence can still find ways to connect its residents for menendian and waller it s about intentional decisions to bring people together waller helped make those decisions in colorado springs those decisions she says are why colorado springs feels far different from how she grew up

its website www bluelinxco com which is updated regularly with financial and other important information about bluelinx investor media contacts ryan taylor vp investor relations treasurybluelinx holdings inc seth freeman vp marketing communicationsbluelinx holdings inc non gaap measures the company reports its financial results in accordance with gaap the company also believes that presentation of certain non gaap measures may be useful to investors and may provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than using reported gaap results alone any non gaap measures used herein are reconciled to their most directly comparable gaap measures herein or in the financial tables accompanying this news release the company cautions that non gaap measures should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for the company s reported gaap results adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin bluelinx defines adjusted ebitda as an amount equal to net income loss plus interest expense and all interest expense related items income taxes depreciation and amortization and further adjusted for certain non cash items and other special items including compensation expense from share based compensation one time charges associated with the legal consulting and professional fees related to our merger and acquisition activities gains or losses on sales of properties amortization of deferred gains on real estate and expense associated with our restructuring activities such as severance in addition to other significant and or one time nonrecurring non operating items the company presents adjusted ebitda because it is a primary measure used by management to evaluate operating performance management believes this metric helps to enhance investors overall understanding of the financial performance and cash flows of the business management also believes adjusted ebitda is helpful in highlighting operating trends adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies many of which present an adjusted ebitda measure when reporting their results we determine our adjusted ebitda margin which we sometimes refer to as our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales by dividing our adjusted ebitda for the applicable period by our net sales for the applicable period we believe that this ratio is useful to investors because it more clearly defines the quality of earnings and operational efficiency of translating sales to profitability our adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and are not intended to present superior measures of our financial condition from those measures determined under gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as used herein are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation these non gaap measures are reconciled in the reconciliation of non gaap measurements table later in this release free cash flow bluelinx defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less total capital expenditures free cash flow is a measure used by management to assess our financial performance and we believe it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations in particular free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that can be used for among other things investment in our business strengthening our balance sheet and repayment of our debt obligations free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure free cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and is not intended to present a superior measure of financial condition from those determined under gaap free cash flow as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation this non gaap measure is reconciled in the reconciliation of non gaap measurements table later in this release net debt and net leverage ratio bluelinx calculates net debt as its total short and long term debt including outstanding balances under our term loan and revolving credit facility and the total amount of its obligations under financing leases less cash and cash equivalents we believe that net debt is useful to investors because our management reviews our net debt as part of its management of overall liquidity financial flexibility capital structure and leverage and creditors and credit analysts monitor our net debt as part of their assessments of our business we determine our overall net leverage ratio by dividing our net debt by trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda we believe that this ratio is useful to investors because it is an indicator of our ability to meet our future financial obligations in addition the ratio is a measure that is frequently used by investors and creditors our net debt and overall net leverage ratio are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and are not intended to present a superior measure of our financial condition from measures and ratios determined under gaap in addition our net debt and overall net leverage ratio as used herein are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation this non gaap measure is reconciled in the reconciliation of non gaap

helpful measures of reit performance by reits and many reit analysts ffo represents net income before depreciation and amortization which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and

real estate impairment charges which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation ffo and ffo per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share ffo is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of

mineralization corridor with the luz del cobre copper deposit at the east figure 4 crushing of stockpile at san antonio is available at figure 5 stockpile placed on newly constructed leachpad is available at san antonio expected impairment the company has assessed the carrying value of its assets as at september 30 2022 as part of its financial results preparation and currently believes that its financial statements for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 will recognize an asset impairment in respect of the san antonio project the expected impairment charge is a result primarily of industry cost pressures and the current inflationary environment which resulted in an increase in interest rates and thus the risk free rate underpinning the applicable weighted average cost of capital used in the impairment assessment the expected asset impairment is a non cash item and for the avoidance of doubt will have no impact on cashflows furthermore the expected asset impairment is not expected to have any impact on osisko development s mine plans gold reserves and resources and streaming and royalty agreements this assessment for impairment has been undertaken in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and related solely to the san antonio project the amount of the asset impairment to be recognized in the financial statements for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 has not been finalized sean roosen chairman and ceo of osisko development commented osisko development offers a unique opportunity through three advanced brownfield projects which have all produced gold this year tintic located in utah is fully permitted and producing gold from small scale mining while a larger ramp is 25 complete which we anticipate will allow for larger scale mining tintic offers immediate production and a host of prospective exploration opportunities to shareholders and stakeholders while the other two projects complete the permitting cycle the cariboo project which comprises over 500 000 acres and a 50 mile mineralized trend is currently in the permitting process and the environmental assessment has been filed for a 4 750 tonne per day mine capacity the san antonio project has completed stacking of 1 1 million tonnes of mineralized material on a heap leach pad with active leaching anticipated for the next 90 to 120 days management is currently evaluating its options for the project at osisko development we are extremely proud of the portfolio we have built all three projects are in strong mining jurisdictions offer brownfield infrastructure and have camp scale exploration potential we continue to advance through permitting at cariboo and anticipate to ramp up our production and exploration activities at tintic

management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes we describe our non gaap measures below we believe these non gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our

non gaap financial measures are useful to investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance nevertheless our use of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin cost of revenue excluding stock based compensation and free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these non gaap financial measures as a comparative tool because of these and other limitations you should consider our non gaap measures only as supplemental to other gaap based financial performance measures including revenues and net loss we calculate forward looking adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in forward looking gaap net income loss we do not attempt to provide a reconciliation of forward looking adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin guidance and targets to forward looking gaap net income loss because forecasting the timing or amount of items that have not yet occurred and are out of our control is inherently uncertain and unavailable without unreasonable efforts further we believe that such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors such items could have a substantial impact on gaap measures of financial performance condensed unaudited consolidated balance sheets in

washington reuters despite the lesson of the cuban missile crisis 60 years ago china has shown no interest in discussing steps to reduce the risk posed by nuclear weapons senior u s officials said on tuesday after chinese leader xi jinping signaled last month that beijing would strengthen its strategic deterrent the pentagon says china is undergoing a major expansion of its nuclear forces and is moving toward having 1 000 nuclear warheads by 2030 but beijing has long resisted arms control talks with washington arguing that the united states already has a much larger arsenal alexandra bell deputy assistant secretary of state for arms control verification and compliance told an atlantic council that despite u s efforts washington and beijing still had not begun engagement on the issue as a first step we d really like to have a conversation with them about each other s doctrines about crisis communication crisis management bell said noting that washington has had such talks with russia for decades we re not in that space with beijing yet so there s work to be done to begin the conversation we think bilaterally bell said we re now at the 60th anniversary of the cuban missile crisis we don t need to repeat that to know that we need to be at the table having conversations with each other bell said referring to events in 1962 when the united states and the soviet union came close to nuclear war over the presence of soviet missiles in cuba u s national security advisor jake sullivan said last year after a call between xi and president joe biden that the two had agreed to look to begin to carry forward discussion on strategic stability but xi signaled during a communist party congress in october that china would strengthen its strategic deterrent a term often used to describe nuclear weapons richard johnson the u s deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and countering weapons of mass destruction policy told the forum the united states was looking to begin exchanges with china on more basic things than the number of warheads if that s the argument that beijing is giving we re not asking to have a discussion about numbers we re saying let s talk about putting some guardrails into the relationship so that we don t have unnecessary crises he said johnson added that if beijing preferred to not engage bilaterally it could demonstrate some transparency about its nuclear build up through the international atomic energy agency by declaring its plutonium stocks for civilian purposes the chinese have stopped doing that and that s a real concern he said reporting by michael martina and david brunnstrom editing by richard pullin

setting up a content moderation council with diverse viewpoints but his own behavior as a prolific tweeter has signaled otherwise but it is almost impossible for those outside of twitter to know what strings he is pulling or whose accounts have been suspended the company has stopped responding to media questions except for the few that musk answers by tweet personette who was chief customer

first reported by morning brew jason calacanis an angel investor and musk confidant working on twitter on monday said twitter was having a very productive day meeting with marketers and advertisers the advertiser meetings could help brands decide whether to stick around or abandon the platform because of divisive and vitriolic content musk has attempted to reassure advertisers twitter s commitment to brand safety is unchanged he tweeted on monday he previously said he would reverse twitter s ban on former us president donald trump who was kicked off because of concerns he could incite further violence after the us capitol riot last year experts have said hateful content has skyrocketed since musk closed his acquisition of twitter last week use of the n word has increased by nearly 500 on twitter said the network contagion research institute on friday which identifies cyber social threats musk explained his plan for twitter s verified system on the social media platform itself twitter s current lords peasants system for who has or doesn t have a blue checkmark is bullshit the new chief twit wrote power to the people blue for 8 month a blue tick badge allows other twitter users to verify that other users are who they say they are musk added that those who sign up for the system will get priority in replies mentions and search which is essential to defeating spam scam ability to post long video and audio half as many ads and paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us the world s richest man previously mulled a 20 per month blue tick verification fee but appeared to lower the cost following criticism from horror author stephen king new twitter ceo elon musk was pictured leaving his mother s new york city home to head back into twitter s nyc office it was the chief twit s second visit to the office this week following his 44 billion takeover during his trip musk confirmed on twitter that access to its verified program will

critics of a previously proposed 20 a month charge pictured musk following his security detail on tuesday as he entered the back of twitter s nyc headquarters musk clad in red samurai armor showed up at heidi klum s 21st annual halloween party at the moxy hotel on monday musk is looking to make good on his promise to make the social media platform turn a profit by introducing a charge for twitter users wanting to keep their verification badge his plan to reportedly charge 20 a month however appeared to sit poorly with king who tweeted 20 a month to keep my blue check f that they should pay me wrote king who has 6 9million followers if that gets instituted i m gone like enron musk replied we need to pay the bills somehow twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers how about 8 he asked which appears to be the price he s settled on king isn t the only blue tick twitter user to threaten to abandon their blue ticks if a charge is introduced to the platform author stephen king said he will leave twitter if musk brings in a 20 a month charge for him to keep his blue check author stephen king who wrote the shining said he will leave the platform if musk introduces a blue tick verification charge musk appeared to haggle with the horror author suggesting the 8 price he ultimately decided on musk is pictured leaving his mother s house in new york city wearing an occupy mars branded t shirt as he walked with his security detail musk appears to have taken monday s criticism from the public to heart as he opted to lower the proposed blue mark cost following his outing to klum s premier halloween party the world s richest man was pictured arriving at the party in a red samurai style costume as reports emerge that he is preparing to cut close to 2 000 twitter jobs amounting to around 25 percent of its workforce musk looked triumphant as he posed on the red carpet in his armor with his street clothes still visible underneath it s not clear what musk was supposed to be

off says new york life s goodwin investors may be getting a bit too excited about potential changes from the federal reserve according to lauren goodwin economist and portfolio strategist at new york life investments goodwin said in a note that she expected the fed to hike by 0 75 of a percentage point on wednesday and half a point in december but that the slowdown should not be seen as the start of a big shift from the central bank a fed pause is not the same as a pivot certainly deteriorating economic and credit conditions could cause the fed to pivot modestly at some point but a full pivot into accommodative territory is highly unlikely in the next year goodwin said in a note goodwin pointed out that the first rate hikes should now start to show their impact across the broad economy instead of just housing however the fed will need several months of data to go its way before changing course at this point with inflation surprising as much as it has already the fed will want to see clear signs of reversal in wage growth before pivoting recession should be considered a base case rather than a risk goodwin said jesse pound

countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including volatility or a decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further

this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied

represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log

period of time it has caused complications in the bond market it s creating complications in the real estate market those not prepared for it are navigating a difficult environment for those who sat

sold two banks said demand hasn t slowed despite the increase in interest rates even though we re heading into a recession and rates are much higher we re now making loans 275 basis points higher than when we launched the company a year ago yet that hasn t changed the demand at all gordon said the bank s been busy on several fronts in june it raised another 25 million of additional capital in july it launched a new escrow division this month it became the exclusive national banking partner of excess telecom an officially licensed nationwide provider of free internet access and low cost tablets to low and moderate income communities gordon sees opportunities because larger banks have legacy issues such as being stuck with loans with low interest rates or too many branches whenever this country heads into some sort of adverse cycle banks are needed more than ever by all the businesses and by our communities gordon said at the time they re needed the most banks tend to pull away tighten up the demand is greater than ever i m excited we don t have any of the balance sheet legacy issues that are becoming a drag

irvine co is planning a new 532 000 square foot life science office campus in irvine that aims to boost orange county stature in the biotechnology and healthcare sectors against nearby markets like san diego marketing materials from the newport beach based developer indicate the project will be on the northwest corner of irvine co s uci research park office campus a 36 building business park next to the university of california irvine the project as currently planned will include four four story buildings each totaling 128 000 square feet of lab ready space geared specifically for medical healthcare and biotechnology tenants whose work focuses on living things the developer s marketing materials indicate it would be the largest project of its type in the county the site for the development near the intersection of macarthur boulevard and university drive is currently fenced off and appears largely graded no vertical construction appeared to be underway as of last week a new cushman wakefield market report indicates irvine co could break ground by the end of the year on the office campus dubbed academy point other local brokers indicate current market conditions may keep the construction timeline in limbo for the time being irvine co declined to comment on the project which would be the third large office development currently underway in the city by oc s largest office landlord as it prepares to deliver the third and final phase of spectrum terrace great for oc a website for the project touts academy point as the only oc life science campus with direct access to uc irvine leading research hospitals top medical device companies and life science incubators brokers tell the business journal that irvine co may hold off on construction until it secures an anchor tenant due to the high interest rate environment and still uncertain office market rather than building on a speculative basis as it has done for other big projects of late such a development would be a boon for orange county newmark executive vice president greg may told the business journal we really need a purpose built incubator lab building for life science startups in oc like they have done in san diego may said it would be great for oc if they built it this was echoed by nico napolitano and jeff cole of cushman wakefield who noted life science tenant interest will spur additional investment by way of conversion or redevelopment transactions san diego has slightly over 21 million square feet of life science inventory with approximately 3 7 million square feet under construction they told the business journal via email san diego s inventory base was largely born from redevelopments of what used to be underutilized traditional office space this has simultaneously created a healthier leasing market for office owners we would expect a similar outcome in orange county competitors the life science industry is a fast growing one in orange county though the sector has failed to burgeon as fully as it has in other neighboring markets san diego for example ranked as the third largest life science market in the u s this year according to a report from commercial real estate website commercialcafe san francisco came in at no 2 followed by boston in the top slot orange county especially with recent healthcare investments checks all the boxes of what life

there s no sugarcoating the stock market s 20 plunge but there is a small consolation prize you have one of the best opportunities in years to lower your tax bill that s because the u s tax code allows investors to sell poor performing stocks and use those investment losses to offset capital gains from selling better performing assets such as stocks bonds a home or business if your losses exceed your gains you can even deduct up to 3 000 against your taxable income losses beyond 3 000 can be carried forward every year until death to offset gains in future years the extent to which the strategy known as tax loss harvesting can lower your tax bill and boost returns isn t insignificant according to research from derek horstmeyer a finance professor at george mason university when the standard poor s 500 index has yielded a negative return the average benefit of harvesting losses provided a bump of 3 21 percentage points for investors facing a 25 capital gains tax rate so if you re sitting on paper losses what are you waiting for you might as well use them to your advantage and sell before the year is out any capital losses incurred in 2022 can be used against gains from this year and beyond when you file your tax returns in april but most investors should buy back a similar stock or fund right away to keep their portfolios balanced and stay invested if the market starts to turn around the internal revenue service s wash sale rule says the sale of a security won t be considered a capital loss if you buy the same security or one that s substantially identical 30 days before or after selling it you won t get fined if you run afoul of the rules but you won t be able to get the tax write off and don t think if you sell something in your brokerage account you can just buy it right back in a retirement one the wash sale rule applies across all an investor s accounts there s some murkiness around what substantially identical means and not much in the way of case law explaining it either are different share classes of alphabet substantially identical how about a mutual fund sold by a different company that tracks the same index typically a brokerage firm will flag anything that s disallowed on the 1099 form it sends you in january detailing gains and losses from transactions during the prior year you re better off being more conservative and then swapping for what you really want after the 61 day waiting period especially considering how low trading fees are these days it s 61 days because remember the 30 day waiting period applies both before and after the sale for some mutual fund investors the benefit of tax loss harvesting will be amplified in december fund investors may be in for a nasty surprise not only will most have suffered negative returns but they may also be receiving a capital gains distribution it s because of the way mutual funds are structured if other investors want to sell their shares the fund often has to sell appreciated holdings to meet those redemptions investors who remain in the fund are then on the hook for any gains the fund makes from selling those shares if you hold those mutual funds in a taxable account you could owe tax even if you reinvest the gains back into the fund there were record level mutual fund capital gains distributions in 2021 2022 isn t expected to be quite as bad but it s still something fund investors should be thinking about and planning for says jim miller a certified financial planner in chapel hill north carolina locking in stock losses now can help to offset those unwelcome distributions remember the difference between short term and long term holdings when thinking about what to sell the irs considers short term to be less than a year so if you sell an asset within that time frame you ll be taxed on any gains at the same rate as ordinary income with a top rate of 37 long term gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 plus a 3 8 tax for higher earners if you sell a stock to harvest the loss and plan on buying it back after the waiting period remember the clock will be reset again before it can be considered a long term gain when you eventually sell finally crypto those investors can tax loss harvest just like stock investors they have an advantage though the wash sale rule doesn t apply to digital assets so they re able to sell and then buy the same coin without waiting still some tax experts warn crypto investors could get burned by the irs s economic substance doctrine that rule basically says that you can t do something just for a tax benefit meaning you d have to expose yourself to some sort of market risk before buying the same coin according to matt metras an accountant in rochester new york who represents taxpayers before the irs but whether that s 10 minutes or 10 days is anyone s guess as with stocks it s better to err on the side of caution it s been a rocky year in the markets but smart moves now can make taxes less painful in april

compounding its existing problems the self driving truck specialist reported a disappointing third quarter what happened to put it mildly autonomous truck company tusimple holdings tsp has had a bad time of it this year that was compounded on tuesday when it published an earnings report that many investors found rather displeasing as a result tusimple stock simply plunged on the day falling by nearly 5 so what for its third quarter tusimple recorded revenue of just over 2 65 million which was substantially more than the 1 79 million it posted in the same quarter of 2021 it attributed the improvement to the increased utilization of our existing assets combined with price increases the company was more consistent on the bottom line in recording a deep net loss this amounted to 113 million or 0 50 per share not much narrower than the year ago deficit of 115 million in terms of operational metrics the reservation numbers for its trucks were flat across that stretch of time at 7 485 now what tusimple investors needed some good news about their company and with the deep in the red bottom line number in the earnings report they didn t get any on monday tusimple s board of directors removed ceo xiaodi hou this came on the heels of legal concerns a clutch of government agencies are investigating allegations that the company failed to disclose that it shared protected technology tusimple is currently searching for a permanent replacement to lead the company and that wasn t long after an automobile guided by the company s self driving technology had an embarrassing accident in arizona times are tough for tusimple just now and until there are indications that its ride is getting smoother investors will likely continue to be bearish on its stock
dover del ap the former president of the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has reached a settlement with federal securities regulators in a related civil action in a court filing tuesday an attorney for the securities and exchange commission asked a federal judge in delaware to approve a consent judgment against former wilmington trust president robert harra jr under the proposed consent judgment harra would pay a civil penalty of 100 000 be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of a public company and be prohibited from violating federal securities laws that were the basis of the sec s civil suit harra along with former wilmington trust chief financial officer david gibson former chief credit officer william north and former controller kevyn rakowski were convicted in 2018 on criminal charges of fraud conspiracy and making false statements regarding the bank s troubled commercial loan portfolio the bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a 60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start wilmington trust s settlement included a civil forfeiture of 44 million and 16 million it previously paid to the sec the executives received prison sentences ranging from three to six years but a federal appeals court panel last year reversed their convictions for making false statements and ordered that judgments of acquittals be entered the panel also ordered a retrial of the conspiracy and securities fraud charges but prosecutors later opted to drop the case altogether meanwhile gibson and rakowski finalized settlements in the sec s civil action in 2019 agreeing to pay more than 70 000 and 44 000 respectively to the agency approval of harra s settlement would leave north the only defendant in the lawsuit in which sec claimed the executives knowingly or recklessly made false disclosures regarding the bank s loan portfolio an attorney for north did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment tuesday in a separate civil action wilmington trust agreed to pay 200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans auditing firm kpmg agreed to pay an additional 10 million as part of the settlement in the criminal case prosecutors alleged that in the wake of the financial crisis the executives misled regulators and investors about wilmington trust s massive amount of past due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse founded by members of the dupont family in 1903 the bank imploded despite receiving 330 million from the federal troubled asset relief program prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as current for interest and in the process of being extended to ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments in the fourth quarter of 2009 bank officials reported only 10 8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due concealing more than 316 million in past due loans subject to the waiver practice according to prosecutors after a meeting to discuss matured loans and how to make them go away by year s end bank officials went beyond the waiver practice and decided on a mass extension that involved temporarily extending more than 800 commercial loans worth 1 3 billion prosecutors said in an email to harra north referred to certain loans as credit turds meanwhile before its 2011 fire sale to m t bank wilmington trust raised 287 million in a 2010 stock offering intended partly to help repay the tarp funds while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors prosecutors said defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret they also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the federal reserve and for disclosing financial information in sec filings were ambiguous and that the term past due was not clearly defined the appeals court agreed that the reporting requirements were ambiguous

climate change disrupting weather patterns creating long term drying trend in alaska experts say unseasonable weather has cut alaska s hay harvest in half and sent the price of feed soaring making it difficult for both farmers livestock producers who already were struggling with high fuel and fertilizer prices state and federal experts are advising alaska farmers to expect continued unusual weather and they ve scheduled workshops next month to help farmers plan for the new normal heavy snowfall last winter delayed delta junction area farmers from getting their hay crops in the ground last spring by at least two weeks and then it warmed up mugrage hay cattle mugrage stores rolls of hay wrapped in protective plastic on fields where his cattle graze all that snow that we had man it just disappeared says uaf cooperative extension service agent phil kaspari it went from all that snow to pretty dry quite quickly kaspari says that was followed by warmer than usual early summer weather in both the interior and the mat su the state s biggest agricultural areas and then a wetter than usual july and august especially in southcentral so they had a really tough haying season he said and the long and the short of it is there s a serious lack of forage and unfortunately grain for feeding livestock kaspari who s based in delta says farmers were already were facing high fuel and fertilizer costs when the summer began alaska farm bureau board president scott mugrage says he paid 40 percent more for those commodities this spring and got only about half of last year s yield during his first hay harvest in late june so the fertilizer and fuel going up and the amount of yield going down was kind a two fold kick y know he said mugrage grows feed and raises livestock at his delta area farm and he says it was a tough year for grains too he says he harvested only about half of the barley and oats that he anticipated and that was due to the dry weather plus an early frost that we had back in late july he said kaspari says the low supply and high cost of feed and other necessities forced many producers to reduce their herds by slaughtering livestock putting more strain on the industry because when you starting eliminating breeding stock it takes years to build these herds back up he said and that hurts the farmers who grow the feed mugrage hay cattle mugrage grows hay barley and oats on his farm and uses some for his cattle and sells the rest the livestock industry is the economic engine for so much of what alaskan agriculture is all about providing feed for that industry he added farmers have always operated on slim margins and relied on good weather or at least predictable weather but climate change has altered those patterns and researchers now believe a long term drying trend is under way in the state alaska is an area where we re experiencing drought says jodie anderson the interim director of the university of alaska fairbanks agricultural and forestry experiment station she says dry weather is especially hard on plants that are beginning to spout and it s a problem for so called dry land farming a type of cultivating that doesn t require irrigation which until recently worked pretty well here in alaska we dry land farm but we get plenty of moisture from the atmosphere the natural patterns she said and those are changing and we re going to have to start irrigating some farmers around the state do irrigate but anderson says it ll likely have to done more widely to grow more food for both livestock and humans she says state and federal agencies haven t formally declared a drought in alaska but she says researchers with those agencies will talk about the problem in workshops to be held on november 14th in delta and 16th in palmer it s an opportunity for education so that farmers can maybe farm a little smarter to manage their water better so that even in dryer times they re still going to be ok anderson said the workshops will feature presentations by representatives of the uaf cooperative extension service and the federal natural resources conservation service and agriculture department s northwest climate hub as well as the national drought mitigation center anderson says the workshops are intended mainly for farmers and others in the agriculture industry but members of the public may virtually attend the meeting in palmer over the online zoom platform editor s note click hereto find out more about the drought workshops and how to virtually attend the nov 16 session in palmer

alan d miller an amazing coincidence revealed itself as i researched the history of our old house in granville a newsman unwittingly bought a house that had been built by another newsman more than a century earlier adding another layer to that newspaper history within our 152 year old house is that for most of two years my parlor became the office from which i piloted the the columbus dispatch newsroom during the covid 19 pandemic the simple wood frame house was built in 1870 by a man who published the licking monitor a newspaper serving granville from 1872 to 1874 the monthly paper was short lived and although its existence was noted in several databases of u s newspapers i could find no copies of it online it was one of several business ventures by george w evans a man who also was involved in farming real estate and retail in perhaps another coincidence i m involved with farming too and i ll get to that later i was giddy to find that the granville historical society owns one copy of most editions of the licking monitor which gave me a glimpse into the life and times of george evans his wife mary and the two daughters for whom they built the house cora and alline george s four page papers were recently digitized and eventually could be available online my family and i learned so much during this deep dive into the history of our four walls while the research was tedious at times it was a fascinating adventure and learning experience tips on where to begin when you dig into the history of your home or another property it starts with a title search a deed or title is filed with the county for every property transfer after reviewing the deeds and learning who owned the property we then searched for details about the people whose names appeared on the deeds the older the house the quicker you understand that your house really isn t your house until you leave it that s what we learned in buying the granville house which we moved into 30 years ago oh you re in the owen house we heard over and over again as we described our house located in an old section of granville members of the owen family had lived there for more than 70 years before we came along since then there has been a turnover in ownership of every other house on our block some multiple times we re the old timers in the neighborhood but still relative newcomers in the 217 year old licking county village the owen family has visited occasionally and we have welcomed them because we appreciate their history and that their family shepherded the house through a long stretch of time so that we could enjoy it now talk to previous owners neighbors we talked with neighbors even before we signed contracts on our granville house and our first home in newark we spotted our first house when we lived next door in an upstairs apartment for a year before we bought the brick italianate home across the alley we had admired it from our perch in our second floor apartment and we got to know faye the elderly owner while helping her occasionally with her chores she was a kindly woman who had never married and when she went to live in a nursing home her siblings and our neighbors encouraged us to buy her home as much as we loved the house with its foot thick brick walls arched windows and 11 foot ceilings we were 25 and 26 years old we were scared out of our minds about taking on a loan and the responsibility for a house built in 1876 one in need of a lot of work we did it though and we learned a lot when we purchased the granville house many of the neighbors had been residents of the neighborhood for years some their entire lives and they had many memories of the previous owners and life on our street if it is possible sometime before closing on a house ask the sellers about their time there and about their family if you can swing it spend an hour or so with them getting to know them and what they know about the property that might sound awkward to people who aren t journalists or naturally outgoing but you d be surprised at how many people will be flattered that you cared enough to ask in the case of our granville house which we bought 30 years ago in august it was being sold by the daughter of the previous owners as part of their estate she had grown up in this house as had her mother and she was happy to see a young family moving in my wife our three daughters and me our oldest was 5 at the time headed into kindergarten and we had 2 year old twins the seller graciously shared some of her family history three generations in this house over 75 years and a photo of the house from the early 1900s which gave us glimpses into a few changes that had been made to the front mainly a new porch she also provided names of former owners which was critical when the day came recently that i had time to visit the licking county recorder s office this is the place where a researcher can pinpoint ownership details from past sales one source leads to another i ve been writing the old house column about historic preservation and old home maintenance for the dispatch home section for more than three decades thirty years ago after i wrote about the history of our granville house a relative of the evans family contacted me and connected me with george w evans granddaughter who also happened to be granville historian and author minnie hite moody i visited moody at her home on the east side of granville where she grew up living with her grandfather the newspaper publisher george evans and near her aunts cora and alline she occasionally mentioned them in local history columns she wrote for the granville sentinel newspaper in newspaper columns from 1964 and 1970 i read that granville had 10 newspapers before 1880 moody s grandpa evans also edited a literary newspaper called the wanderer which was established in 1815 and the family monthly established in 1875 perhaps after the demise of the licking monitor i now need to look for copies of those papers thirty years ago moody was so taken with the fact that i was living in a house built by her grandfather that she gave me original photos of her grandmother mary who bought the lot on which the house was built and her aunt cora who was a local teacher their portraits have adorned our staircase collection of family photos ever since read public records county auditors and recorders keep a wealth of information a good bit of which is available online all of it is open to the public and free to access asking for copies of records generally comes with a small fee state law allows public agencies to charge for the actual cost of the copy typically a quarter a page or less but no additional fees auditors keep a lot of details related to property taxes so their records often include the year a house was built its current appraised value who currently owns the property how much they pay in taxes drawings of the footprint of the property generally what rooms are on each floor and at least one photograph of the property some sites include both a street view and an aerial view both of which are typically available in a google search of the address beware that some online information is not entirely accurate for example when some public offices digitized records to put them online they hit some glitches especially with older records in franklin county for example some properties listed in auditor s records as being built in 1800 or 1810 were built much later one look at the houses on those properties makes that clear that s why it s important to triangulate your research if the house looks like every other house on the block all of which were built around the same time in the early 1900s you should be suspicious about an 1800 construction date on the record other public records can be used to verify those findings and typically require a visit to local county offices check out actual deeds and plat maps in the recorder s office more maps are available in the county engineer s office most of these offices now also have online sites providing online access to some records but not all of them researching the family farm i ve also been working on another big research project the history of our holmes county family farm in the case of the farm in northeastern ohio s amish country the land has been passed from generation to generation for more than 200 years that s pretty rare as is demonstrated by the state s historic family farms program which celebrates the importance of working farms in ohio during the past two centuries we thought we knew a lot about the stewards who came before us at the farm but we learned this year in doing research to apply for the historic family farms program that we knew less than we thought and we had some of the history wrong with a name like miller it shouldn t be a surprise that my family has amish heritage in our background but it actually was a surprise to learn that the first two owners of our family farm were amish we know this because they are buried in an amish cemetery on the farm adjacent to our farm land they also once owned before pieces were parceled out to later generations of the family and despite our family s longtime ownership of the farm we learned these details about our ancestors just this year while tracing the genealogy of our 67 acres near walnut creek that s the reason i was at the holmes county courthouse early this past summer whether your house is five or 205 years old it has a history if you didn t build it chances are pretty good that you don t know a lot about its history beyond what you read in the dry toast legal mumbo jumbo in the deed reading a deed can be a bit like reading a foreign language until you do it for a few hours after a while the legalistic terminology becomes more familiar and easier to digest my experience has been that clerks in these offices are very patient and helpful holmes county recorder anita hall endured at least three of my visits to her office in millersburg this year while i was researching our farm and she graciously helped me find my way around her office the majority of our work here is property searches for current transfers she says maybe 5 percent is for genealogy it s really interesting like putting together a puzzle she adds hall advises that having names of previous owners in hand prior to visiting her office is helpful as is having a clear description of the property she also advises giving yourself plenty of time don t come in at 3 p m and expect to have it all done by closing time she says historically some counties did a better job than others linking current deeds to those filed before them for the same property holmes county didn t do that as much as some others do thus when searching deeds in that county i spent hours poring over indexes looking for references to the description of our farm property because i was searching for the farm s earliest owner within my family i worked backward from more current names the earliest name i knew was my great great grandfather c j miller once my research was completed i learned that the farm came to us through his wife lizzie shrock whose mother and father abraham and mary had owned the land c j and lizzie bought the land from her mother in 1902 still the search was not over in a county where there are hundreds of millers and shrocks i hit a muddy middle and wasn t sure where to turn so i went to the beginning searching for sales of that land by the united states i hit gold in a deed signed by president james madison in 1812 the u s government sold the land to david shrock of somerset county pennsylvania i haven t yet determined whether he is an ancestor of mine and there is no evidence that he ever set foot on the ohio land but two years later he sold it to my five times great grandfather john shrock john also was living in pennsylvania at the time but moved to the property in 1815 according to family history he lived there with his son john shrock jr and john jr s family john shrock sr sold it to john jr in 1833 both of the men and their wives are buried on the farm next door which was part of their original purchase we know this because of a book containing inventories and diagrams of amish cemeteries compiled in the 1970s that 1833 sale of our farmland revealed the link my research needed apparently that deed had been lost and a replacement for it was issued and recorded nearly a century later in 1934 this was one of several roadblocks that took a lot of sleuthing to work through back in granville i hit a similar snag in researching our granville house which changed hands many times between the original owners and the owen family one of those came during a sheriff s sale the deed from that sale did not include a reference to a previous deed with the trail seemingly cold i retraced my steps and reread more recent deeds finally i discovered enough information in the property descriptions to leapfrog over the sheriff s deficient recording to find the previous owners by this point i had browsed through 15 to 20 big heavy ledgers that hold the deeds in a county office if you have an opportunity to do such research you may find that the beautiful handwritten records from the 1800s are fascinating deeds won t tell exactly when a house was built because they show ownership of property that may or may not contain buildings the deeds don t usually speak about buildings but the sale price can be an indicator of when a building arrived on the site i traced the property back before the 1830s in 1869 mary evans paid 100 for the property as a gift to two of her daughters according to the deed that was actually written into the deed which is a rare and amazing detail in 1884 mary s daughters alline and cora evans sold the property for 900 this isn t scientific but based on those sale prices i surmised that an 800 house was built before the daughters sold the property in 1884 using other sourcesto triangulate a construction date we know from a historical atlas of licking county published in 1875 that the house was on this property at that time and the property was labeled g e for george evans stewarding your house all of this research illustrates that no one really owns a house we live in them hopefully enjoy them maintain or upgrade them and eventually sell them to another caretaker often the next caretaker is a complete stranger as were the stewards who came before them sometimes the same family hands off property from one generation to the next so the owners know at least a little something about previous residents we ve experienced both of those scenarios in our time caring for two old houses and the family farm and it is natural to wonder who were the people who came before us what were they like what did they do for a living what was life like for them in this place why did they add this door take away that window or cover beautiful oak woodwork with dark laminated paneling not judging just wondering and whose children s names are marked on a basement door chronicling their growth in this house sources for researching homeowners below are some resources for researching the people who built or lived in your old house google once you have names of former residents plug names into google and include if possible a general location if you find information this way you might be lucky familysearch org this online source is a free version of ancestry com my friends at the granville historical society pointed me to this resource local libraries many have collections of local history books some of which are digitized the columbus metropolitan library has an amazing local history and genealogy section in its collection much of it available online and the staff supporting this section is among the most kind and generous i have encountered they seem to love the adventure of sleuthing for details about people and properties in central ohio among the helpful resources at local libraries are old city directories which list names addresses phone numbers and other details about residents including occupations in some cases in central ohio another resource is the keyword searchable archive of the columbus dispatch which is available from this page columbuslibrary org research topics local history to anyone with a columbus metropolitan library card local historical societies and museums the more i talked about the people who built my house the more granville historical society researcher janet procida s face lit up she is a descendant of the evans family and had already researched this history it was like hitting the lottery she and archivist theresa overholser were godsends in columbus columbus landmarks is a great resource and advocate for preservation county engineer s office the engineer s office typically has a collection of historical maps that can help pinpoint when a building was constructed here s an example from the franklin county engineer s office franklincountyengineer org historical maps and information sanborn fire insurance maps these maps are available online from various sources including kent state university and the library of congress sanborn produced 40 000 detailed maps of ohio cities drawn between 1882 and 1962 the maps provide detailed drawings of properties in larger cities and villages and their purpose was to show the location and components of buildings for insurers we can see from these maps for example that a back porch was added to our house between 1905 and 1913 ohio historic preservation office this office has an extensive collection of surveys and research into the history of neighborhoods across the state many of which were prepared in nominating properties to the national register of historic places which also is a good resource for those who happen to live in a designated property the historic preservation office also provides resources and conducts workshops with tips on how to preserve your old building and its historic character columbus historic preservation office this office and its website columbus gov planning hpdra can help direct columbus residents to contacts and information about historic preservation in the city s neighborhoods the oldest neighborhoods have well established associations with their own resources for historic preservation and research links to those resources are available from the city preservation office site helpful books do an online search for your community and you re likely to find local history books that could be helpful many of them are available at your local library among my favorite books are historical atlases that were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s they typically include detailed maps of cities and villages and include information about people businesses and houses they aren t comprehensive but they can provide details such as the fact that great great grandpa christian c j miller was a farmer grain and stock raiser as was his father in law abraham abram shrock and that both of them were living on the same township lot in 1875 that was valuable information in triangulating ownership and family history on the land here s a source for such atlases historicmapworks com atlas us 9814 franklin county and columbus 1872 also high on my favorites list is a book of more than 800 pages called a field guide to american houses by virginia mcalester it s about 32 in paperback much less for used earlier versions or free for a couple of weeks from the public library this book is loaded with pictures and drawings that will help you determine architectural style knowing the architectural style of your house can be very helpful because you may then proudly brag to your friends that you own a richardson romanesque a french eclectic or a national house they will be dazzled no doubt more important knowing the style can help determine the age of the house queen anne style the classic victorian era design characterized by high gabled roofs and fancy woodwork was popular from about 1880 to about 1910 according to the field book that does not mean however that all homes built in those three decades were queen anne the shingle stick second empire and plenty of other styles show up during the same time period and for that matter with renewed interest in victorian styles many of the identifying features of the old styles are showing up in some custom houses being built in the columbus area now we think our granville house is folk victorian which was popular from 1870 to 1910 according to the book but that is far from pinpointing a building date and that is why we spent hours at the courthouse library and historical society alan d miller teaches journalism at denison university his old house handyman columns appear monthly in the columbus dispatch at home section email him at
