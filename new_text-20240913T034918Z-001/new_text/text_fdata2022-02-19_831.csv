by jonnelle marte and howard schneider reuters federal reserve officials on friday squelched what had been rising market expectations for an aggressive initial response to 40 year high u s inflation signaling that steady interest rate hikes should be enough to do the trick i don t see any compelling argument to taking a big step at the beginning new york federal reserve bank president john williams the no 2 official on the central bank s policy setting panel told reporters after a speech i think we can steadily move up interest rates and reassess he said at the online event fed governor lael brainard president joe biden s nominee to be vice chair at the fed said officials will likely kick off a series of rate increases at their upcoming meeting in march followed by decreases in the size of the fed s balance sheet in coming meetings brainard speaking at a conference in new york did not give a specific recommendation for the coming meeting but said recent changes in financial markets including a rise in mortgage rates were consistent with where the fed is heading the market is clearly aligned with that and brought forward the changes in financing conditions in a way that s consistent with our communications and data brainard said investors in federal funds futures contracts last week began leaning towards the idea the fed would raise rates a half a percentage point in march those expectations have now drifted back with a quarter point hike now anticipated and six increases in total over the year in remarks at the conference in new york chicago fed president charles evans downplayed the thought the fed needed to get more aggressive even though he agreed policy was wrong footed with annual consumer price increases topping 7 he said he remained convinced inflation would ease on its own i see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk evans said at a separate new york event we don t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike we may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot the remarks came at the end of a tumultuous week in which traders piled into and then backed away from bets that the fed would begin a round of rate hikes next month with a bigger than usual half point increase st louis fed president james bullard had fanned those expectations with a call for raising rates by a full percentage point by the fed s june meeting a rate path that would require at least one half point hike between now and then policymakers at the central bank have all but said they will start raising borrowing costs next month to quell inflation that has raced past their 2 target with fed chair jerome powell publicly silent since january williams and brainard s comments provide the best steer yet on the prevailing view at the fed s policy setting core although all fed presidents and governors participate in monetary policy decisions it is williams and powell along with the fed board vice chair a spot brainard is due to fill after senate confirmation who are most influential in shaping them steadily predictably the fed should begin raising rates next month and once rate hikes are underway begin to steadily and predictably trim its 9 trillion balance sheet williams said both actions he said will bring demand into better balance with supply at the same time he said other forces should also be bringing down inflation with supply chains healing and consumers returning to pre pandemic spending patterns williams said policymakers can speed up or slow down the pace of rate increases later as needed a path in which the overnight federal funds rate moves to a range of 2 to 2 5 by the end of next year makes sense he said williams said he expects real u s gdp to grow by slightly less than 3 this year and for the unemployment rate to drop to about 3 5 by the end of the year he projects inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index to decline to about 3 and for it to fall further next year as supply challenges improve reporting by jonnelle marte and howard schneider writing by ann saphir editing by tim ahmann
parents wresting control of their children s education from bureaucrats has generated in the words of the most panicked new york t imes writer an existential threat to public education want proof of how successful parents have been in unexpectedly thwarting the progressive agenda in schools the new york times the progressive conscience of america has gone on the offensive against book bans initiated by parental complaints with two consecutive news stories here and on the front page here and three opinion pieces here and here and here all within the last two weeks to their credit the times writers all get one thing right these so called book bans are not about books they are about what a child a reader and a society are allowed to think to know and to question this is why the times is in full panic mode the progressive left infiltrated schools decades ago precisely with the goal of transforming society s attitudes toward sex above all and it has done so with impunity suddenly parents have entered school board meetings and written to principals yelling stop and school officials are starting to listen for progressives book bans are the latest right wing conspiracy a new effort in a small but highly visible part of a much larger effort to privatize public schools and turn them into conservative propaganda centers privatize is a favorite boogey word of the left for doing so would make schools more difficult to control and students more difficult to indoctrinate so there we have it parents wresting control of their children s education from bureaucrats has generated in the words of the most panicked times writer an existential threat to public education when existential gets thrown about we know the terror level has turned bright red of course there are duplicities hidden in the times analysis first no one is calling for these books to be banned out right as in cease their publication the call is to keep them out of schools so adult content is not read by children in the times skewed telling conservatives are painted as sending america into ignorance second one times writer tries to undermine concerned parents by insisting that the content of what students read is irrelevant given the unlimited access to adult content students have on their smart phones school sponsored books and internet sleuthing are not comparable since books are fodder for knowledge reflection and transformation what children read is formative and therefore must be carefully chosen the decision to teach a book is a public endorsement of its content by contrast children know implicitly that accessing sexual content on their phones is wrong they would not conceal it otherwise should a school teach a book that describes sexual encounters and fantasies the students would receive the message loud and clear that such things are good even with the internet in each student s pocket have we acquiesced as a country to stock r rated movies in school libraries certainly not yet the books whose appropriateness for school is in dispute if they were to be made into films would all receive r ratings and what are these books the times writers not only name them but describe them these books are being read across the country in public schools and yes in some catholic schools too there s toni morrison s beloved which one times writer calls upsetting because t depicts infanticide rape bestiality torture and lynching upsetting offers a fine example of understatement in 1998 beloved was turned into a movie starring oprah winfrey and was a box office flop it received an r rating for containing according to the times film review graphic nudity sexual situations and discreetly brief flashes of terrible brutality then there is george m johnson s all boys aren t blue a memoir in the times summary about growing up black and queer that includes scenes that depict oral and anal sex and sexual assault this content the times insists is ritten for readers 14 and older determining what is age appropriate apparently is not a talent shared by all writers and educators the list of sexually explicit books being read in schools goes on the times includes toni morrison s the bluest eye maia kobabe s memoir gender queer and cory silverberg s sex is a funny word a sex education book targeted for 8 10 year olds as having been challenged by parents to this we could add octavia butler s parable of the sower maya angelou s i know why the cage bird sings and ocean vuong s on earth we are briefly gorgeous what do all these books have in common it s a superficial feature that advocates use as a ruse for hoisting these mind altering books on our children the authors are all members of under represented groups morrison johnson butler and angelou are african american while kobabe and silverberg call themselves queer and vuong is gay since their minority perspectives are so valued the argument goes their books must be read in schools so students can learn to appreciate diverse backgrounds to achieve the horrifying goal of sexualizing children it seems an author s skin color or sexual orientation covers a multitude of sins these books would have no chance of landing in school libraries and curricula if they were written by straight white men they would be recognized for the smut they are and not given the time of day concerned parents are right to challenge these books and they must continue to do so despite the racial and phobic laden insults that will meet them in response catholic parents in particular have the support of vatican ii s gravissimum educationis which champions the role of parents in the educational endeavor book bans are not about books they are about protecting our children from the real existential threat looming in schools the imposition of the sexual revolution s reign of terror on america s youngest citizens
the risk was rattled this week as geopolitical uncertainty loomed in the form of russia and the threat of an incursion into ukraine volatility soared sinking stocks and lifting gold at the time of writing the picture is still not entirely clear what the situation is however for the most part markets are accepting claims of a russian withdrawal from crimea despite the west still asking to see concrete evidence of that action uk inflation hit a record high but the bank of england is expecting a rise in inflation above 7 in april anyway inflation prints around the world will continue to grab headlines as records are smashed other key events from the past week uk inflation 50bps rate hike coming feb 16 inflation is at its highest level in 30 years for the uk and this adds pressure for more rate hikes but that pressure should be limited as uk inflation is meant to peak around 7 in april china jp morgan are bullish feb 17 with russian risk shaking the us and european stocks it is timely that jpmorgan is bullish on china s a shares it projects china to have the highest return over the next decade if russia ukrainian tensions continue to fade is this still a great time to invest in china s shares aud employment data feb 17 at the last rba meeting they were pleased with the progress made in the labour market this week s employment data should not ring any alarm bells the headline gain of 12 9k was mainly driven by part time jobs but did take place when the omicron was at its worst key events for the coming week nzd interest rate statement feb 23 with nzd inflation at a 30 year high and a red hot housing market will the rbnz make a hawkish tilt and boost the nzdjpy pair next week this is a can t miss calendar event of the week seasonal trades american express we are now heading into a strong period of seasonal strength for american express financials tend to do well in a hiking cycle usd core pce feb 25 soaring us inflation is what has been driving the case for a series of aggressive fed rate hikes if we see any signs of a miss in core pce data that should really weaken the usd it should have a similar outlook to us cpi data at the start of february learn more about hycm
geopolitical tensions between russia and ukraine dominate financial markets the us federal reserve meeting minutes failed to provide fresh clues on monetary policy eur usd is technically neutral but could turn bullish on a clear break above 1 1400 the eur usd pair ends the week little changed trading in the 1 1350 60 price zone financial activity was all about the sentiment with the latter directly linked to headlines related to geopolitical tensions between russia and ukraine the situation on the border remains uncertain after some shelling took place in donbass on thursday sounding all alarm bells in the west us president joe biden said that moscow is preparing a pretext to invade ukraine while russian president vladimir putin accused washington of ignoring its security demands sentiment likely to hold the grip risk related sentiment improved temporarily throughout the week mostly when headlines suggested russia was pulling back troops by the end of the week however moscow announced new drills on saturday for the most part the market mood was sour with investors moving away from higher yielding assets for a change the dollar was left aside to the benefit of other safe haven assets such as gold or the jpy resulting in pairs such as eur usd holding within tight ranges elsewhere stocks fell and wall street was down for a second consecutive week reflecting the cautious tone while us government bonds appreciated resulting in lower yields which somehow added to the greenback s lack of strength will russia finally invade kyiv and what could happen then well it seems more likely that putin get away with what he wants that is taking control over ukraine and preventing the country from adopting a westernized lifestyle than having a strong response from the west despite the strong wording from nato leaders such a scenario will likely maintain financial markets in risk off mode for a while but it seems unlikely it will remain as the main market motor for longer than a couple of more weeks measured fed disappoints investors us federal reserve officials keep hinting at upcoming rate hikes the central bank released the minutes of the latest fomc meeting on wednesday and the document confirmed what the market already knew policymakers are ready to hike and are moving on with plans to reduce their balance sheet investors were disappointed about voting members maintaining a measured approach to monetary policy tightening ahead of the release speculative interest was pricing in up to a 75 bps hike in march down to 50 bps after the event another factor weighing negatively on the dollar s demand the macroeconomic calendar included some relevant figures that anyway failed to impress the eu published the second estimate of its q4 gross domestic product which was confirmed at 0 3 qoq germany unveiled the february zew survey which showed that economic sentiment missed expectations in the country printing 54 3 while that for the eu contracted by less than anticipated to 48 6 the us published january retail sales which unexpectedly increased by 3 8 in the month much better than the 2 0 expected industrial production and capacity utilization improved in january although initial jobless claims were up to 248k in the week ended february 11 what s next in the calendar the upcoming week will be a busier one in terms of data as it will start with markit releasing the preliminary estimates of its february pmis for europe and the us germany will publish the ifo business climate survey and the gfk consumer confidence survey while the eu will unveil january inflation estimates the us calendar includes the second estimate of q4 gross domestic product and january durable goods orders among other minor reports eur usd technical outlook the weekly chart for the eur usd pair shows that despite trading in the green it has posted a lower low and a lower high which skews the risk to the downside furthermore a firmly bearish 20 sma capped advances providing resistance alongside a fibonacci level at around the 1 1400 threshold technical indicators have seesawed within negative levels heading into the close without directional strength the daily chart shows that the pair has spent the last three days in consolidation mode above a flat 20 sma but below a bearish 100 sma the momentum indicator approached overbought levels but turned firmly lower while the rsi indicator remains lifeless around 51 reflecting the absence of speculative interest chances of a firmer advance should increase if the pair breaks above 1 1400 while the next relevant resistance level is 1 1470 beyond the latter the pair has room to run up to the 1 1600 20 price zone the 1 1300 level provides support ahead of 1 1240 if the latter gives up the pair can extend its decline towards 1 1160 en route to the yearly low at 1 1120 eur usd sentiment poll the fxstreet forecast poll indicates that speculative interest is still belting for king dollar bears outcome bulls in the three time frame under study standing above 70 in the monthly and quarterly views the range of possible targets is well limited in the next couple of weeks reflecting the ongoing uncertainty as the pair is seen holding pretty much between 1 1000 and 1 1400 however the spread of possible targets widens in the quarterly view with the pair seen as low as 1 0500 and as high as 1 2200 the overview chart shows that the moving averages have lost their previous bullish slopes now offering neutral to bearish stances it is also notable that in every time frame forecasted most targets accumulate around or below the current level

by megan davies and chris prentice new york washington reuters u s prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks according to two sources familiar with the situation the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms including such well known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors reuters and other media have reported while prosecutors haven t made any decisions yet potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico were an option on the table the sources said in the past prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations such as manipulation one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u s attorney s office in los angeles which are involved in the probe according to the sources declined to comment citron declined to comment a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment the potential use of the 1970 law which has not been previously reported provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department s unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged criminal enterprise even if they participated indirectly lawyers said but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people that s in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity they said among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so called short and distort scheme sources have previously told reuters in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company s stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited the sources have said they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports reuters previously reported rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery money laundering or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented u s prosecutors in 2019 charged then current and former jpmorgan chase co executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals rico statutes haven t been used in this realm often in recent years but they aren t limited to organized crime robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said it s certainly in the prosecutors toolbox additional reporting by svea herbst bayliss editing by michelle price paritosh bansal and diane craft
it s no longer shocking when a global luxury brand raises prices on its most coveted bags shoes and dresses as louis vuitton did earlier this week for years luxury brands have been upping the numbers at a steady clip even as more affordable clothes and accessories have gotten cheaper often these increases are attributed to higher materials costs or clogged supply chains that can t keep up with soaring demand that s not entirely spin labels such as gucci louis vuitton and others have bought up alligator farms and opened sprawling workshops in recent years to ensure they can create enough shoes and bags and shoes to satisfy customer demand but another reason a chanel 2 55 bag costs nearly double what it did five years ago is that a healthy share of the brand s customers are willing to pay those higher prices without blinking an eye a soaring stock market spiking real estate prices and new middle and upper class consumers in developing countries created seemingly endless demand the industry s biggest brands have taken full advantage there are a growing number of signs the party could soon be over however even as record sales and profits give luxury brands the confidence to step up the pace of price hikes advertisement in china economic growth has slowed and a troubled property market plus last year s crackdown on conspicuous consumption has worried luxury brands if not meaningfully dented sales the s p 500 index is down about 7 percent this year and tech stocks that fuelled much of the gains of the last decade hit especially hard the crypto market which has created a new pool of luxury super consumers is going through one of its period busts but the real immediate threat is inflation what started as a seemingly temporary pandemic induced spike in the cost of manufacturing and shipping goods threatens to turn into something more lasting in the us overall prices rose 7 5 percent in 2021 the most in 40 years consumer prices rose 5 5 percent in the uk a nearly 30 year high the us federal reserve plans to raise interest rates to contain rising prices but that will cause economic pain too where chanel was an outlier with its regular price increases before it s now common to see consumer brands from crocs to nestle pass along escalating costs to consumers a luxury executive might brush this off if their customers didn t care about rising prices in 2021 or 2019 why should they now this would be a mistake as we reach the end of the pandemic consumers will once again spend a larger portion of their discretionary income on experiences especially travel and restaurants they ll also feel the impact of inflation on everything not just fashion in other words consumers radar is up in a way it wasn t before the pool of shoppers willing to spend more and more to get their hands on a louis vuitton neverfull bag will get smaller what s more there s a movement among a certain set of consumers in the us and europe especially but also china to reject the highly commoditised easy to access look of masstige luxury at some point the market will simply no longer be able to absorb further price increases the brands that benefit from the shift in behaviour will offer products that consumers deem of high value for the prices they pay hermès is one such label that exemplifies this concept and may escape lasting damage should there be a backlash to sky high prices but those that rely on trend driven items to drive growth will feel the squeeze advertisement the news in brief fashion business and the economy kering sales beat estimates on gucci

last week a tiny back page item in the new york times reported that the president of ukraine had come to believe that as much as he wants ukraine to join nato it may be just a dream suggesting a willingness to forego membership then came another small news item that might offer help a report that vladimir putin has suggested using cbms confidence building measures to resolve issues with nato rather than strive for a comprehensive agreement that seems out of reach cbms are worth exploring the idea behind them is that parties to a conflict take small but significant steps reciprocally to move away from a potential battlefield reducing tensions preventing escalation of hostilities and building mutual confidence in each side s motives are the immediate objectives there can be two party or multiple party cbms agreement on cbms does not resolve a conflict but it lays the basis for positive momentum that might in the end result in a settlement of course each step of the way holds out the possibility of failure either intentionally or accidentally but that is also the beauty of cbms since each step is small any defect can be rectified or if not replaced with something more workable cbms depend to some extent on trust each side trusts that the other side will take a corresponding step back as president reagan once said when talking about arms control agreements with russia however trust but verify thus cbms are always accompanied by verification components such as on the spot international inspectors surveillance technologies and reporting procedures cbms have been effective in european troop deployments the nuclear agreement with iran and the china india border dispute and they might work in the current crisis over ukraine what might cbms in the crisis look like one common cbm is monitoring of troop deployments to prevent surprise attacks or misperceptions of intentions another is a cease fire in border areas third is a pullback or reduction of forces from the ukraine border a fourth step could be removal of threatening weapons such as us missiles from poland and russian missiles from their own territory alternatively a cbm would simply halt additional weapon deployments there are also all kinds of economic cbms that could be arranged such as removal of us and european sanctions step by step and russian commitments to keep natural gas flowing to germany and beyond the nord stream 2 project very importantly cbms should be considered with regard to cyber attacks finally cbms also have nonmilitary applications such as social and cultural exchanges michael mcfaul the former us ambassador to moscow writes in the current issue of foreign affairs that biden in concert with allies and partners should seize the diplomatic offensive and counter with a comprehensive grand bargain for enhancing european security call it helsinki 2 0 that idea makes sense but in the present circumstances seems premature and because it is so ambitious more likely to fail than cbms granted cbms only bear tangentially on the main problem in the current crisis security in central europe they don t meet either russia s demands for a nato withdrawal or nato s demands for russian withdrawal in short they don t establish a new european security order as putin has been demanding and amb mcfaul is advocating but what cbms might accomplish is a series of substantive verifiable steps that reduce tensions and at the outside start a trust building process and right now we need a few small steps however even small temporary steps may not alleviate the ukraine crisis nato seems to be opposed to any move that suggests a weakening of its commitment to ukraine s defense nor is it clear which cbms putin favors we have examples of cbms being rejected even when they seem so logical in preventing violent conflict the china taiwan tensions have not led to agreement on cbms because china first demands that taiwan affirm the principle of one china the lesson here is that although cbms are relatively easy to devise agreeing on and implementing them are no small matters let s hope that president zelensky in ukraine relents on his dream and putin in moscow agrees to cbms because if they don t we ll have war mel gurtov syndicated by peacevoice is professor emeritus of political science at portland state university and blogs at in the human interest

leave it to elon musk to stir up controversy without saying or tweeting a word in november according to a regulatory filling the tesla ceo donated to charity about 5 million shares of company stock worth 5 7 billion since the filing with the securities and exchange commission was made public monday tesla hasn t responded to a request for comment nor has musk mentioned the donation on twitter his favorite communications forum yet that hasn t quelled debates in and out of philanthropy about transparency tax deductions and congressional legislation along with speculation about where exactly the money was donated some experts say musk likely donated his shares to his donor advised fund or daf for short dafs are essentially charitable investment accounts in which donors can claim a tax deduction upfront but aren t legally required to distribute the money experts say that would be the most advantageous strategy for musk currently the world s richest man with an approximate net worth of more than 220 billion a daf donation would allow him to claim a tax deduction of as much as 30 of his 2021 adjusted gross income instead of 20 if he had donated it instead to his foundation musk could also deduct the fair market value of the stock instead of its original value he can do whatever he wants with his money anyone can said john arnold a billionaire philanthropist who co founded the laura and john arnold foundation and arnold ventures with his wife laura but if he s getting a subsidy from society through this tax deduction then there s a responsibility that goes with it whether or not musk donated his tesla shares to a daf arnold said the possibility that he did highlights a questionable tax loophole for many wealthy americans society is giving them this tax deduction this subsidy to encourage more resources to get to communities arnold said but the way that the tax law is structured today it doesn t necessitate that that happens you can get the tax deduction today and there s no requirement for that money ever to get to the community you can give money to a donor advised fund and keep it in a tax free investment account forever tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk speaks at the satellite conference and exhibition march 9 2020 in washington arnold and others who want to address that loophole have formed a coalition the initiative to accelerate charitable giving that seeks to tighten requirements for dafs and other financial vehicles used by the wealthy this month a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a bill in the house of representatives that would limit how long donations can remain in a daf untaxed similar bipartisan legislation was introduced last year in the u s senate many daf proponents oppose the changes arguing that dafs with an average payout rate of around 20 are distributing money faster and more robustly than many private foundations whose average distribution is generally only slightly above the 5 annually required by law according to the stanford law school policy lab on donor advised funds if musk did place tesla shares in a daf the tax law s intent backfired arnold said the community received neither the tax revenue generated by musk s income on the shares or the philanthropic benefit that the tax deduction was meant to create dafs also allow for anonymity benjamin soskis a historian of philanthropy and a senior researcher at the urban institute suggested that musk s donation shows norms may be tipping towards a lack of disclosure about where large gifts are landing when you re giving away that much money it is by definition a matter of public interest where it s going to soskis said generally musk s approach to donations has differed from that of many other wealthy donors who are often accused of publicizing their gifts as a way to burnish their reputations about a month before donating his stock the notoriously provocative musk engaged in a twitter fight with the head of the united nations world food programme who had urged billionaires to donate 6 billion on a one time basis to help end starvation musk said he would sell 6 billion of tesla stock and donate the proceeds to the agency if it could show how the money would solve world hunger david beasley the organization s executive director said this week that it had yet to receive a donation from the tesla ceo soskis of the urban institute has suggested that there s room for musk to be more transparent about his gifts while still signaling his contempt for elite public opinion as the tesla ceo frequently does at times musk does provide transparency about his donations last year he gave 50 million to st jude s children s research hospital he also donated about 30 million to a variety of public schools and nonprofits in south texas where spacex builds its rockets his private foundation s latest irs filing shows he donated 11 000 tesla shares to the charity in 2019 from july that year to june 2020 the foundation distributed 23 6 million in grants some of that went directly to working charities but a large chunk 20 7 million went to fidelity charitable a grantmaker that sponsors dafs some who have worked with musk explain his style of philanthropy by saying he isn t focused on looking good marcius extavour vice president of climate and energy at xprize which manages musk s 100 million prize for carbon removal says musk wanted the project to be focused on finding impactful solutions and didn t want it to use his image everywhere that s in contrast to some other donors who extavour asserts seem more concerned about invitations to speaking engagements and other events it s been pretty nice to work with the musk foundation as a donor who is not nitpicking on how we describe this or how we describe that extavour said or making sure they get the shine or the limelight steve greanias general manager of fundraising solutions for the fundraising platform givesmart says that like most people working in philanthropy he is curious about where musk s money went and how it was or will be used yet he doesn t think it s necessarily everyone s business to know his own platform which serves about 8 000 nonprofits and has processed about 800 million in donations accepts anonymous donations if you have this kind of money and you want to do good with it and you don t feel the need to be recognized for it that s ok greanias said that s between you and the organization as long as your relationship s ok with them it shouldn t matter if the world wants

smartphone line up these won t be the only new iphones this year the third generation of apple s entry level iphone se family is expected to launch during the upcoming march event and production is reportedly under way the affordable iphone se 3rd gen is likely going to be 5g enabled however it is expected to have the same design and build of the previous gen model along with the iphone se we

computers touch id single lens rear camera and iphone 8 design getty apple s user privacy problem following last week s news from zdnet that apple has been storing user voice data without permission apple has clarified its stance noting the bug was addressed in ios 15 2 not 15 4 nevertheless the situation is still worrying while the company is to be credited for acting more quickly than originally thought two months after user audio was wrongly shared with apple rather than five months it does nothing to absolve the company s lack of transparency around this issue upon learning that user audio was being recorded without permission and set to apple servers the only acceptable action was for apple to be transparent and communicate to users what had happened bug or not the error represented a clear breach of user privacy as it stands on multiple occasions apple has now had access to audio records of its users without their permission details below and every time apple had to be caught out before admitting what had happened zdnet via forbes new macs are coming but which ones thanks to some timely and required submissions for certification apple has tacitly confirmed three new macs are on their way beyond the model numbers we re left with speculation and intuition on what to expect but there are two obvious gaps that need filling before the end of the year last year saw the imac launch at the spring event albeit this was in mid april rather than the more traditional march slot seeing the imac pro one year later certainly fits in with apple s love of calendar based regularity the mac pro is also waiting on the move to the arm based chipset with the last release in december 2019 this machine could be waiting until the end of the year or both the pro machines could come out now as the final m1 family members ahead of the introduction of the m2 at wwdc in june for a q4 launch forbes what about an m2 macbook pro what if it was a macbook pro there s certainly some discussion in the air with the focus on a potential debut of the m2 chip in an entry level macbook pro this may be a case of apple making a decision much closer to the time hence the mixed signals online no doubt some subtle expectation management will take place over the next few weeks so nobody is disappointed about the final choice on timing based on the new information seen by macrumors the upcoming 13 inch macbook pro retains the same design as the current version including the touch bar but unlike the 14 inch and 16 inch macbook pro models it will not have a notch or a promotion display contrary to some rumors if so that means the headline difference in the new entry level macbook pro model will be the new m2 chip which features the same number of cpu cores as the m1 processor up to 10 graphics cores and improved performance macrumors first diabetic pump control app cleared by fda the american fda regulator has approved tandem diabetes care s mobile app that will allow diabetics to control their own insulin pumps through their smartphone this will be the first app given approval to provide this service previously any system required the delivery to be controlled by the pump directly now the app can be used with this update pump users will be able to program or cancel bolus doses of insulin which are taken at mealtimes and are crucial in keeping blood glucose levels under control giving a meal bolus is now the most common reason a person interacts with their pump and the ability to do so using a smartphone app offers a convenient and discrete solution john sheridan president and ceo of tandem diabetes care said in a statement the change could be a big improvement for people who prefer not to have pumps out in public settings or attach them to undergarments like bras the verge how apple hurt facebook and meta how much has apple s moves to restrict user tracking in on device advertising impacted facebook and parent company meta the headline figures is 10 billion in revenue but that announcement last week saw 250 billion knocked off the company s value what happens next peter kafka dives deep to find out the short version as coo sheryl sandberg told investors last week facebook s ad targeting became less accurate because it now knows less about its users which means facebook advertisers have to spend more money in the hope of reaching people on iphones and that facebook advertisers who had been used to measuring the effectiveness of their campaigns down to the penny now have to make much less informed guesses about whether their ad dollars are working recode and finally it s time to say goodbye to the iphone 6 plus as apple moves its first big iphone to the vintage product list which effectively means that repairs may still be possible but only if parts are in stock it s a quiet ramp down to the obsolete list and the death knell of support but it is a graceful ramp down the vintage products list features devices that apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago apple provides service and parts for vintage devices for up to 7 years or as required by law but repairs are subject to parts availability apple stopped supporting the iphone 6 and 6 plus with software updates back in 2019 with the launch of ios 13 macrumors apple loop brings you seven days worth of

federal reserve approves stricter trading rules file this may 4 2021 file photo shows the federal reserve building in washington the federal reserve on friday feb 18 2022 formally adopted sweeping new rules that will limit the ability of its top officials to invest in financial markets a change intended to prevent ap photo patrick semansky file washington ap the federal reserve on friday formally adopted sweeping new rules that will limit the ability of its top officials to invest in financial markets a change intended to prevent conflicts of interest involving investments affected by fed policies the stricter rules were developed after an outcry last year over questionable trades that were made by several top fed policymakers under the new rules fed officials may not invest in individual stocks bonds or cryptocurrencies and are limited to diversified investments such as mutual funds they must provide 45 days notice of any trade and secure approval of such trades and they will have to provide public notice of any trades made in the previous 30 days fed chair jerome powell announced the rules in october after ethics questions engulfed several high ranking policymakers about trades they had made in securities that stood to be affected by fed actions at the time the central bank s decisions on interest rates and bank regulations can cause significant swings in the prices of stocks bonds and other securities powell himself had come under fire after it was revealed that two regional federal reserve bank presidents traded stocks and other investments in the spring of 2020 while the fed was taking expansive steps to boost the economy and calm financial markets as a result the trades raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the two officials could have profited from the fed s actions the new rules will also cover senior vice presidents at the fed s 12 regional banks research directors at the regional banks and senior staff members at the fed in washington as well as their spouses the rules will take effect may 1
investors are looking for stalwarts in the storm the stock market completed another troubling week with major market indexes moving still lower on friday there are a host of issues to look at including the russia ukraine conflict the federal reserve s monetary policy tightening and ongoing economic pressures from supply chain disruptions and other problems those worries sent the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 s p 500 gspc 1 20 and nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 lower again on friday extending the correction still further index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 68 233 s p 500 0 72 31 nasdaq 1 23 169 even though the markets were down investors focused on some success stories the kinds of stocks they looked at though revealed some of the thought process that the investing community seems to be moving toward here we ll look more closely at why dollar tree dltr 0 14 and matson matx 0 94 both moved higher significantly on friday money grows at dollar tree shares of dollar tree finished up more than 5 on friday the dollar store retailer made an upper level management move that gave investors a signal that some more drastic changes might be coming to the company in the near future executive board chair bob sasser announced that he will retire from his position the move will happen before dollar tree s 2022 shareholder meeting according to the release the 70 year old sasser will retain the honorary title of chairman emeritus after retiring sasser has worked with dollar tree for more than 20 years including leading the company as ceo from 2003 to 2017 in his time with the company dollar tree s size has grown more than tenfold using several key metrics including store count size of its workforce annual revenue and market capitalization of its stock it might seem odd for the departure of such a prominent player in dollar tree s success to prompt an upward move in the stock price however traders are speculating that the activist investors who have focused on dollar tree might now have more of a free hand to suggest more sweeping changes at dollar tree if those moves prove to be shareholder friendly then it could push the dollar store stock price back to all time highs and then some matson ships it meanwhile shares of marine shipping company matson were higher by 11 on friday favorable financial results on thursday evening helped lift the hawaii based company and better times ahead could continue to lift the stock matson s fourth quarter financial report was positively stellar operating revenue jumped more than 80 year over year to 1 27 billion wrapping up a year with a 65 rise in operating sales compared to 2020 levels net income soared more than four times from year earlier levels in the fourth quarter with earnings coming in at 9 39 per share supply chain issues are helping matson dramatically its service to china is an important element of its ocean transportation segment with elevated demand for expedited service helping to boost sales meanwhile matson is also seeing hefty volume in its domestic trade and its logistics business is benefiting from inventory restocking efforts and strong supply and demand dynamics in its core markets even after today s jump matson s stock price remains below 100 per share that puts a ridiculously low earnings multiple on the stock that clearly anticipates supply chain disruptions putting a big crimp in matson s bottom line going forward even if earnings do fall the question is whether they ll fall so much as to justify making the stock look like an attractive value right now
elon musk s 5 7b donation sparks questions about giving file tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk speaks at the satellite conference and exhibition march 9 2020 in washington according to a regulatory filling the tesla ceo donated about 5 million shares of company stock worth roughly 5 7 billion to charity in november 2021 tesla didn t respond to a request for comment and musk has not commented on twitter about the donation since the filing with the u s securities and exchange commission was made public monday feb 14 2022 ap photo susan walsh file leave it to elon musk to stir up controversy without saying or tweeting a word in november according to a regulatory filling the tesla ceo donated to charity about 5 million shares of company stock worth 5 7 billion since the filing with the securities and exchange commission was made public monday tesla hasn t responded to a request for comment nor has musk mentioned the donation on twitter his favorite communications forum yet that hasn t quelled debates in and out of philanthropy about transparency tax deductions and congressional legislation along with speculation about where exactly the money was donated some experts say musk likely donated his shares to his donor advised fund or daf for short dafs are essentially charitable investment accounts in which donors can claim a tax deduction upfront but aren t legally required to distribute the money experts say that would be the most advantageous strategy for musk currently the world s richest man with an approximate net worth of more than 220 billion a daf donation would allow him to claim a tax deduction of as much as 30 of his 2021 adjusted gross income instead of 20 if he had donated it instead to his foundation musk could also deduct the fair market value of the stock instead of its original value he can do whatever he wants with his money anyone can said john arnold a billionaire philanthropist who co founded the laura and john arnold foundation and arnold ventures with his wife laura but if he s getting a subsidy from society through this tax deduction then there s a responsibility that goes with it whether or not musk donated his tesla shares to a daf arnold said the possibility that he did highlights a questionable tax loophole for many wealthy americans society is giving them this tax deduction this subsidy to encourage more resources to get to communities arnold said but the way that the tax law is structured today it doesn t necessitate that that happens you can get the tax deduction today and there s no requirement for that money ever to get to the community you can give money to a donor advised fund and keep it in a tax free investment account forever arnold and others who want to address that loophole have formed a coalition the initiative to accelerate charitable giving that seeks to tighten requirements for dafs and other financial vehicles used by the wealthy this month a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a bill in the house of representatives that would limit how long donations can remain in a daf untaxed similar bipartisan legislation was introduced last year in the u s senate many daf proponents oppose the changes arguing that dafs with an average payout rate of around 20 are distributing money faster and more robustly than many private foundations whose average distribution is generally only slightly above the 5 annually required by law according to the stanford law school policy lab on donor advised funds if musk did place tesla shares in a daf the tax law s intent backfired arnold said the community received neither the tax revenue generated by musk s income on the shares or the philanthropic benefit that the tax deduction was meant to create dafs also allow for anonymity benjamin soskis a historian of philanthropy and a senior researcher at the urban institute suggested that musk s donation shows norms may be tipping towards a lack of disclosure about where large gifts are landing when you re giving away that much money it is by definition a matter of public interest where it s going to soskis said generally musk s approach to donations has differed from that of many other wealthy donors who are often accused of publicizing their gifts as a way to burnish their reputations about a month before donating his stock the notoriously provocative musk engaged in a twitter fight with the head of the united nations world food programme who had urged billionaires to donate 6 billion on a one time basis to help end starvation musk said he would sell 6 billion of tesla stock and donate the proceeds to the agency if it could show how the money would solve world hunger david beasley the organization s executive director said this week that it had yet to receive a donation from the tesla ceo soskis of the urban institute has suggested that there s room for musk to be more transparent about his gifts while still signaling his contempt for elite public opinion as the tesla ceo frequently does at times musk does provide transparency about his donations last year he gave 50 million to st jude s children s research hospital he also donated about 30 million to a variety of public schools and nonprofits in south texas where spacex builds its rockets his private foundation s latest irs filing shows he donated 11 000 tesla shares to the charity in 2019 from july that year to june 2020 the foundation distributed 23 6 million in grants some of that went directly to working charities but a large chunk 20 7 million went to fidelity charitable a grantmaker that sponsors dafs some who have worked with musk explain his style of philanthropy by saying he isn t focused on looking good marcius extavour vice president of climate and energy at xprize which manages musk s 100 million prize for carbon removal says musk wanted the project to be focused on finding impactful solutions and didn t want it to use his image everywhere that s in contrast to some other donors who extavour asserts seem more concerned about invitations to speaking engagements and other events it s been pretty nice to work with the musk foundation as a donor who is not nitpicking on how we describe this or how we describe that extavour said or making sure they get the shine or the limelight steve greanias general manager of fundraising solutions for the fundraising platform givesmart says that like most people working in philanthropy he is curious about where musk s money went and how it was or will be used yet he doesn t think it s necessarily everyone s business to know his own platform which serves about 8 000 nonprofits and has processed about 800 million in donations accepts anonymous donations if you have this kind of money and you want to do good with it and you don t feel the need to be recognized for it that s ok greanias said that s between you and the organization as long as your relationship s ok with them it shouldn t matter if the world wants to know where money came from ____ the associated press receives support from the lilly endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits the ap is

gas prices nationally have surged to nearly an 8 year high and experts say more costly fuel bills could be coming with both the possible russian invasion of the ukraine and the typical rise in prices as summer nears nationally gas prices on average are at 3 51 a gallon for regular as of friday according to gasbuddy com that s up nearly 20 cents from last month and 91 cents from the same time last year that matches prices not seen nationally since the summer of 2014 i worry that we could see some really high gasoline prices in the coming months that will have a profoundly negative effect on large portions of the population robert sinclair a aaa northeast spokesman who tracks gas prices said while he declined to predict how high gas prices could go sinclair said increased demand and the switch to summer blend gasoline alone has led to price increases of 25 to 30 cents per gallon in the past the continued pain at the pump might make price shopping more of a necessity crude oil the raw product that gasoline is refined from is trading on commodity markets for 91 76 a barrel down from 95 46 high for the year that hit on valentine s day oil prices had not been that high since since the fall of 2014 according to nasdaq gasoline prices continue to rise as a result of the rising price of crude oil which continues to go up due to worries among oil traders that a war between russia and ukraine is imminent and would disrupt the flow of oil with both countries in the dispute major oil producers sinclair said sanctions or a slowdown in the flow of russian oil to the world market would increase prices he said u s energy information administration ranks russia as the third largest oil producer in the world after saudi arabia and the united states the u s consumes more oil at 20 54 million barrels a day than the 18 61 million barrels of oil it produces based on eia 2020 statistics not all those 18 billion barrels stay here the eia reported that 8 5 million barrels a day of u s produced crude oil is exported u s oil is exported to countries where it will get the highest price which are mexico canada china japan and india the eia reported would prices go down if the u s kept domestically produced oil in the country having that oil ordered to stay here would only help with supply problems which we don t have sinclair said the extra oil would not be sufficient to affect price which is decided by global market forces the same situation would hold true if president joe biden ordered more oil released from the u s strategic oil reserves as he did in november oil from the strategic reserve again would affect supply but wouldn t do much to change prices sinclair said last time oil was released it was 50 million barrels about five days worth of u s output which would have a negligible impact even without turmoil between russia and ukraine higher prices would still be on the road ahead for drivers in the spring for two reasons more driving and switching from winter blend gas in about a month experts said with demand poised to increase as the weather warms commodity traders worry that opec won t be able to keep up increasing the value of crude especially if supply modes are disrupted sinclair said
vol 46 no 7 friday february 18 2022 congress eyes more financial disclosure for federal judges print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap federal judges would have to publicly disclose more about their finances under a bill approved by the senate this week which aims to make the judiciary subject to similar transparency requirements as lawmakers the bipartisan bill by sens john cornyn r texas and chris coons d del is intended to make it easier for the public to find out if a judge s financial holdings could pose a conflict of interest in a case they are presiding over the measure was approved by a voice vote thursday and now goes to the house for consideration the effort comes as judges have faced increased scrutiny for failing to recuse themselves from matters in which they could have an interest like stock ownership in a company that is part of a case before them federal judges are required to file annual disclosures but those documents are not readily available to the public without filing a written request even then the judge must first be notified it can take months and potentially far longer to obtain the filings the financial disclosures of lawmakers and congressional candidates on the other hand are posted online and under a 2012 law known as the stock act lawmakers must also file reports within 45 days after selling holdings like company stock which judges don t have to do federal judges should never have been excluded from the stock act s disclosure requirements and this oversight has resulted in conflicts of interest that erode public trust in our judiciary said cornyn the legislation could come into play as congress debates new financial ethics rules for lawmakers including a ban on owning stocks public anger over congressional trading has mounted since the first tremors of the pandemic when some lawmakers were caught buying and selling millions of dollars worth of stock after being warned about the coming disruption from the virus a number of the trades were probed by the justice department though no lawmakers have been charged a handful of bills have been introduced to limit lawmakers ability to hold stock but some powerful figures in congress have said they would prefer a more targeted approach like increased penalties than an outright ban house speaker nancy pelosi has said that any legislative push should also address judges the judiciary has no reporting of stock transactions and it makes important decisions everyday pelosi told reporters this month referring to the periodic reports lawmakers must make when they buy or sell stocks which comes on top of their required annual financial disclosures we have to do this to deter something that we see as a problem it is a confidence issue cornyn and coons bill would require the federal court system to create a searchable online database of judges financial disclosures posted within 90 days of being filed judges would also be subjected to the stock act s requirement of filing periodic transaction reports within 45 days of securities transactions over 1 000 it would still allow judges to request redactions of personal information on financial disclosure reports due to a security concern under current rules federal judges are prohibited from hearing cases that involve a party in which they or their immediate family have a financial interest but an investigation by the wall street journal last year found that between 2010 and 2018 over 130 federal judges did not recuse themselves in hundreds of cases in which they or their family had a financial interest coons said the bill if signed into law would make sure our legal system is free from conflicts of interest so that everyone can have clarity and confidence when they enter a courtroom

vol 46 no 7 friday february 18 2022 fed officials push back on rapid interest rate hikes print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required new york ap the federal reserve should start raising interest rates next month to help rein in too high inflation federal reserve bank of new york president john williams said friday but he added that the rate hikes may not have to begin with as big a bang as some have suggested with inflation at its hottest level in two generations the fed is widely expected to seek to cool the economy by raising its benchmark short term interest rate from its record low of nearly zero where it s been throughout the pandemic the only question has been how big and how quickly it will move because an overly aggressive approach could choke the economy while too much caution could let inflation spiral further personally i don t see any compelling argument to take a big step at the beginning williams said following an event at new jersey city university to discuss the economy and interest rates williams who is vice chair of the committee that sets the fed s interest rate policy said he sees a march increase as the beginning of a steadily moving process to get interest rates closer to a level where they are no longer stimulating the economy he also said he expects inflation to fall from its current level due to a confluence of factors including the fed s moves and hoped for improvements in supply chain bottlenecks last month inflation hit 7 5 in january compared with a year ago williams comments were echoed by other fed officials who spoke at a policy conference in new york this support for a steady approach to rate hikes contrasted with previous statements by federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard who said the fed should consider a half point rate hike in one of its upcoming meetings twice its normal increase his comments shook wall street which had been expecting a slower liftoff of rates lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said that she expected the fed would at its next meeting in march initiate a series of rate increases brainard is close to fed chair jerome powell and has been nominated for vice chair the fed s no 2 position krishna guha an analyst at investment bank evercore isi said that brainard broadly endorsed wall street s expectations that the fed will hike rates six times this year she also said the fed would soon turn to reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled during the pandemic because of the fed s bond purchases she said they would likely do so more quickly than from 2017 2019 when they allowed about 50 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them charles evans president of the chicago fed said friday that the fed needed to adjust its low interest rate policies which he called wrong footed but he also suggested that the central bank may not have to sharply raise rates this year evans also said that high prices have mostly been caused by disruptions to supply chains and other factors stemming from the pandemic and will likely fade partly on their own and given the economy s current strength the fed s moves shouldn t slow hiring as much as interest rate hikes have in the past evans added higher rates can corral inflation by slowing the economy but they can also cause a recession if they go too high and they put downward pressure on all kinds of investments from stock prices to cryptocurrencies wall street has been fixated on almost every word from fed officials recently hoping to divine how quickly and by how much the fed will move the mix of aggressive and moderate comments have left traders expectations in flux traders were pricing in only a 21 probability of such a half point move on friday afternoon down from 49 a week earlier according to cme group williams said he did not want to get into minute details about whether market expectations are in line with his own thinking for interest rate policy but he said that the big picture movements make sense based on expectations that the fed will move its key interest rate closer to normal like 2 to 2 5 by the end of next year that s higher than the most recent forecast fed officials gave in december they had a median projection of 1 6 for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 evans who typically favors lower interest rates acknowledged that if inflation stayed high throughout this year a larger number of rate hikes could be necessary other speakers at the new york conference focused on whether the fed had erred when it adopted its new policy framework in august 2020 which sought to keep rates low until inflation actually materialized previously the fed would typically raise borrowing costs when the economy was healthy to preempt any inflation frederick mishkin a former fed governor and economist at columbia university said the fed had made a serious mistake in not hiking rates earlier to prevent inflation from taking off now fed officials may have to raise rates much higher to bring prices back in line he added evans however defended the fed s new policy framework by pointing out that in the past when the fed hiked rates to preempt inflation such moves likely cost many jobs and in some cases inflation didn t materialize following the remarks by williams and evans the two year treasury note fell to 1 46 from 1 49 late thursday it tends to move with expectations for the fed s policy on rates stocks and other areas of the bond market were also lower amid worries about a possible russian invasion of ukraine

key takeaways the u s eu and uk are coordinating a significant sanctions and export controls package to be implemented if russia takes further action in ukraine restrictions are likely to target key russian industries including finance energy and defense and would be far more severe and far reaching than past sanctions new export controls could include restrictions on foreign produced items made using u s origin technology or software and a possible ban on a significant range of exports to russia from the u s and its allies individuals or companies with business interests or investments in russia should begin or continue contingency planning to mitigate risk _____________________________________________________ for months the biden administration and the governments of u s allies around the world have raised concerns about russian actions in the region in the same breath those governments have warned of massive coordinated sanctions against russia as the certain response to an escalation of the conflict despite months of diplomacy tensions have soared and there are now too many tea leaves to dismiss as merely hypothetical the threats of a renewed armed conflict breaking out in the region and the resulting crippling sanctions the biden administration has now assessed that russia has massed sufficient forces around ukraine to launch an invasion the u s and allied countries as well as russia have ordered diplomatic staff and private citizens to leave ukraine immediately and there was a vote in the russian parliament to request that putin recognize two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine a superyacht alleged to be owned by putin recently abruptly sailed from germany where it was undergoing renovations to the nearby russian enclave of kaliningrad prior to the completion of the work on the vessel in an apparent attempt to avoid its seizure in the event putin himself is personally sanctioned while a new escalation of the armed conflict may seem imminent the situation is rapidly developing and may quickly swing from escalation to de escalation to something in between we do not know when or if military action will occur however the biden administration has made it clear that sanctions and exports controls will be part of the response of the u s and its allies any individuals or companies with business interests or investments in russia should escalate contingency planning if they have not already done so in order to assist with these efforts we have outlined sanctions export and investment controls that may be imposed against russia and what steps individuals or companies can take now to mitigate the economic impact of such actions russia sanctions one of the hallmarks of u s sanctions policy in the first year of the biden administration has been a preference for sanctions coordinated with allies including canada the eu and the uk it is certain that any new sanctions on russia will follow this model as outlined below the u s and its allies have a variety of sanctions options from which to choose a list based sanctions the u s eu and uk all maintain lists of specific individuals and entities subject to comprehensive sanctions that typically involve the freezing of the person s assets as well as a prohibition on further business dealings with listed entities the u s department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control s ofac specially designated nationals and blocked persons list sdn list is perhaps the most well known among the most likely targets of list based sanctions include i banks sberbank vtb gazprombank veb rf the russian direct investment fund credit bank of moscow alfa bank rosselkhozbank fc bank otkritie promsvyazbank sovcombank and transkapitalbank have been specifically mentioned in the press and in pending sanctions legislation in the u s senate ii energy companies gazprom lukoil rosneft surgutneftegas and transneft are the largest russian oil and gas companies gazprom is the supplier of gas that is supposed to flow through the controversial nord stream 2 pipeline which will be operated by a swiss entity nord stream 2 ag one way to stop the pipeline which has been publicly threatened by president biden would be to sanction the swiss entity germany one of the main beneficiaries of the pipeline has recently signaled that a renewed escalation of the conflict could mean the end of the project iii defense aerospace sector united aircraft corporation tactical missiles corporation uralvagonzavod and united shipbuilding corporation are all major russian defense companies that would make logical targets in response to russian military action b sdn list designation of putin and government officials in addition to targeting certain sectors of the russian economy specific sanctions are expected to target russian president vladimir putin along with key russian government officials these individuals could be operating in any sector of the russian economy and would be designated by ofac white house press secretary jen psaki has described these individuals as in or near the inner circle of the kremlin and noted that they are especially vulnerable to sanctions due to their financial ties to the u s and western europe as many hold investments outside of russia while the u s government has not released a list of potential targets it is likely that many would appear on the report on senior foreign political figures and oligarchs in the russian federation which includes russian individuals with an estimated net worth of 1 billion or more as well as individuals who are senior members of the russian presidential administration members of the russian cabinet ministers heads of other major executive agencies and other senior political leaders and senior executives at state owned enterprises this report was provided to congress by the department of the treasury in 2018 pursuant to the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act of 2017 caatsa if added to the sdn list all u s assets held by such individuals would be frozen and u s persons would be prohibited from engaging in most transactions with the designated persons these sanctions are also likely to apply to close family members of those designated such as spouses and children as a result the children of designated individuals could be banned from attending u s universities which is common for the children of russian elites the eu and uk have also announced that they would implement similar sanctions on inner circle individuals in parallel with the u s in addition both the u s and eu apply sanctions to entities owned or controlled by designated individuals known as the 50 rule this will create significant compliance challenges for individuals and companies trying to assess whether sanctioned individuals own or control business partners as the assets of the russian political and economic elite are notoriously difficult to scrutinize putin for example is estimated to have 200 billion in assets but appears nowhere on the forbes list of richest persons in the world though such a net worth would place him at the top of the list c sectoral sanctions if economic or political realities result in the u s and its allies deciding not to use list based sanctions on specific entities they could rely on so called sectoral sanctions which impose restrictions on certain transactions with companies in a targeted sector the u s for example currently imposes sectoral sanctions on russia s financial energy and defense sectors sectoral sanctions could be expanded to cover additional transactions within these three sectors or they could target other industries such as commodities beyond oil and gas or manufacturing these sanctions could also be deployed in tandem with list based sanctions d sovereign debt restrictions u s financial institutions are currently prohibited from participating in the primary market for ruble or non ruble denominated bonds issued after june 14 2021 by the russian central bank the national wealth fund of the russian federation or the russian ministry of finance u s financial institutions also cannot lend funds to these three entities there is a significant loophole to these restrictions in that u s financial institutions are still permitted to participate in the secondary market for russian sovereign debt an escalation of the conflict could result in the expansion of restrictions to the secondary market which is a step the u s recently took with belarusian sovereign debt the move would largely freeze russia out of the global bond markets seriously impeding its access to debt financing russia currently runs budget surpluses and has large foreign currency reserves but that could quickly change under the bite of international sanctions making the debt restrictions a potent tool e swift disconnecting russian banks from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift messaging system is another potential sanction swift is a belgian messaging service that connects over 11 000 financial institutions globally the service is not used to actually transmit funds but instead allows members to alert one another of upcoming transactions removing russian financial institutions from the swift system would dramatically hinder if not stop a significant number of transactions involving russian banks the result could be global financial turmoil russia has also developed its own messaging system but it is limited in scope recent press reports have indicated that u s and eu officials are focusing on sanctioning russian banks rather than leveraging swift likely in order to limit unintended consequences to the global financial system f investment controls while disconnecting russia from swift has received significant press attention potential investment restrictions have not during the trump administration and continuing and expanding under the biden administration the u s published a list of chinese companies deemed to be part of the chinese military industrial complex cmic u s individuals and entities are prohibited from conducting any transaction in publicly traded securities of these companies including derivatives or other investments designed to provide exposure to securities it is conceivable that the u s could prepare a list of russian companies that pose a national security threat to the u s and impose similar investment controls to those imposed on cmic entities it is unclear how much time investors would be given to unwind positions in impacted russian entities u s export controls a country group e designation the most serious export control restriction that could be applied is for the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security bis to downgrade russia to country group e under the export administration regulations ear russia is effectively in country group d 5 at the moment along with china a categorization that nevertheless permits exports of many products without an export license country group e is reserved for comprehensively embargoed countries specifically cuba iran north korea and syria this would mean that many additional items exported from the u s or that are of u s origin would require an export license to send to russia including software with standard encryption many aircraft parts and a host of other off the shelf commercial items not only would this increase the burden on exporters who would now need to apply for and manage export licenses but license applications would presumably be subject to a policy of denial by bis it is also likely that processing and reviewing such applications would take bis a considerable amount of time further delaying any transactions that were allowed to move forward b foreign direct product rule u s export controls include the foreign direct product rule whereby foreign produced items located outside the united states are subject to the ear when they are a direct product of specified technology or software or are produced by a plant or major component of a plant that itself is a direct product of specified technology or software the trump administration used an expanded version of this rule to restrict the export of items to huawei that otherwise would not have been subject to u s export controls the biden administration could similarly lower the threshold for when the foreign direct product rule would apply to exports to russia indeed on january 25 2022 two senior biden administration officials threatened novel export controls should russia take action in ukraine that could well allude to a more expansive version of the foreign direct product rule c application of the de minimis rule currently foreign origin items that incorporate more than 25 percent of certain u s origin content require a license if exported to russia from outside the u s this is known as the de minimis rule and is applicable to other countries beyond russia however if russia were to be downgraded to country group e as discussed above the types of u s origin hardware software and technology encompassed by the rule would expand significantly and the threshold content would drop from 25 percent to a mere 10 percent the result would be that many non u s exporters would face the often daunting task of calculating the percentage of u s origin content in each of their products particularly difficult when the content is software or technology and potentially having to apply for u s export licenses to export such products to russia d eu nato country export controls and sanctions in addition to u s sanctions and export controls and their potential extraterritorial application companies and individuals with business interests in russia cannot afford to ignore what we must assume will be materially similar sanctions and export controls from the eu uk and other nato countries including canada the likely result which is certainly the intent of these western allies is to leave few places in the world to hide from the impact of sanctions against russia belarus in response to what the u s deemed a fraudulent presidential election in belarus on august 9 2020 and the violent political repression that followed the u s has launched five rounds of sanctions against the country in coordination with canada the eu and the uk sanctions have targeted government officials and businesspeople as well as major construction petrochemical potash fertilizer and tobacco product companies of particular note was the imposition of restrictions on dealings in new issuances of belarusian sovereign debt in both the primary and secondary markets which as noted above may serve as a model for future sanctions against russia although major industries in belarus have already been heavily sanctioned the risk of further sanctions against the country remains very high especially if belarus assists russia in the conflict belarus is currently hosting tens of thousands of russian forces and participating in a menacing military exercise with russia near the border with ukraine it is conceivable that the department of commerce could add belarus to country group e along with russia given its close ties the two countries form a so called union state which aims to integrate the countries economically and militarily and be subject to a comprehensive sanctions program by the u s and its allies ukraine the biden administration has said little about what u s policy would be towards an occupied ukraine its treatment of crimea could be illustrative there the u s imposed sanctions on individuals and entities operating in crimea and has prohibited the import or export of goods services or technology to or from the crimea region in addition u s persons are barred from making new investments in the crimea region as a result most u s companies and many non u s companies with connections to the u s treat crimea as off limits akin to cuba iran north korea and syria the u s and eu will need to balance support of the ukrainian people with not wanting to assist in economically supporting the government of an occupied ukraine china in a move certainly designed in part to blunt the impact of u s and eu sanctions russia agreed to supply an additional 10 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas to china russia s gazprom signed the deal with china national petroleum corporation cnpc on february 4 2022 gazprom is currently subject to limited u s sanctions that prohibit u s persons from entering into transactions directly or indirectly in relation to oil exploration or production involving deepwater arctic offshore or shale projects that either a have the potential to produce oil in russian federation territory including maritime territory claimed by the russian federation or b if the project was initiated on or after january 29 2018 has the potential to produce oil in any location and gazprom has a 33 or greater ownership interest or b ownership of a majority of the voting interests gazprom is not currently subject to eu sanctions which is perhaps why the deal with cnpc is structured to settle in euros this is nevertheless an odd choice because gazprom would almost certainly be targeted by the eu u s and uk for significant sanctions including placement on ofac s sdn list cnpc is not currently subject to u s sanctions and in the past has suspended its involvement in transactions in venezuela and iran that risked running afoul of u s sanctions this raises the question of whether the deal is worth the paper it is printed on as it would seem unlikely based on past conduct that cnpc or other chinese entities would risk secondary sanctions or other penalties from violating u s sanctions nevertheless a newly assertive china armed with anti sanctions blocking laws could be signaling that its willingness to abide by western sanctions is at an end this in turn raises the specter that chinese firms could themselves be targeted for actions that appear to support and enable russia s actions far reaching impacts of u s sanctions and export controls a secondary sanctions even individuals and companies located in countries that do not impose sanctions on russia may nevertheless be impacted under certain sanctions programs including those related to iran persons without a connection to the u s can be subject to u s extraterritorial sanctions known as secondary sanctions through secondary sanctions ofac claims authority to impose sanctions on persons who fail to abide by u s sanctions it is possible that secondary sanctions could form part of the u s s response to an escalation of the conflict in the region b facilitation causing ofac regulations prohibit u s persons from facilitating transactions by non u s persons with sanctioned parties thus companies hoping to avoid complying with u s sanctions by using entities located outside of the u s to deal with sanctioned persons must be careful not to involve u s persons in the transaction further ofac has pursued non u s entities under a causing theory wherein the non u s entity causes a u s person to violate sanctions c extra territorial export controls as noted above u s export controls include the foreign direct product rule which could be expanded to assert u s jurisdiction over a wide range of items made using american technology or tools in addition items made outside of the u s that incorporate more than a de minimis amount of certain u s content hardware software or technology are also subject to u s exports controls whether or not they were produced using u s origin technology or software companies located outside of the u s need to carefully monitor whether the foreign direct product rule or de minimis rule are expanded in the context of exports to russia what to do individuals and companies with customers suppliers or operations in russia ukraine or belarus should strongly consider taking the following steps to mitigate international trade risks should the conflict escalate in the region
americans can hardly agree on anything anymore but people across the political spectrum have had it with capitol hill s stock trading scandals last month a fox news poll found that 70 percent of registered voters were in favor of a ban on current members of congress and their immediate family and staff trading stocks the public is fed up our otherwise divided congress meanwhile has long been united by its willingness to dodge ethics rules and avoid enacting meaningful ethical restrictions when congress created the federal conflict of interest law it conveniently exempted its own members and staffers there s nothing stopping a member such as sen joe manchin iii d w va from voting to block an environmental bill that would affect his own investment in waste coal there s little stopping other members from making suspiciously timed stock trades after they receive confidential government briefings on market moving information that could change congress is poised to ban stock trading by lawmakers with bipartisan support but the details are everything depending on which of several competing bills prevails congress either will take a first step toward creating a real ethics program or it will give us more window dressing for legalized corruption the last time the public similarly demanded a change congress pulled a fast one by passing the nearly useless stop trading on congressional knowledge act of 2012 stock act that law did not bar members from owning or trading stocks which would remove opportunities for insider trading all it did was shorten the deadline for disclosure so it s no surprise this toothless law failed to prevent suspicious trades in fact former congressman chris collins r n y pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2019 during the pandemic the justice department investigated four senators on suspicion of insider trading related to the coronavirus those probes were closed without action but the appearance of impropriety left a stain to make matters worse some in congress have shown they can t even be bothered to meet the disclosure deadline insider and other news outlets identified 57 members of congress who failed to fully comply with the disclosure requirements advertisement now a decade after congress conned the public with the stock act there s a danger that its members could pass another ineffectual law to make it look as though they re addressing the public s concern without having to change their disgraceful behavior several proposals on the table fall short sen josh hawley r mo has introduced a bill with a cumbersome enforcement mechanism that seems designed to fail his bill would entitle a member to a vote by the full senate or house before any fine is collected a process bound to end in partisan side taking and even if their colleagues vote to punish members the proposal is toothless while hawley s bill authorizes a fine it doesn t specify how much to collect so the ethics committees may lack authority or at least the nerve to levy a significant sum the bill does require members to forfeit profits or tax deductions from unauthorized transactions but only sales generate profits or deductible losses so it wouldn t prevent suspicious purchases sen jeff merkley d ore has introduced his own weak ban that doesn t apply to members spouses and lets lawmakers keep stocks they owned before taking office passing a bill with any of these deficiencies would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would once again let congress hide behind the illusion of reform in contrast sens jon ossoff d ga and mark kelly d ariz introduced a stronger proposal the ban congressional stock trading act it improves on the trust in congress act previously introduced by rep abigail spanberger d va who was the first and most vigorous champion of a stock trading ban and rep chip roy r tex these plans would require members and their spouses to divest several types of assets or put them in blind trusts they don t control which would foreclose opportunities for insider trading ossoff s bill has a strong enforcement mechanism applies to spouses and dependent children and contains a crucial disclosure requirement it would empower each ethics committee to assess a fine equal to a month s salary and to keep assessing successive fines in that amount for each month the member remains in noncompliance a member would have no right to demand the full chamber vote on whether to dismiss the fine advertisement it would close an existing loophole too under an existing law members can put assets rather than just cash into blind trusts lawmakers are notified when the trustee sells an asset but the public is not giving members more insight into their conflicts of interest than the public has ossoff would address that problem by requiring all sale notices to be released publicly the public would finally know which members have truly eliminated their conflicts of interest and which are only pretending not to know what they own the disclosure is important because it would give the public a tool in pressuring members to sell off conflicting assets instead of just concealing them in blind trusts share this article share last week sens elizabeth warren d mass and steve daines r mont introduced another bill the bipartisan ban on congressional stock ownership act which would bar members and their spouses not only from trading but also from owning stock in large corporations unless as part of a diversified mutual fund this approach would meaningfully improve the situation too although it goes further than the ban congressional stock trading act by prescribing the strong medicine of divestiture for stocks rather than the creation of a blind trust it doesn t cover as many types of assets as ossoff and kelly s bill would the two bills are therefore complementary and could be combined to magnify their effect on government ethics some opponents have objected that it s unfair to apply these proposed restrictions to spouses or children if this resistance to government ethics weren t so sinister it would be laughable while working at the office of government ethics one of us shaub spent over a decade forcing presidential nominees for senate confirmed posts to comply with a conflict of interest law that applied to them their spouses and their minor children in all those years no senator picked up the phone after reading a nominee s ethics agreement to complain that making the nominee s spouse divest assets was unfair not once only now that similar requirements may apply to their own spouses and children do members of congress suddenly care and if they really see these restrictions as onerous they could easily opt out of them by simply going back to private life advertisement in truth we d like to see an even stricter ban one that applies not only to members of congress their spouses and their minor children but also to their senior staffers the president and vice president political appointees and judges and which limits the holdings they can own to diversified mutual funds and u s treasury bonds with narrow exceptions applicable only in unusual circumstances but some of the proposals before lawmakers now are a strong first step in the right direction after passing these bills or an amalgam of them congress could use the momentum to establish the stricter ban we propose the public has entrusted government leaders with great power it s time those leaders realized that they must put the public above all else
the federal reserve formally adopted tough sweeping restrictions on officials investing and trading aiming to prevent a repeat of the ethics scandal that engulfed the u s central bank last year the changes codify new guidelines announced in october to restrict active trading prohibit the purchase of individual securities and boost disclosure requirements among policymakers and senior staff members the measures follow revelations of unusual trading activity by three top officials in 2020 as the fed intervened aggressively to shield the economy from covid 19 who subsequently resigned the new rules aim to support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the committee s work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest the fed said in a statement friday fed chair jerome powell s request for the new rules was an admission that the fed s ethics standards were not sufficient photographer drew angerer getty images bloomberg bloomberg news the new rules were approved unanimously by the federal open market committee this week fed officials said during a briefing call with reporters any violations will be reviewed on a case by case basis according to officials on the call who didn t provide details on what sanctions might be applied fed chair jerome powell s request for the new rules was an admission that the fed s old ethics standards were not sufficient he was also responding to demands for change by lawmakers with sen elizabeth warren calling out a culture of corruption at the central bank after the activity came to light a probe of fed trading is underway by the central bank s inspector general rosengren kaplan boston fed president eric rosengren and his dallas counterpart robert kaplan resigned last year after their trading records raised questions about adherence to ethical guidelines rosengren cited ill health in announcing his early retirement disclosures by vice chair richard clarida showed he sold at least 1 million of shares in a u s stock fund in february 2020 before buying a similar amount of the same fund a few days later on the eve of a major fed announcement that signaled its readiness to buffer the economy from the coronavirus clarida stepped down on jan 14 ahead of the expiration of his term as a governor on jan 31 rosengren s 2020 financial disclosure showed multiple transactions in real estate investment trusts even as the fed was intervening in that sector of the economy via massive purchases of mortgage backed securities kaplan a former senior goldman sachs group executive disclosed multiple 1 million plus transactions that year the new rules essentially force senior fed personnel to limit their investments to highly diversified investment vehicles like mutual funds and exchange traded funds an official said on the briefing call friday some questions still surround the full extent of kaplan s trading the dallas fed has denied a request by bloomberg news to provide the dates of the trades asked at a january press conference for the dates powell said that the fed s washington based board didn t have that information congress rules the ethics scandal at the fed has helped fuel momentum for stricter rules for members of congress progressive democrats and conservative republicans alike have joined in proposals that run the gamut from requiring securities be held in a blind trust to complete bans on individual stock ownership senate majority leader chuck schumer has endorsed the idea though no specific proposal and house speaker nancy pelosi has said she is open to restricting trading after initially opposing limits numerous questions have been raised by some lawmakers including whether the restrictions or bans would apply to spouses and dependent children current law known as the stock act prohibits members of congress from using nonpublic information gleaned in the course of their duties for personal benefit and requires disclosure of securities trades by members spouses or dependent children of more than 1 000 critics say the law is too easily skirted the disclosure requirements too loosely enforced and the penalties too lenient president biden has nominated fed governor lael brainard to succeed clarida as vice chair and she awaits senate confirmation for the post the boston fed last week announced that economist susan collins will be the bank s new president under the the new fed ethics rules officials are prohibited from holding individual stocks sector funds agency securities bonds commodities cryptocurrencies foreign currencies and derivatives contracts and from engaging in short sales or buying securities on margin officials must provide 45 day non retractable notice for transactions receive pre approval for purchases and sales and hold investments for at least one year the time periods straddling fomc meetings during which transactions are prohibited were extended by one day to align with the fed s

homicide on dateline nbc s true confession episode airing friday tapp tells host keith morrison i m just trying to be the best person i can be combine the two people the guy who was in prison and the guy before prison we all make mistakes good or bad we can do things right or wrong but i just try to be the best person i can morrison asked tapp though he moved on if he was still a little upset

scream star david arquette is taking stock of his happiness cultivating positivity and confidence with everyone s fav horror movie deputy with a new movie crushing it at the box office in scream the fifth release from a horror franchise that s spanned 25 years david arquette is taking stock of his happiness when we connect by phone he sounds like a man deeply appreciative for all of life s curveballs that have been thrown his way over the past few decades his voice laid back and humbled imparts little nuggets of wisdom that could only be ascertained by someone who takes a curious approach to life i m not big on regret he tells askmen i like to think of lessons learn from them and not keep repeating them over and over again related grammy award winning performer sean paul s conscious path to success over the course of our conversation arquette discusses his path to acting elaborates on his current bozo the clown project and reveals his strategies for maintaining a healthy mindset and eliminating anxieties askmen was acting always the path for you or were there other aspirations or interests david arquette i ve always loved art i was doing graffiti as a kid as a part of hip hop subculture and loved spray painting big murals and stuff but acting was always a part of our background for sure my father was an improvisational actor and my mother also taught it so we studied a lot with them i performed in little plays in elementary school and when i got into high school my teacher got me to focus and channel my energy i d gone on a few auditions just growing up in hollywood and always got rejected but after i started taking drama classes i placed in a drama competition anonymously without mention of my family and that kind of gave me the confidence that i too might have an ability as well it gave me the focus and the techniques to train and led me on a path to acting but art has always been a second or fellow love of mine you mentioned that your experience in high school gave you the confidence needed to pursue acting was there a point early on in your career that validated the decision to go down that path i was fortunate enough to get a couple of tv shows right off the bat that went for a year each they didn t get picked up to multiple seasons but within them we shot 26 episodes between the two they were single camera so i got to really understand how to interact with the camera there were moments where i really felt i embodied the character which gave me a lot of confidence and understanding around the relationship between actor camera and the process i did a film called johns really early in my career and that also gave me a lot of confidence in studying a character understanding the character doing the research that it takes and building a character it was a leading role so it was an opportunity to have some time on screen to be able to capture the character s essence and to just have the confidence that you need acting is really about confidence being confident enough to find the real moments and then opening up and being vulnerable enough to hopefully connect with an audience has honing the ability to have that confidence transferred over to everyday david arquette or has there always been a division between confidence in acting and your own self confidence believe it or not wrestling had a lot to do with that confidence and even confidence as far as acting goes wrestling really teaches you to be in the moment to stand up for yourself and to have a voice you have to protect yourself in a sense and be able to say i don t want to do that you learn you have to not be a pushover for sure i went through a divorce and that was pretty painful for me meeting helped me heal move on and have confidence again it s a pretty traumatic experience and it takes a lot you kind of have to rebuild to have that confidence belief in yourself the drive to get things done get back on the horse and choose how you want to manifest the rest of your life divorce must really shake someone up in so many ways absolutely i was just reading an article from henry miller about life and not getting bitter avoid getting bitter it s easy to get bitter or wounded after something like that and just kind of shell shocked and not wanting to engage to be able to pursue life you really have to be able to be open to it in many ways you can say that s the highest form of growth just like with working on this new scream you can be in an environment where you don t hold bitterness and still maintain that sense of self doing scream was a great experience it tracked 25 years of my life so it was a great opportunity and i m really grateful to wes for keeping me alive i was supposed to die in the first but he kept me alive and allowed me that opportunity it s pretty funny it s very parallel to my life it was a great experience i think also as you get older you start figuring some things out i m not big on regret i like to think of lessons and learn from them and not keep repeating them over and over again do you find yourself going through periods of self reflection making certain adjustments in order to not keep repeating the same mistakes i call it getting into the flow of life a lot of times i ll be doing things that become my worst enemy or self sabotage one of the things i learned in wrestling was when i did something called the death match and got stabbed in the neck i had a lot of time in the hospital to kind of reflect on why did i put myself in that situation and what am i beating myself up for so much how can i avoid beating myself up that then goes to how can i take care of myself i have a lot of anxieties and depression sometimes so working out eating right and getting enough sleep are positive ways to deal with stressful situations that help discontinue the bad behavior it s easy to draft the plan but sticking with it can be a little cumbersome it s a day to day situation you plan ahead if it s business or if it s family and then you try balancing the two being clear headed being responsible making your appointments taking care of the things you need to take care of cleaning out the garage when you have to that kind of stuff it sounds like action based tasks really help keep the ship moving in the right direction absolutely physical exercise doing something creative are just things that feel so good for your spirit in general you ll feel better if you do something creative everyday if you do something physical everyday if you don t skip meals and you don t eat a bunch of junk it s funny the older you get if you eat something healthy you can start feeling it in your body i don t feel the drag which helps you start becoming more aware of that kind of stuff you also become more aware of not wanting to waste your time on certain things like if old relationships or friendships have run their course you won t spend as much time on stuff like that at

new york the federal reserve should start raising interest rates next month to help rein in too high inflation federal reserve bank of new york president john williams said friday but he added that the rate hikes may not have to begin with as big a bang as some have suggested with inflation at its hottest level in two generations the fed is widely expected to seek to cool the economy by raising its benchmark short term interest rate from its record low of nearly zero where it s been throughout the pandemic the only question has been how big and how quickly it will move because an overly aggressive approach could choke the economy while too much caution could let inflation spiral further personally i don t see any compelling argument to take a big step at the beginning williams said following an event at new jersey city university to discuss the economy and interest rates williams who is vice chairman of the committee that sets the fed s interest rate policy said he sees a march increase as the beginning of a steadily moving process to get interest rates closer to a level where they are no longer stimulating the economy he also said he expects inflation to fall from its current level due to a confluence of factors including the fed s moves and hoped for improvements in supply chain bottlenecks last month inflation hit 7 5 percent in january compared with a year ago williams comments were echoed by other fed officials who spoke at a policy conference in new york this support for a steady approach to rate hikes contrasted with previous statements by federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard who said the fed should consider a half point rate hike in one of its upcoming meetings twice its normal increase his comments shook wall street which had been expecting a slower liftoff of rates lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said that she expected the fed would at its next meeting in march initiate a series of rate increases advertisement brainard is close to fed chairman jerome powell and has been nominated for vice chair the fed s no 2 position krishna guha an analyst at investment bank evercore isi said that brainard broadly endorsed wall street s expectations that the fed will hike rates six times this year she also said the fed would soon turn to reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled during the pandemic because of the fed s bond purchases she said they would likely do so more quickly than from 2017 2019 when they allowed about 50 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them charles evans president of the chicago fed said friday that the fed needed to adjust its low interest rate policies which he called wrong footed but he also suggested that the central bank may not have to sharply raise rates this year evans also said that high prices have mostly been caused by disruptions to supply chains and other factors stemming from the pandemic and will likely fade partly on their own and given the economy s current strength the fed s moves shouldn t slow hiring as much as interest rate hikes have in the past evans added advertisement higher rates can corral inflation by slowing the economy but they can also cause a recession if they go too high and they put downward pressure on all kinds of investments from stock prices to cryptocurrencies wall street has been fixated on almost every word from fed officials recently hoping to divine how quickly and by how much the fed will move the mix of aggressive and moderate comments have left traders expectations in flux traders were pricing in only a 21 percent probability of such a half point move on friday afternoon down from 49 percent a week earlier according to cme group williams said he did not want to get into minute details about whether market expectations are in line with his own thinking for interest rate policy but he said that the big picture movements make sense based on expectations that the fed will move its key interest rate closer to normal like 2 percent to 2 5 percent by the end of next year that s higher than the most recent forecast fed officials gave in december they had a median projection of 1 6 percent for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 evans who typically favors lower interest rates acknowledged that if inflation stayed high throughout this year a larger number of rate hikes could be necessary advertisement other speakers at the new york conference focused on whether the fed had erred when it adopted its new policy framework in august 2020 which sought to keep rates low until inflation actually materialized previously the fed would typically raise borrowing costs when the economy was healthy to preempt any inflation frederick mishkin a former fed governor and economist at columbia university said the fed had made a serious mistake in not hiking rates earlier to prevent inflation from taking off now fed officials may have to raise rates much higher to bring prices back in line he added evans however defended the fed s new policy framework by pointing out that in the past when the fed hiked rates to preempt inflation such moves likely cost many jobs and in some cases inflation didn t materialize following the remarks by williams and evans the two year treasury note fell to 1 46 percent from 1 49 percent late thursday it tends to move with expectations for the fed s policy on rates stocks and other areas of the bond market were also lower amid worries about a possible russian invasion of

the tesla ceo donated to charity about 5 million shares of company stock worth 5 7 billion since the filing with the securities and exchange commission was made public monday tesla hasn t responded to a request for comment nor has musk mentioned the donation on twitter his favorite communications forum yet that hasn t quelled debates in and out of philanthropy about transparency tax deductions and congressional legislation along with speculation about where exactly the money was donated some experts say musk likely donated his shares to his donor advised fund or daf for short dafs are essentially charitable investment accounts in which donors can claim a tax deduction upfront but aren t legally required to distribute the money experts say that would be the most advantageous strategy for musk currently the world s richest man with an approximate net worth of more than 220 billion a daf donation would allow him to claim a tax deduction of as much as 30 of his 2021 adjusted gross income instead of 20 if he had donated it instead to his foundation musk could also deduct the fair market value of the stock instead of its original value he can do whatever he wants with his money anyone can said john arnold a billionaire philanthropist who co founded the laura and john arnold foundation and arnold ventures with his wife laura but if he s getting a subsidy from society through this tax deduction then there s a responsibility that goes with it whether or not musk donated his tesla shares to a daf arnold said the possibility that he did highlights a questionable tax

today it doesn t necessitate that that happens you can get the tax deduction today and there s no requirement for that money ever to get to the community you can give money to a donor advised fund and keep it in a tax free investment account forever arnold and others who want to address that loophole have formed a coalition the initiative to accelerate charitable giving that seeks to tighten requirements for dafs and other financial vehicles used by the wealthy this month a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a bill in the house of representatives that would limit how long donations can remain in a daf untaxed similar bipartisan legislation was introduced last year in the u s senate many daf proponents oppose the changes arguing that dafs with an average payout rate of around 20 are distributing money faster and more robustly than many private foundations whose average distribution is generally only slightly above the 5 annually required by law according to the stanford law

institute suggested that musk s donation shows norms may be tipping towards a lack of disclosure about where large gifts are landing when you re giving away that much money it is by definition a matter of public interest where it s going to soskis said generally musk s approach to donations has differed from that of many other wealthy donors who are often accused of publicizing their gifts as a way to burnish their reputations about a month before donating his stock the notoriously provocative musk engaged in a twitter fight with the head of the united nations world food programme who had urged billionaires to donate 6 billion on a one time basis to help end starvation musk said he would sell 6 billion of tesla stock and donate the proceeds to the agency if it could show how the money would solve world hunger david beasley the organization s executive director said this week that it had yet to receive a donation from the tesla ceo soskis of the urban institute has suggested that there s room for musk to be more transparent about his gifts while still signaling his contempt for elite public opinion as the tesla ceo frequently does at times musk does provide transparency about his donations last year he gave 50 million to st jude s children s research hospital he also donated about 30 million to a variety of public schools and nonprofits in south texas where spacex builds its rockets his private foundation s latest irs filing shows he donated 11 000 tesla shares to the charity in 2019 from july that year to june 2020 the foundation distributed 23 6 million in grants some of that went directly to working charities but a large chunk 20 7 million went to fidelity charitable a grantmaker that sponsors dafs some who have worked with musk explain his style of philanthropy by saying he isn t focused on looking good marcius extavour vice president of climate and energy at xprize which manages musk s 100 million prize for carbon removal says musk wanted the project to be focused on finding impactful solutions and didn t want it to use his image everywhere that s in contrast to some other donors who extavour asserts seem more concerned about invitations to speaking engagements and other events it s been pretty nice to work with the musk foundation as a donor who is not nitpicking on how we describe this or how we describe that extavour said or making sure they get the shine or the limelight steve greanias general manager of fundraising solutions for the fundraising platform givesmart says that like most people working in philanthropy he is curious about where musk s money went and how it was or will be used yet he doesn t think it s necessarily everyone s business to know his own platform which serves about 8 000 nonprofits and has processed about 800 million in donations accepts anonymous donations if you have this kind of money and you want to do good with it and you don t feel the need to be recognized for it that s ok greanias said

2020 and read more do you sometimes ask yourself when this will all end i don t mean the universe nor our lives nor even this year c mon guys it has just started i mean of course inflation if only you weren t in a coma last year you would have probably noticed that prices had been surging recently for instance america finished the year with a shocking cpi annual rate of 7 1 the highest since june 1982 as the chart below shows now the key question is how much higher inflation could rise or how persistent it could be the consensus is that we will see a peak this year and subsequent cooling down but to still elevated levels this is the view i also hold however would i bet my collection of precious metals on it i don t know as inflation could surprise us again just as it did to most of the economists but not me last year the risk is clearly to the upside as always in economics it s a matter of supply and demand there is even a joke that all you need to turn a parrot into an economist is to teach it to say supply and demand funny huh when it comes to the demand side both the money supply growth and the evolution of personal saving rate implies some cooling down of inflation rate please take a look at the chart below as you can see the broad money supply peaked in february 2021 assuming a one year lag between the money supply and price level inflation rate should reach its peak somewhere in the first quarter of this year there is one important caveat here the pace of money supply growth has not returned to the pre pandemic level but it stabilized at about 13 double the rate seen at the end of 2019 inflation was then more or less at the fed s target of 2 so without constraining money supply growth the us central bank couldn t beat inflation as the chart above also shows the personal saving rate has returned to the pre pandemic level of 7 8 it means that the bulk of pent up demand has already materialized which should also help to ease inflation in the future however not all of the forced savings have already entered the market thus personal consumption expenditures are likely to be elevated for some time contributing to boosted inflation regarding supply factors although some bottlenecks have eased the disruptions have not been fully resolved the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus and regional lockdowns in china could prolong the imbalances between booming demand and constrained supply other contributors to high inflation are rising producer prices increasing house prices and rents strong inflation expectations see the chart below and labor shortages combined with fast wage growth the bottom line is that all things considered in particular high level of demand continued supply issues and de anchored inflation expectations i forecast another year of elevated inflation but probably not as high as in 2021 after reaching a peak in a few months the inflation rate could ease to let s say around 4 in december if we are lucky importantly the moderate bond yields also suggest that inflation will ease somewhat later in 2022 implications for gold what does it mean for the gold market well i don t have good news for the gold bulls gold loves high and accelerating inflation the most indeed as the chart below shows gold peaks coincided historically with inflation heights the most famous example is the inflation peak in early 1980 when gold ended its impressive rally and entered into a long bearish trend the 2011 top also happened around the local inflationary peak the only exception was the 2005 peak in inflation when gold didn t care and continued its bullish trend however this was partially possible thanks to the decline in the us dollar which seems unlikely to repeat in the current macroeconomic environment in which the fed is clearly more hawkish than the ecb or other major central banks the relatively strong greenback won t help gold shine surely disinflation may turn out to be transitory and inflation may increase again several months later lower inflation implies a less aggressive fed which should be supportive of gold prices however investors should remember that the us central bank will normalize its monetary policy no matter the inflation rate since the great recession inflation has been moderate but the fed has tightened its stance eventually nevertheless hence gold may experience

following the path you car for the company s future now turning to page 7 key developments starting with the financial highlights on page 7 of the supplemental i will quickly summarize our quarterly performance as christine will cover this in greater detail the company generated 0 06 cents of gap earnings per share undepreciated eps was 0 02 cents higher at 0 08 cents per share also book value per share ended at fourth quarter at 4 70 or 4 74 per share on an undepreciated basis due to a fourth quarter increase in direct investments a real property through our multi family jv program we will provide an undepreciated earnings and undepreciated book value which removes non cash expenses related to depreciation and certain amortization expenses related to leasehold intangibles after the fourth quarter dividend of 0 10 per share our 2021 total rate return was 11 7 and despite a full transition to loan and jv investments g a remained close to 2 2021 was a transformational year for the company as our capital redeployment strategy was executed in direct loan investments generated from our single family origination partners and as it relates to our multi family strategy loans and jvs were generated internally at nymc by our origination team in the fourth quarter we added nearly 800 million of new investments which set a record for the company however our quarterly earnings did not fully benefit from recurring income related to those assets as more than 70 of investment settled after late november and in december with high investment activity we were able to better optimize our balance sheet as our cash balances dropped below 10 capitalization or 152 million of unrestricted cash net of 30 day debt maturities working through previous periods of high cash balances allowed us to relive our unencumbered assets in the first quarter which will be touching on a minute we also continue to utilize mental recourse leverage for the poor book value and for book value protection and lower costs with their preferred stock issue at 7 which redeemed a 7 75 callable c series reducing capital costs by 75 basis points lastly due to the recent market volatility we thought it was prudent to add 200 million buy back program which the board recently approved now turning to page 8 subsequent developments investment activity accelerated through the first six weeks of the new year at 325 million of assets were added we are now on pace to exceed fourth quarter 2021 investment activity on the financing side we have been very active as well with two securitizations completed thus far the first in the early january against our rpo portfolio at 2 3 total cost of debt and in february we completed our second bridge loan securitization revolver lastly redeemed 138 million convertible note which matured on january 15 simply we are committed to driving company earnings higher by growing our portfolio and have the capability to do so organically through our unencumbered loan book we are excited to see this capital put to work and the earnings generated in subsequent quarters at this time i ll pass it over to kristine nario our cfo to provide further detail in our quarterly financial results kristine nario chief financial officer thank you jason good morning everyone and thank you again for being on the call in discussing the financial results for the quarter i ll be using some of the information from the quarterly comparative financial information section included in slides 29 or 36 of the supplemental presentation our financial snapshot on slide 10 covers key portfolio metrics on a quarter over quarter comparison the company continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter with gaap earnings per share of 0 06 and gaap book value of 470 this quarter we are introducing two new metrics undepreciated earnings and an undepreciated book value which are non gaap financial measures undepreciated earnings represent gaap net income excluding the company s share in depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to operating real estate undepreciated book value represents the company s gaap book value excluding the company s share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to operating real estate by excluding these non cash adjustments undepreciated book value reflects the value of the company s rental property portfolio at its undepreciated basis the company s rental property portfolio primarily includes consolidated multi family apartment properties for the fourth quarter undepreciated earnings per share was 0 08 and an our undepreciated book value ended at 474 down 0 02 from the previous quarter our net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 363 an increase of 38 basis point from the previous quarter our portfolio weighted average asset yield was 657 an improvement of 18 basis point the increase was largely attributable to our continued investment in higher yielding business purpose bridge loans our funding costs improved by 20 basis point ending at 294 largely due to the refinancing of our 2020 rpo strategy securitization in the latter part of the third quarter which resulted in 210 basis point in cost savings the company s recourse leverage ratio and portfolio recourse leverage ratio remain low at point four times and point two times slide 11 details our financial results we had net interest income of 30 8 million relatively flat as compared to the previous quarter our continued investment in higher yielding business purpose loans during the quarter contributed to the point nine million increase in single family interest income offset by a point five million decrease in multi family interest income partly due to redemptions over mezzanine lending investments accounted forced loans although there was a decrease in income from our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced loans income from our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced equity increased during the period contributing 7 2 million in preferred return during the quarter have these mezzanine lending investments qualified for loan accounting treatment under gaap they would have contributed 46 basis point in net interest margin interest expense on our single family portfolio decreased by 0 3 million primarily due to the full quarter impact of the previously mentioned rpo refinancing securitization transaction at a lower cost we had non interest income of 39 3 million mostly from net unrealized gains of 15 5 million due to continued improvement in pricing on our assets particularly our residential loans we also generated 5 2 million of net realized gains primarily from residential loan prepayment activity offset by 4 1 million of net realized losses from sale of agency rmbs the net realized loss from the sale of agency rmbs was offset by the reversal of unrealized losses recognized in the prior periods in addition as discussed earlier our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced equity contributed 7 2 point two million of preferred return we also generated other income of 7 9 million which is primarily related to 4 8 million of income recognized from equity investments in entities that invest in or originate residential properties and loans and 3 1 million of redemption premium and premium recognized from early repayment of mezzanine lending investments during the quarter included in our results for the quarter is the net loss activity related to our multi family apartment properties in which the company has equity investments in the form of preferred equity or joint venture equity because of certain control provisions we consolidate these properties in our financial statements in accordance with gaap we received variable distributions from these equity investments on a pro rata basis and management fees based upon property performance we pursue these investments for potential participation and value appreciation of the underlying real estate which is realized only upon sale of the multi family assets these properties generated operating rental income of 7 6 million and incurred interest expense and operating expenses of 2 1 million and 13 5 million respectively operating expenses incurred by these properties during the quarter is primarily related to depreciation expense and amortization of lease intangibles totaling 9 2 million after reflecting the share in the losses to the non controlling interests of 1 3 million in total these multi family apartment properties incurred a net loss of 6 6 million for the quarter we had total g a expenses of 12 5 million relatively flat compared to the previous quarter we had portfolio operating expenses of 8 1 million which increased primarily due to the growth of the business purpose loan portfolio slide 12 summarizes our activity in the fourth quarter as jason mentioned earlier we accelerated our investing activity in the fourth quarter acquired residential loans for 606 million funded multi family joint venture and mezzanine lending investments for 123 million and 66 million respectively we also sold non agency rmbs agency and residential loans for proceeds totaling 194 million we also had total repayments totaling 333 comprised of 245 million from our residential loans 59 from our investment securities and 28 million from our mezzanine lending investments jason will now go over the market and strategy update jason jason serrano president thanks kristine turn page 14 relates to our strategy update our course strategies remain unchanged we believe we are strategically positioned to take advantage of fundamental market strength with current agency mortgage coupons now at 4 housing affordability is close to the long run average where mortgage cost equals about 23 of first time homebuyers any refinancing in housing demand due to higher rates is not likely to correlate to lower home prices here like many sectors at this time the supply side component determined price equal equilibrium is an overriding factor december printed another record law homes available for sale was below 1 million units this correlates to 1 8 months of supply in the market also record law extreme and persistent low volume is likely the keep prices pinned at or above inflation rates particularly in the south we continue to see value in these and this market through short term bridge loans where underlying investors can take advantage of a technical squeeze in housing supply and we can benefit from high coupons and a short duration loan with higher short term rates we have two fixed rates securitization revolvers out its pos january thins returns secondly gain on sale has all but evaporated for agency non agency residential loan originators in the first quarter while market coupons we set higher albeit at lower origination volumes we see an excellent opportunity to pick up deeply discounted paper in the scratch net market also secondary and tertiary msas in the south and southeast should continue to benefit from population migration trends as these markets provide a cheaper cost of living alternative in a recent large scale us poll more than 80 of workers suggested they would quit their job if employers asked them to report back to the office full time thus work from home is likely to transition from a health measure to retention measure offered by employers to keep talent to keep out we see great opportunity attractive risk returns in the multi family sector to take advantage of this migration due to this trend now turning to page 15 to address sourcing our sourcing approach we recently looked locked in a flow agreement for 50 of production from a large originator in the bpo space we are excited about this arrangement and will add to our robust growth in the single family sector in the higher rate environment we have also increased our participation with our originators as we see better value offered we are an investor of choice because we are scalable reliable buyer in the market and do not directly compete against our partners on the multi family side and as a way of background in 2016 internalize riverbank and multi family originator and asset management platform since then since this time we funded over 1 billion of loans on our balance sheet generating a 15 life to date return on our assets as we do not utilize leverage within the strategy we have built up organic sourcing opportunities with hundreds of sponsors we are very excited about this program that offers portfolio across clutterization roll up opportunities we close our first deal last november on 11 properties totaling more than 2 000 units we offer more than just capital to our multi family regional sponsors our asset management platform helps our partners relieve certain operational pinch points as an example our technology can map into the jail of underlying multi family properties to automate and review months reporting this is just one of the ways we can help sponsors consolidate their assets asset management program on page 16 our latest strategy update our transformation from early 2000 is evident with each of these graphs in the first graph asset sales in early 2020 generated excess cash as we held a defensive posture in q3 2020 after this time we held a stubbornly high cash balance with a levered balance sheet in the second graph as prices recovered and term financing normalized we increased our utilization of non market market structures to reduce balance sheet risk and lower our cost of funds to optimize our balance sheet in the third graph we monetize our securitization holdings and reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding loans and jvs the gestation period for loans and jvs is much longer than bond investments some of our larger opportunities such as portfolio roll outs can take multiple course of close which caused some inefficiency these three graphs demonstrate how we manage through these transformation and pace and how we exhibit patience in doing so in the fourth quarter cash was brought below 10 we quadrupled usage of non market structures and depends on short term borrowings while also lowering our cost of bonds and be rotated out of security holdings to increase our yield on assets the greatest level in the company s history on page 18 we are excited about our earnings potential from these activities with anticipated high investment levels in the new year we are prepared for a busy first quarter to grow our portfolio by raising cash from mainly unencumbered assets on our balance sheet we were active in this year s asian market on day one of the new year and through february 15 2022 we have raised 584 million of cash with keeping a low rate of recourse leverage which after effect to this funding is only point four times simply putting half of the catch during narrated from the 788 million total financing completed or in process at either a 9 12 or 15 we can generate a 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 of incremental eps respectively we believe hitting the upside to the growth potential is not out of the equation we are excited to demonstrate that over the course of the year turn to page 19 we believe we can do so by protecting book value under prudent financing structures which limit company recourse and mark to market risk as illustrated here now turning to page 20 as they go through the single family overview and just as a quick note regarding a single family allocation we continue to stay up in credit with high fico borrowers at low ltvs targeting to 12 to 15 rvs after second financing we began adding dscr loans in the fourth quarter which are loans to rental investors with guaranteed production from a floor agreement and coupons are nearly a 100 basis point higher than at the beginning of the year we feel confident adding exposure here with the intention of gestation to escalation this longer duration mortgage loan requires term financing to prudently generate an equity return we are confident we can now accumulate attractive levels for a rental loan pool securitization turn to page 21 our portfolio highlights while we are hitting our stride at multiple volume asset classes and single family sector the performance of our credit assets remain positive delinquency rates have flattened down on our bill book on our scratch and dent book we continue to benefit from par prepayments on our discounted loan purchases while we do expect prepayments to slow in durations the length and this presents an opportunity to add to it these months with securitization and opportunity we have been recently executed for compelling go forward equity translates this asset class turning to page 22 on our bpo bridge strategy with nearly one billion of loans at the end of the fourth quarter bpo bridge loan continues to be our largest exposure performance has been great which is expected with loans to 65 ltv after repair and a double digit hpm market equity buildup is substantial for the borrowers here that are experienced in their local markets to complete the rehab jobs focused on low cost projects turning page 23 our multi family portfolio overview 25 of our capital is now allocated to this asset class we believe this portfolio offers our security our shareholders a differentiated type of diversification in this market our roes of 12 to 17 we are at the center of a sector that is in the process of fundamental landscape change the market is efficient workforce housing offering quality and affordability is an attractive proposition in today s post covid marketplace in the jv portfolio at 272 million we are looking forward to sharing the equity upside with our sponsors on property repositioning strategies more on that in a minute turning page 24 as expected performance is excellent one loan is delinquent and expected to resolve in a full recovery year over year rental growth rate for our portfolio is 8 which is the highest level we have seen for our book with low ltv presented here that does not account for valuation changes that have occurred since the opportunity was funded we expect to continue our record of zero losses in the strategy to date in end term with 71 million already closed in the first quarter and 152 million in underwriting portfolio growth will continue from q4 levels turn to page 25 the growth we have seen here is exciting with our origination platform with the close of a portfolio roll up and cap recapitalization we are now on a non linear growth trajectory joint venture is our leading product and as kristine mentioned earlier we will also report undepreciated eps and book value to remove these non cash costs to our income statement and balance sheet and these measures we do expect depreciation and amortization cost to grow alongside our portfolio particularly amortization because high growth rates receive the rent in today s market thus expect us to continue reporting these measures on page 26 the asset transition plan offered in high growth submarkets is a case where we invest in lower market quality property as a value play typically related to deferred maintenance or a daily concept and utilize a cost effective capex plan that produces a refresh look meeting market competition this has been the focus since 2014 while markets do change we consistently see tenants desire for a neat product and affordable price point and we expect to meet that growing demand now on page 27 we believe a diversified portfolio of growth strategy centered around recurring income streams will provide stability to earnings in 2022 with industry leading global company resource leverage and flexibility aided by our low cost operating structure we have taken a more offensive posture to pursue opportunities in the high rate environment for continued portfolio growth we believe this is the path to enhancing rate earnings and we believe the time is now at this time i would like to open up the call for questions operator questions answers operator our first question or comment comes from the line of eric hagen from btig eric hagen btig analyst hey thanks good morning i think just one from myself can you talk about the outlook and the opportunity to fix and flips this really just the competition which is developed there how much you guys think you can source in that channel this year with the backdrop paying higher interest rates jason serrano president yes thank you we have put together a floor agreement which gives us 50 production of one originaire we will also have increase our participation with a few other originators in the market we do expect our fix and flip volumes to increase from what we presented in the fourth quarter given those arrangements the market because of the recent rate volatility that market has taken a bit of a step back as relates to the liquidity on financing relative to these assets this year s asian market is given rate increases is higher and therefore there s this transition period that has to come with respect to most originators out there with higher coupons and in this period that liquidity matters tremendously given the change in rates we have been a consistent buyer of this product with with our counter parties we have been able to help them understand where coupons are going and migrating given just swap rates in the market so we ve been able to stay ahead of this change and which has helped some of our our partners here so we can we expect to continue to see portfolio growth there particularly with the fact that we have one to generate 50 of our production eric hagen btig analyst that s helpful color sense a lot operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of stephen laws from raymond james your line is open stephen laws raymond james analyst hi good morning jason can you talk about your comments toward a more offensive posture going forward as you look for new investment opportunity where you see the best opportunities you cited the rising rate outlook and what are those may be and also how do you think about those new investment opportunities versus the stock repurchase with shares around a 25 discount on appreciated book value here jason serrano president yep so starting with the opportunity and the offensive posture now we have been analyzing looking at this market we ve had opportunities to buy larger portfolios in 2021 which we passed on and part of the reason was that the markets i was offering very efficient and high liquidity financing particularly in the short term part of the financing spectrum which back in 2020 we saw the result of that and securities long term securities again short term repo the effect here is not as great obviously and the financial markets are completely open it s just it s costlier to finance so our goal was to focus on the short duration product where we weren t taking large interest rate risk given the reset of these loans or the pay off these loans is fairly quick within a year or two to kind of 15 months and the product would reset into higher loans we also like the opportunity of taking our borrowers that are resetting or paying off and i say resetting now more than paying off something because of a large part of the fix and flip market is now going into dscr loan product so the fix and flip investor is now likely to do a fix to rent and with our portfolio we the ability to recapture that bar and to add a loan is great as well as resetting these coupons a bit higher in this market which will give us better better nim earnings on those assets so that is part of why we are becoming more aggressive in the last couple of months here on our portfolio we just like the fact that the coupons are at the highest levels we ve seen in roughly two years and and we we re going continue to take advantage of that as relates to our share buy back program we see an opportunity to grow our book value and grow eps which will allow our shares to appreciate if we are able to continue with that plan now the opportunity that we re seeing ahead of us today in assets given where we re taking we have low cash balances we re taking loans that are unencumbered and in covering them through securitizations with and receiving cash back for that and we ve allocated into investments and investment securities which all investment assets which will allow us to generate a thin s return which we think that will bridge the gaap from this kind of gaap that we re currently trading at so we re seeing an opportunity in the market and the extent that we see continued volatility with respect for shares in the end the fact that we are not able to hit some of our objectives with respect to our portfolio growth then the consideration is there for a share buy back which is why we put it on and have the board approved this last couple of weeks stephen laws raymond james analyst great thanks for the color kristine thinking about the operating real estate portfolio appreciate your prepared comments as we look to model that forward how should we think about run rate through 22 or kind of an outlook for the revenue and expenses for those investments kristine nario chief financial officer i think it s going to be a little bit significant more significant so in the first quarter as majority of our jv investments that we closed in 2021 actually closed the latter part of december so you would expect that number to grow and as we continue obviously to invest in more jv type structures these numbers you would expect would also grow stephen laws raymond james analyst ok thanks appreciate the comments this one operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of christopher nolan from ladenburg thalmann your line is open christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst how much do you anticipate taking multi family up to as a percentage of your capital allocation jason serrano president we expect it to grow from here and the the difficulty in answering that question why what we did present our pipelines to kind of estimate that when you take unencumbered assets off our balance sheets that are in residential loans and you securitize those loans your percent of market capitalization for that product does decline if you reinvest that product into an equal allocation then you expect you know multi family to to increase from there we are growing on both sides and as i mentioned earlier we had record volume of acquisitions on both the single family and the multi family side in the fourth quarter and we re expecting similar results in the first quarter there is not a hard target we re looking at we are opportunistic we will look to see where the best returns are in the market and where we can do so with book value protection so there is not a set number we re targeting it s just a function of what the market is allowing and what the market is providing us and where we see the best opportunities so we ll continue that approach versus a hard target of a certain percent christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst great and kristine you mentioned i think in your comments and net loss on multi family was that a gaap net loss including the non cash depreciation charges kristine nario chief financial officer yes it is a gaap net loss christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst so going forward we should be starting to look at this undepreciated eps and book value as multi family growth as a portfolio kristine nario chief financial officer that s correct that s why we introduced this quarter because we see those numbers getting significant as we go into joint venture equity investments in multi family properties where we have control christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst all right and then jason given that you guys invest both common and preferred equity into these joint ventures is your preferred equity from the sponsor standpoint is your preferred equity technically equity when he goes and tries to get a first lean loan on his assets jason serrano president well yes so does it the way we look at it we call them in the presentation we call it mas lending and mas the lending is basically a second party in the cap structure for the sponsor and in certain cases there s provisions on a second or as long as relates to recapitalization of the first so it is a hybrid security instrument where it has that features and equity features that features in the form of a coupon and equity features in the form of pick and other calculated measures so from the sponsors perspective it does give them flexibility as it relates to senior financing as relates to press versus a mezzanine loan although the features of both those are very similar as relates to our return christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst and given all that should we look at these as control investments or is there a scenario where there could be some control investments kristine nario chief financial officer there is going to be scenarios for preferred equity type investments that could be control when we have to take over the property if the property is not doing well or some things being done by the operator that s not that s not in accordance with our agreement there s i think a couple of instances in a prior year where we took over these properties and by taking them over we were able to make the property better and actually not incur any loss in those properties christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst ok i ll follow up offline thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of doug harter from credit suisse your line is open doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks can you talk about how loan pricing has changed in 2022 then given some of the back up we ve seen in securitization spreads and pricing jason serrano president yeah so i can speak to our portfolio directly so we looking at the latest changes for this week we believe that we ve estimated about a one a half percent loss to book value through the first quarter that s related to this our securities that we still have on our balance sheet and in most of the longer duration mortgage loans that we have on the balance sheet as well where a lot of those were that losses that have we believe that losses have been incurred the market as a whole i mean there s depending on what the underlying coupons are and what the duration is it s more than just simply looking at swap rates and taking it duration and taking your price range from there it s also some liquidity measures on some of the lower coupon on assets so when you re financing costs is greater than the spread or your asset coupons he doesn t know how much leverage you apply for that so staying away from those low coupon asset class has been a priority for us which is why we focus on short duration high coupon bridge and we delayed our dscr investment strategy until the better half of fourth quarter and mainly starting in the first quarter the market is resetting and securitizations are also resetting there s been a couple of deals that have been pulled off the market some of it simply because nobody wants to step into a bond deal and have it marked down a few points next day when rates move another 25 basis point so i think the market is waiting to reset there s still plenty of capital on the sidelines for all these assets in securizations but there s kind of a wait and see approach in the market until rates kind of settle out doug harter credit suisse analyst i guess just then on your ability to deploy capital are there opportunities to take advantage of others kind of hesitancy given your current defensive positioning or do you kind of take that wait and see approach given given the current volatility jason serrano president no we ve freed up capital on our balance sheet with early securizations in the quarter simply to take advantage of some illiquidity in the market that will allow us to buy it at lower prices we are open for business we have been looking at larger portfolios from a region your pipelines that kind of got it stock without being able to place into the market and warehouse lines that were timing out our interest and our market presence in the scratching of market really helps us see a lot of activity not just related to agency origination that is now scratching down but just origination overall that can get kind of can get put in a period of hold where the buyer backed out and now they re kind of shopping that loan pool in the market is all we are evaluating opportunities to that end and we expect to continue seeing it we are absolutely looking to take advantage of this technical change that s happened the market and at a deeper discount doug harter credit suisse analyst great appreciate it operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of matthew erdner from jones trading your line is open matthew erdner jones trading analyst hey thanks guys asking a question on behalf of jason stewart so with the partnership with bpl rental what kind of origination volume are you guys seeing from them and what should we expect in the first quarter of this year and moving forward jason serrano president what we liked about our partnership here is that the originator has shown kind of a hockey stick at origination growth that we are excited about and they continue to add new staffing to build out business right now at current rates of origination we expect a minimum of a half a billion dollars of loans in his first year but they are growing and we do expect to be able to grow that portfolio along with them on top of it we also have the opportunity to purchase loans that we are seeing from other originators that it s not necessarily a contractual floor agreement but we have been a very consistent buyer every month with these with these originators which is what when you look at our asset acquisitions rallies in the bpo space you can see consistent purchases that was around 250 million a month now we re now that number is going up as you saw last quarter and will definitely be higher in the first quarter this year overall so this is just a partnership that allows us to bring liquidity in certain markets such as this to originate and there s potentially other originators that could follow in this kind of process with us we think there s a low cost way for us to to benefit from origination platforms matthew erdner jones trading analyst yeah that s great and then are they located in the areas where you guys have been active before jason serrano president well they are it s bpl origination their focus is mostly in the dscr space they do fix and flip as well we are part of the hesitancy of going to the dcsr market was simply volume and being a secondary market buyer portfolio this is not a great way to grow a securitization book given the lack of consistency and the fact that you do want to just take for a securitization portfolio take out we would only look at this space if we had kind of guaranteed pipelines which we do today which is why that strategy is now one of our focal points that we just we walk through their bpl fix and flip book is growing and we expect that to grow faster than their dscr book but again this is one of many that we speak to and we buy loans from and we re just in this case it was originally it was concerned about rate movements and also concerned about liquidity as relates to their operation and having a consistent buyer and that can come in and take loans off their balance sheet every month or once a week was important so the funding timelines also increased relate to this opportunity for them which was helpful relief cash and get it to put it back into the market and for us to acquire assets matthew erdner jones trading analyst awesome thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of bose george from kbw your line is open bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst everyone good morning in terms sort of where you are in the transformation you guys obviously put a lot of money to work for you again in 1q is there a way to think about what inning you re in terms of the transformation to a more normalized are we jason serrano president what kristine walk through and are in that purchase activity for the quarter i think it s helpful to kind of cement that point we added 324 of net activity for the quarter we it s been a struggle to add the net incrementally positive to our balance sheets simply because of the our asset sales that we ve conducted in the securitization space we sold a 193 million last quarter we are sort of at the end of that cycle for our security sales that we have on our balance sheet which is will be helpful obviously to continue to grow net positive our balance sheet going forward so for those reasons we do expect further growth prepayment and redemption activity we had very high payoffs in our scratching that portfolio which was a positive given bought those loans at discounts that we think that s going to moderate as well our rpo prepayments have been kind of consistent in kind of mid single to high single digit range that product is less sensitive to rates they have higher coupons already and it s more of a change of life plan for the borrower that prepaid that loan after 10 years of pain on that loan and in multi family we with the roll up opportunities that we re focusing on and working in this new environment in the south southeast part of the united states we have really hit our stride with sourcing we do speak to hundreds of sponsors we do and so it is an 80 20 rule here where 20 of our business comes to 20 of the sponsors provide about 80 of the business and we re going to continue being able to grow in those southern markets with the migration that we see so we re excited about the growth that our portfolio could experience and the reason why we provided a projection or at least a hypothetical relating to our eps movements related to asset growth bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok great that s helpful and then actually in terms of returns can you just talk about the returns on the operating real estate just how that compares to the incremental returns on other assets jason serrano president in relating to jvs bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst the jvs yeah kristine nario chief financial officer so the jvs we re targeting about 12 to 17 of return but that s going to be over the life of the investment which would include kind of like an exit when we sell the property and that s what we re looking to do i mean you ll see the pop at the end but over time what you ll see is property income less expenses which would include depreciation and amortization expenses and then at the end you ll see a gain a capital gain essentially jason serrano president yeah the important note is that those assets are held at basis and we take depreciation against that those assets every quarter so the extent that we ve had an 8 increase in rental rates in the first quarter that s not going to the gain of those assets is not to be represented on our balance sheet as we hold it at cost so its cost accounting on those assets with depreciation on kristine s point the gain would you have to expect to gain that we are working toward on a transformation of a lot of the property itself through capex plans or maintenance deferment cleanup is what we re how generate our return as well as the rental payments we receive on a monthly basis bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok and actually if you said this already what s the typical life for those properties jason serrano president thanks for mentioning that it s an important distinction part of the growth strategy for us also has been the fact that our mezzanine portfolio is more of a shorter duration instrument typically what happens is that the sponsor takes the rpfs that use for capex improves the property and then looks to either recap the property or sell the property to to get paid on that improvement so we ve seen that duration anywhere from kind of like two and a half to two to four four and a half years as the property gets transitioned we do expect the jvs that of a longer duration in the fact that we are equity we are equity alongside of the sponsor and making decisions on that sale have opportunity to take back the property in the case of a sale so if the sponsors timelines are a bit shorter than ours we have the opportunity to hold that property through a longer lifetime which we really enjoy you know a lot of the sponsors will focus on irr you we re focusing on on look on irr and total cash so we love we think there s a great income producing asset is inflation protected and we don t mind taking these assets for a bit of a longer duration if need be but we do expect it to be a bit longer than that prep bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok great thanks and then just one last one you mentioned it earlier but what was the book value of quarter date again was that half percent and catch up kristine nario chief financial officer undepreciated book value is 474 down 0 02 cents bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst in the quarter since the end of the quarter like what was the change jason serrano president it s down about a half a percent bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst half a percent ok perfect ok great thanks all jason serrano president i m sorry if the question was related to first quarter book value decline we see about a one and a half percent decline to date through this week if that was the question bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst yeah that was it yeah you just missed it anyways thanks a lot operator ok thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of matthew howlett from b riley your line is open matthew howlett b riley financial analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question first of all congrats to you both steve good luck in your role jason congrats on the promotion just a couple of questions on you would be the cabinet appointments i just were to assume it happened on october 1st all of it i mean they added to sense cents sort of dividend coverage we re getting close to that just curious on what the impact would have been jason serrano president the impact if we were to add this as in october hypothetically matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yes jason serrano president the impact is essentially what you re seeing on that hypothetical page that we presented and it s simple math you look at the average income right you look at the addition to the numerator in that quarter relates a full year a full quarter cycle of interest earnings and then you could see the incremental impact there so it s pretty straightforward which is why we presented it and that s our expectation when you if you were to add those assets matthew howlett b riley financial analyst got it so we look at dividend coverage we should look at the run rate of the company and that is sort of the example you gave jason serrano president yeah there look there matthew howlett b riley financial analyst got a second question congrats on paying off the high cost convertible or let s look at the unsecured side but what do you what are you seeing out there your cost of capital has come down you ve been able to issue cheaper and would you look to replace that something else of balance sheet jason serrano president so we speak regularly with bankers in the space on corporate finance opportunities that s available very few of the number of calls this year despite higher rates there s a couple of interesting transactions that they re out there as really if the whole business securitizations which is securing a particular part of your asset portfolio and issuing debt off that portfolio so it s like a whole business kind of securitization related to the grassapple that is something that is evolved over the course of the last couple of years that product offering i remember back in 2007 was pretty popular and that seemed to come back in the last six months i mentioned it not as because we re actually considering doing a deal in that space right now simply because there are new structures that we re seeing which we re evaluating right now we have plenty of cash on our balance sheet with respect to financing that we ve completed and expect to complete so we re not in the market at the moment looking for a corporate finance opportunity related to the grassapple but during the course of the year depending on where you know our portfolio migrates and and also what the opportunities on the sourcing side we definitely will continue evaluating that but we have plenty of equity for our pipeline so that we have established matthew howlett b riley financial analyst great ok we ll look forward to that and on the subject of lower cost of capital i look at atlantis history so we ve had a great history of versification first mover and as the classes now look at the two sort of residential multi family particularly the recent growth and the role strategy of the jvs would you see these two strategies co existing together could there be one be split out i mean do you think there s synergies of having them together would you look at some point to try to enhance the value of the multi family business by spinning it out or some some other type of corporate restructuring jason serrano president it s an interesting question we believe at the moment it offers our shareholders interesting diversification that is i think unique in the market today i definitely believe that the story we ve talked more about the origination platform because we believe it s an important part of the value of the company and our sourcing capability particularly the fact that we are internally sourcing in and originating those loans and it s an asset class that has produce roughly 100 million dollars of origination volume net of over the course of the years and now we re obviously seeing opportunities to increase that so as that business continues to grow well we ll evaluate the opportunity and see what is in the best interest of our shareholders as it relates to that portfolio and the rest of the book but at the moment i think it provides a great diversification strategy for those that are looking at both residential markets and looking at the strength of the multi family market that we have within our within our balance sheet today matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yeah just look at all the sort of there s been a lot of private equity activity in real estate so these and just look at that that portfolio may not be getting the credit that it deserves and you know your cost of capital should be lower as relates to that strategy jason serrano president i mean private equity the property reach had a great run of trade above book value obviously depreciation plays a big role there but there s been a big increase in valuations of those underlying properties giving rent rate growth rates and today we were following that same path as rates that gaap accounting and we hope our shows see the value of that asset our balance sheet matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yes certainly familiar with that we ll look forward to it and congrats again jason serrano president thank you operator thank you i m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr serrano for any closing remarks jason serrano president yes thank you everybody for being on the call today and we look forward to speaking you to on our q1 2022 earnings call great have a great day

biden says putin has decided to invade ukraine us president joe biden looks down as he delivers a national update on the situation at the russia ukraine border at the white house in washington dc february 18 2022 washington united states president joe biden said friday he is convinced that vladimir putin has decided to invade ukraine within the week an event that would trigger western sanctions set to turn russia into what a us official called a pariah as of this moment i m convinced he s made the decision biden said in televised remarks at the white house biden said the attack could come in the next week or days and that targets would include the capital kyiv a city of 2 8 million innocent people the us leader insisted it was not too late to de escalate and return to the negotiating table but warned that if an attack comes the russian president will have slammed the door shut on diplomacy the kremlin insists it has no plans to attack its neighbor which has angered russia by seeking long term integration with nato and the european union however the united states says that with an estimated 149 000 russian troops on ukraine s borders as many as 190 000 when including the russian backed separatist forces in the east it s only a matter of when adding to jitters russia s defense ministry announced that putin would personally oversee previously scheduled drills involving nuclear capable missiles on saturday and on the ground in ukraine s disputed east sporadic clashes fed a growing sense of dread an afp reporter near the front between ukrainian government forces and the pro russian territory in the lugansk region heard explosions and saw damaged civilian buildings on kyiv s side of the line there were growing fears that only a spark which washington warns could be a deliberate false flag incident created by the russians might now be needed to set off the largest military confrontation in europe since world war ii a us defense official said that more than 40 percent of the troops surrounding ukraine were now uncoiled in a position to go on the offensive pariah biden spoke on friday with fellow nato allies in a conference call to cement plans for western economic sanctions against russia should its troops attack ukraine we continue to remain in lockstep biden said afterward according to a senior official the sanctions package will be devastating if russia invades ukraine it would become a pariah to the international community the deputy us national security advisor for international economics daleep singh told reporters it will become isolated from global financial markets and be deprived of the most sophisticated technological inputs singh predicted intense capital outflows mounting pressure on its currency surging inflation higher borrowing costs economic contraction and the erosion of its productive capacity false flags in the eastern separatist areas of donetsk and lugansk moscow backed leaders sought to flip the narrative of russia being the aggressor accusing kyiv of planning its own offensive to retake the eastern territories they said the government s forces were carrying out sabotage missions civilians were ordered to evacuate but us secretary of state antony blinken accused the kremlin of mounting a propaganda campaign to create an excuse for war blinken told the munich conference what has happened in the last 24 to 48 hours is part of a scenario that is already in place of creating false provocations of then having to respond to those provocations and then ultimately committing new aggression against ukraine ukraine s foreign minister said russian disinformation about a supposed ukrainian attack was being spread to fuel the war fever biden praised ukraine s military for showing restraint and great judgement saying the allegation that they were the ones preparing aggression defies basic logic putin sees deterioration both sides in the east of ukraine claimed the other was stepping up the violence amid low level exchanges of fire videos circulating on russian language social media showed sirens sounding in donetsk as moscow backed separatist militia leaders ordered the civilian evacuation over the border to russia denis pushilin head of the so called donetsk people s republic dpr said ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky would order soldiers to go on the offensive in moscow putin met with the authoritarian leader of belarus which is hosting tens of thousands of russian troops on the ukrainian border and said he saw a deterioration of the situation but the ukrainian command said the russian backed separatist forces had violated a ceasefire 53 times between midnight and 5 00 pm friday twenty children and 18 adults at a kindergarten in the government held village of stanytsia luganska were lucky to escape almost completely unharmed on thursday when an artillery shell struck the building russian strategic forces the russian defense ministry sent a chilling reminder of the stakes in any east west confrontation when it announced that putin would oversee saturday s exercise of strategic deterrence forces during which ballistic and cruise missiles will be launched the air force units of the southern military district as well as the northern and black sea fleets would be involved in the nuclear capable missile tests russia says that it will not back away from ukraine unless western countries agree never to allow ukraine into nato and to pull us forces back from eastern europe effectively creating a new version of the continent s cold war era spheres of influence the conflict between the heavily armed pro russian rebels and ukrainian government forces in the country s east has already rumbled on for eight years claiming the lives of more than 14 000 people and forcing more than 1 5 million from their homes

following the path you car for the company s future now turning to page 7 key developments starting with the financial highlights on page 7 of the supplemental i will quickly summarize our quarterly performance as christine will cover this in greater detail the company generated 0 06 cents of gap earnings per share undepreciated eps was 0 02 cents higher at 0 08 cents per share also book value per share ended at fourth quarter at 4 70 or 4 74 per share on an undepreciated basis due to a fourth quarter increase in direct investments a real property through our multi family jv program we will provide an undepreciated earnings and undepreciated book value which removes non cash expenses related to depreciation and certain amortization expenses related to leasehold intangibles after the fourth quarter dividend of 0 10 per share our 2021 total rate return was 11 7 and despite a full transition to loan and jv investments g a remained close to 2 2021 was a transformational year for the company as our capital redeployment strategy was executed in direct loan investments generated from our single family origination partners and as it relates to our multi family strategy loans and jvs were generated internally at nymc by our origination team in the fourth quarter we added nearly 800 million of new investments which set a record for the company however our quarterly earnings did not fully benefit from recurring income related to those assets as more than 70 of investment settled after late november and in december with high investment activity we were able to better optimize our balance sheet as our cash balances dropped below 10 capitalization or 152 million of unrestricted cash net of 30 day debt maturities working through previous periods of high cash balances allowed us to relive our unencumbered assets in the first quarter which will be touching on a minute we also continue to utilize mental recourse leverage for the poor book value and for book value protection and lower costs with their preferred stock issue at 7 which redeemed a 7 75 callable c series reducing capital costs by 75 basis points lastly due to the recent market volatility we thought it was prudent to add 200 million buy back program which the board recently approved now turning to page 8 subsequent developments investment activity accelerated through the first six weeks of the new year at 325 million of assets were added we are now on pace to exceed fourth quarter 2021 investment activity on the financing side we have been very active as well with two securitizations completed thus far the first in the early january against our rpo portfolio at 2 3 total cost of debt and in february we completed our second bridge loan securitization revolver lastly redeemed 138 million convertible note which matured on january 15 simply we are committed to driving company earnings higher by growing our portfolio and have the capability to do so organically through our unencumbered loan book we are excited to see this capital put to work and the earnings generated in subsequent quarters at this time i ll pass it over to kristine nario our cfo to provide further detail in our quarterly financial results kristine nario chief financial officer thank you jason good morning everyone and thank you again for being on the call in discussing the financial results for the quarter i ll be using some of the information from the quarterly comparative financial information section included in slides 29 or 36 of the supplemental presentation our financial snapshot on slide 10 covers key portfolio metrics on a quarter over quarter comparison the company continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter with gaap earnings per share of 0 06 and gaap book value of 470 this quarter we are introducing two new metrics undepreciated earnings and an undepreciated book value which are non gaap financial measures undepreciated earnings represent gaap net income excluding the company s share in depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to operating real estate undepreciated book value represents the company s gaap book value excluding the company s share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to operating real estate by excluding these non cash adjustments undepreciated book value reflects the value of the company s rental property portfolio at its undepreciated basis the company s rental property portfolio primarily includes consolidated multi family apartment properties for the fourth quarter undepreciated earnings per share was 0 08 and an our undepreciated book value ended at 474 down 0 02 from the previous quarter our net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 363 an increase of 38 basis point from the previous quarter our portfolio weighted average asset yield was 657 an improvement of 18 basis point the increase was largely attributable to our continued investment in higher yielding business purpose bridge loans our funding costs improved by 20 basis point ending at 294 largely due to the refinancing of our 2020 rpo strategy securitization in the latter part of the third quarter which resulted in 210 basis point in cost savings the company s recourse leverage ratio and portfolio recourse leverage ratio remain low at point four times and point two times slide 11 details our financial results we had net interest income of 30 8 million relatively flat as compared to the previous quarter our continued investment in higher yielding business purpose loans during the quarter contributed to the point nine million increase in single family interest income offset by a point five million decrease in multi family interest income partly due to redemptions over mezzanine lending investments accounted forced loans although there was a decrease in income from our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced loans income from our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced equity increased during the period contributing 7 2 million in preferred return during the quarter have these mezzanine lending investments qualified for loan accounting treatment under gaap they would have contributed 46 basis point in net interest margin interest expense on our single family portfolio decreased by 0 3 million primarily due to the full quarter impact of the previously mentioned rpo refinancing securitization transaction at a lower cost we had non interest income of 39 3 million mostly from net unrealized gains of 15 5 million due to continued improvement in pricing on our assets particularly our residential loans we also generated 5 2 million of net realized gains primarily from residential loan prepayment activity offset by 4 1 million of net realized losses from sale of agency rmbs the net realized loss from the sale of agency rmbs was offset by the reversal of unrealized losses recognized in the prior periods in addition as discussed earlier our mezzanine lending investments accounted forced equity contributed 7 2 point two million of preferred return we also generated other income of 7 9 million which is primarily related to 4 8 million of income recognized from equity investments in entities that invest in or originate residential properties and loans and 3 1 million of redemption premium and premium recognized from early repayment of mezzanine lending investments during the quarter included in our results for the quarter is the net loss activity related to our multi family apartment properties in which the company has equity investments in the form of preferred equity or joint venture equity because of certain control provisions we consolidate these properties in our financial statements in accordance with gaap we received variable distributions from these equity investments on a pro rata basis and management fees based upon property performance we pursue these investments for potential participation and value appreciation of the underlying real estate which is realized only upon sale of the multi family assets these properties generated operating rental income of 7 6 million and incurred interest expense and operating expenses of 2 1 million and 13 5 million respectively operating expenses incurred by these properties during the quarter is primarily related to depreciation expense and amortization of lease intangibles totaling 9 2 million after reflecting the share in the losses to the non controlling interests of 1 3 million in total these multi family apartment properties incurred a net loss of 6 6 million for the quarter we had total g a expenses of 12 5 million relatively flat compared to the previous quarter we had portfolio operating expenses of 8 1 million which increased primarily due to the growth of the business purpose loan portfolio slide 12 summarizes our activity in the fourth quarter as jason mentioned earlier we accelerated our investing activity in the fourth quarter acquired residential loans for 606 million funded multi family joint venture and mezzanine lending investments for 123 million and 66 million respectively we also sold non agency rmbs agency and residential loans for proceeds totaling 194 million we also had total repayments totaling 333 comprised of 245 million from our residential loans 59 from our investment securities and 28 million from our mezzanine lending investments jason will now go over the market and strategy update jason jason serrano president thanks kristine turn page 14 relates to our strategy update our course strategies remain unchanged we believe we are strategically positioned to take advantage of fundamental market strength with current agency mortgage coupons now at 4 housing affordability is close to the long run average where mortgage cost equals about 23 of first time homebuyers any refinancing in housing demand due to higher rates is not likely to correlate to lower home prices here like many sectors at this time the supply side component determined price equal equilibrium is an overriding factor december printed another record law homes available for sale was below 1 million units this correlates to 1 8 months of supply in the market also record law extreme and persistent low volume is likely the keep prices pinned at or above inflation rates particularly in the south we continue to see value in these and this market through short term bridge loans where underlying investors can take advantage of a technical squeeze in housing supply and we can benefit from high coupons and a short duration loan with higher short term rates we have two fixed rates securitization revolvers out its pos january thins returns secondly gain on sale has all but evaporated for agency non agency residential loan originators in the first quarter while market coupons we set higher albeit at lower origination volumes we see an excellent opportunity to pick up deeply discounted paper in the scratch net market also secondary and tertiary msas in the south and southeast should continue to benefit from population migration trends as these markets provide a cheaper cost of living alternative in a recent large scale us poll more than 80 of workers suggested they would quit their job if employers asked them to report back to the office full time thus work from home is likely to transition from a health measure to retention measure offered by employers to keep talent to keep out we see great opportunity attractive risk returns in the multi family sector to take advantage of this migration due to this trend now turning to page 15 to address sourcing our sourcing approach we recently looked locked in a flow agreement for 50 of production from a large originator in the bpo space we are excited about this arrangement and will add to our robust growth in the single family sector in the higher rate environment we have also increased our participation with our originators as we see better value offered we are an investor of choice because we are scalable reliable buyer in the market and do not directly compete against our partners on the multi family side and as a way of background in 2016 internalize riverbank and multi family originator and asset management platform since then since this time we funded over 1 billion of loans on our balance sheet generating a 15 life to date return on our assets as we do not utilize leverage within the strategy we have built up organic sourcing opportunities with hundreds of sponsors we are very excited about this program that offers portfolio across clutterization roll up opportunities we close our first deal last november on 11 properties totaling more than 2 000 units we offer more than just capital to our multi family regional sponsors our asset management platform helps our partners relieve certain operational pinch points as an example our technology can map into the jail of underlying multi family properties to automate and review months reporting this is just one of the ways we can help sponsors consolidate their assets asset management program on page 16 our latest strategy update our transformation from early 2000 is evident with each of these graphs in the first graph asset sales in early 2020 generated excess cash as we held a defensive posture in q3 2020 after this time we held a stubbornly high cash balance with a levered balance sheet in the second graph as prices recovered and term financing normalized we increased our utilization of non market market structures to reduce balance sheet risk and lower our cost of funds to optimize our balance sheet in the third graph we monetize our securitization holdings and reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding loans and jvs the gestation period for loans and jvs is much longer than bond investments some of our larger opportunities such as portfolio roll outs can take multiple course of close which caused some inefficiency these three graphs demonstrate how we manage through these transformation and pace and how we exhibit patience in doing so in the fourth quarter cash was brought below 10 we quadrupled usage of non market structures and depends on short term borrowings while also lowering our cost of bonds and be rotated out of security holdings to increase our yield on assets the greatest level in the company s history on page 18 we are excited about our earnings potential from these activities with anticipated high investment levels in the new year we are prepared for a busy first quarter to grow our portfolio by raising cash from mainly unencumbered assets on our balance sheet we were active in this year s asian market on day one of the new year and through february 15 2022 we have raised 584 million of cash with keeping a low rate of recourse leverage which after effect to this funding is only point four times simply putting half of the catch during narrated from the 788 million total financing completed or in process at either a 9 12 or 15 we can generate a 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 of incremental eps respectively we believe hitting the upside to the growth potential is not out of the equation we are excited to demonstrate that over the course of the year turn to page 19 we believe we can do so by protecting book value under prudent financing structures which limit company recourse and mark to market risk as illustrated here now turning to page 20 as they go through the single family overview and just as a quick note regarding a single family allocation we continue to stay up in credit with high fico borrowers at low ltvs targeting to 12 to 15 rvs after second financing we began adding dscr loans in the fourth quarter which are loans to rental investors with guaranteed production from a floor agreement and coupons are nearly a 100 basis point higher than at the beginning of the year we feel confident adding exposure here with the intention of gestation to escalation this longer duration mortgage loan requires term financing to prudently generate an equity return we are confident we can now accumulate attractive levels for a rental loan pool securitization turn to page 21 our portfolio highlights while we are hitting our stride at multiple volume asset classes and single family sector the performance of our credit assets remain positive delinquency rates have flattened down on our bill book on our scratch and dent book we continue to benefit from par prepayments on our discounted loan purchases while we do expect prepayments to slow in durations the length and this presents an opportunity to add to it these months with securitization and opportunity we have been recently executed for compelling go forward equity translates this asset class turning to page 22 on our bpo bridge strategy with nearly one billion of loans at the end of the fourth quarter bpo bridge loan continues to be our largest exposure performance has been great which is expected with loans to 65 ltv after repair and a double digit hpm market equity buildup is substantial for the borrowers here that are experienced in their local markets to complete the rehab jobs focused on low cost projects turning page 23 our multi family portfolio overview 25 of our capital is now allocated to this asset class we believe this portfolio offers our security our shareholders a differentiated type of diversification in this market our roes of 12 to 17 we are at the center of a sector that is in the process of fundamental landscape change the market is efficient workforce housing offering quality and affordability is an attractive proposition in today s post covid marketplace in the jv portfolio at 272 million we are looking forward to sharing the equity upside with our sponsors on property repositioning strategies more on that in a minute turning page 24 as expected performance is excellent one loan is delinquent and expected to resolve in a full recovery year over year rental growth rate for our portfolio is 8 which is the highest level we have seen for our book with low ltv presented here that does not account for valuation changes that have occurred since the opportunity was funded we expect to continue our record of zero losses in the strategy to date in end term with 71 million already closed in the first quarter and 152 million in underwriting portfolio growth will continue from q4 levels turn to page 25 the growth we have seen here is exciting with our origination platform with the close of a portfolio roll up and cap recapitalization we are now on a non linear growth trajectory joint venture is our leading product and as kristine mentioned earlier we will also report undepreciated eps and book value to remove these non cash costs to our income statement and balance sheet and these measures we do expect depreciation and amortization cost to grow alongside our portfolio particularly amortization because high growth rates receive the rent in today s market thus expect us to continue reporting these measures on page 26 the asset transition plan offered in high growth submarkets is a case where we invest in lower market quality property as a value play typically related to deferred maintenance or a daily concept and utilize a cost effective capex plan that produces a refresh look meeting market competition this has been the focus since 2014 while markets do change we consistently see tenants desire for a neat product and affordable price point and we expect to meet that growing demand now on page 27 we believe a diversified portfolio of growth strategy centered around recurring income streams will provide stability to earnings in 2022 with industry leading global company resource leverage and flexibility aided by our low cost operating structure we have taken a more offensive posture to pursue opportunities in the high rate environment for continued portfolio growth we believe this is the path to enhancing rate earnings and we believe the time is now at this time i would like to open up the call for questions operator questions answers operator our first question or comment comes from the line of eric hagen from btig eric hagen btig analyst hey thanks good morning i think just one from myself can you talk about the outlook and the opportunity to fix and flips this really just the competition which is developed there how much you guys think you can source in that channel this year with the backdrop paying higher interest rates jason serrano president yes thank you we have put together a floor agreement which gives us 50 production of one originaire we will also have increase our participation with a few other originators in the market we do expect our fix and flip volumes to increase from what we presented in the fourth quarter given those arrangements the market because of the recent rate volatility that market has taken a bit of a step back as relates to the liquidity on financing relative to these assets this year s asian market is given rate increases is higher and therefore there s this transition period that has to come with respect to most originators out there with higher coupons and in this period that liquidity matters tremendously given the change in rates we have been a consistent buyer of this product with with our counter parties we have been able to help them understand where coupons are going and migrating given just swap rates in the market so we ve been able to stay ahead of this change and which has helped some of our our partners here so we can we expect to continue to see portfolio growth there particularly with the fact that we have one to generate 50 of our production eric hagen btig analyst that s helpful color sense a lot operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of stephen laws from raymond james your line is open stephen laws raymond james analyst hi good morning jason can you talk about your comments toward a more offensive posture going forward as you look for new investment opportunity where you see the best opportunities you cited the rising rate outlook and what are those may be and also how do you think about those new investment opportunities versus the stock repurchase with shares around a 25 discount on appreciated book value here jason serrano president yep so starting with the opportunity and the offensive posture now we have been analyzing looking at this market we ve had opportunities to buy larger portfolios in 2021 which we passed on and part of the reason was that the markets i was offering very efficient and high liquidity financing particularly in the short term part of the financing spectrum which back in 2020 we saw the result of that and securities long term securities again short term repo the effect here is not as great obviously and the financial markets are completely open it s just it s costlier to finance so our goal was to focus on the short duration product where we weren t taking large interest rate risk given the reset of these loans or the pay off these loans is fairly quick within a year or two to kind of 15 months and the product would reset into higher loans we also like the opportunity of taking our borrowers that are resetting or paying off and i say resetting now more than paying off something because of a large part of the fix and flip market is now going into dscr loan product so the fix and flip investor is now likely to do a fix to rent and with our portfolio we the ability to recapture that bar and to add a loan is great as well as resetting these coupons a bit higher in this market which will give us better better nim earnings on those assets so that is part of why we are becoming more aggressive in the last couple of months here on our portfolio we just like the fact that the coupons are at the highest levels we ve seen in roughly two years and and we we re going continue to take advantage of that as relates to our share buy back program we see an opportunity to grow our book value and grow eps which will allow our shares to appreciate if we are able to continue with that plan now the opportunity that we re seeing ahead of us today in assets given where we re taking we have low cash balances we re taking loans that are unencumbered and in covering them through securitizations with and receiving cash back for that and we ve allocated into investments and investment securities which all investment assets which will allow us to generate a thin s return which we think that will bridge the gaap from this kind of gaap that we re currently trading at so we re seeing an opportunity in the market and the extent that we see continued volatility with respect for shares in the end the fact that we are not able to hit some of our objectives with respect to our portfolio growth then the consideration is there for a share buy back which is why we put it on and have the board approved this last couple of weeks stephen laws raymond james analyst great thanks for the color kristine thinking about the operating real estate portfolio appreciate your prepared comments as we look to model that forward how should we think about run rate through 22 or kind of an outlook for the revenue and expenses for those investments kristine nario chief financial officer i think it s going to be a little bit significant more significant so in the first quarter as majority of our jv investments that we closed in 2021 actually closed the latter part of december so you would expect that number to grow and as we continue obviously to invest in more jv type structures these numbers you would expect would also grow stephen laws raymond james analyst ok thanks appreciate the comments this one operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of christopher nolan from ladenburg thalmann your line is open christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst how much do you anticipate taking multi family up to as a percentage of your capital allocation jason serrano president we expect it to grow from here and the the difficulty in answering that question why what we did present our pipelines to kind of estimate that when you take unencumbered assets off our balance sheets that are in residential loans and you securitize those loans your percent of market capitalization for that product does decline if you reinvest that product into an equal allocation then you expect you know multi family to to increase from there we are growing on both sides and as i mentioned earlier we had record volume of acquisitions on both the single family and the multi family side in the fourth quarter and we re expecting similar results in the first quarter there is not a hard target we re looking at we are opportunistic we will look to see where the best returns are in the market and where we can do so with book value protection so there is not a set number we re targeting it s just a function of what the market is allowing and what the market is providing us and where we see the best opportunities so we ll continue that approach versus a hard target of a certain percent christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst great and kristine you mentioned i think in your comments and net loss on multi family was that a gaap net loss including the non cash depreciation charges kristine nario chief financial officer yes it is a gaap net loss christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst so going forward we should be starting to look at this undepreciated eps and book value as multi family growth as a portfolio kristine nario chief financial officer that s correct that s why we introduced this quarter because we see those numbers getting significant as we go into joint venture equity investments in multi family properties where we have control christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst all right and then jason given that you guys invest both common and preferred equity into these joint ventures is your preferred equity from the sponsor standpoint is your preferred equity technically equity when he goes and tries to get a first lean loan on his assets jason serrano president well yes so does it the way we look at it we call them in the presentation we call it mas lending and mas the lending is basically a second party in the cap structure for the sponsor and in certain cases there s provisions on a second or as long as relates to recapitalization of the first so it is a hybrid security instrument where it has that features and equity features that features in the form of a coupon and equity features in the form of pick and other calculated measures so from the sponsors perspective it does give them flexibility as it relates to senior financing as relates to press versus a mezzanine loan although the features of both those are very similar as relates to our return christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst and given all that should we look at these as control investments or is there a scenario where there could be some control investments kristine nario chief financial officer there is going to be scenarios for preferred equity type investments that could be control when we have to take over the property if the property is not doing well or some things being done by the operator that s not that s not in accordance with our agreement there s i think a couple of instances in a prior year where we took over these properties and by taking them over we were able to make the property better and actually not incur any loss in those properties christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst ok i ll follow up offline thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of doug harter from credit suisse your line is open doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks can you talk about how loan pricing has changed in 2022 then given some of the back up we ve seen in securitization spreads and pricing jason serrano president yeah so i can speak to our portfolio directly so we looking at the latest changes for this week we believe that we ve estimated about a one a half percent loss to book value through the first quarter that s related to this our securities that we still have on our balance sheet and in most of the longer duration mortgage loans that we have on the balance sheet as well where a lot of those were that losses that have we believe that losses have been incurred the market as a whole i mean there s depending on what the underlying coupons are and what the duration is it s more than just simply looking at swap rates and taking it duration and taking your price range from there it s also some liquidity measures on some of the lower coupon on assets so when you re financing costs is greater than the spread or your asset coupons he doesn t know how much leverage you apply for that so staying away from those low coupon asset class has been a priority for us which is why we focus on short duration high coupon bridge and we delayed our dscr investment strategy until the better half of fourth quarter and mainly starting in the first quarter the market is resetting and securitizations are also resetting there s been a couple of deals that have been pulled off the market some of it simply because nobody wants to step into a bond deal and have it marked down a few points next day when rates move another 25 basis point so i think the market is waiting to reset there s still plenty of capital on the sidelines for all these assets in securizations but there s kind of a wait and see approach in the market until rates kind of settle out doug harter credit suisse analyst i guess just then on your ability to deploy capital are there opportunities to take advantage of others kind of hesitancy given your current defensive positioning or do you kind of take that wait and see approach given given the current volatility jason serrano president no we ve freed up capital on our balance sheet with early securizations in the quarter simply to take advantage of some illiquidity in the market that will allow us to buy it at lower prices we are open for business we have been looking at larger portfolios from a region your pipelines that kind of got it stock without being able to place into the market and warehouse lines that were timing out our interest and our market presence in the scratching of market really helps us see a lot of activity not just related to agency origination that is now scratching down but just origination overall that can get kind of can get put in a period of hold where the buyer backed out and now they re kind of shopping that loan pool in the market is all we are evaluating opportunities to that end and we expect to continue seeing it we are absolutely looking to take advantage of this technical change that s happened the market and at a deeper discount doug harter credit suisse analyst great appreciate it operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of matthew erdner from jones trading your line is open matthew erdner jones trading analyst hey thanks guys asking a question on behalf of jason stewart so with the partnership with bpl rental what kind of origination volume are you guys seeing from them and what should we expect in the first quarter of this year and moving forward jason serrano president what we liked about our partnership here is that the originator has shown kind of a hockey stick at origination growth that we are excited about and they continue to add new staffing to build out business right now at current rates of origination we expect a minimum of a half a billion dollars of loans in his first year but they are growing and we do expect to be able to grow that portfolio along with them on top of it we also have the opportunity to purchase loans that we are seeing from other originators that it s not necessarily a contractual floor agreement but we have been a very consistent buyer every month with these with these originators which is what when you look at our asset acquisitions rallies in the bpo space you can see consistent purchases that was around 250 million a month now we re now that number is going up as you saw last quarter and will definitely be higher in the first quarter this year overall so this is just a partnership that allows us to bring liquidity in certain markets such as this to originate and there s potentially other originators that could follow in this kind of process with us we think there s a low cost way for us to to benefit from origination platforms matthew erdner jones trading analyst yeah that s great and then are they located in the areas where you guys have been active before jason serrano president well they are it s bpl origination their focus is mostly in the dscr space they do fix and flip as well we are part of the hesitancy of going to the dcsr market was simply volume and being a secondary market buyer portfolio this is not a great way to grow a securitization book given the lack of consistency and the fact that you do want to just take for a securitization portfolio take out we would only look at this space if we had kind of guaranteed pipelines which we do today which is why that strategy is now one of our focal points that we just we walk through their bpl fix and flip book is growing and we expect that to grow faster than their dscr book but again this is one of many that we speak to and we buy loans from and we re just in this case it was originally it was concerned about rate movements and also concerned about liquidity as relates to their operation and having a consistent buyer and that can come in and take loans off their balance sheet every month or once a week was important so the funding timelines also increased relate to this opportunity for them which was helpful relief cash and get it to put it back into the market and for us to acquire assets matthew erdner jones trading analyst awesome thank you operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of bose george from kbw your line is open bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst everyone good morning in terms sort of where you are in the transformation you guys obviously put a lot of money to work for you again in 1q is there a way to think about what inning you re in terms of the transformation to a more normalized are we jason serrano president what kristine walk through and are in that purchase activity for the quarter i think it s helpful to kind of cement that point we added 324 of net activity for the quarter we it s been a struggle to add the net incrementally positive to our balance sheets simply because of the our asset sales that we ve conducted in the securitization space we sold a 193 million last quarter we are sort of at the end of that cycle for our security sales that we have on our balance sheet which is will be helpful obviously to continue to grow net positive our balance sheet going forward so for those reasons we do expect further growth prepayment and redemption activity we had very high payoffs in our scratching that portfolio which was a positive given bought those loans at discounts that we think that s going to moderate as well our rpo prepayments have been kind of consistent in kind of mid single to high single digit range that product is less sensitive to rates they have higher coupons already and it s more of a change of life plan for the borrower that prepaid that loan after 10 years of pain on that loan and in multi family we with the roll up opportunities that we re focusing on and working in this new environment in the south southeast part of the united states we have really hit our stride with sourcing we do speak to hundreds of sponsors we do and so it is an 80 20 rule here where 20 of our business comes to 20 of the sponsors provide about 80 of the business and we re going to continue being able to grow in those southern markets with the migration that we see so we re excited about the growth that our portfolio could experience and the reason why we provided a projection or at least a hypothetical relating to our eps movements related to asset growth bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok great that s helpful and then actually in terms of returns can you just talk about the returns on the operating real estate just how that compares to the incremental returns on other assets jason serrano president in relating to jvs bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst the jvs yeah kristine nario chief financial officer so the jvs we re targeting about 12 to 17 of return but that s going to be over the life of the investment which would include kind of like an exit when we sell the property and that s what we re looking to do i mean you ll see the pop at the end but over time what you ll see is property income less expenses which would include depreciation and amortization expenses and then at the end you ll see a gain a capital gain essentially jason serrano president yeah the important note is that those assets are held at basis and we take depreciation against that those assets every quarter so the extent that we ve had an 8 increase in rental rates in the first quarter that s not going to the gain of those assets is not to be represented on our balance sheet as we hold it at cost so its cost accounting on those assets with depreciation on kristine s point the gain would you have to expect to gain that we are working toward on a transformation of a lot of the property itself through capex plans or maintenance deferment cleanup is what we re how generate our return as well as the rental payments we receive on a monthly basis bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok and actually if you said this already what s the typical life for those properties jason serrano president thanks for mentioning that it s an important distinction part of the growth strategy for us also has been the fact that our mezzanine portfolio is more of a shorter duration instrument typically what happens is that the sponsor takes the rpfs that use for capex improves the property and then looks to either recap the property or sell the property to to get paid on that improvement so we ve seen that duration anywhere from kind of like two and a half to two to four four and a half years as the property gets transitioned we do expect the jvs that of a longer duration in the fact that we are equity we are equity alongside of the sponsor and making decisions on that sale have opportunity to take back the property in the case of a sale so if the sponsors timelines are a bit shorter than ours we have the opportunity to hold that property through a longer lifetime which we really enjoy you know a lot of the sponsors will focus on irr you we re focusing on on look on irr and total cash so we love we think there s a great income producing asset is inflation protected and we don t mind taking these assets for a bit of a longer duration if need be but we do expect it to be a bit longer than that prep bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst ok great thanks and then just one last one you mentioned it earlier but what was the book value of quarter date again was that half percent and catch up kristine nario chief financial officer undepreciated book value is 474 down 0 02 cents bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst in the quarter since the end of the quarter like what was the change jason serrano president it s down about a half a percent bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst half a percent ok perfect ok great thanks all jason serrano president i m sorry if the question was related to first quarter book value decline we see about a one and a half percent decline to date through this week if that was the question bose george keefe bruyette and woods analyst yeah that was it yeah you just missed it anyways thanks a lot operator ok thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of matthew howlett from b riley your line is open matthew howlett b riley financial analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question first of all congrats to you both steve good luck in your role jason congrats on the promotion just a couple of questions on you would be the cabinet appointments i just were to assume it happened on october 1st all of it i mean they added to sense cents sort of dividend coverage we re getting close to that just curious on what the impact would have been jason serrano president the impact if we were to add this as in october hypothetically matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yes jason serrano president the impact is essentially what you re seeing on that hypothetical page that we presented and it s simple math you look at the average income right you look at the addition to the numerator in that quarter relates a full year a full quarter cycle of interest earnings and then you could see the incremental impact there so it s pretty straightforward which is why we presented it and that s our expectation when you if you were to add those assets matthew howlett b riley financial analyst got it so we look at dividend coverage we should look at the run rate of the company and that is sort of the example you gave jason serrano president yeah there look there matthew howlett b riley financial analyst got a second question congrats on paying off the high cost convertible or let s look at the unsecured side but what do you what are you seeing out there your cost of capital has come down you ve been able to issue cheaper and would you look to replace that something else of balance sheet jason serrano president so we speak regularly with bankers in the space on corporate finance opportunities that s available very few of the number of calls this year despite higher rates there s a couple of interesting transactions that they re out there as really if the whole business securitizations which is securing a particular part of your asset portfolio and issuing debt off that portfolio so it s like a whole business kind of securitization related to the grassapple that is something that is evolved over the course of the last couple of years that product offering i remember back in 2007 was pretty popular and that seemed to come back in the last six months i mentioned it not as because we re actually considering doing a deal in that space right now simply because there are new structures that we re seeing which we re evaluating right now we have plenty of cash on our balance sheet with respect to financing that we ve completed and expect to complete so we re not in the market at the moment looking for a corporate finance opportunity related to the grassapple but during the course of the year depending on where you know our portfolio migrates and and also what the opportunities on the sourcing side we definitely will continue evaluating that but we have plenty of equity for our pipeline so that we have established matthew howlett b riley financial analyst great ok we ll look forward to that and on the subject of lower cost of capital i look at atlantis history so we ve had a great history of versification first mover and as the classes now look at the two sort of residential multi family particularly the recent growth and the role strategy of the jvs would you see these two strategies co existing together could there be one be split out i mean do you think there s synergies of having them together would you look at some point to try to enhance the value of the multi family business by spinning it out or some some other type of corporate restructuring jason serrano president it s an interesting question we believe at the moment it offers our shareholders interesting diversification that is i think unique in the market today i definitely believe that the story we ve talked more about the origination platform because we believe it s an important part of the value of the company and our sourcing capability particularly the fact that we are internally sourcing in and originating those loans and it s an asset class that has produce roughly 100 million dollars of origination volume net of over the course of the years and now we re obviously seeing opportunities to increase that so as that business continues to grow well we ll evaluate the opportunity and see what is in the best interest of our shareholders as it relates to that portfolio and the rest of the book but at the moment i think it provides a great diversification strategy for those that are looking at both residential markets and looking at the strength of the multi family market that we have within our within our balance sheet today matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yeah just look at all the sort of there s been a lot of private equity activity in real estate so these and just look at that that portfolio may not be getting the credit that it deserves and you know your cost of capital should be lower as relates to that strategy jason serrano president i mean private equity the property reach had a great run of trade above book value obviously depreciation plays a big role there but there s been a big increase in valuations of those underlying properties giving rent rate growth rates and today we were following that same path as rates that gaap accounting and we hope our shows see the value of that asset our balance sheet matthew howlett b riley financial analyst yes certainly familiar with that we ll look forward to it and congrats again jason serrano president thank you operator thank you i m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr serrano for any closing remarks jason serrano president yes thank you everybody for being on the call today and we look forward to speaking you to on our q1 2022 earnings call great have a great day

from february 25 to march 12 theater for the new city tnc will present the august strindberg rep production of august strindberg s dance of death parts one and two newly translated and directed by robert greer the two parts of this play which were written in 1900 are being performed together in english onstage for the very first time translator director robert greer is artistic director of august strindberg rep which is a resident company of tnc dance of death is labeled by some critics as strindberg s greatest work in an isolated fort edgar a captain of a coastal artillery installation and alice his wife have lived for 20 years hating each other with a deadly venom and each wishing the other s death when kurt edgar s cousin comes to stay in it he is caught up in the atmosphere of evil he falls in love with alice and becomes her associate in a plot designed to destroy her husband following a stroke edgar suddenly gains a new vision of life realizing his own errors and pleading for reconciliation thus ends the first part of the drama in part two edgar is revealed to be a villain clever devious and cunning he has lured kurt into a stock market scam ruined kurt s aspirations for election to parliament snatched kurt s household furnishings at bankruptcy prices undermined the military career of kurt s son allen by getting him transferred to a remote base in the far north and plotted to marry his own coquettish daughter judith to his commanding officer to curry favor nevertheless the second play ends in the final triumph of the wife edgar s health problems which were established in part one are catching up with him remorselessly alice drives edgar to his death although in the very process of doing so bitter doubt enters her mind in a diabolical subplot judith tortures allen kurt s son for loving her she is portrayed as a youthful vampire and there is the sense that this family s cycle of love hatred will go on and on the plays legacy can be seen in a number of contemporary works in play strindberg friedrich dürrenmatt condensed the two parts into a terse brutal series of boxing rounds the claustrophobic atmosphere and treatment of marital dysfunction in strindberg s masterpiece reverberate through albee s who s afraid of virginia woolf harry kondoleon s the houseguests and even john guare s the house of blue leaves robert greer s new translation aspires to the tone and register of the original plays which were written in 1900 without sounding dusty there have only been two english translations to date of part 2 the original by edwin björkman in 1912 the other by harry g carlson greer s mentor in 1971 carlson taught that translations of plays unlike novels only last for ten years and must be refreshed robert greer has stepped up to provide such a translation for our 21st century american sensibility to configure the two plays for a one night presentation he has trimmed out some fat in kurt s part and some unnecessary minor characters maids and a crazy old lady whose scenes were so encapsulated that they could be eliminated without affecting continuity he theorizes that extraneous characters were packed into the plays because in those days audiences liked large casts complete with servants edgar the captain is played by brad fryman his wife alice is played by natalie menna kurt edgar s cousin is played by brian hamilton judith the daughter of edgar and alice is played by bailey newman allen kurt s lovesick son is played by john cencio burgos set design is by mark marcante lighting design is by alexander bartenieff costume design is by billy little props by lytza colon sound design by roy t chang strindberg is considered a father of the avant garde and august strindberg repertory theatre under the direction of robert greer is committed to productions of the author s best and less often performed plays in new translations and interpretations that illuminate the plays for today s american audience that is why tnc has taken this repertory into its family robert greer writes the strindberg rep is deeply grateful to crystal field for having made us her newest resident company crystal s support of new plays and plays newly translated has been a godsend to us her knowledge and experience of theater is a beacon guiding us and her unflagging devotion to the art of the drama

hey there time traveller this article was published 17 02 2022 787 days ago so information in it may no longer be current leave it to elon musk to stir up controversy without saying or tweeting a word in november according to a regulatory filling the tesla ceo donated to charity about 5 million shares of company stock worth 5 7 billion since the filing with the securities and exchange commission was made public monday tesla hasn t responded to a request for comment nor has musk mentioned the donation on twitter his favorite communications forum yet that hasn t quelled debates in and out of philanthropy about transparency tax deductions and congressional legislation along with speculation about where exactly the money was donated some experts say musk likely donated his shares to his donor advised fund or daf for short dafs are essentially charitable investment accounts in which donors can claim a tax deduction upfront but aren t legally required to distribute the money file tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk speaks at the satellite conference and exhibition march 9 2020 in washington according to a regulatory filling the tesla ceo donated about 5 million shares of company stock worth roughly 5 7 billion to charity in november 2021 tesla didn t respond to a request for comment and musk has not commented on twitter about the donation since the filing with the u s securities and exchange commission was made public monday feb 14 2022 ap photo susan walsh file experts say that would be the most advantageous strategy for musk currently the world s richest man with an approximate net worth of more than 220 billion a daf donation would allow him to claim a tax deduction of as much as 30 of his 2021 adjusted gross income instead of 20 if he had donated it instead to his foundation musk could also deduct the fair market value of the stock instead of its original value he can do whatever he wants with his money anyone can said john arnold a billionaire philanthropist who co founded the laura and john arnold foundation and arnold ventures with his wife laura but if he s getting a subsidy from society through this tax deduction then there s a responsibility that goes with it whether or not musk donated his tesla shares to a daf arnold said the possibility that he did highlights a questionable tax loophole for many wealthy americans society is giving them this tax deduction this subsidy to encourage more resources to get to communities arnold said but the way that the tax law is structured today it doesn t necessitate that that happens you can get the tax deduction today and there s no requirement for that money ever to get to the community you can give money to a donor advised fund and keep it in a tax free investment account forever arnold and others who want to address that loophole have formed a coalition the initiative to accelerate charitable giving that seeks to tighten requirements for dafs and other financial vehicles used by the wealthy this month a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a bill in the house of representatives that would limit how long donations can remain in a daf untaxed similar bipartisan legislation was introduced last year in the u s senate many daf proponents oppose the changes arguing that dafs with an average payout rate of around 20 are distributing money faster and more robustly than many private foundations whose average distribution is generally only slightly above the 5 annually required by law according to the stanford law school policy lab on donor advised funds if musk did place tesla shares in a daf the tax law s intent backfired arnold said the community received neither the tax revenue generated by musk s income on the shares or the philanthropic benefit that the tax deduction was meant to create dafs also allow for anonymity benjamin soskis a historian of philanthropy and a senior researcher at the urban institute suggested that musk s donation shows norms may be tipping towards a lack of disclosure about where large gifts are landing when you re giving away that much money it is by definition a matter of public interest where it s going to soskis said generally musk s approach to donations has differed from that of many other wealthy donors who are often accused of publicizing their gifts as a way to burnish their reputations about a month before donating his stock the notoriously provocative musk engaged in a twitter fight with the head of the united nations world food programme who had urged billionaires to donate 6 billion on a one time basis to help end starvation musk said he would sell 6 billion of tesla stock and donate the proceeds to the agency if it could show how the money would solve world hunger david beasley the organization s executive director said this week that it had yet to receive a donation from the tesla ceo soskis of the urban institute has suggested that there s room for musk to be more transparent about his gifts while still signaling his contempt for elite public opinion as the tesla ceo frequently does at times musk does provide transparency about his donations last year he gave 50 million to st jude s children s research hospital he also donated about 30 million to a variety of public schools and nonprofits in south texas where spacex builds its rockets his private foundation s latest irs filing shows he donated 11 000 tesla shares to the charity in 2019 from july that year to june 2020 the foundation distributed 23 6 million in grants some of that went directly to working charities but a large chunk 20 7 million went to fidelity charitable a grantmaker that sponsors dafs some who have worked with musk explain his style of philanthropy by saying he isn t focused on looking good marcius extavour vice president of climate and energy at xprize which manages musk s 100 million prize for carbon removal says musk wanted the project to be focused on finding impactful solutions and didn t want it to use his image everywhere that s in contrast to some other donors who extavour asserts seem more concerned about invitations to speaking engagements and other events winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement it s been pretty nice to work with the musk foundation as a donor who is not nitpicking on how we describe this or how we describe that extavour said or making sure they get the shine or the limelight steve greanias general manager of fundraising solutions for the fundraising platform givesmart says that like most people working in philanthropy he is curious about where musk s money went and how it was or will be used yet he doesn t think it s necessarily everyone s business to know his own platform which serves about 8 000 nonprofits and has processed about 800 million in donations accepts anonymous donations if you have this kind of money and you want to do good with it and you don t feel the need to be recognized for it that s ok greanias said that s

superhosts with health and safety concerns related to the pandemic are eligible for an extension the company said in a statement late friday afternoon airbnb and its hosts have a symbiotic relationship that was frayed early in the pandemic when airbnb gave guests full refunds for canceled reservations which some hosts said left them in the lurch airbnb s business rebounded quickly in part fueled by workers untethered from offices who booked long term rentals in far flung locations airbnb superhost ann goldman sits at the dining table in her east bay home where she sometimes invites guests to join friends at dinner goldman faces losing her host designation if she does not meet the company s rental guidelines within a certain time period don feria special to the chronicle goldman fits the exact profile of the kind of host airbnb likes to highlight a senior who hosts to help make ends meet sharing a room in their home advertisement article continues below this ad the other kind of hosts rent out entire houses or apartments they are controversial with many civic leaders who say turning homes into hotels removes desperately needed housing stock san francisco and other cities have placed strict limits on whole home rentals but hosts with separate units who are not cohabiting with guests obviously would have fewer concerns about hosting during the pandemic now that we re going back to our usual assessments you ll need to work on a few of your stats airbnb wrote in a email last week saying that superhosts must host at least 10 stays in the past year or 100 nights over at least three stays for hosts with longer term reservations during the pandemic airbnb had temporarily let superhosts keep their designation without being active we ve worked hard to help our hosts adapt to the changing conditions of the pandemic including changing the way we assess superhost status the company said in its friday statement our superhosts are valued members of the airbnb community and we ll continue to monitor the impacts of covid 19 and make updates as appropriate david jacoby president and co founder of hostfully which makes software to help airbnb hosts and property managers manage their vacation rentals said he appreciates that airbnb extended superhost status as long as it did advertisement article continues below this ad he resumed renting via airbnb in his san francisco home in september but does not share common spaces with travelers obviously there are going to be hosts who are concerned and upset about that he said of the new policy if and when they start hosting again they will have to start from scratch to re earn their superhost status but he thought hosts would be able to re earn it quickly because airbnb does an evaluation every three months of who meets its criteria san francisco residents karen and rodolfo cancino 81 and 83 respectively have similar concerns to those of goldman they re longtime hosts who rent out a private bedroom and bathroom in their western addition victorian but they stopped hosting over covid fears for themselves and even more for their toddler granddaughter who is not old enough to be vaccinated their son his wife and the 14 month old live on the property and could come into close contact with guests karen said we would not risk that happening we re just being very cautious we all have reasons valid reasons for not wanting to host now advertisement article continues below this ad airbnb enjoyed a stellar fourth quarter with revenue up 38 from the same time in 2019 pre pandemic the

nasi ambeng from coba coba truly horrendous meals are hard to find in singapore mediocre food sure indifferent food of course but the island has a well deserved reputation for being a place where good food can be found pretty much everywhere in this new series the straits times food team fanned out across the island to curate lists of places worth visiting in each part of singapore north south east west and central the idea is not to tell people living in each region about the gems in their hood rather it is to give a list of possibilities for people living in other parts of singapore who might find themselves in these areas or be willing to travel for food since travel overseas is difficult in pandemic times i am starting off the series exploring the north of singapore admiralty kranji woodlands sembawang yishun yio chu kang seletar and sengkang because there are only 20 on the list the curation has to be tight the places that made my list are those i can recommend without hesitation or hedging it helps that i do not live in the north when it came time to nail down the 20 places i picked the ones i d go back to in a heartbeat you might wonder about the dearth of new places i had a list of those to visit but found to my horror that many of them had closed that to me is a sign that the appetite for fried porridge is more fierce than for say chicken and waffles the owner of one new cafe i had wanted to include told me he was closing in a month when i called for more information there is no point coming up with a list that becomes outdated in a month or two the other new places i went to turned out competent food but would i go to sengkang woodlands or yio chu kang to eat at those places no no matter how instagrammable the burgers waffles or pasta are eating for work sounds like a dream job and for most people it probably is the draw for me at least is the possibility of finding a gem somewhere or of tucking into something soulful and satisfying in the north i discovered a terrific fish soup although the seafood was not the highlight a wickedly good dessert i want to have every day but cannot because my doctors will be up in arms a coffee shop stall which fries unthinkable things and a cool and quirky cafe that was the last place i had expected to find terrific nasi ambeng after a great briyani meal in sembawang i drove down the street saw a sign for a cafe and decided to stop and check it out it turned out to be a ghost kitchen sort of set up bummed out and on the way back to the carpark i passed another briyani restaurant and had to go in and there i found paradise you will see what i mean and yes i had two briyani meals back to back anything for you dear reader the chill vibe of the seletar area is so seductive i feel my blood pressure going down as i exit the expressway i cannot think of anything better than morning coffee outdoors at a quirky cafe on the premises of an aviation company come explore the north with me you

char kway teow wow i am in awe of your taste memory that char kway teow must surely be your madeleine your ratatouille my taste memory does not stretch that far although i remember eating at that coffee shop on the corner of armenian and loke yew streets after visits to the old national library a few years ago when i heard that the tan family had opened a stall in sengkang i made a beeline there then and now because i cannot claim to remember exactly how the original char kway teow tasted i have to evaluate it like i would any dish on its own merits and this char kway teow from 3 ticks many boxes for me it is more savoury than sweet always a good thing in my book it has the requisite wok hei so important for many dishes but for char kway teow especially because i love the flavour of expertly charred soya sauce lacquered on the rice noodles cockles are essential and the stall does not overcook them i get extra hum for 1 to add to my 4 plate hidden among the noodles are lardons cubes of pork fat the golden nuggets are mostly crisp with just a little bit of softness in the areas that come into contact with the wettish noodles i wonder if they will add cockle juice to the wok if i ask next time and if i want it a little less wet yes there will be a next time i do not find it strange to go to sengkang for char kway teow especially for such a good version my other go tos are at havelock road and zion riverside food centre both are easier to get to but i doubt very much that while queuing i will get to see the chef his hands hidden behind a tiled low wall in frying ecstasy

much skill has gone into making this bowl first the noodles are just under done and delightfully chewy as i progress and the noodles sit longer in the bowl they soften if they had not been undercooked they would have turned mushy by the time i am halfway through second the seasonings are punchy full of oomph and just spicy enough for me i would like more vinegar but this is easily fixed next time third the slices of pig liver although not cut as thickly as i would like are perfectly cooked which is to say the slices are pink in the middle i spring for three fishballs at 1 to add to my bowl and they have quite a bounce they are not of the handmade variety but then i don t expect the earth for 1 yishun 928 yishun laksa where 01 155 928 yishun central 1 open 7am to 7pm mondays to saturdays closed on sundays this laksa s gravy is lemak but not crazy rich that is a fine balance to strike says the writer st photo tan hsueh yun looking at the state of laksa in singapore i can only conclude that the health promotion board is staffed with overachievers they have done their jobs so well that food people think of as rich and indulgent have become light and politically correct very little coconut milk no oil floating on top of the bowl some places don t even offer cockles these are unacceptable crimes against laksa i don t eat it often maybe twice a year if that but when i do i want unabashed richness because that kind of laksa is hard to find i have gone entire years not eating it then recently i hit paydirt and find two places george s katong laksa in changi road and 928 yishun laksa it is a rainy morning when i rock up to yishun central despite the weather there are people doing takeaways at 928 and all but one of the tables is occupied the bowls cost 3 and 3 50 and i get the larger one with an extra dollar s worth of cockles the gravy is lemak but not crazy rich that is a fine balance to strike my belly very moody in the morning is thankful better yet the laksa rempah has oomph with plenty of dried prawn flavour i stir in the generous dollop of sambal gleefully it can only make the dish richer right small cockles overcook in a heartbeat but these are still juicy a friend reminds me of the olde days where cockles were much larger these days we are grateful for any cockles small or large the new york times predicted in a piece about american food trends in 2022 that laksa is poised to rise in prominence in the united states i shudder at the thought remembering the horrors visited on laksa when it became hot in australia oh about a decade ago red capsicum really so it is very good to know that there are laksa shops in singapore that are still showing the proper way to make the dish in case the americans want to take notes they should look at what that

it is instead of dipping my toes in and maybe ordering nasi padang and nasi lemak i skip all of that and home in on the nasi ambeng 23 90 for a two person serving that javanese communal and celebratory dish of rice meat and vegetables laid out on a large platter one taste of the bean sprout urap or salad and i am transported to bali the cekur also called sand ginger always transports me to that island and in quick succession i note the pungent chinese celery leaves in the bergedil the bright and piquant sambal terung and telur belado and the mellow richness of the ayam kalio there is more beef rendang that is not dried out or stringy sambal goreng with big cubes of tempeh and green beans that are still snappy and pieces of paru or beef lung crisp in parts spongy in others every element is cooked with care the spicing and heat levels are on point not everything is atomically spicy and nothing is dull or bland owner timothy yun 35 who went to university in sydney has indonesian friends and used to frequent an indonesian restaurant near where he lived whenever he needed a comfort food fix when he came home and decided that being a chemical engineer was not for him he opened coba coba modelled on the kind of restaurants he enjoyed seeking out in australia i always looked for places that are cheap and good he says he is hands on in the kitchen toggling between the yishun shop and coba coba kedai kopi in the jalan besar area he had worked in restaurants in sydney and instead of just hiring chefs he learns their recipes so he can cook them himself and he trains all the new recruits too chefs come and go but i m a constant here he says so i learn all the recipes first and pass them on to chefs we hire subsequently consistency is the most important thing so whenever i introduce a new recipe everybody learns it he has no qualms teaching his crew figuring that running a food business is much more than knowing a clutch of recipes the care he takes with his food shines through on the plate at his all day restaurant i have customers who come three times a day breakfast lunch and dinner lit lit sin dessert where 01 157 928 yishun central 1 open

jian bao restaurant by no signboard holdings is one of them a colleague had said it was worth visiting and i make my way to sprawling northpoint city quite literally city like in scale for the uninitiated sheng jian bao are made with yeast leavened dough like char siew bao but they are cooked like gyoza pan fried until crisp at the bottom and steamed on top despite my colleague s endorsement i temper my expectations the restaurant is in a mall for goodness sake but i seem to always be eating my words and i do so here i will say this i will be darkening these doors often i go to two shanghai restaurants for sheng jian bao in singapore and neither of them serve bao that are better the restaurant has a very impersonal vibe you order and pay at a counter take a seat keep eyes on an electronic screen for when your number flashes on it go to the collection counter to get your food rinse and repeat schlepp up and down if you have ordered many items the people at the table next to me take turns to collect their food ambience nada zip zero but who cares when the food is good oh a word of warning before you chow down tuck a napkin down the front of your shirt and try not to wear white why the sheng jian bao are crazy juicy i have chilli crab stains on my white dress to prove it they are not kidding about the popping juices part i order a sampler tricolor sheng jian bao 10 80 for six with two each of the signature chilli crab and vegan bao the chilli crab sauce packs a punch and the bao is mad juicy what lets it down is the frozen crabmeat which is mushy but honestly it would be crazy to expect hand picked lump crabmeat the signature bao is excellent juices flow copiously out of it and it has a very crispy bottom what thrills me is the contrast in textures that crunchy bottom and soft top even the vegan version filled with chopped greens and shredded carrot is good but not as juicy as the other two pan fried juicy guotie dumpling 5 50 for three is just as juicy how much jellied stock do they stuff inside the dumplings but i prefer the bao for the bigger contrast in textures another dish worth ordering is sliced pork with garlic in spicy sauce 7 80 what the menu does not say in english at least is that the slices of pork sit on a bed of fen pi translucent noodles that are off the charts qq the garlicky pork sliced thin but not dried out and the springy noodles are almost perfect i just need more black vinegar old world bak kut teh fried porridge where 01 380 732 yishun avenue 5 open 10am to 2 30pm 5 to 8pm tuesdays to fridays 8

porridge 6 is hands down the best thing i ate for this feature the dish looks seriously ugly a bowl of brown sludge but i am smitten from the first spoonful the porridge is deeply infused with wok hei and that smokiness is intoxicating it smells and tastes like how fried hor fun should but never does because proper no holds barred wok hei is so elusive i am happy to just slurp up fried porridge but am glad there is a generous amount of impeccably cleaned large pig intestines and pig stomach in the bowl the slices of lean pork and pig liver are less compelling both are overcooked the owner mr jemmy yeo who opened old world in 2019 says he got the idea from penang where hawkers fry white porridge and add seasonings to it his version is different the base is hokkien kiam buay savoury hokkien style porridge which he then fries in an atomically hot wok the ones he uses are smaller and lighter than zi char woks his measure about 30cm in diameter he can achieve wok hei in a far shorter time in these smaller woks he says his bak kut teh 7 is generously sized with four meaty ribs i like that it is not too peppery but the soup is under salted this is easily fixed however dry fried mee sua 1 and bak kut teh 7 st photo tan hsueh yun to have with the bak kut teh i get dry fried mee sua 1 another dish worth ordering the vermicelli is beautifully springy not weighed down with oil the flavour

spacious and some care has been taken in the choice of tables and chairs and in the sign designs for each stall this place is like a foodcourt without air conditioning with plenty of good food ah ma mee sua is a standout here i am not a fan of mee sua because the rice vermicelli is way too starchy so i opt for ah ma tau chiam 4 50 tau chiam noodles are made with soya beans and wheat the ones at ah ma are very thin about the width of mee pok they are cooked perfectly silky slippery and pleasantly chewy the broth is light but flavourful and truth be told it could do with a little more salt but soon i am distracted by the two good sized pork balls juicy and not too densely packed there is also a whole dried then rehydrated shiitake mushroom with a bizarre scissor snip down the centre that does not cut through the whole thing is that to make the mushroom easier to eat it is delicious having soaked up lots of broth i am also impressed by the slices of pig liver cut fairly thick and not overcooked so often i struggle to find something healthy to eat in a hawker centre i cannot always settle for fish soup yong tau foo and steamed egg from the economic rice stalls although temptations

beef noodles dry or in soup i like mine dry but detest gluggy sauces so when ordering from a new stall or shop i just take the safe option and get the soup version for some reason i opt for dry noodles at beef king a halal beef noodle stall in marsiling mall and boy am i glad the beef tendon tripe noodle 9 has a thickened sauce but it is not at all gloopy it has the right viscosity to coat the thin stretchy kway teow underneath even better the tripe is cleaned beautifully and delightfully springy chunks of gelatinous tendon go down easy sometimes at beef noodle places the meat is stringy but the collagen in the pieces of what i think is beef shin keeps the generous chunks juicy i prefer these chunks of beef to sliced beef over tenderised with baking soda which is what some stalls offer there are two dipping sauces to go with the noodles a rust red one with the deep flavour of dried chillies and a bright red one that has tang in spades the chunks of beef are great with the rust red dip and the offal sings with the zingy one pungent chinese celery perfumes the noodles and soup but does not mask the cinnamon and caramel notes in it i could have a bowl every day ivan s

boiled and peeled potatoes and baskets of raw russets waiting to be turned into rosti i think about the work that goes into it peeling boiling and shredding the spuds cannot possibly be fun now i will say that if you are expecting swiss style rosti uniformly crunchy and golden brown look elsewhere the rosti here is fried fairly hard so some parts are browned some parts charred some parts soft it is this mix of textures that i like besides to achieve crunchiness throughout they would need to fry it with insane amounts of oil i am not up for that owner ivan lee opened the stall in 2009 after working for seven years at marche in the heeren where he made rosti he says he uses about 20kg of spuds a day and more than 60 per cent of his customers order rosti he fries each one to order in small pans he even makes his own sour cream adding lemon juice to whipping cream to sour it owner ivan lee opened the stall in 2009 after working for seven years at marche in the heeren where he made rosti

from the fryer with a crunchy armour and spurts juices when i cut it with a knife my quibble is that it is undersalted and although the staffer tells me the chicken had been marinated i don t taste it

uninteresting and i am in despair before taking a bite looks are not everything it would seem this is a substantial dish for the price and it is available only on weekdays from 3pm there are many little touches i appreciate the blanched cabbage is properly drained so it does not sit in a pool of water at the bottom of the plate the potatoes are cooked right through to the centre the green beans have a lot of snap best of all the stall is generous with the tempeh and scattered on top are crisp flower shaped keropok so i don t mind that the sauce has been slopped on and it is impossible

prawns slices of generic white fish you know some variation of catfish and the best thing in the bowl the stall s signature minced pork the prawns are firm and sweet but you would expect that the fish well it s nothing to write home about but the minced pork is just utterly fabulous it is mixed with a generous amount of toasted dried sole fish which gives it a deep umami flavour later when i double back to the stall to thank them i tell the uncle how much i love the pork he tells me 1kg of dried sole goes into 20kg of minced pork if you have ever bought good quality dried sole you will know it does not come cheap but adds a lot of flavour to everything the soup made with pork prawn and crayfish is murky it sounds like a bad thing but is not it is robust and very flavourful the only problem is that it is very salty but eat it with rice and all is forgiven sembawang paradise biryani where 01 07 sembawang cottage 369 sembawang road tel 6314 6369 open 10 30am to 9 30pm tuesdays to sundays

jakarta washington reuters russia and china watered down a g 20 finance leaders statement on geopolitical risks to the global economy as a contentious meeting ended on friday feb 18 deleting a reference to current tensions as financial markets fretted over the prospect of war in ukraine the gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors from the group of 20 major economies was one of the most fractious since the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 according to people familiar with the discussions canadian finance minister chrystia freeland strayed from the g 20 economic script to issue an impassioned plea to her russian counterparts to not invade ukraine warning that such action would hurt the global economy and bring crushing sanctions against russia according to two sources familiar with her remarks other sources familiar with the meeting said china and russia had objected to the reference to current tensions in an earlier draft communique as well as disagreements on debt restructuring for poor countries and carbon pricing the group s final communique simply said we will also continue to monitor major global risks including from geopolitical tensions that are arising and macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities as the meeting concluded us and european stocks fell on worries that a russian invasion of ukraine was imminent after russian backed separatists announced a surprise evacuation of their breakaway regions in eastern ukraine debt relief standstill the g 20 talks held virtually and in the indonesian capital jakarta were also marked by disagreements over the group s stalled debt restructuring framework the final communique failed to endorse international monetary fund and world bank proposals for an immediate debt service suspension for poor countries that seek restructurings and an expansion to include some middle income countries instead finance officials reiterated their commitment to step up our efforts to implement the framework in a timely orderly and coordinated manner without any specifics earlier a source at the talks said china by far the world s largest bilateral creditor had baulked at the idea of accepting outright haircuts on debt world bank president david malpass said at the munich security conference after the finance meeting that he was concerned the g 20 is not identifying the steps forward to deal with a massive and growing debt overhang in developing countries the g 20 discussions on debt were really disappointing said eric lecompte executive director of the jubilee usa network a faith based organisation campaigning for debt relief for poor countries he said china was resisting steps to strengthen the bankruptcy like g 20 debt framework so that they can cut deals on the side with debtor countries credibility questions
california is home to the largest share of the united states billionaires soon lawmakers say they could have to pay up assemblyperson alex lee d san jose re introduced a tax on extreme wealth this week it would tax people with a net worth of 50 million or more an extra 1 and billionaires an extra 1 5 that would affect about 15 000 households in the state lee says the tax would be on a person s full wealth whether that wealth has been realized as income or not tax season is upon us again although it somehow feels like it never ends the top tax accountants in sf can help you ensure the greatest refund and lowest likelihood of an audit the false claims act got its name from its authors research on income tax avoidance of some of the world s richest people the propublica analysis released last year revealed that the richest 25 americans pay just a tiny fraction of their wealth in taxes and some are able to pay little to nothing in income tax with effective tax rates lower than the average american by increasing their fortunes in assets such as stocks and property and then borrowing off those assets they are able to avoid selling the assets and paying capital gains taxes explained lee there are fears it could push some of those wealthy people out of california for instance when elon musk faced restrictions in california he moved tesla s headquarters to austin texas and likely has most of his personal wealth parked there now too assemblymember lee argues that won t be the case while some say california is driving away higher income residents the opposite is true we ve actually been losing lower and middle income residents that are being priced out while continuing to gain higher income residents lee also says a vast majority of californians support such a tax with a david binder poll clocking that number in at 70 of california residents while california does have the most billionaires it also has the highest poverty rate before the pandemic the golden state s poverty rate was about 16 4 whereas the nationwide average was 13 4 those numbers have only worsened in the pandemic a uc berkeley and uc davis study estimates the wealth tax would bring the state about 22 3 billion a year right now there s no guidelines for how that money would be used the bill would need voter approval since it exceeds the state s tax rate limit which right now is set at 0 4 last year lee s attempt at the same tax didn t even make it to committee other similar efforts have also failed repeatedly and even california governor gavin newsom has avoided the issue the california taxpayers association has come out against the bill if it passes ab 2289 would kick into effect in 2023 for billionaires and in 2025 for 50 millionaires photo by giorgio trovato on unsplash
by megan davies and chris prentice new york washington reuters u s prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks according to two sources familiar with the situation the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms including such well known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors reuters and other media have reported while prosecutors haven t made any decisions yet potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico were an option on the table the sources said in the past prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations such as manipulation one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u s attorney s office in los angeles which are involved in the probe according to the sources declined to comment citron declined to comment a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment the potential use of the 1970 law which has not been previously reported provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department s unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged criminal enterprise even if they participated indirectly lawyers said but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people that s in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity they said among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so called short and distort scheme sources have previously told reuters in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company s stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited the sources have said they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports reuters previously reported rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery money laundering or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented u s prosecutors in 2019 charged then current and former jpmorgan chase co executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals rico statutes haven t been used in this realm often in recent years but they aren t limited to organized crime robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said it s certainly in the prosecutors toolbox additional reporting by svea herbst bayliss editing by michelle price paritosh bansal and diane craft

new york the federal reserve should start raising interest rates next month to help rein in too high inflation federal reserve bank of new york president john williams said friday but he added that the rate hikes may not have to begin with as big a bang as some have suggested with inflation at its hottest level in two generations the fed is widely expected to seek to cool the economy by raising its benchmark short term interest rate from its record low of nearly zero where it s been throughout the pandemic the only question has been how big and how quickly it will move because an overly aggressive approach could choke the economy while too much caution could let inflation spiral further personally i don t see any compelling argument to take a big step at the beginning williams said following an event at new jersey city university to discuss the economy and interest rates williams who is vice chairman of the committee that sets the fed s interest rate policy said he sees a march increase as the beginning of a steadily moving process to get interest rates closer to a level where they are no longer stimulating the economy he also said he expects inflation to fall from its current level due to a confluence of factors including the fed s moves and hoped for improvements in supply chain bottlenecks last month inflation hit 7 5 percent in january compared with a year ago williams comments were echoed by other fed officials who spoke at a policy conference in new york this support for a steady approach to rate hikes contrasted with previous statements by federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard who said the fed should consider a half point rate hike in one of its upcoming meetings twice its normal increase his comments shook wall street which had been expecting a slower liftoff of rates lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said that she expected the fed would at its next meeting in march initiate a series of rate increases advertisement brainard is close to fed chairman jerome powell and has been nominated for vice chair the fed s no 2 position krishna guha an analyst at investment bank evercore isi said that brainard broadly endorsed wall street s expectations that the fed will hike rates six times this year she also said the fed would soon turn to reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled during the pandemic because of the fed s bond purchases she said they would likely do so more quickly than from 2017 2019 when they allowed about 50 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them charles evans president of the chicago fed said friday that the fed needed to adjust its low interest rate policies which he called wrong footed but he also suggested that the central bank may not have to sharply raise rates this year evans also said that high prices have mostly been caused by disruptions to supply chains and other factors stemming from the pandemic and will likely fade partly on their own and given the economy s current strength the fed s moves shouldn t slow hiring as much as interest rate hikes have in the past evans added advertisement higher rates can corral inflation by slowing the economy but they can also cause a recession if they go too high and they put downward pressure on all kinds of investments from stock prices to cryptocurrencies wall street has been fixated on almost every word from fed officials recently hoping to divine how quickly and by how much the fed will move the mix of aggressive and moderate comments have left traders expectations in flux traders were pricing in only a 21 percent probability of such a half point move on friday afternoon down from 49 percent a week earlier according to cme group williams said he did not want to get into minute details about whether market expectations are in line with his own thinking for interest rate policy but he said that the big picture movements make sense based on expectations that the fed will move its key interest rate closer to normal like 2 percent to 2 5 percent by the end of next year that s higher than the most recent forecast fed officials gave in december they had a median projection of 1 6 percent for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 evans who typically favors lower interest rates acknowledged that if inflation stayed high throughout this year a larger number of rate hikes could be necessary advertisement other speakers at the new york conference focused on whether the fed had erred when it adopted its new policy framework in august 2020 which sought to keep rates low until inflation actually materialized previously the fed would typically raise borrowing costs when the economy was healthy to preempt any inflation frederick mishkin a former fed governor and economist at columbia university said the fed had made a serious mistake in not hiking rates earlier to prevent inflation from taking off now fed officials may have to raise rates much higher to bring prices back in line he added evans however defended the fed s new policy framework by pointing out that in the past when the fed hiked rates to preempt inflation such moves likely cost many jobs and in some cases inflation didn t materialize following the remarks by williams and evans the two year treasury note fell to 1 46 percent from 1 49 percent late thursday it tends to move with expectations for the fed s policy on rates stocks and other areas of the bond market were also lower amid worries about a possible russian invasion of

seoul feb 19 korea bizwire south korean stock markets are expected to continue to face volatile sessions next week largely on persistent uncertainties about the u s russian military standoff over ukraine analysts said saturday the benchmark korea composite stock price index kospi closed at 2 744 52 points friday little changed from 2 747 71 points a week ago the key stock index fluctuated much this week mostly caused by global inflation risks and rising tensions between the united states and russia over ukraine analysts said global inflation worries and geopolitical risks surrounding ukraine will continue to serve as major factors that could determine the direction of the stock markets the ukraine risk will continue to weigh on the markets in the short term said nh investment securities analyst kim young hwan investors are worried that even if russia invades ukraine and it causes wall street plunge the fed would not be able to step in to help policy wise the war would likely raise energy prices and further fan the inflation hike he added the u s russia tensions elevated this week as the u s and nato members claimed russia was building up military troops along the ukraine borders uncertainty remains high over the ukraine crisis but some remain cautiously optimistic as top diplomats of the u s and russia have agreed to hold a meeting next week inflation risks will also likely remain as yet another major risk for the markets in particular hawkish comments by fed officials next week could dent investor sentiment as they could hint at faster and steeper than expected rate hikes in the u s south korea s central bank of korea will also hold a rate setting meeting thursday observers expect the bok will likely freeze its key policy rate following a quarter percentage point increase last month but remain hawkish amid inflation worries yonhap
getting your trinity audio player ready alexis rojas santiizers counters at a slice of new york in sunnyvale on oct 15 2020 photo by olivia treynor lea este artículo en español on wednesday gov gavin newsom signed a law that requires large employers in california to offer workers up to 80 hours of covid 19 related paid sick leave but there s a catch the bill which the legislature passed on feb 7 doesn t apply to small employers with 25 or fewer workers that exemption which california s 2021 covid 19 sick leave law also included applies to more than 90 of companies in california and leaves at least one in four workers without access to the new paid leave according to data from california s employment development department without additional leave most workers in california are legally entitled to just three paid sick days early in the pandemic the federal government was reimbursing employers for covid 19 sick leave including small employers but in september 2021 both the state law and the federal reimbursements for additional paid covid 19 leave lapsed both state and federal leaders are to blame here for being short sighted and not anticipating the need for additional paid leave said kristin schumacher senior policy analyst for california budget and policy center california department of public health guidelines say that workers who are exposed to covid 19 or test positive should quarantine or isolate for at least five days when people don t have paid sick days they will work sick and that s a real danger said jenya cassidy director of california work and family coalition which advocates for paid leave policies this new law is the product of compromise she said and it will wind up helping a lot of workers but she said obviously if we re trying to do this for public health and for the health and well being of workers and their families then why would anybody be exempted nobody should be exempted this employee threshold was part of finding compromise with employer organizations and legislators concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic on small businesses said senate president toni atkins a san diego democrat in a statement bad for small business workers the vast majority of businesses in california have four or fewer employees according to data from california s employment development department workers at smaller companies earn lower wages on average than employees at larger firms according to data from the bureau of labor statistics that s concerning because nationally workers with household incomes under 25 000 were 3 5 times as likely to miss a week of work due to covid 19 compared to workers with household incomes of 100 000 or more according to analysis from the economic policy institute good for small business owners small businesses have been buffeted around by closures staffing issues and supply chain snafus business plans have been upended with each new wave of the virus and while companies like amazon apple tesla and ups have seen their stock soar during the pandemic profit margins for many small businesses have worn thin larger employers generally have more cash on hand and easier access to credit so they might have an easier time adapting to new costs said david nelson director of public policy for california asian pacific chamber of commerce if the exemption was not put in place for small businesses a mandate like that likely could have been the death knell for many small businesses especially minority small businesses said nelson he estimates that the average asian american and pacific islander owned business in california has between four and 12 employees but leaving small businesses out entirely wasn t the only option lawmakers had to soften the impact california will have a 21 billion surplus for the coming budget year based on the newsom administration s projections seemingly everyone involved in california state politics has their own idea for how to spend it that includes small business advocates who say the state could have reimbursed small business owners for providing additional paid sick leave to workers we recognize especially with another historic surplus in the budget that there are ways that the administration could make this place that small business owners are in much easier said bianca blomquist california policy director for the advocacy group small business majority it really seems like being able to support workers should be a very basic cost of doing business jenya cassidy director california work and family coalition other small business groups opposed the law despite the exemption for small employers there s this assumption by the progressives in the capitol that employers are not doing their part and making leave available said john kabateck california state director for the national federation of independent businesses california is rich with employee leave programs he said pointing to a list of leave programs many of which do not apply to workers exposed to covid 19 such as time to serve on a jury or for victims of domestic violence to file restraining orders jim relles a florist in sacramento is glad the new leave requirement won t affect his business he s got 19 employees and said it s been hard to keep up with shifting requirements during the pandemic a new paid leave policy would mean more bookkeeping and another rule to stay on top of what other covid protections do small business workers have small business employees who are exposed to covid 19 at work have significantly more protections than workers who get exposed or sick outside of work under california s covid 19 workplace rules workers who get sick due to a workplace exposure are supposed to be sent home with full pay until they re able to return to work if an employer offers more sick days than the minimum of three that workers are granted by state law then they can ask workers to use those additional sick days to quarantine or recover workers who are sure they were exposed to covid 19 outside of work don t have the same pay protection but they might be eligible for other programs such as disability insurance the state has a website to help workers figure out what sort of leave they re eligible for based on their situation cassidy from the work and family coalition said she hopes small business owners are working paid sick leave for covid 19 into their budgets it really seems like being able to support workers should be a very basic cost of doing business
washington ap the federal reserve on friday formally adopted sweeping new rules that will limit the ability of its top officials to invest in financial markets a change intended to prevent conflicts of interest involving investments affected by fed policies the stricter rules were developed after an outcry last year over questionable trades that were made by several top fed policymakers under the new rules fed officials may not invest in individual stocks bonds or cryptocurrencies and are limited to diversified investments such as mutual funds they must provide 45 days notice of any trade and secure approval of such trades and they will have to provide public notice of any trades made in the previous 30 days fed chair jerome powell announced the rules in october after ethics questions engulfed several high ranking policymakers about trades they had made in securities that stood to be affected by fed actions at the time the central bank s decisions on interest rates and bank regulations can cause significant swings in the prices of stocks bonds and other securities powell himself had come under fire after it was revealed that two regional federal reserve bank presidents traded stocks and other investments in the spring of 2020 while the fed was taking expansive steps to boost the economy and calm financial markets as a result the trades raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the two officials could have profited from the fed s actions the new rules will also cover senior vice presidents at the fed s 12 regional banks research directors at the regional banks and senior staff members at the fed in washington as well as their spouses the rules will take effect may 1

washington feb 19 federal reserve officials yesterday squelched what had been rising market expectations for an aggressive initial response to 40 year high us inflation signaling that steady interest rate hikes should be enough to do the trick i don t see any compelling argument to taking a big step at the beginning new york federal reserve bank president john williams the no 2 official on the central bank s policy setting panel told reporters after a speech i think we can steadily move up interest rates and reassess he said at the online event fed governor lael brainard president joe biden s nominee to be vice chair at the fed said officials will likely kick off a series of rate increases at their upcoming meeting in march followed by decreases in the size of the fed s balance sheet in coming meetings advertisement brainard speaking at a conference in new york did not give a specific recommendation for the coming meeting but said recent changes in financial markets including a rise in mortgage rates were consistent with where the fed is heading the market is clearly aligned with that and brought forward the changes in financing conditions in a way that s consistent with our communications and data brainard said investors in federal funds futures contracts last week began leaning towards the idea the fed would raise rates a half a percentage point in march those expectations have now drifted back with a quarter point hike now anticipated and six increases in total over the year advertisement in remarks at the conference in new york chicago fed president charles evans downplayed the thought the fed needed to get more aggressive even though he agreed policy was wrong footed with annual consumer price increases topping 7 per cent he said he remained convinced inflation would ease on its own i see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk evans said at a separate new york event we don t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike we may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot the remarks came at the end of a tumultuous week in which traders piled into and then backed away from bets that the fed would begin a round of rate hikes next month with a bigger than usual half point increase st louis fed president james bullard had fanned those expectations with a call for raising rates by a full percentage point by the fed s june meeting a rate path that would require at least one half point hike between now and then policymakers at the central bank have all but said they will start raising borrowing costs next month to quell inflation that has raced past their 2 per cent target with fed chair jerome powell publicly silent since january williams and brainard s comments provide the best steer yet on the prevailing view at the fed s policy setting core although all fed presidents and governors participate in monetary policy decisions it is williams and powell along with the fed board vice chair a spot brainard is due to fill after senate confirmation who are most influential in shaping them steadily predictably the fed should begin raising rates next month and once rate hikes are underway begin to steadily and predictably trim its us 9 trillion rm37 6 trillion balance sheet williams said both actions he said will bring demand into better balance with supply at the same time he said other forces should also be bringing down inflation with supply chains healing and consumers returning to pre pandemic spending patterns williams said policymakers can speed up or slow down the pace of rate increases later as needed a path in which the overnight federal funds rate moves to a range of 2 per cent to 2 5 per cent by the end of next year makes sense he said williams said he expects real us gdp to grow by slightly less than 3 per cent this year and for the unemployment rate to drop to about 3 5 per cent by the end of the year he projects inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index to decline to about 3 per cent and for it to fall further next year as supply challenges improve reuters
