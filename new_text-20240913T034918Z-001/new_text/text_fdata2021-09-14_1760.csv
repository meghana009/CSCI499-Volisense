andreypopov istock new york kenneth and adi martinez have an extra bedroom in the home they share outside of seattle with their 6 month old son and 3 year old daughter so when the martinezes watched the coverage of tens of thousands of people fleeing afghanistan last month as the taliban took over they stepped up to help the martinezes opened their extra bedroom to a family of four who left afghanistan with all of their belongings packed in a few bags the mother is pregnant with her third child they they were in the airplane when one of their friends contacted them and said the taliban came said adi martinez i m pretty sure their flight was one of the last to leave before the chaos began for the past month the two families from different parts of the world have assimilated living and cooking together and watching their young children play together even as they speak different languages the martinezes have helped the family adjust to life in seattle including buying them coats and shoes to adjust to the cold even though we may think we don t have a lot we have an extra bedroom we have the means and the resources and the ability to help said kenneth martinez we are happy that we can help the biden administration said as many as 95 000 refugees are expected to resettle in the united states from afghanistan over the next year u s military and diplomatic personnel withdrew from afghanistan on aug 31 ending america s 20 years of war in the country to be able to respond to the demand the nine national u s refugee resettlement agencies that lead the process are having to work with community partners to find housing according to kristen aster director of client and community engagement with the international rescue committee irc one of the nine agencies in some cases people like the martinez family are opening their homes for free to afghan refugees in other cases local companies and individuals are offering places to rent given the large numbers of folks who are arriving right now we are working with community members and private resources to have interim solutions said aster that s definitely been a great and critical lifeline as we work with these families to find them more permanent housing then we work with the families to help them find jobs to enroll their kids in school and access medical care to learn english to get connected with volunteers and others in the community to help them navigate life in the united states she said all of that is with the goal of helping families to be self sufficient and integrated as soon as possible the martinezes said their christian faith as well as their own experience motivated them to help the couple immigrated to the united states from mexico in 2011 when kenneth martinez was offered a job with microsoft we know exactly what it feels like to come to a brand new country with no family or anything he said we know it can be difficult and in the case it s very difficult for fawn johnson a real estate developer in nearby seattle the realization she could help afghan families in need came as she was watching news coverage of them fleeing their home country on u s military aircraft one of homes became vacant in july and as we saw more and more about what was going on in afghanistan we decided we wanted to use it to help refugees she said this was one thing we could actually put our hands on and personally do something about johnson is now donating her property to be used as a temporary landing spot for refugees until they are able to move to more permanent housing when johnson and her son and daughter who work in the family business asked for help from family and friends a team of more than 100 volunteers stepped up to renovate the house in a matter of weeks and stock it with food clothing household supplies and toys a family of three including an 18 month old boy arrived at the home on aug 23 and johnson and other volunteers were there to greet them we helped them carry in their luggage and they came in with everything they had she said it really hit us the few things that they brought with them and how we could carry of all that in just a trip or two describing the toddler s reaction to his new home in the u s johnson recalled the first thing he did when he came in was go right to where the toys are and he saw a ball his father said that he loves balls and that he had one in kabul that he had to leave behind johnson has stayed in touch with the family as they have settled into their home including taking them to see the ocean for the first time and procuring bread from a local afghan bakery so they would feel more at home she is now also working to help find jobs for the afghan refugees resettling in the seattle area the husband in the house now has a degree in computer science said johnson as he looks for jobs here it s difficult to make that transition so we re really hoping some of the big tech companies can step up and help people like him who have the education to work with them to get them employed the people that we are seeing are those who worked with u s military who are well educated and who are going to do a great deal to add to this country she said they will really be clearly adding to the culture and the economy and just the tapestry of the united states both johnson and the martinez family are volunteering their homes through world relief a christian humanitarian organization whose seattle office is working to resettle more than 100 afghan refugees who have arrived in the past month we have a pretty robust afghan community in the seattle area and most folks want to go where they have a tie either a family member or friend chitra hanstad executive director of world relief seattle said of why the area is experiencing such an uptick i think it also has to do with the welcoming nature of washington state it makes it a great place for people to land and there are a lot of job opportunities the afghan refugees arriving in the seattle area typically come with just a suitcase or two and just over 1 000 in hand through a u s government stipend to start their new lives according to hanstad from there world relief steps in to help provide housing and supplies to start their lives in the u s including gift cards to local stores so the families can pick out their own belongings the organization also provides long term support like job placement child care social activities and language classes we read research that you can learn language faster if you re doing something that you re good at or want to do so we started an afghan women s sewing class and teach english through sewing said hanstad adding that the class also helps with the isolation refugees often feel we do it in a cohort model so these women get to know another group of women really well through those weeks of sewing hanstad said there has been a huge uptick recently of donations for afghan refugees but she worries about the months and years ahead as the refugees continue to build their lives in the u s i ve been doing this work for years and i ve seen that crises are short lived people move on to the next thing she said really what we need desperately is funding so we can be flexible and agile the huge need for help for afghan refugees has prompted companies in the private sector to step up and help too airbnb org for example is providing temporary housing to 20 000 afghan refugees worldwide working with the international rescue committee to place refugees in housing available for rent cameron steele a 30 year old in arlington virginia found out in late august that his airbnb property in sacramento california would be rented via airbnb org and the international rescue committee to house a refugee family as he told his friends about the booking an idea grew of how they could help the incoming afghan family one of my friends said if the family needs anything let me know i m happy to support said steele that sparked an idea and i posted on facebook and instagram that i d be hosting a family and if anyone wanted to i d make sure 100 was given to the family donations started pouring in mostly in small amounts like 5 and 10 according to steele steele s sister ashley frost who lives in sacramento and helps him manage the airbnb property used the support to stock the house with supplies and leave the family a gift card so they could shop on their own she spent hours collecting all the stuff for the family with the money that was given steele said of frost she went with her two daughters my nieces so it was neat to see her involving them in the process when the first afghan family moved on to more permanent housing and a second family moved in this week steele was also able to give them gift cards and supplies it s so difficult to leave everything you know even if you know the opportunity is better for your kids and your family said steele who saw it firsthand through his girlfriend and her family who are armenian and immigrated to the u s i know it s not easy at all so it s cool to just play a little role in adding some humanness to this whole experience and really showing them what we re about steele said that in addition to helping them start their lives he hopes the act of leaving donations for the afghan families helps make them feel more at home in america little things like this hopefully make you feel like you made the right decision and you re in the right place and it gives you hope and that s what we all need he said is a challenging thing for a lot of people both for people moving here and for people feeling like people are coming into their communities but it s part of the american dream and the foundation of who we are as a country as a people for this country specifically we were all immigrants once said steele copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

how the company has positively responded to the extraordinarily volatile market over the past year and a half despite these challenges we continued our focus on delivering cash dividends to shareholders we have now paid almost 75 million in cash dividends since inception of the dividend program in december 2013 we have diversified and substantially enhanced our assets by completing the acquisition of a non operated ownership interest in barnett shale natural gas assets in may 2021 strong operating results improved commodity prices and the acquired production volumes have allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend by 50 as of the september 30 2021 payment additionally we more than doubled our fiscal 2020 year end proved reserves from 10 2 mmboe to 23 4 mmboe which has extended our ability to support the higher dividend rate for years mr brown concluded as we look to the future we expect to continue to benefit from the improved price environment particularly for natural gas as we generate strong cash flow from our newly diversified portfolio and continue to pay out meaningful dividends to our shareholders with this second acquisition we have shown our ability to execute on accretive acquisitions and we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to further grow our asset base and reserves financial and operational results for the quarter ended june 30 2021 evolution reported total revenue for the fourth quarter of 13 7 million oil revenue increased 20 to 8 5 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a 16 increase in commodity price natural gas

delhi natural gas revenue was 2 6 million compared to insignificant revenues in the prior quarter with the increase also driven by inclusion of approximately two months of results from the barnett shale asset acquisition total production for the fourth quarter was 4 378 boepd an increase of 156 over the prior quarter due primarily to the barnett shale acquisition fourth quarter production was comprised of 1 498 barrels per day bopd of oil 1 116 boepd of ngls and 1 764 boepd of natural gas production costs increased to 7 6 million from 3 6 million in the prior quarter driven by the barnett shale acquisition and increased co 2 costs at delhi co 2 purchases are contributing to the increase in costs as the co 2 purchase price is based on oil price despite these increases production costs per boe decreased 19 to 19 02 the newly acquired barnett shale assets have driven down the cost per boe significantly due to the lower cost nature of the natural gas wells depletion depreciation and amortization dd a expense increased 24 to 1 3 million quarter over quarter due to the increase in production during the current quarter primarily attributable to the barnett shale acquisition on a per boe basis the company s dd a rate decreased to 3 13 or 53 compared to the prior quarter this decrease on a per boe basis is driven by the 129 increase in proved reserves with the closing of the barnett shale acquisition the company s general and administrative g a expenses were 1 8 million for the quarter a decrease of 2 from the prior quarter the decrease in g a was primarily due to acquisition related legal and tax expenses incurred in the prior quarter net income for the quarter was 2 2 million or 0 07 per diluted share compared to 1 2 million or 0 04 per diluted share in the prior quarter this increase was primarily driven by an increase in income from operations of 1 6 related to the barnett shale asset acquired during the current quarter financial and operational

was comprised of 1 520 bopd of oil 470 boepd of ngls and 440 boepd of natural gas the increase in production from the prior year was primarily due to the acquisition of the barnett shale assets and strong base performance at hamilton dome production costs for the year totaled 16 6 million compared to 13 5 million in the prior year the increase in total production costs was primarily due to a full year of production costs at hamilton dome field in fiscal 2021 compared to eight months of production costs in fiscal 2020 following the acquisition in november 2019 and the acquisition of the barnett shale assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 production costs per boe for the year were 18 70 per boe compared to 18 13 per boe in the prior year the increase in production costs per boe was primarily due to the decrease in production at delhi during the current year dd a expense decreased 10 to 5 2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 5 8 million for fiscal 2020 on a per boe basis the company s dd a rate per boe decreased 26 compared to the prior year this decrease on a per boe basis is driven by the 129 increase in proved reserves due to the closing of the barnett shale acquisition total g a for fiscal 2021 increased 1 5 million or 28 to 6 8 million from the prior year the increase is primarily due to higher legal and professional fees of 0 8 million related to consulting on various potential business transactions an increase in accrued bonus expense of 0 5 million and an increase in salaries of 0 2 million due to additional employees the company reported a net loss for the year ended june 30 2021 of 16 4 million or 0 49 per diluted share compared to net income of 5 9 million or 0 18 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year primarily driven by 24 8 million in pre tax proved property impairments in the current year the impairments were a result of extremely low commodity prices during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 that temporarily and severely reduced the carrying value of our reserves in addition evolution s income tax provision benefit increased primarily due to a pre tax loss in the current period compared to pre tax income in the prior year during the fiscal year 2020 the company recorded a 2 8 million income tax benefit related to enhanced oil recovery credits claimed on income tax returns for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 operations update net production at delhi in the current quarter was 121 911 boe a 3 increase compared to 118 558 boe in the prior quarter oil production was significantly impacted by materially lower co 2 purchases when the co 2 purchase pipeline upstream of delhi field was shut in for repairs in late february until october 2020 when limited purchases were resumed the loss of co 2 purchases coupled with the decline in oil prices led to the operator electing to freeze non essential capital projects through the end of calendar year 2020 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the operator resumed limited capital conformance projects within the field the average oil price realized by evolution at the delhi field during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 64 68 compared to 56 02 during

bbls in the current quarter compared to 35 179 bbls in the prior quarter due to the operator restoring previously shut in production and maintenance within the field there were limited capital expenditures in the field during fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of the decrease in oil prices most projects in the field focused on maintenance or restoring shut in production the average oil price realized by evolution at hamilton dome during the fourth quarter was 55 93 compared to 46 61 during the previous quarter an increase of 20 production from this field is transported by pipeline to customers and is priced on the western canadian select index which generally trades at a discount to wti net production at barnett shale was 240 009 boe for the current quarter blackbeard operating the primary barnett shale operator has yet to formalize a budget through 2022 as they sold their interests to diversified energy company in july 2021 barnett shale acquisition on may 7 2021 the company closed on substantially all of the previously announced acquisition of non operated oil and natural gas assets in the barnett shale for 18 3 million net of preliminary purchase price adjustments a portion of the non operated dry gas working interests were excluded from the transaction due to potential title defects that the seller was unable to timely cure upon resolution of the

mmboe at year ended june 30 2020 although both delhi and hamilton dome had positive revisions net of production the majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of non operated interests in the

year ended june 30 2021 approximately 65 were liquids 36 crude oil and 29 ngls and 35 natural gas at fiscal year end approximately 92 of proved reserves were classified as proved developed producing and 8 as proved undeveloped probable and possible reserves the probable and possible reserves are categories that represent potential recoveries from the co 2 flood developed in the delhi field greater than those included in the proved reserves consequently while the probable and possible reserves are 85 and 91 developed respectively and require de minimis capital expenditures they remain less certain of attainment and have more risk of recovery than proved reserves and should not be aggregated with other categories these categories of reserves reflect the incremental reserves associated with different engineering assumptions with respect to the percentage of original oil in place that can be recovered through co 2 enhanced oil recovery probable and possible reserves decreased approximately 1 and 8 respectively from the prior year primarily due to the movement of probable and possible reserves to the proved reserves category as a result of a positive change to the proved reserves life at delhi cash dividend on common stock in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition of the non operated oil and natural gas assets in the barnett shale and the continuing improvement in commodity prices the board of directors declared an increased quarterly cash dividend payable june 30 2021 of 0 05 per share of common stock which represents a 67 increase from the

million as of june 30 2021 working capital decreased 8 6 million from the prior quarter to 11 5 million compared to 20 1 million at march 31 2021 this decrease is primarily attributable to the barnett

statement our reserves as of june 30 2021 were estimated by degolyer macnaughton a global independent reservoir engineering firm all reserve estimates are continually subject to revisions based on production history results of additional exploration and development price changes and other factors the sec s current rules allow oil and natural gas companies to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable and possible reserves that meet the sec s definitions of such terms estimates of probable and possible reserves by their nature are much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves these non proved reserve categories are subject to greater uncertainties and the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk when estimating the amount of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids recoverable from a particular reservoir probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered generally described as having a 50 probability of recovery possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10 or greater probability of being recovered these three reserve categories have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not

andreypopov istock new york kenneth and adi martinez have an extra bedroom in the home they share outside of seattle with their 6 month old son and 3 year old daughter so when the martinezes watched the coverage of tens of thousands of people fleeing afghanistan last month as the taliban took over they stepped up to help the martinezes opened their extra bedroom to a family of four who left afghanistan with all of their belongings packed in a few bags the mother is pregnant with her third child they they were in the airplane when one of their friends contacted them and said the taliban came said adi martinez i m pretty sure their flight was one of the last to leave before the chaos began for the past month the two families from different parts of the world have assimilated living and cooking together and watching their young children play together even as they speak different languages the martinezes have helped the family adjust to life in seattle including buying them coats and shoes to adjust to the cold even though we may think we don t have a lot we have an extra bedroom we have the means and the resources and the ability to help said kenneth martinez we are happy that we can help the biden administration said as many as 95 000 refugees are expected to resettle in the united states from afghanistan over the next year u s military and diplomatic personnel withdrew from afghanistan on aug 31 ending america s 20 years of war in the country to be able to respond to the demand the nine national u s refugee resettlement agencies that lead the process are having to work with community partners to find housing according to kristen aster director of client and community engagement with the international rescue committee irc one of the nine agencies in some cases people like the martinez family are opening their homes for free to afghan refugees in other cases local companies and individuals are offering places to rent given the large numbers of folks who are arriving right now we are working with community members and private resources to have interim solutions said aster that s definitely been a great and critical lifeline as we work with these families to find them more permanent housing then we work with the families to help them find jobs to enroll their kids in school and access medical care to learn english to get connected with volunteers and others in the community to help them navigate life in the united states she said all of that is with the goal of helping families to be self sufficient and integrated as soon as possible the martinezes said their christian faith as well as their own experience motivated them to help the couple immigrated to the united states from mexico in 2011 when kenneth martinez was offered a job with microsoft we know exactly what it feels like to come to a brand new country with no family or anything he said we know it can be difficult and in the case it s very difficult for fawn johnson a real estate developer in nearby seattle the realization she could help afghan families in need came as she was watching news coverage of them fleeing their home country on u s military aircraft one of homes became vacant in july and as we saw more and more about what was going on in afghanistan we decided we wanted to use it to help refugees she said this was one thing we could actually put our hands on and personally do something about johnson is now donating her property to be used as a temporary landing spot for refugees until they are able to move to more permanent housing when johnson and her son and daughter who work in the family business asked for help from family and friends a team of more than 100 volunteers stepped up to renovate the house in a matter of weeks and stock it with food clothing household supplies and toys a family of three including an 18 month old boy arrived at the home on aug 23 and johnson and other volunteers were there to greet them we helped them carry in their luggage and they came in with everything they had she said it really hit us the few things that they brought with them and how we could carry of all that in just a trip or two describing the toddler s reaction to his new home in the u s johnson recalled the first thing he did when he came in was go right to where the toys are and he saw a ball his father said that he loves balls and that he had one in kabul that he had to leave behind johnson has stayed in touch with the family as they have settled into their home including taking them to see the ocean for the first time and procuring bread from a local afghan bakery so they would feel more at home she is now also working to help find jobs for the afghan refugees resettling in the seattle area the husband in the house now has a degree in computer science said johnson as he looks for jobs here it s difficult to make that transition so we re really hoping some of the big tech companies can step up and help people like him who have the education to work with them to get them employed the people that we are seeing are those who worked with u s military who are well educated and who are going to do a great deal to add to this country she said they will really be clearly adding to the culture and the economy and just the tapestry of the united states both johnson and the martinez family are volunteering their homes through world relief a christian humanitarian organization whose seattle office is working to resettle more than 100 afghan refugees who have arrived in the past month we have a pretty robust afghan community in the seattle area and most folks want to go where they have a tie either a family member or friend chitra hanstad executive director of world relief seattle said of why the area is experiencing such an uptick i think it also has to do with the welcoming nature of washington state it makes it a great place for people to land and there are a lot of job opportunities the afghan refugees arriving in the seattle area typically come with just a suitcase or two and just over 1 000 in hand through a u s government stipend to start their new lives according to hanstad from there world relief steps in to help provide housing and supplies to start their lives in the u s including gift cards to local stores so the families can pick out their own belongings the organization also provides long term support like job placement child care social activities and language classes we read research that you can learn language faster if you re doing something that you re good at or want to do so we started an afghan women s sewing class and teach english through sewing said hanstad adding that the class also helps with the isolation refugees often feel we do it in a cohort model so these women get to know another group of women really well through those weeks of sewing hanstad said there has been a huge uptick recently of donations for afghan refugees but she worries about the months and years ahead as the refugees continue to build their lives in the u s i ve been doing this work for years and i ve seen that crises are short lived people move on to the next thing she said really what we need desperately is funding so we can be flexible and agile the huge need for help for afghan refugees has prompted companies in the private sector to step up and help too airbnb org for example is providing temporary housing to 20 000 afghan refugees worldwide working with the international rescue committee to place refugees in housing available for rent cameron steele a 30 year old in arlington virginia found out in late august that his airbnb property in sacramento california would be rented via airbnb org and the international rescue committee to house a refugee family as he told his friends about the booking an idea grew of how they could help the incoming afghan family one of my friends said if the family needs anything let me know i m happy to support said steele that sparked an idea and i posted on facebook and instagram that i d be hosting a family and if anyone wanted to i d make sure 100 was given to the family donations started pouring in mostly in small amounts like 5 and 10 according to steele steele s sister ashley frost who lives in sacramento and helps him manage the airbnb property used the support to stock the house with supplies and leave the family a gift card so they could shop on their own she spent hours collecting all the stuff for the family with the money that was given steele said of frost she went with her two daughters my nieces so it was neat to see her involving them in the process when the first afghan family moved on to more permanent housing and a second family moved in this week steele was also able to give them gift cards and supplies it s so difficult to leave everything you know even if you know the opportunity is better for your kids and your family said steele who saw it firsthand through his girlfriend and her family who are armenian and immigrated to the u s i know it s not easy at all so it s cool to just play a little role in adding some humanness to this whole experience and really showing them what we re about steele said that in addition to helping them start their lives he hopes the act of leaving donations for the afghan families helps make them feel more at home in america little things like this hopefully make you feel like you made the right decision and you re in the right place and it gives you hope and that s what we all need he said is a challenging thing for a lot of people both for people moving here and for people feeling like people are coming into their communities but it s part of the american dream and the foundation of who we are as a country as a people for this country specifically we were all immigrants once said steele copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

the odd one out amongst the three big chinese ev startups is li auto contrary to nio and xpeng they don t make a fully electrical car but one with a range extender instead the large one suv is only half of li auto s founder li xiang s vision for new mobility but the other half never reached the market advertisement li xiang a particular character the product is not the only thing that sets li auto apart from its two main competitors also the story of its founder is slightly different li xiang is born in shijiazhuang hebei province in 1981 in a middle class family so he is a bit younger than li bin nio and he xiaopeng xpeng in high school he is an unremarkable student certainly not top of his class he finds his passion at home when he discovers the mighty internet li starts his first trials while still in high school my teachers and relatives thought i was good for nothing because my academic performance was poor so i started a personal website to avoid being looked down on li states on his weibo in 2019 soon he makes more money than his parents and his teachers so he decides to drop out of school instead of taking a college entrance exam his home project becomes a business in 1999 a website called pcpop com advertisement a very young li xiang on the right this is the first time li shows a strong determination to do things his own way where li bin is viewed as the friendly leader and he xiaopeng as the technology geek li xiang s personality is far more polarizing on the on hand admired for being focused and visionary on the other hand criticized as rude and clumsy in some of his social media outings no wonder li is often called the chinese elon musk the internet business pcpop is a retail and advertising platform for consumer electronics like mobile phones li relies on hard work to beat the competition he gets up very early in the morning to search the web for new products and better deals he wants to be first to offer every new product and service and it the strategy pays off pcpop becomes a leading consumer electronics portal in the first years li runs the business from his parent s home but in 2002 he moves to beijing and rents a proper office it allows him to hire more staff and expand further looking for new areas for growth li takes on his other hobby cars he starts developing a section of pcpop dedicated to automotive electronics first and keeps adding more elements of automotive sector including the cars themselves in 2005 the automotive section becomes a pcpop channel called autohome and in 2007 the website is separated as stand alone company the target is clear become china s first resource for consumers when they re looking for a car want to buy one or just search for information advertisement although both internet companies achieve impressive initial growth li xiang s lack of experience as manager and entrepreneur starts to become apparent the websites do not return the revenues one would expect it s not until qin zhi an experienced harvard educated business manager joins autohome in early 2007 when things start to change qin lays out working procedures creates a marketing and sales strategy and turns the company into a far more professional operation revenues multiply by several times and qin takes over the ceo role as li acknowledges that he s better suited to the job a collection of li one s on a salt lake in 2008 the financial crisis has severe effects on the availability of money and advertisement budgets of companies the fast growing autohome company is suddenly in trouble as their income stream dries out qin decides to sell 55 of pcpop and autohome to telstra an australian marketing and telecommunications company now li has not just lost the ceo position he also lost control of his company still in a resurgent car market following the crisis autohome continues to grow as before and soon all targets are met autohome is now the largest news site the largest online car community and the largest online reseller in china in 2013 autohome gets listed on the new york stock exchange making telstra and several autohome managers very happy telstra sells its remaining shares three years later to ping an a chinese insurance company by then both qin and li are no longer connected to autohome qin makes a career within telstra but opposes the sale to ping an when it goes ahead he gives up his position as autohome director and leaves the company li leaves autohome almost a year earlier he is making new plans 2014 the year 2014 proves to be a pivotal year for li xiang there are two events that set him on his future course first he takes delivery of his tesla model s actually he is one of a dozen or so celebrities that get one of the very first tesla s delivered to china in an event attended by elon musk himself li already contemplated getting involved with new energy vehicles in some way or another and the tesla convinces him it can be done properly things get more real when li bin invites him to become co founder of nio li xiang seriously considers the opportunity but in the end declines the offer after conversations with li bin he suspects the two will have conflicting ideas about the future electric cars still li xiang does like li bin s initiative enough to become one of the early investors with a few million dollars from his own money a year later li xiang quits autohome and sets up beijing chehejia information technology in april of 2015 now he has his own car company sev and suv while li bin and nio follow the tesla master plan starting with expensive ev s and working their way down to mainstream models li xiang has a totally different approach he sees his new company growing on two very different models initially codenamed sev and suv the sev is a small urban mobility solution and the suv a large long range car for intercity commuting beijing chehejia which translates as car and home by the way starts the development of the sev first in china lsevs low speed electric vehicles are a special kind of vehicle the cars have very simple technology are powered by motor of approximately 4 kw and usually have lead acid batteries as energy storage no license is needed to drive such a lsev in certain regions of the country they enjoy great popularity because they are condoned by local authorities legally they are not allowed on most roads and they are very cheap at the time analysts and li xiang as well expect the central government to adopt a set of nationwide regulations for these vehicles based on new eu rules for such cars and make them legal chehejia develops its sev according to these eu rules but the design is far removed from the ultra cheap lsevs the chinese are used to the sev is modern looking two seater with the passenger sitting behind the driver similar to the renault twizy with modern technology like up to date motors and a removable lithium battery that can be taken from the car and charged inside the owners house although the sev should be available for private buyers li xiang is mainly targeting car sharing and ride hailing services chehejia even reaches an agreement for a joint venture with didi china s largest taxi service company in 2018 but the plan falls through shortly afterwards chehejia sev 1 of 8 it turns out that the central government is not forthcoming with legalization of the lsev category it s a proper setback for chehejia the company has built a modern production facility in changzhou jiangsu province and already started some low scale trial production of the sev in the first half of 2018 chehejia however completely writes off the project and sells all the assets including prototypes battery packs and intellectual property to third parties interestingly the sev has never reappeared under a different brand name it means it s back to square one for chehejia and they have to pull forward their suv project this is an entirely different car 5 meters long and seating six or seven people the one before we get the car let s take a look at the corporate developments first already in 2017 chehejia begins preparing an international ipo by setting up chehejia technologies in the cayman islands the overseas entity takes control of the chinese operations through a hong kong subsidiary and establishes a variable interest enterprise vie with beijing chehejia we ve seen this structure before with nio and others it s meant to allow foreign investment in a chinese company that s restricted by chinese law in 2019 chehejia technologies renames itself leading ideal inc this is of course a rather bold name for a starting company it s a translation of the chinese phrase lixiang zhizao note the founders name in the first part for a while the brand name is leading ideal as well but in 2020 the company abbreviates it to li auto while the company is renamed to li auto inc in chinese the brand is often referred to as lixiang back to the car li reveals the one as it call its first model in april 2019 and production starts in november actual deliveries commence in early 2020 the one is distinctively different from the offerings of nio and xpeng its two main competitors and ideological brothers where the other two at least try to portrait themselves as fully self developed li auto announces a number of high profile partnerships with suppliers like bosch borgwarner panasonic and valeo and second the one is not a fully electric car but a plug in hybrid or better a range extended ev like the chevrolet volt the one has a 40 kwh battery for an electric range of about 180 km and then there s a dongan 1 2 litre three cylinder turbocharged engine that acts as generator and does not drive the wheels the combined petrol electric range is 800 km far exceeding its chinese competitors with two electric motors the one is all wheel drive and packs a combined power of 240 kw li one 1 of 4 production takes place in the now finished changzhou factory as usual li auto has to acquire a production permit to be able to sell the cars it finds this permit with lifan a once popular privately owned car manufacturer based in chongqing lifan has two such permits one for each of its passenger car units in december 2018 li auto acquires one these units chonging lifan automobile before the transaction most assets are moved lifan s other car making business but the permit and a factory are part of the deal after li auto moves the permit to its holding company and transfers the plant to a new subsidiary the rest of lifan automobile is disposed of a slow success li auto is a relatively frugal company of course it s loss making up till now but less so than other startups initially li auto is funded by private investments meituan online retailer and bytedance software developer best known for the tiktok app are the most high profile ones but li auto didn t create the vie structure for nothing in july 2020 the company is listed on the american nasdaq exchange which brings in a billion dollars a second listing in hong kong follows earlier this year again bringing in a healthy amount of new funds contrary to his earlier enterprises li xiang still controls the majority of voting rights li auto s upcoming large suv with deliveries staring in the middle of the covid pandemic the li one makes a slow commercial start sales are okay at first but far behind nio and xpeng but slowly and steadily the car grows on the chinese audience and sales are increasing all the time to the point where li auto has caught up with nio and xpeng the one is an influential car as traditional competitors are introducing similar vehicles for instance dongfeng s new lantu voyah free and the huawei inside seres sf5 follow the same principle li xiang may have created a new automotive hype it s interesting to notice that the three new forces of chinese car manufacturing can co exist very well because they ve each chosen a different approach to the market nio focuses on the customer experience xpeng is the brand for technology freaks and li auto addresses range anxiety they all take a piece of the pie without too much direct competition for li auto the next step is an even bigger suv with more power and more space carnewschina has showed you the spyshots already it will be another range extended ev and with slightly more relaxed governments regulations on plug in hybrids since this year li auto may postpone the transition to fully electric cars for a little while longer

of the finished products such as cars computers phones etc source sunright limited corporate website after burn in a semiconductor device is tested to determine if it operates as intended at the same time the device is graded for its quality by testing the electrical characteristics and determining if it is operating within specified limits and functions source sunright limited corporate website overall both processes are critical within the production process of semiconductors beyond the company s production capabilities this stock warrants a second look for investors and we will unveil them layer by layer source sunright 1h fy2021 result press release for 1h fy2021 sunright s revenue declined slightly by 3 year on year to s 58 69 million mr samuel lim executive chairman chief executive officer explained in the first six months of this financial year we saw strong design wins with higher loadings for computing businesses consequently the additional volume compensated for the lower loadings from our customers in the automotive sector despite the lower revenue net profit attributable to owners of the company surged by more than 400 year on year to s 1 28 million this can be seen from the lower employee benefits expense and depreciation of property plant and equipment in terms of outlook mr lim highlighted the on going remote working environment and distance learning drove demands for personal computers laptops tablets as a result of the global covid pandemic we are seeing a continuing flow in demands from 5g a i and icloud markets with the coronavirus pandemic in better control as vaccination programs are rolling out our products and services should benefit under more stable market conditions source shareinvestor webpro the single largest shareholder for sunright is mr samuel lim syn soo holding a 54 93 stake as the co founder of the company he currently also holds the position of executive chairman chief executive officer with his strong background of 45 years in the semiconductor industry coupled with his stake in the company investors can be assured that he has the capabilities knowledge and interest to ensure that the company is well positioned for growth source shareinvestor webpro sunright has been in a net cash position over the years even so its total debt to equity has been generally on a declining trend to just 0 17 times in fy2020 this is a good sign as it proves that sunright is not heavily leveraged to further expand our dive into its financial health sunright s liquidity ratios reflects that the company is financially stable given the high current ratio and in particular cash ratio the ratio for fy2020 stood at 1 40 times which indicates that its cash on hand exceeds its total current liabilities to give a sense of comparison avi tech electronics limited sgx bky the closest competitor of sunright is trading at s 0 39 with a cash ratio of 2 58 times and current ratio of 7 65 times source sunright 1h fy2021 result announcement based on the latest figure for 1h fy2021 sunright has s 99 21 million worth of cash and short term deposits in its balance sheet if we offset its total loan and borrowings its net cash amount would be s 86 93 million this amount alone is significantly higher than its current market capitalisation of s 55 87 million and it implies that investors are investing in the company at a discount to its net cash amount on hand and its business operations for free sunright holds a 48 4 stake in malaysia listed firm kesm industries berhad kesm based on the current market price its stake is worth around rm250 73 million s 80 70 million and this amount exceeds the entire market value of sunright source shareinvestor webpro kesm is the largest independent provider of burn in testing and electronic manufacturing services in malaysia if we add up its net cash amount the stake in kesm and assuming its business at zero value the implied value of sunright should be around s 1 36 here s the calculations according to a report by transparency market research the market size for the global wafer level test and burn in wltbi market is estimated to exceed us 5 6 billion by 2031 expanding at a compound annual growth rate cagr of around 4 the growth in the wltbi market can be attributed to the increasing usage of semiconductors in both automotive and telecom sectors overall these factors will help to boost the wltbi market size in the long run comparing with sunright s fy2020 revenue of just s 110 62 million this presents a huge growth opportunity for sunright to capture market share in the wltbi market with its current share price trading below its implied value this shows that the market is giving a huge discount for sunright the strong net cash position and the company s stake in kesm alone should warrant its share price to trade at a higher valuation more importantly sunright s business operations are churning out positive profit as mentioned above and therefore its business should be worth a certain value

it had the shortest average time to approval of lenders surveyed at just six days and 85 per cent of the time it picked up a mortgage file for the first time within just one to two days anz by comparison picked up files for the first time this quickly just 3 per cent of the time speed is always in for mortgage borrowers but it particularly matters in the type of housing market we ve seen over the last 15 months or so which has been characterised by high prices and intense competition for a lower than usual levels of stock when borrowers are infected with fomo fear of missing out they most certainly do not want to be waiting around while their bank dawdles the macquarie survey shows fomo is manifesting in other ways that will give regulators pause while the australian prudential regulatory authority and the reserve bank have repeatedly stressed that their job is not to push house prices one way or another both bodies are watching the housing market closely for signs of dangerous overheating borrowers going fast and going hard brokers told macquarie that on a weighted average basis about 38 per cent of customers borrowed close to their maximum capacity in the 2021 financial year while this is down slightly from 40 per cent in 2020 and up on the 35 per cent seen in 2019 it still suggests a good proportion of borrowers are stretching themselves as far as they can go macquarie estimates that the borrowing capacity of owner occupiers rose by about 7 per cent in 2021 and about 5 per cent across the major banks thanks mainly to lower interest rates advertisement but borrowing capacity in australia remains very elevated compared to the rest of the world macquarie says australian banks were prepared to lend at about 7 times a borrower s gross income which is much higher than the 4 2 times to 5 2 times seen across britain the united states canada and sweden or as macquarie also put it australian banks continue to offer their clients between 35 per cent and 65 per cent more credit than their global peers this is what apra and the rba will be focused on as credit growth surges in the banking sectors are borrowers starting to stretch themselves beyond their means apra s own statistics show that 22 per cent of loans in the june quarter had a debt to income ratio equal to or greater than 6 times up from about 16 per cent last year the regulator might not want to control house prices but macquarie s view continues to be that some sort of macroprudential intervention is likely this could take the form of an increase to the serviceability buffers that banks use to stress test a borrower s ability to live with their mortgage the current buffer sits about 2 5 per cent over the loan s interest rate or around a 5 per cent loan rate in total or it could involve other tactics such as restricting the growth of high loan to value ratios advertisement regulators election conundrum evans and partners banking analyst matthew wilson says cba s move to increase serviceability buffers by 15 basis points shows some banks are prepared to get ahead of the prudential curve but with the recent large and unusual swings in market share it s unlikely others will follow quickly or more to the point without apra making them change their approach but wilson also raises an interesting question around the timing of any policy intervention in the housing market arguing apra and the rba find themselves caught between a bloated housing market and the politics of an impending federal election where the idea of trying to push down house prices might not exactly thrill voters he also cites average home loan sizes and high household debt levels as another reason the rba will be very cautious about lifting rates very quickly or very far macquarie s numbers emphasise this it says australia s most indebted households who have borrowed at their maximum capacity have an interest burden of 19 per cent interest as a percentage of pre tax income compared to global peers at about 11 per cent rba governor philip lowe made it very clear in a speech on tuesday that the central bank won t use rates to cool housing indeed it is unlikely to touch rates for three years but he did emphasise regulators are discussing possible regulatory steps if lending standards deteriorate or credit growth accelerates too much the question of how to cool the housing market without hurting the economy won t be easy for these regulators to solve

forward looking statements are based upon information available to the company on the date they are published and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or new information after the date of this release note regarding use of non gaap financial measures to supplement our condensed financial statements presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap this earnings release and the accompanying tables and the related earnings conference call contain certain non gaap financial measures including adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share non gaap eps we believe these financial measures provide useful information to investors with which to analyze our operating trends and performance in computing adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap eps we exclude stock based compensation expense which represents non cash charges for the fair value of stock options and other non cash awards granted to employees acquisition related costs and expenses and severance for adjusted ebitda we also exclude depreciation amortization and provision for income taxes because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company s non cash operating expenses we believe that providing non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash expense and non recurring costs and expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time our adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap eps measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry as other companies in our industry may calculate non gaap financial results differently particularly related to non recurring unusual items our adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap eps are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap we do not consider these non gaap measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial results a reconciliation of specific adjustments to gaap results is provided in the last two tables at the end of this press release contacts rf industries ltd peter yin svp cfo 858 549 6340

a local food bank for residents in the p t barnum apartments complex in bridgeport credit allison minto connecticut public dione dwyer lives in bridgeport s largest public housing complex p t barnum apartments she remembers moving in 19 years ago and just being thankful for something to call her own at the time she was a single mother to two young daughters and had no stable income she had been living with her father a real estate investor and was tired of moving around i found out about public housing through a friend when she told me about it i had no idea where to find it to be honest said dwyer 44 she applied and was approved in a few weeks she said and the first apartment she was offered she took i thought it would be a good place to start getting back on my feet something to level me out so i could provide for my kids dwyer said her rent was based on 30 of her gross income but over time dwyer came to realize that her three bedroom apartment for her family wasn t that great of a deal she lives just a short walk from an asphalt plant a recycling plant and a garbage disposal plant the complex built in the late 1900s is not a comfortable living arrangement dwyer said she said there are problems with maintenance conflicts among residents and a lack of the kind of support she thinks would help her family still she s been there 19 years and she says finding anything remotely affordable in fairfield county is hard it might have saved me as far as not being homeless but at the same time i m stuck here i can t get out dwyer said a new report funded in part by the connecticut department of housing has found that dwyer is not alone it says connecticut is short more than 86 000 rental units for residents like her in the 0 30 area median income area median income is determined by the u s department of housing and urban development about a third of the shortage is in fairfield county this isn t surprising this is one of the most expensive real estate counties in the country said christie stewart one of the researchers behind the findings and director of the fairfield county s center for housing opportunity more than half of residents in fairfield county are already cost burdened or pay more than 30 of their income on housing costs and where the rent eats first many are left to cut back on food health care and other necessities stewart said the result of high housing costs is that many low wage earners can only afford housing in just four out of the 23 municipalities in the region fairfield county has four urban centers in danbury stamford norwalk and bridgeport there s a disproportionate share of residents at the 0 to 30 area median income and we don t get a proportional share of the state investment stewart said for folks who live in those urban centers and are barely able to get by they live in overcrowded housing they live in old housing stock some are doubled up pregnant with opportunity but stewart says connecticut is in a good place to start chipping away at the issue and her organization is one of over 50 housing organizations calling on the state to use once in a lifetime federal funds to build more housing stewart said advocates estimate the state has hundreds of thousands of dollars left over from the american rescue plan act the federal stimulus package gave connecticut more than 6 billion to help the state recover from pandemic related impacts a majority of the money has already been allocated to local health departments covid relief education and more so far around 35 million has been allocated to some housing concerns including support to level the playing field in housing court for those at risk of eviction but there is no money set aside for more permanent housing solutions to address affordability this moment is pregnant with opportunity for fairfield county and the state on the housing front we have the data and we have the baseline we just need the public will and leadership to take the next step stewart said the funds could be used to incentivize private developers or be put into a housing trust fund on the state level the trust fund could then be used to fund projects in municipalities with the greatest need the connecticut general assembly was expected to convene for a special session this fall to discuss the leftover federal dollars but speaker of the house matt ritter told connecticut public radio that s not likely ritter said the money already allocated hasn t been distributed completely so the legislature will probably hold off on allocating more but he understands the importance of affordability the definition of affordable housing in fairfield county is not really affordable for a lot of people so we have a lot of work to do here in connecticut ritter said if funds from the american rescue plan were allocated to housing on the state level they couldn t go toward public housing as it s already funded by federal dollars but they could increase the overall housing stock which would be a plus for dione dwyer if we have more affordable housing across the state it s a win win for all residents and public housing complexes said dwyer whose yearly income is around 20 000 with rents for a multi bedroom apartment nearing 2 000 in fairfield county it s no surprise she s felt defeated every time she has tried to go apartment hunting she added it s like a lottery dwyer said describing the likelihood of finding something outside of public housing beyond the money but more money won t fix the issue completely especially in fairfield county we need a narrative shift stewart said it s human nature to not like change but this false dichotomy that some will lose if others win is really doing some damage over the years many affordable housing developments have been met by opposition from residents and local planning and zoning boards in fairfield county from fairfield to westport public hearings for affordable housing developments have made headlines after residents expressed concerns about sizing overcrowding and fear of change to the character of the municipality the pushback is largely because people don t realize who needs affordable housing stewart said when we talk about affordable housing we re talking about housing that is affordable to your neighbors and the people that make up the community that you live in stewart added it s fair housing options for the people that teach your children or keep your streets safe it s housing for your aging parents or children when they come back from college kathy falandys in her home in a mixed income affordable housing complex in fairfield on aug 12 2021 credit ryan caron king connecticut public lifelong fairfield resident kathy falandys is an example of who benefits from affordable housing born and raised in fairfield falandys said she never wanted to leave her hometown and when she had her two children she did everything she could to stay this is what i grew up with and i wanted them to have the same falandys said so i worked my whole life i lived paycheck to paycheck i was so thankful i could pay my bills at the start of the month but then i was broke she said her rent was always her biggest expense and she remembers paying up to 2 000 for rent over the years i needed to make arrangements with electric and gas monthly to keep the utilities on she said she said that was her reality for most of her life up until now falandys lives at pine tree apartments a mixed income affordable housing complex in fairfield with about half of its units reserved for low to very low income residents renovated five years ago her one bedroom apartment has an accessible bathroom energy efficient washer and dryer and a modern kitchen with appliances they met every need she said and for the first time i have reserve savings at 72 years old after years of working she relies on just her social security benefits and pays 167 a month in rent falandys said she s blessed to have an affordable option in the town she loves so much but knows she s one of the lucky ones there needs to be more information about affordable housing everyone knows someone who needs affordable housing it s for seniors young families and professionals falandys said stewart said that s the kind of stability needed across the region if this is kicked down the road i think low income families are going to be pushed out completely their only options are going to be substandard overcrowded options or not living here at all stewart said we ll have an economic shock in fairfield county felt across the state the hope is the state takes action one way or another but at the very least stewart said the report should help all residents realize that affordability is a concern for all and affordable housing isn t affordable if the most vulnerable income bands are left out

take private activity reached a decade high in the first half of 2021 fueled by large sums of dry powder and heated competition for assets the takeover of supermarket chain morrison s the fourth largest in the uk has caused something of a stir the uk based supermarket chain is the subject of a bidding war between us based pe firm clayton dubilier rice cd r and a consortium led by fortress investment group after weeks of competing bids morrison s board agreed to a revised offer from cd r which gave the supermarket chain an enterprise value of us 14 billion the transaction is subject to shareholder approval with the possibility that the fortress led consortium could return with another offer the deal is among the largest public to private p2p transactions of 2021 so far it s also symbolic of a strategy that is back in vogue for private equity investors following a quiet period last year amid pandemic induced market volatility stock markets have become a prime source of deals for pe managers in recent years driven in part by their unstoppable ability to raise capital already in the first half of 2021 global take private deal activity involving pe firms totaled us 113 5 billion not only was this more than double the total seen in the previous six months us 50 7 billion it also represents the strongest half yearly value since h1 2007 which saw us 258 6 billion activity similarly the 46 transactions recorded in deal volume in the first six months of this year represents the highest half yearly total in ten years matching the 46 deals recorded in h1 2011 this level of activity has been fueled by pe firms access to capital dry powder currently sits somewhere in the region of us 2 trillion and competition for privately held assets has never been higher add special purpose acquisition companies spacs into the mix which have an estimated us 133 billion at their disposal not including leverage and pe is being pushed to look further and wider for opportunities value play the rising competition for privately held companies in recent years has made some listed assets look comparatively inexpensive even in coveted sectors such as technology there are relative bargains to be found the largest p2p in the first half of 2021 saw thoma bravo take proofpoint off the nasdaq exchange for us 12 3 billion or 11 7x the cybersecurity firm s 2020 revenues and that includes a 34 purchase premium for comparison the median revenue multiple of the bvp nasdaq emerging cloud index at the time of the deal was 18 6x proofpoint was loss making in 2020 making an earnings multiple valuation impossible and also making it difficult to compare against similar private deals however private assets are in many cases changing hands for eye watering multiples this is especially true for enterprise software and it service businesses an investment strategy backstopped by the change in working arrangements brought on by the pandemic by one estimate the median ev ebitda private equity deal multiple in the it sector topped 20x in 2020 twice the price paid a decade prior it is against this backdrop of rising multiples in the private domain that pe funds have sought to capitalize on public market arbitrage uk discounts pe firms will continue to seek out value where they can find it this is what makes the morrison s deal and the uk stock market more broadly so attractive a brexit weakened sterling has made assets attractive on a currency basis add to this the chilling effect that the uk s departure from the european union has had on its equity market indeed british stocks discount to global peers is the widest it has been in over three decades the ftse 100 continues to trade below pre pandemic levels while the stoxx europe 600 is up around 9 and the s p 500 more than 30 this is not a simple function of divergent company performance either the ftse is trading at around 12 6x forward earnings compared with 21x and 16 3x respectively for the aforementioned us and european benchmarks these fundamentals have fueled a surge of activity in the first half of 2021 that has included kkr s acquisition of infrastructure investment firm john laing group for us 2 8 billion and cd r s successful takeover of udg healthcare a uk listed healthcare advisory firm based in ireland for us 4 1 billion including net debt security concerns like the morrison s p2p ultra electronics delisting has caused a stir critics claim that the deal has the potential to undermine national security while the morrison s acquisition is seen by some as undermining the country s food security at a time when supply chains have come under immense pressure due to brexit and the pandemic at the onset of the health crisis european countries at the behest of the eu highlighted the need to scrutinize foreign direct investment into strategic sectors seen as critical for national security purposes it is a concern being felt in many markets germany canada and the uk have revealed new regimes to vet critical investments the uk government published its national security and investment bill in november which introduces a new review system for takeovers potentially giving rise to national security concerns it is anticipated that between 1 000 and 1 830 deal notifications will be triggered each year that is a significant increase on the fewer than 100 deals the competition and markets authority currently reviews the us is similarly watchful despite prior expectations that the biden administration may take a more lenient approach to inbound cross border investments under former president trump the committee on foreign investment in the us stepped up its deal screening efforts especially where capital from china was concerned not only have rigorous screenings continued under the current administration but bipartisan support for the strategic competition act of 2021 signals continued consensus to oppose efforts by china to undermine america s national security from a pure private equity standpoint heightened deal scrutiny is likely to affect markets outside of the us more than it does the us itself this is because the majority of cross border pe buyouts come from globally mandated funds based in the us and these are the deep pocketed sources of private capital equipped to make multi billion dollar take privates given the value dynamics that are still in play and the dry powder reserves available to private equity funds p2ps are likely to remain a theme for the foreseeable future but depending on the sector in question they could face greater regulatory headwinds than before

economynext sri lanka has run a balance of payments deficit of 2 755 billion us dollars up to july 2021 official data show a record high as historically high levels of liquidity was injected to expand unsustainable credit boost imports and also sterilize debt repayments in 2020 sri lanka ran a balance of payments deficit of 2 373 million us dollars the highest annual deficit in central bank history up to the time operating so called alternative or modern monetary theory policies to keep interest rates down sri lanka has had balance of payments or liquidity injections trouble even since a latin america style central bank modeled on the one in argentina was set up by a us money doctor in 1950 us money doctors set up similar central banks with sweeping money printing counter cyclical powers to suppress interest rates leading to chronic currency collapses followed by sovereign default and ultimately dollarization usually liquidity crises the full year 2020 bop deficit has now been exceeded in the first seven months of july 2021 a part of the bop deficit in 2021 closet to billion us dollars was triggered from liquidity injections left over from 2020 due which were used up as private credit picked up the bop deficit is approximately the fall in net international reserves which are progressively drawn down as outflows of foreign exchange exceed inflows foreign exchange shortage due to new money pumped into the banking system and the budget banks may loan the money from maturing bonds which are bought by the central bank after rejecting bids or new bonds bought to make coupon payment to borrowers who in turn will trigger imports when they are invested any new bills or bonds purchased by the central bank or standing deposit window money given to re finance state bank overdrafts to the treasury will be paid as salaries to state workers who will use the money to buy goods in the marketplace creating a foreign exchange shortage when importers replenish the stocks classical knowledge in the 1970s when sri lanka was mired in multiple trade and exchange controls the knowledge that treasury bill purchases from failed auctions triggered bop deficits had been known to at least one classical economist within the bank the responsibility of absorbing the unsubscribed portion of the treasury bills fell on the central bank the classical economist wrote in the 1975 anniversary publication of the monetary authority a major drawback in financing of budget deficits with central bank credit is that while the process involves an expansion in the money supply it is not necessarily accompanied by an expansion by a corresponding increase in national product consequently increased demand emanating from central bank financing of budget deficits had to be satisfied by increased recourse to foreign supplies with resulting pressure on the country s external payments thus though the government fiscal problem and the balance of payments deficits were two distinct problems they were nevertheless inter related in that the balance of payments deficits and loss of external assets arose partly out of the method by which the government sought to finance its deficits when liquidity is injected and bond auctions fail the government is also unable to generate real resources for itself by curtailing domestic credit leading to foreign reserves appropriation to repay foreign debt the reserves are released against t bills in a book transaction if no liquidity was injected and bond auctions do not fail the central bank would later be able to sell down the treasury bill taken to sell reserves to the treasury curtail domestic credit force a foreign exchange surplus and buy the dollars however when liquidity injections to keep interest rates down pressure the currency peg market participants also bet against the peg and or try to cover themselves against further currency falls these include exporters who pile up dollar deposits and borrow rupees made cheap by failed bond auctions and old people and pensioners who stock up on medicines fearing that they will not be imported in the future in sri lanka according to social media some member of the public are also stocking up on jockstraps and other underwear after import restrictions were slammed by outgoing central bank governor w d lakshman in the stock market inflationary expectations were also raised by the liquidity injections and currency instability firing an exporter or dollarized asset frenzy sri lanka last ran two successive years of deficit where the second year deficit was bigger than the first in 1999 and 2000 usually policy corrections are made to reduce liquidity injections after a bop deficit emerges in the first year the central bank hiked policy rates in august but it failed to bring the desired results as price controls on bill and bond auctions triggered more liquidity injections as auctions failed currency crisis tools over the past two decades the central bank has created liquidity injections or balance of payments crises in several ways analysts have shown in 2004 and 2008 liquidity was injected by rejecting real bids at bill auctions prior to that liquidity had also been injected by failing to roll over maturing central bank securities which analysts say is the preferred bop crisis method of argentina s central bank failure to roll over leliq and lebac sterilization securities in 2011 the liquidity injection crisis was created by failure to roll over term repo deals which is similar to failing to roll over sterilization securities as well as rejecting bids to bill auctions outright and keeping ramrod straight fixed bill yields over several months in 2015 and 2016 when bond auctions were not sold outside auctions liquidity was injected by initially failing to roll over term repo deals and keep overnight rates near the floor corridor because the usual tool of rejecting bids at auction was not available to inject liquidity authorities devised other methods to trigger monetary instability explains en s economic columnist bellwether after term repo deals ran out the currency peg was slapped with reverse repo and term reverse repo injections to generate excess liquidity until the rupee collapsed then bills were bought outright from banks later the bills only policy of a s jayewardene was jettisoned and bonds were also bought outright to inject liquidity monetize past deficits and manipulate rates deep into the yield curve rejecting bids for bond auctions also manipulates rates directly beyond overnight and discourages the financing of the deficit with real private sector savings in 2018 in addition to slamming the rupee peg with overnight injections and term repo injections a dollar rupee swap was also used around july to create liquidity when the budget deficit was brought down by purchasing long bonds outright the central bank also bought bonds outright and monetized past deficits turning existing securities in banks into reserve money so that the paper turned into liquidity and imports in 2020 bonds were bought outright outside of auctions auctions were failed with price controls and also a zimbabwe style private credit re finance program for covid 19 hit businesses and a mefo bills style contractor bill re finance programs were started to inject liquidity in 2021 the bop deficit came mostly from mostly failed auctions left over liquidity from 2020 and there were also sterilizations of reserve appropriations such as the july bond repayment the liquidity injections in 2020 and 2021 were so severe that the central bank is now running out of net foreign reserves and its reserve liabilities are going up colombo sept14 2021

author stewart nixon anu in august 2021 australia held its five yearly census of population and housing with responses providing crucial information on the backgrounds and characteristics of people present in australia despite the unusual pandemic context in which it took place the census provides a vital snapshot that will help shape and target government and non government policies in a broad range of areas among the foremost statistical collections in any country the census exemplifies the essential contribution of data to developing evidence based policy with coverage limited to persons in australia the census excludes australian citizens and residents overseas on census night the consequences of this have never been starker with globalisation contributing to a burgeoning diaspora and australia s pandemic borders leaving tens or hundreds of thousands of australians unwillingly abroad while government policies including social welfare tax housing and investment have long distinguished between residents and non residents the divide in outcomes is uniquely involuntary and historically unprecedented under pandemic measures from the statistician s perspective a focus on the population present rather than the legal or economic population reflects mostly practical considerations beyond the census which relies on identifying households australia counts arrivals and departures but does not routinely retain the addresses of australian households abroad outside of voluntary registrations with government agencies this not only presents challenges to the statistician but critically constrains policymakers attempting to support those overseas during a crisis there is precious little information on the size and distribution of australia s diaspora let alone its census equivalent characteristics united nations international migrant stock estimates for 2019 count around 577 000 australians among overseas populations with about half in europe a fifth in north america and almost 14 per cent in asia this undoubtedly represents a significant undercount with overseas census coverage citizenship definitions and dual citizenship all imparting a downwards bias anecdotally the diaspora is believed to be 1 million strong but this number has increased less than one would expect from a 2004 estimate of between 760 000 and 900 000 despite crossing into statistical anonymity australians living or working overseas and intending to return within six years retain non compulsory voting rights at the last federal election in 2019 less than 62 000 people exercised this right with this number including short term travellers that voting rights extinguish with non residency is itself a barrier to diaspora engagement one that goes together with the limited obligations governments owe overseas citizens pandemic border restrictions have highlighted australia s missing bill of rights and the unenforceable international commitments on which fundamental rights rely australia s handling of covid 19 is skewed along population present lines at the expense of australians abroad travel bans arrival caps and hotel quarantine are effective containment measures but they prioritise the welfare of residents over non residents government financial support cushions the blow for residents non residents face quarantine charges inflated airfares and other expenses resulting from policy uncertainty and a reluctance to expand quarantine capacity the vaccination rollout similarly excludes non residents while governments release around the clock updates on resident cases and casualties it took almost 18 months and a freedom of information request for a one off incomplete estimate of overseas australian deaths from covid 19 the crisis has highlighted the one directional nature of diaspora engagement australian governments since around 2002 when dual citizenship was legalised for non naturalised australians have sought to harness diaspora capital recognising the beneficial role overseas australians play as brand australia ambassadors and facilitators of trade and investment however increased recognition of the benefits of a diaspora has not meaningfully translated into greater interest in or obligations towards non resident australians rather it appears to have further exaggerated misperceptions of self sufficiency and privilege these misperceptions are difficult to counter with the statistical cupboard bare treating the diaspora as collateral damage rather than addressing gaps exposed by the pandemic will be a costly misstep for australia s regional and global reputation australia is already taking a monumental hit by locking out international students breaking the other arm of its ambassadorial armada overall immigration remains indefinitely restricted the screws were tightened on inward foreign investment last year whereas many asian countries adopted a facilitative stance australia s pandemic response has had a nationalistic framing with isolationist undertones that has left the diaspora on the outer and deepened the diplomatic deep freeze with china its largest trading partner australia s largely laissez faire emigration policies are lagging behind more active countries in the region the philippines pakistan bangladesh sri lanka and china support emigrant workers through a combination of dedicated agencies registration and deployment pre departure training and orientation bilateral agreements securing rights and legal aid some additionally offer welfare support or offer preferential investment or return migration schemes australia s diaspora is more educated than those of its neighbours but arguments against replicating more active and generous policies are ideological not factual they must be because there are no statistics on which to base them the pandemic looms as a watershed moment for australian identity as a country built on migration and enriched by internationalisation pursues a health response that has upturned commonly understood conceptions of citizenship rights developing a census equivalent for the australian diaspora would help reinforce inclusive citizenship and provide a vital input to future diaspora engagement policies stewart nixon is a research scholar at the crawford school of public policy the australian national university the post australia needs a diaspora census first appeared on east asia forum source link
by chuck collins the nation is on the brink of a severe housing disaster more than 1 2 million families are facing eviction in the coming months millions of others face foreclosures persistent homelessness unaffordable rental housing and out of reach home ownership the u s supreme court s ruling in late august striking down president joe biden s eviction moratorium will cause the pace of evictions to accelerate the human costs of eviction are enormous made worse by the ravages and uncertainty caused by the pandemic the federal eviction moratorium put in place by president donald trump and extended by biden was designed to buy time to get federal emergency pandemic funds to local jurisdictions to fill the gap between lost wages and unpaid rents unfortunately states and localities have moved at a snail s pace to spend that money as of early august only 11 of the 46 5 billion of funds from the federal emergency rental assistance program had reached tenants and landlords the eviction blowout is the tip of the iceberg of a housing affordability crisis for many households rent or mortgage payments are absorbing half of their household budget and rendering the dream of homeownership impossible many communities need more affordable housing stock but the main driver of the crisis isn t housing supply it s who owns that supply during a time of extreme wealth gaps in some places large corporations and private equity firms like blackstone have moved in to buy up millions of units of rental housing including single family homes families locked out of homeownership are forced to rent the homes that they aren t able to buy other investor buyers are removing millions of units of rental housing from the market and converting them to short term rentals like airbnb this drives up rents for people who actually live in these communities finally wealthy investors from around the world are buying up u s real estate not to live in but as a form of wealth storage in cities like los angeles that means tens of thousands of units of vacant housing sit alongside tens of thousands of people without homes many of these buyers are using anonymous shell companies to mask who the real owners are today anonymous shell companies own 40 of the rental housing market an estimated 18 million out of 48 million rental units nationwide according to census data after world war ii our nation experienced a similar housing emergency back then congress made expanding affordable housing a national priority the famous gi bill allocated funds to build rental housing and encourage homeownership with low interest loans through the veterans administration and farmers home it wasn t an equitable program nearly all of the households that benefited were white but it moved millions of people from tenancy to homeownership a ticket on the wealth building train to the middle class lawmakers today could repeat a similar program without the racial bias but many communities aren t waiting for the federal government to act from rhode island to california cities and states are levying mansion taxes taxing luxury housing sales to fund permanently affordable housing other jurisdictions are taxing vacant units and passing laws requiring the disclosure of real ownership who owns the housing matters communities need to expand the supply of local homeownership and permanently affordable rental housing owned by nonprofits and community housing authorities failure to act will lead to the destruction of stable communities and undermine the possibility of economic recovery for the majority of households chuck collins is the co editor of inequality org at the left leaning institute for policy studies

by david haggith joe biden is looking a little grinchy having decided to fire the unvaccinated across america as we head toward the holidays even though the end of enhanced unemployment benefits has not brought back millions of former employees who ve held out since the covid lockdown biden decided it would be wise to fire a lot more people mandating last week that all businesses with more than 100 employees terminate any employees who continue to refuse the government s experimental warp speed vaccine while president biden may think he s going to strong arm people who don t want to get vaccinated into a strong shot in the arm by punishing them with poverty and the threat of losing their homes as we enter the holiday season he may find he find he has just enraged them and increased their willingness to take a stand against forced medication if so that will mean a lot more people have to be fired adding to the soup lines at a time when soup shelves are growing bare i don t know about where you live but where i live i see a number of small businesses already running fewer hours due to lack of employees and running with reduced menus or partially empty shelves due to unattainable supply has jumpin joe not stopped to think that an additional major drain of employees to run shops and move products around the nation does not add up to the kind of holiday retail season that can put companies in the black and may be all it takes to shove an already fading economy into a black winter hole will major trucking companies like swift being forced by the nation s ruler by decree to lay off hundreds of trump loving truckers help the nation with its widespread shortages already a hospital in new jersey has announced it won t be allowing any more baby births due to lack of staffing because of its new vaccination policies an upstate new york hospital will stop delivering babies later this month in part because of employee resignations over a requirement they be vaccinated against covid 19 the number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies at lewis county general hospital new jersey news network i guess the babies will have to start backing up at the ports to those wombs like all the container ships that can t find a berth either are doing all over the world something tells me the babies will not be as compliant about waiting so maybe there will be more street births ah well the christmas story began with no room for a baby president joseph apparently wants to add his own mark on the story ports are more plugged than ever speaking of backed up berths biden launches his effort to create a deeper covid shortage in the labor force at a time when us ports are already more backlogged with shipping vessels than any time before that is partly due to us ports not having enough labor to unload ships and partly due to those ship not having a port to sail to because other ports of the world don t have enough labor due to regional covid lockdowns biden has apparently decided that now would be the opportune time to make sure this problem becomes worse before it gets better you may remember me publishing this graph last month which showed how many ships were backed up at ports at the time i wrote you can see in the following graph how us west coast ports got backlogged back when china experienced its covid lockdowns and then how it looked like that was going to be transitory as economies including china opened back up and finally how all of that has fallen to pieces again now that the delta variant is closing down chinese ports again apparently the supply chain bottlenecks are not so transitory after all never underestimate the power of a tiny virus at stopping the world in its tracks is inflation cooling and putting in a top could it be that i was wrong well that chart now looks like this the backlog has increased by a third since that article last month the timing for exacerbating this couldn t be better since holiday gifts are supposed to start filling warehouses now for october and november s redistribution to retail stores does biden really want to be the grinch that stole christmas we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the expansion of the shipping log jam hasn t helped inflation any the dotted red line in the graph below is the level reached by the highest shipping costs per container when i reported a month ago and the solid line is where those same runs price today you can see they have only continued to rise prices that will show up in stores when and if the products in those ships ever show up in stores that means additional inflation waits in the pipeline or at the waterline a problem not about to go away soon according to long beach port director mario cordero i don t see substantial mitigation with regard to the congestion that the major container ports are experiencing many people believe it s going to continue through the summer of 2022 bob biesterfield chief executive of c h robinson worldwide inc the largest freight broker in north america said shortages of truck drivers and warehouse workers are making shipping delays worse as the need to replenish inventories is at an all time high i don t think that s something that just gets fixed in the next four to five months in accordance with the lunar new year the wall street journal i also noted in my august article once you start seeing empty shelves in major retailers with vast resources you ve entered a situation that can become catastrophic in a hurry suddenly you will have people who can t get basic necessities because of jammed up shipping lack of laborers in production and retail covid shutdowns around the world and lack of resources to build things out of or parts to make them we haven t seen that until now because large corporate inventories were carrying us through as a buffer but those inventories are mostly depleted now and that means prices are likely to rise faster as people compete for the things they need do our government officials realize how quickly this could go from concerning to a panic forced labor crisis apparently having taken another actual economic lockdown off the table in his public statements jalopy joe felt he needed to find an alternative way to make sure us labor falls further so that shortages are redistributed more equitably across the land no need to worry about the impact on economic data from these people who are terminated for refusal of a vaccine even if they already had covid so have better immunity than a vaccine can ever deliver they won t show up in the unemployment data because they will never be eligible for unemployment since they are unemployed due to refusing a vaccine their refusal to comply with the orwellian mandate will be deemed insubordination if you don t hit the unemployment benefit rolls you don t ever show up in the data however neither do the things you used to produce or deliver show up on shelves to the extent that forced vaccination is unsuccessful at getting medicine into people s arms it will be that much more successful in keeping everything else off store shelves and restaurant menus already a major problem milkshakes are missing from u k s mcdonald s branches tomatoes are rotting on italian farms and soldiers mingle with farmers on vietnam s rice paddies all because of shortage of staff a dearth of farm and slaughterhouse workers truckers chefs or waiters is hitting global food supply chains hard causing processing slowdowns delivery delays and empty supermarket shelves bloomberg like most people in the developed world kirsten gjesdal had long taken for granted her ability to order whatever she needs and then watch the goods arrive without any thought about the factories container ships and trucks involved in delivery not anymore she recently received a pot lid she had purchased eight months earlier she has grown accustomed to paying surcharges to cover the soaring shipping costs of the goods she buys she has already placed orders for christmas items like wreaths and baking pans it s nuts she said it s definitely not getting back to normal delays product shortages and rising costs continue to bedevil businesses large and small and consumers are confronted with an experience once rare in modern times no stock available and no idea when it will come in dnyuz the figgy pudding may be in short supply this christmas welcome to the ussa where empty shelves will become a common site this winter however there will be no shortage of inflation that s adding to a long list of problems for the food supply chains this year from extreme weather pounding crops to soaring freight costs and shipping bottlenecks all of that is threatening to compound inflation bloomberg employers are already dangling higher wages sign on bonuses and other perks to lure workers while seeking creative measures spicy chicken chain nando s which was forced to temporarily close some of its u k restaurants sent its own workers to help its troubled suppliers thanks to the biden tax vax plan businesses are going to have to dangle a lot more bait and spicy perks santa s only reindeer is stagflation big banks are finally starting to get the picture that their master the fed is wrong about all of this inflation being transitory michael hartnett of bank of america says the us is already in the first phase of stagflation meaning we ll see higher inflation coupled with weaker economic growth which takes us as expected back to the early 70 s and that brings us back to this inflation streak eventually becoming the thing that breaks the back of this stock market bull stagflation is characterised by weak growth and persistently high inflation it is usually seen as a particularly vicious period in the economic cycle when very few asset classes perform well while global markets have recorded a string of highs over the summer period market sentiment has become increasingly cautious due to rising inflation us news and world report better do your christmas shopping early this year and lay in supplies for those holiday meals or tree and table may be bare what you can get your hands on will be rare so expect to pay dearly as president biden s tax vax program creatively broadens our covid shutdowns in the belief that he can force people to do what he thinks is the socially responsible thing of course what else can you expect from these democrat politicians than their failure to see the real world repercussions of their social engineering ideals biden s 3 5 trillion dollar tax hike the largest in the history of the world should add to the avalanche of troubles coming down on us nothing like hitting the nation with a massive tax increase for social programs at a time when the economy is sinking prices are rising and goods are scarce because workers are scarce higher taxes passed just before congress s holiday break are sure to be just the shot in the arm the economy and markets need if the fed tapers at the same time this could could really become the winter of our discontent

san diego gas electric sdg e will refund 51 6 million to customers and pay a 5 5 million fine due to a botched program meant to encourage people to buy energy efficient lightbulbs according to ap the program to get people to buy costlier energy efficient bulbs started in 2017 and provided incentives to manufacturers and stores to ship and stock them an investigative report commissioned by the california public utilities revealed that 15 million of the subsidized bulbs had gone missing costing utility ratepayers about 55 million it also found that the total number of bulbs shipped in 2017 under the programs was three times the number of bulbs sold in california additional investigators hired by sdg e in 2020 found that bulbs were either overstocked or never sold and that at least one manufacturer falsified shipping invoices for bulbs that were never delivered or dumped sdg e discontinued the program last year according to ap sdg e took ownership of what went wrong spokeswoman helen gao told the san diego union tribune in an email the lessons learned from the program failure have resulted in meaningful changes including new procedures and training to strengthen accountability and prevent this from ever happening again

alexandra keleti alexandra keleti on things your accountant wishes you understood leawood ks united states september 13 2021 einpresswire com alexandra keleti knows a thing or two about accounting as she works through the master of accounting program at ku she hopes to share some of the wisdom sheâ s gained with others the u s tax code is a long and complex document by which accountants are bound the code itself weighs in at a hefty 2 652 pages and includes more words than the king james bible war and peace and the entire harry potter series of books however the complexities arise when you consider irs regulations congressional rules and irs rulings and clarifications along the way then consider that between 2001 and 2012 there were 4 680 changes to the tax codes and it becomes even more complex while you may not be up to date with the minutiae of taxes your accountant must be these are a few of the things your accountant wishes you understood taxes are eternalif you make money you must pay taxes itâ s that simple a skilled accountant can help you lower your tax bills by using legal methods to reduce your burden however as long as you are making money you will continue to owe taxes to your dear old uncle sam if an accountant tells you otherwise you might want to find another accountant the best accountants will work to make sure that you do not pay one cent more in taxes than is absolutely necessary after all who wants to do that but if they are being honest with you all accountants will tell you that you will need to pay some taxes the early bird gets the wormyour accountant is only human with so many people waiting until the last minute to file taxes those who file early will get more attention from their accountants after all there are only 24 hours in a day and accountants do have other needs sleep food family etc to contend with when you file early you get more personal attention from your accountant and youâ re not competing with thousands of other people who waited until the last minute to file plus if you have a refund coming your way you are likely to receive the funds sooner large refunds are not a bonus for youwhen you receive a large refund from your taxes it means one thing it means youâ ve provided uncle sam with an interest free loan of your money that is money you could use throughout the year to earn you interest in other ways such as stock market investments or mutual funds interest earning savings or checking accounts ira purchases holiday club savings programs paying off high interest credit card debt in other words you could use this money far more effectively if you have it available to you rather than waiting for uncle sam to return to you what is already yours your accountant doesnâ t make the ruleswhile it is often easier to blame the messenger than a nameless faceless government entity though you should certainly feel free to write letters to your congressional representatives the truth is they are not the ones who make the rules they are simply bound to comply with the tax rules that have been put into place this means that if you owe money for your taxes it is not the fault of the person preparing your taxes as easy as it is to blame your accountant the fault lies elsewhere alexandra keleti and others like her unfortunately are the ones left to be bearers of the bad news alexandra keleti is a student at ku working on her master s in accounting she currently holds a bachelorâ s degree in business administration from the university of kansas and is excited about this next chapter in her life she hopes readers have learned a few important things about accountants and taxes from this piece
i ve been a science reporter for 40 years i ve wanted to assume that the experts i interview can be trusted to understand their subjects put simply to get it right but watching researchers in the field of obesity almost blindly follow a failed paradigm has led me to cross a line that few journalists ever do to publicly embrace and promote a minority opinion that many in the obesity field think is quackery for nearly a century obesity research has been predicated on the belief that the cause of the disorder is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended to quote the world health organization by this ubiquitous thinking obesity is an energy balance disorder people get fat because they take in more calories than they expend they stay lean when they don t advertisement this is the central dogma of obesity science virtually all obesity research is interpreted in the context of this balance principle all related public health discussions not just on obesity but on all the common chronic diseases that associate with it as well as the very nature of a healthy diet rely fundamentally on its implications the concept that obesity is essentially an energy balance disorder a problem of calories in and calories out is the number one concept that starts everything as harvard researcher bruce spiegelman said when i interviewed him in 2019 if you re a serious scientist he added it s just kind of obvious i might have embraced this thinking as well if the prevalence of obesity had not risen relentlessly for the past half century if obesity along with type 2 diabetes its partner in pathology had not become the dominant non covid health crisis of our time but i can t advertisement the twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes have become a public health crisis one the director of the world health organization has called a slow motion disaster and the world bank has called a ticking time bomb those assessments were made prior to the appearance of covid 19 for which obesity and diabetes are second only to advanced age in elevating the likelihood of bad outcomes the failure to make meaningful progress either treating or preventing obesity cannot be ignored this is why i am now a co author along with 16 influential academic researchers of a lengthy review the american journal of clinical nutrition is publishing on sept 13 the principal author is david ludwig a professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school and of nutrition at the harvard t h chan school of public health we argue that the reason so little progress has been made against obesity and type 2 diabetes is because the field has been laboring quite literally in the sense intended by philosopher of science thomas kuhn under the wrong paradigm this energy in energy out conception of weight regulation we argue is fatally tragically flawed obesity is not an energy balance disorder but a hormonal or constitutional disorder a dysregulation of fat storage and metabolism a disorder of fuel partitioning because these hormonal responses are dominated by the insulin signaling system which in turn responds primarily although not entirely to the carbohydrate content of the diet this thinking is now known as the carbohydrate insulin model its implications are simple and profound people don t get fat because they eat too much consuming more calories than they expend but because the carbohydrates in their diets both the quantity of carbohydrates and their quality establish a hormonal milieu that fosters the accumulation of excess fat despite the unorthodoxy of this thinking it is an easy case to make by studying the history of obesity research as i ve had to do as a journalist investigating the institutional failure to rein in the obesity diabetes epidemic a group of women perform slimming exercises in 1933 douglas miller topical press agency getty images a century ago the general thinking on obesity still allowed for two equally commonsensical ways to conceive of the pathology of the disorder the medical profession in general believes that there are two kinds of obese persons is how louis newburgh of the university of michigan described this schism in 1930 in the first of two papers in which he claimed to have settled the issue those who have become fat because they overeat or under exercise and those composing a second group whose adiposity is not closely related to diet but is caused by an endocrine or constitutional disorder this endocrine hormonal or constitutional concept may have been best phrased not by a scientist or physician but by playwright george bernard shaw in his 1910 work misalliance it s constitutional says the character john tarleton no matter how little you eat you put on flesh if you re made that way the reason so little progress has been made against obesity and type 2 diabetes is because the field has been laboring under the wrong paradigm by this thinking promoted in the decades between the world wars by prominent german and austrian physician researchers some people are born predisposed to accumulate excess fat just as some are predestined to grow tall however hungry or physically inactive they might be is an effect of the manifestation of this predisposition not a cause that the environment plays a critical role is a given the undeniable evidence is the enormous increase in the prevalence of obesity worldwide in the u s 12 of americans lived with obesity 60 years ago more than 40 do today something has changed in the environment in diets or lifestyles to trigger such a dramatic rise in the prevalence of obesity but is it nature or nurture that the environment triggers behavior or physiology minds or bodies in april 1929 at a time when the scientific discipline of obesity research constituted a handful of physicians in the u s and europe musing on causality newburgh claimed to have established experimentally and definitively the primacy of overeating as its manifest cause the articles he published promoting his research comparisons of the rate of weight loss during calorie restriction of maybe half a dozen obese subjects to one lean control successfully shifted thinking in the field ever after this makes newburgh as close as obesity science gets to a transformational figure the most influential researcher in the history of the science although his contribution wildly overblown as it clearly was has long been forgotten when the los angeles times reported on newburgh s work in 1932 the headline put it in appropriately blunt perspective just gluttony causes obesity michigan professor strips defense of portly one clear effect of newburgh s work is that it defined the fundamental question that obesity researchers believed they had to answer why the gluttony rather than why the excessive fat accumulation fat cells david gregory debbie marshall via wellcome beginning with the first animal models of obesity in the late 1930s more on that shortly researchers with the very rarest of exceptions have conceived of their work as elucidating the psychological genetic and physiological determinants of eating behavior they ve assumed without justification that what they observed translated directly and mechanistically to the excessive accumulation of fat in fat tissue ask a simple question as i have as a journalist like why is it that some of us fatten easily and some of us don t just as some breeds of livestock fatten easily and others don t and obesity researchers can t answer it because curiously enough that s not what they study newsletters sign up for daily recap a roundup of stat s top stories of the day please enter a valid email address privacy policy had physicians in the 1930s thought to conceive of obesity as a fat accumulation disorder an assumption free definition of the problem rather than as an energy balance problem they might have studied the physiological mechanisms that regulate fat storage that science was worked out between the 1930s and 1960s but by physiologists working with animal models who didn t think of themselves as studying human obesity driven by a series of technological advances in laboratory assays these researchers had identified in detail how hormones enzymes and the nervous system cooperate to move fat around the body burn it for fuel and store it as necessary but this research evolved independent of the scientific thinking on obesity itself as though the two phenomena the storage of fat in adipose tissue and obesity itself the storage of excess fat had nothing in common in 1957 columbia university s hilde bruch then the nation s leading authority on childhood obesity commented on precisely this problem looking at obesity without preconceived ideas she wrote one would assume that the main trend of research should be directed toward an examination of abnormalities of fat metabolism since by definition excessive accumulation of fat is the underlying abnormality it so happens that this is the area in which the least work has been done in 1973 after this science had mostly been elucidated bruch was still remarking on its absence amazing how little of this increasing awareness she wrote is reflected in the clinical literature on obesity the same statement holds true today medical textbooks discuss the physiological mechanisms central to fat storage and metabolism fat synthesis lipogenesis mobilization of fat from fat cells lipolysis fat storage and burning fat for energy oxidation implying that subtle disruptions in these processes could easily cause individuals to accumulate excess fat but such explanations appear only in metabolism and endocrinology chapters discussions of obesity itself start and end with energy balance and with no exceptions that i have found omit the science of fat metabolism almost entirely textbooks dedicated to obesity will describe the causes of the disorder as multifactorial and complex but the seemingly countless factors deemed relevant are all assumed to influence fat accumulation only indirectly through how much we eat and exercise considering the slow motion disaster quality of the obesity diabetes epidemic it s reasonable to ask why obesity researchers themselves so rarely if ever question their causal assumptions why leave it up to a journalist to ask these questions instead the answer here is simple not only does it seem intuitively obvious that people who struggle with obesity eat too much particularly so if you yourself are lean as newburgh was but the energy balance thinking itself is perceived as an inescapable consequence of physical law this is why articles and textbook chapters and institutional websites on obesity often begin with a discussion of the first law of thermodynamics and its perceived implications the fact that energy is conserved as a 2019 review in the journal nature metabolism explained dictates that changes in the fat stored in the human body must necessarily be a result of changes in energy input food intake and or energy expenditure to question this belief is to be accused as i have been of magical thinking of believing that the laws of physics don t hold for humans despite the ubiquity of this thinking though it is clearly wrong although not even wrong as the physicist wolfgang pauli once described an ill conceived idea might be more appropriate this is among the almost incomprehensible aspects of obesity science the idea that obesity is caused by positive energy balance is not an implication of thermodynamics or any other law of physics positive energy balance more calories consumed than expended is a description of what happens when people gain weight as the energy stored in their bodies increases so does their body mass the increase in body mass is the positive energy balance this reality says nothing about why it happens after all children are in positive energy balance when they re growing as gustav von bergmann the leading german authority on internal medicine in the pre world war ii decades argued then but that s not why they re growing women during pregnancy are in positive energy balance as is the child in their womb but that s no explanation for why their body mass is increasing consider using the identical logic to describe say why people get wealthy economists would i hope be embarrassed by a money balance theory of wealth people get rich because they take in more money than they spend clearly wealthy people did we know that because they re wealthy the increase in wealth is the positive money balance but this says nothing about how or why they accumulate such wealth in obesity research this tautological logic saying the same thing in two different ways but offering no explanation for either was allowed to become the central dogmatic truth another of the remarkable aspects of this history is that the fundamentally tautological nature of energy balance thinking has been so infrequently discussed i could find only a handful of researchers who ever did so publicly one was the harvard nutritionist jean mayer who wrote in 1954 to attribute obesity to overeating is as meaningful as to account for alcoholism by ascribing it to overdrinking the only researcher i have found who has elaborated in this century on the not even wrongness of energy balance thinking is thorkild sørensen of the university of copenhagen sørensen has published more than 400 articles on obesity writing and directing research projects with many prominent researchers he addressed the problem first in an article in 2008 and then later in a book chapter but sørensen says he has made little progress getting even his friends in the field to understand the first thing that happens he told me is that they think i am crazy or stupid they think i am denying the physics of thermodynamic law i have to tell them that this is not what i m doing i tell them they re making an assumption about the interpretation of thermodynamic law that they have no basis to do i sense sometimes that i m kind of convincing them then seconds later they re back again to the typical thinking about positive energy balance is driven by input minus output to attribute obesity to overeating is as meaningful as to account for alcoholism by ascribing it to overdrinking jean mayer that the energy balance thinking offers no explanation for why people become obese is by no means its only serious failing follow almost any implication of energy balance to its logical conclusion as physician scientists thinking about obesity once did and profoundly disturbing problems arise among the most troubling is that it inescapably transforms a physiological disorder the accumulation of excess body fat into a behavioral disorder a character flaw this makes fat shaming a seemingly unavoidable consequence here it helps to quantify exactly what energy imbalance implies to maintain a healthy weight by this thinking requires that people match their intake to their expenditure perfectly overshooting on average by just 10 calories a day the calories in a single potato chip translates into gaining a pound of fat yearly 10 pounds of excess fat per decade in just 30 years that tiny imbalance will transform anyone from lean to obese those 10 calories a day of positive energy balance are less than half of 1 of the calories a typical american consumes daily that s the overeating that has to be explained that raises other seemingly inescapable questions one is how does anyone stay lean when it requires this perfect energy balance to do so another is why wouldn t anyone in the process of becoming obese consciously adjust so they don t consume one or even a dozen fewer potato chips than otherwise and stop the fat from accumulating this is why jules hirsch of rockefeller university among the most celebrated of late 20th century obesity researchers told me in a 2002 interview that after 40 years of research he still didn t know why people get fat to begin with it s why columbia university s rudy leibel equally as celebrated told me that should i ever think i understand obesity it will probably indicate you ve lost your mind inescapably transforms a physiological disorder the accumulation of excess body fat into a behavioral disorder a character flaw it s easy to imagine why already obese individuals might not be able to exert the concerted effort necessary to become lean but why didn t they prevent themselves from becoming obese initially if obesity is caused by a positive energy balance avoiding or preventing it should be effortless because the energy balance logic demands an answer newburgh offered up the implication in his articles and by doing so catalyzed the transformation of the scientific perception of obesity from a chronic disabling physiological disorder into a character or psychological defect children get fat newburgh wrote not because of a constitutional predisposition but because they d been deliberately trained to overeat by their parents and most adults get fat because they suffer from various human weaknesses such as over indulgence and ignorance if they didn t wouldn t they have eaten less and not become obese by the 1950s this logic had been institutionalized suggestions that obesity was a hormonal disorder were dismissed as lame excuses the mayo clinic s leading obesity expert in a 1957 book chapter for the obese to avoid doing what comes naturally to lean people eat in moderation authorities in the obesity field were now becoming psychologists and psychiatrists people overate and got fat these experts declared because of unresolved emotional conflicts or to relieve the nervous tensions of life it s still common to see obesity blamed today on comfort eating as one 2017 textbook describes it to reduce negative emotions such as anger loneliness boredom and depression to avoid the direct implications of the logic that people with obesity merely lack the willpower of those who are lean some authorities instead blame genetics for making people overeat determining as one oxford researcher told the new york times in 2019 who s going to reach for the doughnuts others blame the food industry for making the doughnuts or other ultraprocessed foods the terminology de jour available to be overeaten if not so addictive as to be impossible to refuse since not everyone is obese or overweight some people clearly do balance their intake to their expenditure even in an environment where food is everywhere shouldn t a viable hypothesis of obesity be able to explain why some people remain lean and others don t without implicitly or even explicitly blaming character this problem is solved by simply defining obesity as what it clearly is a disorder of excessive fat accumulation this perspective was argued in the 1920s and 1930s first by the german internist gustav von bergmann and then by university of vienna endocrinologist julius bauer the noted vienna authority on internal diseases as the new york times then described him this conception focused on what bauer called the exaggerated tendency of some tissues to store fat men and women fatten differently he pointed out and both in very specific areas sex hormones clearly influence fat accumulation independent of energy balance whatever mechanisms are at work locally bauer argued should be the prime suspects systemically in causing obesity like a malignant tumor or like the fetus the uterus or the breasts of a pregnant woman bauer wrote in 1929 the fat tissue in a person predisposed to obesity seizes on foodstuffs even in the case of undernutrition it maintains its stock and may increase it independent of the requirements of the organism a sort of anarchy exists the adipose tissue lives for itself and does not fit into the precisely regulated management of the whole organism by the late 1930s bauer and von bergmann s fat storage hypothesis was winning over influential researchers in the u s and europe but it didn t survive the war years the german and austrian research establishments evaporated with world war ii ending the era of german austrian dominance in medical science the lingua franca of medicine shifted from german to english and the hypothesis lost its constituency this shift coincided with the development of the first animal models of obesity allowing researchers for the first time to study obesity experimentally now obesity researchers in america readers and citers of newburgh and not of bauer or von bergmann settled the debate between the two competing paradigms of obesity but they did so incorrectly interpreting their observations only in the energy balance context seemingly unaware that another context or hypothesis or paradigm even existed the very first animal model of obesity set the precedent using a device created for brain surgery the technique required placing a precisely targeted lesion in the middle of an animal s hypothalamus near its underside the ventromedial region the hypothalamus sits directly above the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and is hardwired to organs throughout the body via the nervous system including fat tissue it s also connected indirectly through the hormonal secretions of the endocrine system because animals with these lesions in the hypothalamus often ate voraciously and grew obese john brobeck then a physiologist at yale proposed in 1946 that the hypothalamus must be controlling eating behavior this is how it s been perceived ever since but animals with lesions in the ventromedial region of the hypothalamus would also grow obese or at least get significantly fatter when they didn t eat any more than a lean animal prevent the animal from eating excessively meaning control for the overeating in the language of experimental science and these animals get fat anyway borrowing from shaw s tarleton they put on flesh anyway even at levels of food intake that would not cause weight gain in normal animals this observation would go unexplained or be ignored entirely once brobeck assumed that overeating he called it hyperphagia a term that is still in use was the reason why these animals with ventromedial lesions in the hypothalamus got fat obesity researchers in the post world war ii years perceived their scientific obligation as elucidating how the hypothalamus knows enough to moderate eating and maybe energy expenditure as well and how that awareness breaks down in obesity the hypotheses that dominated thinking from the 1950s onward have been attempts to answer this question proposing for instance that the signal to the hypothalamus was blood sugar jean mayer or circulating fatty acids gordon c kennedy of the university of cambridge in the u k while researchers have since created many animal models of obesity genetically surgically or manipulated by diet one observation is remarkably consistent although researchers have rarely thought to control for energy intake in their experiments when they did testing whether their animals get fatter than lean controls even when eating as little or less food they almost invariably report that they do these mice will make fat out of their food under the most unlikely circumstances even when half starved as jean mayer wrote about obese mice he studied in the 1950s this fundamental observation directly challenges the notion that obesity is caused by poorly regulated eating behavior it supports the hypothesis that poorly regulated eating behavior is a consequence of an animal s constitutional drive to accumulate excess fat these observations too have been ignored the most conspicuous example of the disconnect between the energy balance model and the actual evidence from animal models comes from the most famous mutant mice named the ob ob mice ever discovered the first appeared in a litter at the jackson laboratory in maine in 1949 it was ob ob mutants that led jeffrey friedman and his rockefeller university colleagues to discover the hormone leptin and identify defects in the leptin gene as responsible for the animal s obesity leptin s discovery in 1994 was hailed as the holy grail of obesity research the putative signal secreted by fat tissue to inform the hypothalamus that fat is accumulating and so eating and expenditure must be adjusted to compensate tens of thousands of articles have since been published relevant to leptin s role in obesity despite this body of literature much of it from friedman s own lab documenting leptin s direct effect on fat metabolism and storage bauer and von bergmann s fat accumulation hypothesis the research community has assumed as friedman first did that leptin is a satiety hormone newburgh s energy balance thinking according to the endocrine society website leptin helps inhibit hunger and regulate energy balance so the body does not trigger hunger responses when it does not need energy hence when leptin is absent or the hypothalamus is resistant to leptin s signaling the result is positive energy balance obesity but even the ob ob mutants make fat out of their food when quite literally half starved friedman s research was based on douglas coleman s research at the jackson laboratory and coleman who shared a lasker foundation award in 2010 with friedman dedicated two papers to this observation even when maintained on 50 percent of normal food intake coleman reported in 1985 mutants still become obese if an animal is amassing fat even when deprived of any opportunity to eat a decent meal even when semi starved surely leptin is doing something profound to fat storage other than regulating appetite or even appetite and expenditure when i asked friedman about this just before covid 19 hit in the winter of 2020 he said he had no explanation and hadn t thought about it in a while clearly some metabolic alterations push nutrients into adipose tissue in some ways to the detriment of other tissues he said but if that can happen independent of how much an animal eats why wouldn t we suspect the same thing happens in humans my reading of the history of obesity science is that none of this would have happened had physicians thinking about what causes obesity paid any meaningful attention as bruch suggested in 1957 to the evolving research on fat metabolism itself a series of technological innovations that began in the mid 1930s allowed researchers to understand first how metabolically active fat was mobilization and deposition of fat go on continuously without regard to the nutritional state of the animal as described in a seminal 1948 review and then how hormones and the central nervous system very carefully regulated these processes by the mid 1960s researchers studying fat storage and metabolism had established unambiguously that the hormone insulin dominated the regulation of fat storage while insulin works conspicuously to control blood sugar defects in insulin production and responsiveness are primary causes of diabetes it does so partly by stimulating the uptake of fat into fat cells inhibiting its release and inhibiting its use as energy in non adipose tissue no tissue in the body is as sensitive to insulin s action as fat tissue exquisitely sensitive as these researchers often described it with the invention of a technique to measure circulating levels of insulin the radioimmunoassay developed by solomon berson and rosalyn yalow in 1960 for which yalow after berson s death won a nobel prize in 1977 researchers learned that animals with hypothalamic lesions and ob ob mice are both hyperinsulinemic as are people with obesity and with type 2 diabetes offering a parsimonious explanation for the mechanism of their excessive fat accumulation some of the most influential researchers studying obesity and diabetes including berson and yalow themselves proposed primary roles for insulin in fat accumulation and obesity influential researchers in a discipline known as physiological psychology with roots going back to ivan pavlov jacques le magnen of the collège de france in paris specifically and mark friedman of the monell center in philadelphia a coauthor on the american journal of clinical nutrition review did the same but all these ideas have failed to take hold as obesity researchers continued to insist that energy balance or lack thereof was the mechanistic explanation and an indisputable truth this is the danger with the kind of dogmatic status that the energy balance notion achieved so early and prematurely in obesity research scientists and philosophers of science have commented on this problem for centuries men who have excessive faith in their theories or ideas are not only ill prepared for making discoveries they also make very poor observations claude bernard wrote in the introduction to the study of experimental medicine in 1865 of necessity they observe with a preconceived idea and when they devise an experiment they can see in its results only a confirmation of their theory in this way they distort observation and often neglect very important facts because they do not further their aim in the case of obesity the hormonal constitutional hypothesis also encountered dogmatic resistance in response to its single most direct practical implication diets that can successfully resolve obesity are not those that induce us to eat less per energy balance thinking but those that reduce circulating levels of insulin accomplished most effectively by replacing dietary carbohydrates sugars starchy vegetables and grains and the like with fat physicians and diet book authors have been promoting carbohydrate restricted high fat diets ketogenic diets now commonly known as keto for going on 200 years most famously robert atkins a new york cardiologist by arguing as atkins and others did that fat could be lost without limiting calories by fixing the hormonal dysregulation of fat storage restricting what one eats not how much these books were treated as de facto quackery by advocating that we eat fat rich foods they were considered dangerous over the course of my research i came to find the arguments of these diet books compelling so much so that i ve written four books myself on the subject and co founded a not for profit organization in 2012 the nutrition science initiative to help fund research that might shed meaningful light on the causes of common obesity the results were encouraging but ambiguous while researchers continue to study fat metabolism and its role in obesity they typically assume that whatever they re observing plays a subordinate role to that of energy imbalance this again is a danger of dogmatic thinking in stockholm for instance karolinska institute researchers have reported that fat is stored longer in the fat cells of people who are obese than it is in those who are lean mobilization of fat from fat cells in these people is inhibited precisely as would be predicted by bauer and von bergmann s thinking that the fat tissue in those predisposed to obesity is dysregulated in 2019 the karolinska researchers reported that the older we get the more fat turnover in fat cells slows a phenomenon that they estimate could account for a 200 pound person adding 30 pounds of excess fat in a decade without eating any more than he or she ever did still they could not or would not shake the energy balance context suggesting that because overeating was the main driver for obesity it might be the failure to reduce calorie intake in aging to compensate for this deaccelerating fat turnover that leads to weight gain the researchers most willing to question the energy balance logic are those who still practice as physicians and regularly treat patients with obesity these physicians an ever growing but still small minority find that when they induce their patients to restrict carbohydrates but not calories their patients can achieve and maintain a healthy weight with relative ease and get healthier in the process when this approach has been used for people with type 2 diabetes as the san francisco based start up virta health has been doing the results have been unprecedented for researchers and public health authorities to make real progress against obesity and the obesity diabetes epidemics they will have to shed their energy balance thinking their obsessive focus on how much people eat and exercise instead borrowing again from hilde bruch in 1957 they ll have to focus on fat metabolism and storage itself since by definition excessive accumulation of fat is the underlying abnormality if they think of obesity as it simply and clearly is a disorder of excess fat accumulation they might actually figure it out gary taubes is a science and health journalist author and co founder of the

when the last of the us troops pulled out of kabul on august 31 after a prolonged 20 year military occupation of afghanistan they left behind a treasure trove of weapons but most of them abandoned by retreating afghan forces who were american allies these weapons including combat helicopters armoured vehicles battle tanks and transport aircraft were apparently de activated by the departing americans but some reportedly remain functional and battle ready according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri which monitors weapons sales worldwide the us delivered a staggering array of arms during 2001 2021 including an estimated 21 924 armoured vehicles 66 md 530f armed light helicopters 34 cessna 208b armed light transport aircraft 53 uh 60a transport helicopters 5 scan eagle unarmed and unmanned aerial vehicles and an estimated 250 paveway guided bombs the us reportedly spent over us 2 2 trillion in military humanitarian and development assistance over 20 years of this a hefty us 83 billion was spent on the military at the rate of over us 4 0 billion annually mostly on arms purchases originating from the us defence industry plus maintenance servicing and training but us officials claim that most of the equipment left behind were disabled even though cable news network cnn reported that the taliban threw a parade to publicly display the weapons with fighters waving flags from us made humvees and armoured vehicles and posing for photos in helicopter cockpits responding to a question at a briefing pentagon press secretary john kirby said they can inspect all they want they can look at them but they can t fly them they can t operate them he said because all of them had been de activated siemon wezeman senior researcher arms transfers programme at sipri told idn it is unclear to what extent the left behind us weapons have been or could be made non operational technically rendering the more complicated systems like helicopters or the counter rocket artillery mortars c ram to a state where they cannot be used and will be difficult to restore to use is not very difficult taking away or destroying a few key components including parts of the helicopter engines or some specialised electronics will do the trick while the systems may from the outside still operational or repairable he said if those key components are selected carefully he said they cannot be repaired or replaced without us controlled services or components or with components from other captured systems e g one would need to destroy all components of a certain type used on any of the weapons that were left in afghanistan or were captured from afghan forces to prevent the taliban using parts captured intact wezeman also pointed out that for simpler weapons of which most were in the hands of the afghan forces like the 1 000s of light armoured vehicles or the 10 0000s rifles it would be impossible for the us to make them non operational there were too many they were under control of the afghan forces and most were not close to the few us forces left by august 2021 many would even if partly made non operational probably be fairly easy for the taliban to restore or to use as a source of spare parts to fix other damaged weapons themselves he added wezeman said repairing or swapping a damaged engine from one of the many light armoured vehicles with a functioning engine from another vehicle does not require more expertise than can be found with any car mechanic however trying to fix or swap engines for some of the helicopters needs more expertise and is of course more demanding in precision the wall street journal reported the us troops destroyed or disabled nearly 100 combat vehicles and dozens of aircraft before vacating the airport in kabul in a last ditch bid to deprive the taliban of the use of some american military equipment but us officials who track the flow of weapons are watching closely to see what becomes of the acres of weaponry vehicles and aircraft that were left behind which are still operable and can be of use to the taliban or to arms smugglers overview of transfers in terms of volume according to the sipri report afghanistan was not a very large recipient of major arms in 2016 20 afghanistan ranked as only the 25th largest recipient in the world accounting for 1 0 per cent of the global total slightly over three quarters of the major arms delivered by volume were newly produced while the rest were second hand but in some cases modified prior to delivery the volumes of major arms transfers to the afghan armed forces grew significantly between 2001 2005 and 2011 2015 see figure 1 however volumes decreased by 24 per cent in 2016 2020 sixteen states are known to have supplied major arms to afghanistan in the period 2001 2020 see figure 2 the major arms were overwhelmingly armoured land vehicles and aircraft see figure 3 sipri says the us was the largest major arms supplier to afghanistan in every consecutive five year period after 2001 2005 between 2001 and 2020 the us was the supplier for 74 per cent of afghanistan s imports of major arms by volume the volume of us transfers to afghanistan increased between 2001 2005 and 2011 2015 during 2016 2020 the volume of us exports was similar to the previous five years and it was twice as high as in 2006 2010 and around 65 times higher compared with 2001 2005 also by 2016 2020 imports from other states had fallen even more sharply and the us accounted for almost 90 per cent of afghanistan s imports of major arms by volume according to sipri deliveries from the us to afghanistan from 2001 included an estimated 21 924 armoured vehicles e g hmmwv ua asv 150 m 1117 66 md 530f armed light helicopters 34 cessna 208b armed light transport aircraft and 53 uh 60a transport helicopters the us also delivered 65 scan eagle unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles and an estimated 250 paveway guided bombs most of the arms were supplied to afghanistan as aid russia was the second largest supplier of major arms to the afghan armed forces in the period accounting for 14 per cent of imports by volume all of these deliveries took place between 2002 and 2014 deliveries from russia mainly consisted of 90 second hand and newly produced mi 8mtv and mi 17 transport helicopters between 2002 and 2014 early deliveries 2002 2005 were in the form of aid but most of the transport helicopters were bought via and financed by the us in 2009 2014 and 10 which were delivered in 2010 were financed by the united arab emirates according to the sipri report transfers from other suppliers several other states mainly north atlantic treaty organisation nato member states delivered smaller volumes of major arms to afghanistan directly or supplied major arms through us run and us funded programmes sipri says italy accounted for 3 8 per cent of all deliveries of major arms to afghanistan by volume in the period these consisted of 16 second hand g 222 transport aircraft in 2009 2012 financed by the usa the aircraft were modernized in italy before delivery among other nato member states and nato partner states czechs supplied six mi 24 combat helicopters and six mi 17 transport helicopters in 2007 2009 all were second hand but were modernized in czechs republic before delivery in a programme paid for by nato the uk supplied two mi 17 transport helicopters in 2010 bosnia and herzegovina slovakia and turkey supplied a total of 128 second hand artillery pieces between 2006 and 2013 and norway supplied an estimated 159 tow anti tank missiles in 2009 all these transfers came as direct aid or were financed by the us several non nato states also supplied major arms brazil was the fourth largest supplier accounting for 2 7 per cent of all deliveries these were 26 super tucano a 29b trainer combat aircraft delivered in 2016 2018 they were bought through a us programme financed by the us and modified in the us before delivery to afghanistan they became the main combat aircraft of the afghan air force switzerland supplied 18 pc 12 light transport aircraft in 2015 these reached afghanistan via the us and were probably modified in the us for reconnaissance before final delivery india supplied three cheetah light helicopters and four second hand mi 25 combat helicopters in 2015 2016 it also financed the supply of four second hand mi 24v combat helicopters from belarus in 2019 according to sipri figures in the final analysis sipri s wezeman said what the taliban will do or can do with the captured equipment is less clear generally few see the major arms those listed in sipri s topical backgrounder now in the hands of the taliban as a serious threat to anyone outside afghanistan however the small arms and light weapons and related ammunition and equipment are likely to be a much bigger problem either the taliban can supply them to like minded groups in other countries or some of them can leak into the black market he noted as a result said wezeman they can also get picked up by extremist groups or individuals a situation similar to what happened with libya s large stocks of such equipment which are used by various rebel groups in the sahel region equipment from past conflicts in south east asia have found their way over the years to users like the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte in sri lanka several groups in central america and others in south east asia thalif deen is a former director foreign military markets at defense marketing
