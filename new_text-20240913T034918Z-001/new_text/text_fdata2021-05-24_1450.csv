rich listers are among those grabbing the opportunities now iron ore magnate andrew forrest has perhaps the highest profile having spent much of the past 12 months searching the world for partners in an ambitious plan to turn fortescue metals group into a green energy powerhouse forrest has also joined fellow billionaire and atlassian co founder mike cannon brookes as an investor in sun cable a project that aims to deliver electricity to singapore from a solar farm in the northern territory via an enormous 3700 kilometre undersea cable cannon brookes is also an investor in green energy lender brighte and solar start up sundrive in march both cannon brookes and fellow atlassian co founder scott farquhar invested in genex power an asx listed renewable energy venture waste industry giants ian malouf and john richards are developing waste to energy plants while the kahlbetzer family has invested in sustainable farming and waste to energy businesses ralph sarich s private investment vehicle cape bouvard technologies is working to commercialise technology that would make electric vehicle batteries lighter and cheaper to build for billionaire anthony pratt the fact that capital is now pouring into sustainability is no surprise his late father richard built visy industries into a packaging giant by harnessing the opportunity of turning waste into new products back in the late 1970s that core idea turning trash into treasure continues to drive the group after buying the australasian glass bottle manufacturing assets of united states group owens illinois in july last year for almost 1 billion pratt immediately committed to spending a further 2 billion to help increase the recycled content in glass bottles in australia from 30 per cent to 70 per cent within five years anthony pratt at visy s new glass bottle and jar factory in penrith west of sydney in february dominic lorrimer we ve been working at this for decades so for us this is not johnny come lately stuff we are johnny on the spot says pratt over the phone from new york we ve invested billions in it and we ve got to continue to invest billions in it he emphasises that the family s push into sustainability was built on economics not environmentalism pratt snr hated waste and hated paying someone to take it away using recycled product raw material would help make visy both more competitive and profitable advertisement when anthony pratt arrived in the us in the early 1990s to establish visy s american arm he was stunned to find none of his competitors were recycling spotting a gap in the market pratt closed an existing factory in georgia and built a replica of visy s recycling oriented australian plants then he waited for 15 years while the recycling message slowly got through to us business former us vice president al gore s movie an inconvenient truth released in 2006 shifted the dial later that year retail giant walmart introduced a sustainability scorecard for suppliers with the use of recycled content prominent as a result of that customers were queuing up to deal with us pratt says visy which has 6 per cent of the us cardboard box market and us4 billion 5 17 billion in annual sales is still the only box maker using 100 per cent recycled materials not only has pratt built five of america s largest mills using visy s recycled model but he s powering them with clean energy plants that stand next to the factories i believe that sustainability and commerciality are not in conflict pratt says because fundamentally using a waste product is cheaper than using a virgin product macleod s dive into regenerative farming has similar capitalist origins following a shocking drought in the early 2000s his goal was to save his farms not the planet through bad management we created an economic crisis we created an environmental crisis we created an animal welfare crisis and believe it or not we created a human health crisis as well because everyone who worked here was stressed macleod recalls it was a perfect storm of crises i looked at it and thought there s got to be a better way of doing this while macleod and his team have spent the best part of a decade overhauling the management of wilmot s farms improving ground cover ensuring pastures get the right amount of rest it s only more recently that financial markets have latched on to the potential of soil carbon leading to the microsoft deal investors around the world are now talking about looking for investments that will deliver something over and above financial returns he says that s what s driving asx listed companies to say we ve got to find a solution to how we deliver shareholders financial returns but also something else advertisement the stokes family s seven group is an example in february it announced industrial subsidiaries coates and westrac would reach net zero emissions by 2040 chief executive ryan stokes says the target reflects a broader shift across industry and particularly the mining giants that buy westrac trucks and diggers both bhp and rio are targeting net zero emissions by 2050 we want to be a stronger partner with some of those customers who are very firm in those commitments stokes says goodman group the industrial property giant run by fellow rich lister greg goodman is similarly scrambling to keep up with customers in the logistics sector who are demanding warehouses that not only meet the new requirements of the e commerce boom but are also greener a warehouse at goodman s bungarribee industrial estate eastern creek nsw energy efficiency is vital another strategy is to build multi storey warehouses that have a smaller energy footprint these things are major moves and these moves are creating opportunities goodman says pratt cannily tapped the financial market s hunger for green investments many years ago by striking so called green bond deals essentially 30 year loans linked to sustainability targets with global pension funds which continue to press hard on such issues he believes 2021 has brought a new momentum to the movement in part this is driven from the top with pratt pointing to us president joe biden s ambitious green agenda as a big catalyst for change china is also aggressively tackling emissions for example it instantly shut down a raft of steel producers in march to curb emissions while europe has committed billions to post covid 19 decarbonisation projects and like the us is considering carbon tariffs locally prime minister scott morrison has come close to committing to net zero emissions by 2050 without quite getting there these changes are important but pratt also believes the momentum is coming from a more grassroots source ordinary consumers naturally enough he sees this most clearly through the prism of the humble cardboard box the changes the pandemic has brought to the way we live work and particularly the way we now shop have made consumers only too aware of waste pratt says the packaging ends up in someone s house when the consumer is receiving the box they are even more sustainability conscious than if it was thrown in the back of a supermarket advertisement this gets pushed up through the supply chain visy recently received a us30 million order from a large online retailer for 100 per cent recycled bags and has experienced a boom in demand for its paper based alternative to polystyrene demand for greater recycled content in bottles is also surging from customers such as drinks giants diageo they now rate sustainability in their top three key performance indicators it used to be a nice to have but now it s an essential kpi what s particularly fascinating about the preparedness of the wealthy to embrace sustainability is that in many cases they are taking leaps of faith macleod for example says soil carbon gives agriculture a chance to contribute to decarbonisation but he concedes there is a lot more work to do to refine the concept and more effectively monetise it there s a big question mark around what the potential is for soil carbon in terms of the extent to which it can help us with our carbon accounts but there s a big question as to how much hydrogen can help us too macleod says the journey is very exciting in terms of what potentially might result from this pratt likes to use the analogy of a toboggan when describing visy s approach to sustainability a toboggan starts slowly but then builds more and more momentum he also provides an important reminder of how capitalism can underpin environmentalism the man with a 20 billion fortune likes to stay paranoid by telling his family and his team that visy is only ever two years from bankruptcy from being wiped out by some new product that hasn t been invented yet the more sustainable he becomes the more efficient visy gets and the harder it can compete then the less likely its cardboard boxes can be replaced in the market most people think you ve got to choose between sustainability and profit and that they somehow are enemies pratt says i see them as mutually reinforcing advertisement carbon is soil s secret sauce could the solution to the agricultural sector s decarbonisation challenge come from the land itself that s the question being explored by alasdair macleod s wilmot cattle company which this year signed australia s biggest ever deal to sell its soil carbon credits to tech giant microsoft soil is a natural store of carbon there is more carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and all the world s plant life combined and regenerative farming has long focused on improving farm management to lift soil levels macleod joined the movement almost 20 years ago following a terrible drought the focus at wilmot s properties is on ensuring ground cover across its pastures is maintained software is used to manage the amount of rest that the pastures receive it s about ensuring we re maximising the productivity from our pasture while at the same time minimising any damage that we might be inflicting from overgrazing macleod explains the amount of carbon in wilmot s soil has more than doubled since 2012 the potential for soil carbon sequestration was further underlined last year when the federal government named it one of five priorities in its low emissions technology road map macleod praises that decision saying the level of interest in the potential for soil carbon has surged in the past 12 months there s a big opportunity for agriculture to demonstrate it can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem soil sequestration does have its doubters though and macleod is refreshingly honest about the amount of work still required to prove the technology including actually measuring soil carbon levels it is quite expensive to measure this accurately macleod says there s enormous potential the thing is we don t know enough about what the potential is find out who are australia s richest people in the

on the lawn of the county courthouse in waynesville north carolina is a rough stone memorial honoring the county s vietnam war dead engraved on this monument are the names of haywood county s sons who sacrificed their lives in the republic of south vietnam at the foot of this stone slab is a cast metal pair of unlaced combat boots many of the names inscribed on this simple memorial brown frazier moody rogers and others have echoed in haywood s hills and hollers for generations the ancestors of these dead men probably fought as well in american conflicts ranging from the american revolution to the korean war moreover many of the men whose names are written on this memorial undoubtedly have some relatives who knew them and who are still living brothers and sisters cousins and perhaps even children those few who remember these dead soldiers sailors marines and airmen surely recollect them as they were in their youth still saddened after 50 years by the loss of their loved ones and many of those who knew them and who now share the dust of this earth with them especially their parents and grandparents surely went to their graves still mourning the loss of these young men in their hearts the rest of us may think little of the sacrifices these men made some pedestrians passing the courthouse and other places of honor like it around our country may pause for a few moments to read the inscription and the names to look at the g i boots and even to say a prayer but most of us go about our daily business without giving too much consideration of those who came before us and who built our country especially those who saw service in the military and who paid with their lives in the wars we ve fought but then comes memorial day veterans carry a huge american flag during the 152nd memorial day parade in brooklyn n y on may 27 2019 johannes eisele afp via getty images a day of remembrance we celebrate memorial day on the last monday of may which allows us a three day weekend for various activities some head off to the beach some throw backyard barbecues or picnics in the park some watch stock car races and some take advantage of holiday sales and head for the local mall most of us also regard memorial day as the kick off for summer and on that day many do remember the dead of our wars the men and women who lost their lives fighting for their country arlington cemetery features a wreath laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier some cities host memorial day parades in places across the country such as waynesville some visit the graves of those fallen in our nation s wars both these groups are appropriately celebrating this day of commemoration those who honor the dead abide by the meaning of the holiday but those who take vacations or join together for a meal with friends are also paying their respects they are enjoying those american freedoms for which our men and women in uniform gave their lives a brief history though memorial day didn t become an official federal holiday until 1971 americans across the country for 100 years prior to that declaration had set aside time in the late spring to remember those who had died in the defense of our nation and our way of life the first calls for a memorial day or decoration day as it was then known came after the civil war in response to the enormous casualties suffered during that conflict in 1866 a year after the war s end waterloo new york first set aside a day when businesses closed and attention was paid to the graves of soldiers a hundred years later the federal government recognized waterloo as the birthplace of memorial day decoration day in st paul minn on may 31 1870 by charles alfred zimmerman public domain in may 1868 gen john a logan the leader of a large union veterans group declared may 30 as decoration day when americans should visit cemeteries and decorate the graves of dead soldiers whose bodies now lie in almost every city village and hamlet churchyard in the land by 1890 most states had proclaimed may 30 memorial day and regarded it as an official holiday southern states had their own memorial days but after world war i began to join the rest of the nation it was after that war as well that memorial day became an occasion for honoring all the dead of america s wars brave hearts some of these dead we commemorate on this day were heroes the farmers and merchants who died on lexington green in 1775 facing british regulars were some of our first american patriots frank luke jr famed for his balloon busting against the germans in world war i died after being shot down behind enemy lines and while firing his pistol at the approaching germans in the same war john pruitt captured 40 germans only to be slain later in the battle in 1943 army pilot neel kirby and three other comrades attacked nearly 50 japanese aircraft kirby shot down six of these planes received the medal of honor and died later that year in another aerial combat against the japanese sacrifice we honor these men for their bravery but on the last monday of may we also honor all of our nation s war dead the infantrymen who charged up the slope at the battle of fredericksburg the marines who fell fighting the germans at belleau wood the sailors and pilots lost while fighting the japanese at the battle of the coral sea the americans who faced the massive attacks of the chinese troops in the sub freezing temperatures of the korean war and all the others who have since given their lives in places such as hue kamdesh and fallujah our recent middle eastern conflicts have seen similar heroes killed in the line of duty several of these gave their lives for their comrades by throwing themselves on grenades or trying to rescue others from enemy fire on jan 25 2008 army staff sgt robert miller for instance was killed in afghanistan while providing cover so that his comrades in arms could escape enemy fire on dec 4 2006 ross mcginnis saved the lives of four of his fellow soldiers in iraq by smothering a grenade pitched into their humvee both men posthumously received the medal of honor we honor these men for their bravery but on the last monday of may we also honor all of our nation s war dead the infantrymen who charged up the slope at the battle of fredericksburg the marines who fell fighting the germans at belleau wood the sailors and pilots lost while fighting the japanese at the battle of the coral sea the americans who faced the massive attacks of the chinese troops in the sub freezing temperatures of the korean war and all the others who have since given their lives in places such as hue kamdesh and fallujah canadian john mccrae reflects the poignancy of these deaths in his world war i poem in flanders fields we are the dead short days ago we lived saw dawn felt sunset glow loved and were loved and now we lie in flanders fields instructing the young a young girl at the annual memorial day parade in staten island n y on may 25 2020 spencer platt getty images only the dead have seen the end of war george santayana s words often misattributed to plato are a grim reminder that we live in a dangerous world and that the young men and women of our military are the wall protecting america and her people as we pay homage to the dead of our many wars this memorial day partying over the weekend and perhaps remembering a friend or relative who made the final sacrifice we might engage in some other acts of recollection as well in particular we might set aside some time with our children or grandchildren and read them some of the stories of those who gave their lives for their country such accounts can be found in our public libraries or by searching online war means fighting and fighting means killing confederate cavalry leader nathan bedford forrest declared and we must never glorify the brutal business of war or soften its deadly costs at the same time however we must aim to raise young people willing to defend their country if called upon to do so learning about those who came before them who rallied to the flag should help inculcate that patriotism old glory while handing on these examples and stories to the young we can also use memorial day as an occasion to explore our own thoughts on patriotism what does it mean to be an american in 2021 what makes us americans what do the words life liberty and the pursuit of happiness mean to us how much value do we place on our bill of rights in the constitution on such natural rights as free speech or freedom of assembly and freedom of religion what do we owe this sweet land of liberty many of us will put flags in our yards or on our porches to honor memorial day as we look at those stars and stripes it s right and fitting we remember those who died in service to their country but it s also fitting that we remember why they died to find the answer to that question all we have to do is open our eyes and look around us at the people and places where we live both here and abroad as the line from the battle hymn of the republic tells us americans in uniform have died to make men free as their heirs we still possess our precious liberty in no small part because of the many sacrifices they made we can best repay the debt we owe them by keeping the fires of that freedom bright and burning

before coming out as nonbinary i never considered using the bathroom as an obstacle now it has become one of the most stressful parts of my life while i am accustomed to using women s restrooms at school every time i enter one i feel an onslaught of gender dysphoria i am not a woman and i have not identified as one for some time now but everytime i use a gendered bathroom i question the validity of my identity being able to use the restroom is vital to everyone but is especially important for trans and gender nonconforming students who may not feel comfortable using a gendered restroom on campus gender neutral bathrooms offer one solution in mitigating the violence trans people are subject to when using public restrooms they also offer much needed comfort to those who identify outside the gender binary according to 14 east magazine depaul first implemented single occupancy gender neutral bathrooms in 2015 as of the 2016 2017 school year only three buildings in the loop campus have gender neutral restrooms several buildings on depaul s lincoln park campus also offer gender neutral bathrooms according to bob janis the vice president for facility operations at depaul the university will add an additional gender neutral bathroom on the 12th floor of the daley building next spring the richard m and maggie c daley building located at 14 east jackson blvd has two gender neutral restrooms one on the ground floor and one in the basement o malley place at 23 e jackson blvd hosts depaul s college of law and has several gender neutral bathrooms throughout the building lastly depaul s merle reskin theatre offers one gender neutral bathroom however the building is blocks away from depaul s other loop buildings and only theatre school students can access them additionally these gender neutral facilities are not easily accessible to all depaul students many of the school s loop buildings have at least 10 stories and students have to navigate their way through the limited and often crowded elevators as a result many students may not be able to find a gender neutral restroom in a timely manner i think trans issues are the biggest one at the current moment that are not being respected and just gender identity in general said riley reed depaul s sga senator for lgbtq students so that is something i really want to emphasize and focus on and listen to anyone that wants to come forth and talk about their experience overall i want to make sure is as comfortable for people as possible and respectful of people s gender identities reed continued because it s not something that is that respected at depaul that i found pretty frustrating bathrooms albeit an often overlooked aspect of colleges and universities are an integral issue because every student deserves access to one without the fear of potentially violent confrontations or the psychological repercussions of using a restroom that does not align with one s gender identity as depaul has plans for students to return on campus next fall i am excited to resume classes in person however one of my main concerns is relying on public restrooms it sounds absurd but using the bathroom at school is one of my least favorite parts of my day while depaul offers some gender neutral bathrooms on both campuses they are single occupancy making it more difficult to find one that is available and more often than not it is easier for me to use the women s restroom one of my initiatives is accessibility just in general but also especially with this reed said not physically accessible a lot of people don t actually know where they are i think overall an amazing thing would be to just get rid of gendered bathrooms period violence towards trans people continues to increase around the world particularly towards trans women of color often violent confrontations occur in an attempt to prohibit trans people from using public restrooms beyond physical safety many trans and gender nonconforming individuals experience heightened distress and anxiety when using bathrooms that do not align with their gender identity leading to a slew of both physical and mental consequences according to the american medical association in a 2015 study on public restrooms the national center for transgender equality found that of the near 30 000 trans individuals surveyed 12 percent reported instances of assault and harassment in public restrooms 59 percent of individuals said they avoided public bathrooms out of fear of confrontation and 31 percent said they refrained from eating or drinking throughout the day so they did not have to use the bathroom in public as i continue to embrace my gender identity and my authentic self i have started to notice the ways my school supports lgbtq students and the ways it falls short in 2019 depaul s student government association implemented an initiative that would provide free period products in restrooms on campus while it is important to provide basic hygienic products for free they are only offered in the gender neutral and women s restrooms on campus according to depaul s facility operations which stocks the bathrooms with menstrual products they do not currently provide free tampons and pads in men s restrooms given that menstruation is not exclusive to women depaul needs to provide period products in all bathrooms including the mens in order to further support its trans students i definitely think that should be everywhere men menstruate too reed said i think a lot of people ignore that fact and may think that men that menstruate will use the women s bathroom and the gender neutral bathrooms but it s a total comfort thing of where you want to go and where you identify so if they want to use the men s bathroom 100 percent need to be in there reed echoed my concerns regarding the need for greater trans inclusivity on campus and depaul should accept initiatives to make campus more inviting for its lgbtq students more accessible gender neutral bathrooms and free period products in all bathrooms are simple yet important initiatives that will help make depaul s campus more comfortable for me and trans and gender nonconforming students alike i know there are queer support groups through the lgbt resource center but there needs to be so much more than that reed said i think that something with college is that it is a place that you really come into yourself seeing people grow from freshman to senior year is so incredible and you really come into your queer identity even just seeing myself growing in the last few years is a really important thing

a secret cache of clean energy is lurking in sewers and there are growing efforts to put it to work in the battle against climate change the u s department of energy estimates americans wash enough energy down the drain every year to power about 30 million homes the sources are often everyday items inside homes think hot showers washing machines and sinks evolving technology is making it easier to harness that mostly warm water denver is now constructing what is likely the largest sewer heat recovery project in north america according to enwave a canadian energy company set to operate the system over the next few years a 1 billion remodel will turn the 250 acre site home to the national western stock show and rodeo into a hub for art education and agriculture the revamped national western center will include about a million square feet of new indoor space all of which will be heated and cooled with energy from the sewer pipes below brad buchanan the ceo leading the redevelopment said the project has already changed how he thinks about the best location for real estate big pieces of sewer infrastructure have long repelled development now he imagines they might be sought out as a way to save energy costs and avoid greenhouse gas emissions the national western center estimates the project will help it annually avoid the carbon equivalent of driving an average gas powered car around the equator 250 times it ll be interesting to see if folks start to look at not just where light rail lines or good schools are located but what s the proximity to a large sanitary sewer line buchanan said hart van denburg cpr news cpr news the national western center negotiated rights in perpetuity to the thermal energy from sewers under its construction site it expects to save energy costs and avoid climate warming emissions how to mine for sewer heat the technology to harvest sewer heat isn t complicated at the national western center construction crews have already completed a pit exposing the main sewer line the wastewater inside stays a mild 55 to 75 degrees year round local officials say no matter the weather outside that consistent temperature can be tapped to heat and cool aboveground buildings the key is a massive heat pump which will be housed in a central plant on the campus the device works like a reversible air conditioning unit in the winter it will transfer energy from the sewage into a clean water loop connecting the buildings adding heat to indoor spaces the process can then be flipped to keep things cool in the summer and to answer an obvious question no the raw effluent is never exposed to the air so people occupying the buildings won t get hit with waves of sewer stink shanti pless a research engineer with the national renewable energy laboratory in golden colo said the technology opens up a vast world of renewable heat mining with the advent of large scale heat pumps we can cost effectively use say 70 degree wastewater to heat our buildings and our hot water systems pless said hart van denburg cpr news cpr news crews at work on the national western center denver s wastewater district now hopes to attract other developers with arrangements to heat and cool buildings with thermal energy from sewers rethinking how we heat and cool buildings pless said the biggest barrier isn t technology it s helping developers rethink the size of their heating and cooling systems sewer heat recovery often works best as the heart of a district size energy system where a central plant provides energy to a whole neighborhood or office complex denver itself shows how this kind of centralized strategy has fallen out of favor in the united states a 141 year old steam heat system warms many of the city s downtown buildings supplying energy from a central gas plant operated by xcel energy as costs to improve the system have landed on customers many building operators have disconnected from the steam service in favor of smaller independent heating and cooling systems nevertheless pless said district energy often makes sense but it requires a careful study of the energy needs and resources in a specific area nrel has developed tools to help communities model the viability of heat recovery systems he said the national western center could also help blaze a trail into the sewers this has been a great local example for us to take the idea to the rest of the country pless said a sewer energy gold rush if sewer energy catches on one reason could be the potential benefits for wastewater districts that s because warm sewage causes its own environmental problems in denver wastewater is often hotter than the south platte river its final destination after running through a treatment plant this thermal pollution can imperil native plants and wildlife mickey conway metro wastewater district manager said it d be possible to build cooling towers to chill the treated sewage but the national western center project could showcase a better alternative new homes and buildings could harvest this heat cooling the water while avoiding climate warming emissions and potentially reducing energy bills it s kind of a perfect storm of win win situations conway said metro wastewater has produced slick brochures to entice other developers with sewer heat conway said there are no solid plans just yet but the district has had discussions with denver and thornton a metro denver suburb meanwhile the national western center has moved to protect its supply in the event of a kind of sewer heat gold rush the city and county of denver a partner in the project exercised a three year option for exclusive access to the energy inside the pipelines running through the campus buchanan the project ceo said it amounts to a new sort of environmental resource instead of mineral rights or water rights his development holds sewer thermal energy rights we have it protected because we re

bloomberg back in february as the world was beating a path to taiwan s door for help to tackle a shortage of semiconductors the health minister got into a scrap with china over covid 19 vaccines beijing he suggested had used political pressure to derail taiwan s plan to purchase five million doses directly from germany s biontech se rather than via a chinese company which held the rights to develop and market the biontech pfizer inc vaccine across china hong kong macau and taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying retorted that taipei should stop hyping up political issues under the pretext of vaccine issues three months later taiwan is paying the price for a lack of vaccines with a surge in virus cases that threatens to trigger a lockdown having successfully sidestepped the first covid wave the government now faces a health emergency only about 1 of its population is vaccinated so far with the potential to disrupt the chip industry that dominates the local economy and which is critical to an already squeezed global supply that s a link made by the head of taiwan s office in new york who warned of logistical problems without access to more shots yet by shunning vaccines from china and warning of more chip shortages if it can t source enough doses elsewhere the government is giving even greater incentive to the world s biggest economies to make investments that may erode taiwan s competitive edge in semiconductors over the long term taiwan s predicament illustrates its strategic yet vulnerable position at the confluence of u s china tensions separated by a 110 mile 177 kilometer wide strait taiwan is regarded as a province by beijing and its conquest is president xi jinping s key goal for historical and ideological reasons the u s is an ally of taipei s democratic government and a big buyer of its exports dominated by chips produced by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co the onset late last year of chip shortages that have hobbled industries from autos to computer gaming had looked to give taipei global leverage tsmc is the world s leading provider of cutting edge semiconductors and holds 56 of the so called foundry business of manufacturing chips designed by customers including apple inc and qualcomm inc but taiwan has suffered a sudden reversal of fortunes the pandemic comes just as a drought triggers power outages stoking economic uncertainty and a slump in what was the world s best performing stock index in the four years to january read more the world is dangerously dependent on taiwan for semiconductors what s more the very source of taiwan s recent geopolitical clout its dominance of the market for cutting edge chips is under attack as governments from the u s to europe and japan alerted to the strategic nature of the semiconductor supply chain seek to spur production at home china is pumping billions into catching up after washington imposed export controls on u s chip technology i think we ve become too dependent on taiwan and korea that s the point we need a more balanced global supply chain pat gelsinger chief executive officer of silicon valley s intel corp the world s biggest chipmaker said in an interview the u s and europe should act more aggressively to counter the imbalance of asia s lead in manufacturing semiconductors that are mostly consumed in the west he said intel is a rival and plans to challenge tsmc at the cutting edge but gelsinger isn t the only voice making for uncomfortable listening in taiwan commerce secretary gina raimondo said this month that while the biden administration is working with taipei and tsmc to address the chip shortage it s also looking to reduce u s dependence on taiwan tsmc is in the process of building a new fabrication facility in the u s some in washington have suggested that taiwan is a backdoor to china by enabling tech transfers republicans michael mccaul and tom cotton have called on the administration to engage with taipei to do more to mitigate the risk of taiwanese companies providing services and technologies to entities of concern a reference to chinese state backed companies with links to the military with the prospect of some 50 billion in government funding to build out chip making in the u s and the promise of still more in europe and south korea there are signs that taiwan is starting to feel the heat the government is working to draft a new export control list targeting technologies with military use to tighten curbs on exports to china and raise the penalty for violations according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be named discussing policy deliberations that s after alchip technologies ltd s stock took a beating in april when the washington post reported that it supplied chips to phytium a people s liberation army affiliated entity alchip said it has always been in compliance with government regulations and that phytium projects were on hold taipei has become more alert to the possibility of chinese companies ramping up efforts to recruit taiwanese engineers last month the cabinet met to discuss how to prevent the outflow of local talent with the ministry of labor instructing local job search websites to remove ads recruiting taiwanese citizens to work for china particularly in the semiconductor industry companies and headhunters can be fined as much as nt 500 000 17 900 for advertising such jobs and nt 5 million for facilitating local engineers employment with chinese companies on the mainland ministry official huang chiao ting said job search site 1111 said it has removed close to 3 000 job listings investigators have visited the local offices of four chinese companies including bitmain technologies ltd within the last two months to look into allegations they recruited engineers illegally by more aggressively investigating chinese companies efforts to poach taiwanese engineers we hope we can help prevent potential trade secrets leaking to china should local talent get hired away said judy chen a spokeswoman for the hsinchu district prosecutors office she declined to name the other companies probed members of the ruling democratic progressive party are considering amending the law to boost penalties for intellectual property theft lawmaker chao tien lin is proposing life sentences for those found guilty of economic espionage a crime not currently on the statute books in taiwan taiwan needs to win trust from its partners and help prevent china from building a supply chain from stolen technology chao said in comments provided by his assistant whether it s enough to allay concerns in washington may become clearer with the publication of president joe biden s review of the semiconductor supply chain the 100 day review is due to conclude on june 4 what s already known is that there is bipartisan support to build u s chip making and taiwan is in the cross hairs taiwan dominates semiconductor manufacturing and one company taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company virtually controls the market senator john cornyn a texas republican who introduced the chips for america act to boost u s production said on the senate floor this month the sustainability of taiwan s industry has also come into question after it suffered power outages this month focusing attention on environmental factors including water shortages and uncertainty over future electricity supply for power hungry chip plants on monday shares in tech companies such as smartphone maker xiaomi corp and computer giant lenovo group ltd slid over concerns that taiwan s covid outbreak could further jeopardize semiconductor supplies read more the chip industry has a problem with its giant carbon footprint taiwan can potentially overcome the virus outbreak as well as the power and water shortages showing its companies can still satisfy global demand by manufacturing mostly in taiwan without any issue said arisa liu a researcher at the taiwan institute of economic research in the short term that will require vaccines on saturday the chairman of shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group co ltd the greater china distributor of the biontech pfizer vaccine told china s state run xinhua news agency that the company was willing to use the vaccine to serve taiwan compatriots but it s unclear if taiwan would now accept a vaccine deal that goes through fosun making it more likely any shots will come from europe or the u s according to chunhuei chi a former health policy adviser in taiwan who is now director of the center for global health at oregon state university many politicians in taiwan urged the taiwanese government to use microchips as leverage for vaccines while the government is reluctant to use that leverage explicitly he said if the u s is concerned about the supply of chips from tsmc the u s would have incentives to provide taiwan with vaccines to make sure production will not be disrupted by this outbreak updates

shanghai reuters cryptocurrency mining operators including huobi mall and btc top are suspending their china operations after beijing stepped up its efforts to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading sending the digital currency tumbling a state council committee led by vice premier liu he announced the crackdown late last friday may 21 the first time the council has targeted virtual currency mining a big business in china that accounts for as much as 70 per cent of the world s crypto supply crypto miners use increasingly powerful specially designed computer equipment or rigs to verify virtual coin transactions in a process that produces newly minted crypto currencies such as bitcoin bitcoin took a hammering after the latest chinese move and is now down nearly 50 per cent from its all time high it shed as much as 17 per cent on sunday before paring some losses and was last trading steady in asia investor protection and prevention of money laundering are particular concerns of governments and financial regulators which are grappling with whether and how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry united states federal reserve chairman jerome powell turned up the heat on cryptocurrencies last week last thursday he said they pose risks to financial stability indicating that greater regulation of the increasingly popular electronic currency may be warranted huobi mall part of cryptocurrency exchange huobi said in a statement late on sunday that all of its custody businesses have been suspended meanwhile we re contacting overseas service providers to pave the way for exports of mining rigs in the future huobi mall said via its official telegram community and asked clients not to worry and calm down btc top a crypto mining pool also announced the suspension of its china business citing regulatory risks founder jiang zhuo er said in a micro blog post via weibo that in the future btc top will conduct its crypto mining business mainly in north america in the long term nearly all of chinese crypto mining rigs will be sold overseas as chinese regulators crack down on mining at home he wrote
home prices are soaring at the fastest pace in over 15 years and a panic buying wave for homes has been inflating the real estate price bubble to levels never before seen entire swaths of the population are getting priced out of the market as affordable homes are now impossible to find as a result several experts and economists and most notably goldman sachs have been warning that housing prices must soon face a correction otherwise the market will be doomed to face a decades long hyperinflationary crisis the rapid worsening of the affordability crisis is worrying industry analysts who are arguing the current pace of home price appreciation is becoming increasingly unsustainable every time prices rise another month there s another sort of swath of the economy a swath of americans at that point who can no longer afford to buy homes explained zillow senior economist jeff tucker so as prices rise it does make homeownership a more exclusive club record low mortgage rates and remote work have contributed to an overwhelming demand from homebuyers over the past 17 months according to the real estate brokerage redfin in march we had the hottest month in housing market history with a record 43 of homes selling for more than their listing price almost half of the homes that went under contract had an accepted offer within one week after being listed all across the country homes are being immediately snatched up after hitting the market supply chain disruptions also helped the meteoric rise in building costs for new homes with lumber prices surging more than 200 in a year builders are now building as fast as they can but the u s housing market one year s worth of construction even with everybody firing on all cylinders just can t really make up for 10 or 12 years of under building tucker pointed out in massachusetts with each passing month buyers are getting more shocked in face of the soaring prices on the few homes that are still available one recent research released by the firm shows that during april a home in haverhill sold in 17 days after being listed and for 105 3 above the asking price those who cannot even consider the possibility of buying a home but have been looking for more space during the health crisis have started chasing rents as a more affordable alternative but data released by corelogic indicates that rents for single family homes in the us surged to the highest level since september 2006 jumping 4 3 in march compared with a year earlier led by double digit increases in several states the combination of all of the mentioned factors is aggravating the affordability crisis to the point of pushing the housing market closer to a sharp price correction affordable housing is typically defined as housing that costs 30 or less of a person s income but for lower income earners with such elevated prices that can be incredibly hard to achieve it s against that backdrop that goldman sachs has divulged its latest forecast indicating that if the fed doesn t hike interest rates to prevent the market from overheating the bank would expect that a national housing shortage will fuel substantial home price appreciation for at least a couple more years this means that if the fed continues to artificially boost the housing market by suppressing rates while injects trillions into the economy and financial markets hyperinflation will definitely make rents and housing prices hit one record high after the other until the bubble becomes so unsustainable that it would pop on its own in simple terms goldman is predicting that home prices will be rising at a pace far faster than the epic 2006 2007 housing bubble and that the effects of this surge in prices will make the coming hyperinflation anything but transitory in essence the bank s forecast suggests that the fed is left with two choices and neither of them looks good either they raise interest rates to fight inflation and trigger a housing market crash in that process so that prices finally readjust or they keep maintaining the market artificially heated and let the price bubble expands as much as it can possibly go before imploding itself and end up on a catastrophic bust and throughout that process not only real estate and rental markets would be facing exceedingly high prices but the entire economy as if it isn t already so whether they decide to mitigate the housing bubble explosion now or later the frantic rally is bound to culminate in a crash the only thing is the more the bubble grows the sharper will be its collapse we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

concord coal once the dominant fuel for heating buildings while driving industry in new england has faded almost entirely from view julie kinney can point to one remnant that she wishes would fade with it we have an ash pile right now at some point we ll have to talk with whoever moves here how to get rid of it said kinney for years kinney of derry n h has been part of the small segment of new hampshire residents small and getting smaller who heat their home with coal burned in small stoves or a boiler she chose a coal stove in 2005 for the same reason that it fueled the industrial revolution and heated a majority of american homes through world war ii it s powerful stuff packing more energy than almost anything this side of uranium the btus are incredible kinney said using the acronym of british thermal unit a measure of energy output i could heat my house all winter for about 1 000 and walk around in my knickers if i want to just ask harris energy in littleton n h which provides coal for heating to some 250 customers throughout new hampshire and vermont some as far as 100 miles away they are very glad they have it because of the amount of heat they put out said owner carroll lucas they say it s a little more work but i keep my house at 75 instead of 65 he said it takes about 1 7 tons of pellets to equal a ton of coal in terms of heating output but coal has a serious weakness it s dirty stuff burning coal for power and industry is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warping the climate and there s the pollution closer to hand as shown by kinney s ash pile burning coal pellets leaves behind 20 to 30 of their weight in ash at least 10 times the amount that s left by wood pellets when you empty the ash bucket you re like oh boy i shouldn t have dusted said kinney this is her last winter with coal she s about to switch to propane once common coal was once a major source of home heating in new hampshire as late as 1940 the u s census says 34 8 of state homes used it home coal use was just as common throughout much of the u s not to mention overseas london homes burned so much coal that they created the infamous london fog until the great smog of 1952 killed hundreds and led to that country s clean air laws in new hampshire it was oil and electricity and then natural gas that pushed out coal state officials estimate about 611 homes in new hampshire heat primarily with coal about one ninth of one percent of all houses in the state coal in new hampshire is now associated with merrimack station in bow which burns thousands of tons of it as the last coal fired power plant in new england fewer companies even make the stoves vermont castings for example dropped its model years ago and few stores sell them the demand was very limited said paul barlett a sales associate since 1979 at the stove shoppe in windham n h on why they stopped selling coal stoves a few years ago it wasn t always that way he said in the early 80s every monday night i used to do a coal burning class because we d sell 50 60 coal stoves a week he said the class reflected a complication with coal stoves they take effort it would take a couple hour class on how to burn it fill it how to empty the ash don t throw it in your garden it can t be used like that how to detect carbon monoxide problems indeed coal ash can be toxic its disposal is one of the major problems with burning the fuel in any amount plus if you do have a stove finding coal isn t easy since few stores stock the 40 pound bags of anthracite coal in sizes known as rice pea and nut or deliver it to homes with furnaces anthracite is the least dirty of all types of coal to turn and long ago replaced cheaper but dirtier bituminous coal in homes one of the few places where coal remains a healthy part of the business is harris energy in littleton which also provides oil and wood for heating we started as a truck a year we ve grown to provide between 300 and 500 tons of it a year maybe 250 customers said owner lucas to put that number in context the company has about five times as many customers who burn wood pellets as supplemental heat or a main heating source but he sells almost 10 times as many pounds of wood pellets lucas added coal to the company s mix of products when he bought it in 2006 after working there a half dozen years he knew there was enough business in the north country where natural gas pipelines haven t arrived some people have a coal stove or boiler in their house from 40 50 years ago some people got it back maybe 5 or 6 years ago when wood pellet stoves were so popular that manufacturers couldn t keep up with demand they wanted to get away from oil because of high prices he said there s no sign of the interest going away he said rare and getting rarer things are slightly different across the connecticut river where coal heat is just as rare a unh survey of vermont in 2019 found only 529 homes in the state that heated primarily with coal and 402 that had it as a second source vermont is trying to reduce that number through the coal change out program run through its vermont small scale renewable energy incentive program it pays up to 7 000 for homes and 27 000 for businesses to switch from burning coal to burning wood launched last july with 300 000 it is set to run out next month unless it is extended further from the clean energy development fund it has overseen 10 change outs said suzanne elowson the manager for the state s renewable energy rescource center david frank co owner of sunwood biomass in vergennes vt has performed a few of the change outs customer reasons have been varied concern about climate change is part of it since coal is the worst fuel source from the point of view of greenhouse gases but practical considerations hold sway a common thread is about coal being dirty and they re tired of handling it and frankly availability has become a problem he said really it s hard to imagine using coal up here that s a long way to bring it in littleton lucas says climate change isn t much of a factor in people s decision about whether to burn coal i ve never heard it from a customer up here i ve never had a customer say i love it but i hate the environmental impact of it he said in the big picture the environmental impact isn t terribly important the merrimack station power plant in bow burned about half a million tons of coal in 2018 which is more than 1 000 times as much as all of new hampshire s coal using homes combined if every one of those homes switched from coal tomorrow it wouldn t even be a rounding error in climate change statistics that s no reason not to make the switch however scientists agree that the sooner we stop burning fossil fuels for whatever reason the less we ll have to cope with generations of planetary damage even if it s not a major benefit it s a benefit although like many environmental choices it carries a little cost i ll miss that heat

asian sugar traders are facing growing uncertainty ahead of vietnam s antidumping policy announcement in june with market sources noting a rise in domestic prices amid depleting sugar inventory vietnam s ministry of industry and trade had conducted a public consultation on may 12 over antidumping investigations on thai sugar imports with the current duty structure on thai raw and refined sugar imports at 33 88 and 48 88 respectively the development came following a surge in thai sugar imports which impacted the country s domestic sugar industry although there are market rumors that the duties imposed on thai refined sugar might be halved to about 20 the information could not be verified at the time of writing the antidumping duty will be in effect for 120 days after the date of announcement need for imported sugar vietnam s domestic wholesale sugar price rose to vietnamese dong 16 500 16 700 kg 720 730 mt in may up by almost 10 12 from a month ago trade sources noted that the rise in domestic prices could suggest vietnam is running low on sugar stocks and have limited access to thai origin sugar vietnam faces a net shortage of sugar resulting in the need for vietnamese buyers to import sugar from other origins or from thailand platts analytics estimates vietnam s production unchanged at 700 000 mt in the current 2020 21 season and consumption at 1 7 million mt as of may 20 total imports of thai raws into vietnam during january may was at 122 052 mt compared to 228 929 mt in the previous year thai white and refined sugar imports into vietnam during the same period was at 135 953 mt down from 281 032 mt a year ago the relative competitiveness of thai sugar imports has diminished as vietnamese buyers pivot towards importing sugar of other asean origin including indonesian and malaysian origins concerns over cross border flows several sources familiar with the matter said that thai raw sugar is still entering into vietnam via traditional sea routes where buyers are paying the duties while most thai refined sugar has been entering vietnam through cross border trucking activities many countries such as laos and cambodia are selling sugar to vietnam by trucks so it is not the usual sea route a singapore based white sugar trader said despite the unfavorable circumstances prevailing for thai origin sugar the cash premiums for thai sugar have remained relatively supported s p global platts assessed thai hipol prompt shipment raw sugar at 190 points over the new york no 11 july futures hovering at 185 190 points in the month of may a trader in singapore said cross border activities have significantly slowed since may as rising covid 19 resulted in stricter border controls vietnam s demand is down a lot and buyers are just buying slowly because of covid 19 another factor is due to container freight as importers cannot get good freight rates a singapore based trader said on the subject of antidumping duties traders said that it will be of no benefit to the local industry should cross border inflow of sugar replaces imported sugar with antidumping duties i don t think antidumping measure is good because a lot of sugar will then go through the unofficial route their local sugar industry and the government will not benefit a hong kong based trader said source platts

with immediate effect mr hannigan joins a leading executive and advisory team that includes founder ceo and managing director mr anastasios taso arima mr hannigan has over 25 years of global experience in natural resources as company founder chief executive officer private capital investor and non executive director in these lead roles mr hannigan has helped build multiple billion dollar companies in the private and public markets he is a large shareholder and non executive director of piedmont lithium limited nasdaq asx pll executive chairman todd hannigan commented our team has made excellent progress on the exploration and evaluation of the titan project in tennessee and it is apparent that we have a project that is potentially global in scale and quality with critical minerals that could be sustainably produced in the heartland of the usa this strong foundation offers hyperion the potential to build a multi generational american critical minerals operation targeting high value titanium mineral sands such as rutile pseudo rutile and hi ti ilmenite as well as zircon and rare earth rich monazite our founder ceo and managing director taso arima has already founded two resource companies worth more than one billion dollars and hyperion has the hallmarks of his exceptional insight taso had the commercial acumen to quickly understand the scale of the larger opportunity that is available for low cost zero carbon titanium metals and powders there are multiple powerful industrial trends that intersect and offer incredible scale to this market opportunity the usa is nearly completely reliant on titanium feedstocks and titanium sponge metal imports as the largest consumer of titanium metal for aerospace space and defense this is not a sustainable nor defendable position for the leading economy of the world the production of stainless steel and aluminum is highly carbon intensive and produces large amounts of toxic waste that is typically held in tailings dams and sometimes disposed of at sea the world urgently needs low to zero carbon metals that are light strong corrosion free and recyclable that metal is titanium titanium is the superior metal across a wide range of high performance applications as it offers higher strength lower weight and corrosion resistance qualities that exceed nearly all metals and alloys the wide scale usage of titanium in applications that require strength and low weight such as electric cars has only been constrained by higher production costs and 3d printing or additive manufacturing is a technology innovation that has the potential to disrupt the global manufacturing sector it offers the potential to build products with less waste and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods this rapidly

united nations may 22 2021 ips education cannot wait ecw the global fund that brings teaching and learning to children in emergencies and protracted crises is observing five years of reaching boys and girls in some of the world s hardest hit conflict and disaster zones the initiative launched in 2016 sought to close a major gap in humanitarian funding for education at that time less than two percent of humanitarian aid was allocated for education although according to the united nations children s fund unicef 75 million children in crisis and war torn areas were in desperate need of education support ecw stepped in as a lifeline for millions of school aged children at risk of missing out on schooling five years later with health emergencies like the covid 19 pandemic adding to issues such as war protracted conflicts displacement and disasters this lifeline is more important than ever as the fund turns five ips speaks with ecw s executive director yasmine sherif on its landmark achievements efforts to scale up educational support during the pandemic and her vision for the next five years amid rising hunger and conflicts excerpts of the interview follow inter press service ips as you reflect on the fifth anniversary of ecw what do you think are some of the programme s most important achievements yasmine sherif ys that we actually reached those children and youth left furthest behind in some of the most complex crises on the globe and were able to invest in their quality education we speak of the girls in the countryside of afghanistan a country where girls now amount to 60 percent in our multi year resilience joint programme we were among the very first responders to the rohingya refugee influx in 2017 and were able to quickly provide them with educational services and psycho social support we made a huge leap forward in our investments in central sahel and across sub saharan africa where children and adolescents are constantly being forcibly displaced and their need for a holistic and whole of child education is a top priority and we were able to reach active conflict zones and sieges in syria in gaza in palestine and in yemen to deliver to those who would otherwise be considered unreachable ecw now has investments in 38 countries these results the difference we make in the lives of crisis affected girls and boys is our most important achievement and here i would like to stress that this would not have been possible unless we had over 20 strategic donor partners governments foundations and the private sector who steadfastly provided both strategic and growing financial contributions in the same vein without our close relationship with host governments communities civil society and the un agencies we could not have become such an action oriented global fund they are doing the real work on the ground thanks to ecw working with the long established un coordination mechanisms on both the humanitarian and development side we were able to rapidly grow and move with unprecedented speed education cannot wait ecw was among the very first responders to the rohingya refugee influx in 2017 and able to quickly provide them with educational services and psycho social support pictured here is mohammad rafique along with other refugee children gathered at the rohingya market of kutupalong camp the photo was taken last march just two weeks before bangladesh went into a nationwide lockdown in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus credit rafiqul islam ips ips what are some of the main challenges that ecw is facing as it strives to educate children in emergencies ys access is always a challenge in countries affected by crisis especially armed conflict in countries like the central african republic or yemen you have different factions and different control over different territories in such situations of emergency you need to apply humanitarian principles to their utmost we are there supporting our colleagues in country to focus on the children and youth and their right to an inclusive quality education they are our priority lack of infrastructure and digital access is also a challenge in sub saharan africa for instance however the overarching and biggest challenge is financing if all of ecw s multi year resilience programmes which are joint programming between humanitarian and development actors across africa asia the middle east and south america were fully financed we could reach 16 million girls and boys with an inclusive quality education rather than the current five million more funding means more children and youth more girls more children with disabilities more refugee children are finally accessing their right to sustainable development goal sdg 4 quality education and with that additional development goals such as rising from extreme poverty being empowered by gender equality and through education ready to bring peace and justice to their societies ips ecw announced this month that through a 300 000 acceleration grant psychosocial support would be extended to children in emergencies alongside education how important is mental health support to these boys and girls ys mental health and psychosocial support is a top priority most children and adolescents if not all are traumatised by protracted armed conflicts forced displacement and climate induced disasters imagine what they have gone through and are forced to keep going through as a child or a young person you see your family members killed your home destroyed militia roaming around trafficking bombs and rockets forced recruitment and fleeing in haste across the border to another country what does that do to a young person s mind it traumatises them and severely impacts on their ability to feel safe and learn in a safe environment unless we address their traumatic experiences provide them with mental health and psychosocial support very little learning can take place trauma and chronic stress can either break them or make them with mental health and psychosocial support along with several other components such as social and emotional learning academic learning sports arts school feeding protection safe learning environments and empowered teachers who also suffer by the way we can empower them to make it through the difficult situations they face and reach their potential without this support their direction in life will most likely go the other way and break them leading them to only survive rather than thrive ips according to unicef refugees are five times more likely to be out of school than other children with girls facing unique risks tell me a bit about ecw s focus on gender equity in education in emergency settings ys refugees and internally displaced make up 50 percent of ecw s investments we follow populations those left furthest behind that is our starting point and added value among them girls in secondary school are amongst those most left furthest behind at the refugee forum in 2019 we committed together with the world bank and the global partnership for education to jointly advance refugee education especially refugee girls in ecw we have taken affirmative action and set the target of 60 percent of girls and adolescent girls in all ecw s investments but it is not just about numbers or percentages we also focus on protection measures for girls and adolescent girls training of teachers and sanitation facilities we also need to work with teachers men and boys to advance girls education to sensitise them to girls right to safety respect and encouragement to succeed academically i meet so many inspiring adolescent girls in my travels to our investments in various countries who once they complete their education will become powerful leaders in their communities and countries to see them speak up fiercely for their right to an education and finally be able to exercise it is very rewarding and brings hope they are the ones we have been waiting for to paraphrase alice walker ips as you look ahead to the next year or next five years what is your vision for ecw and for the boys and girls you support ys coming back to results and making a real difference the vision is to reach at least 2 3 of the children and youth of whom 50 percent are girls in the most crisis affected parts of the globe and secure for them an inclusive continued quality education but this will require making education in emergencies and protracted crisis a top priority for financing by governments the private sector and philanthropists without the finances we cannot reach these girls and boys yet with financing all is possible in the coming five years ecw which is already a one billion dollar fund counting trust fund and in country contributions combined will need billions more to change the world that is the key for this vision deserving and urgently needing billions in investments if we want to close the gap on the sdgs we need to start by investing in quality education sdg 4 for those left furthest behind through such investments we are also investing in multiple other sustainable development goals without it none of the other sdg s can be attained it is logically impossible more broadly i see the experiment or innovation of the education cannot wait fund which was conceived and pursued by the un special envoy for global education gordon brown who serves as chair of ecw s high level steering group together with governments like the united kingdom canada the united states un agencies civil society and foundations setting the example this was a vision of impatience to reach those left furthest behind a vision of less bureaucracy and more accountability and a vision of breaking silos and of finally working together and in doing so place education at the forefront of international financing we are moving in this direction and in five years i hope the larger part of those who care for the world will have joined ecw in the quest that every child every girl every boy every youth who today suffers in wars forced displacement and in sudden climate induced disasters will see the light of an inclusive and whole of child driven education that is how we change the world and make it a better more peaceful stable and just place for the human family this vision is priceless related ips articles the post q a reflecting on five years of educating children in the throes of crises emergencies and displacement appeared first on financial

in northeastern quebec 2 500 arcelormittal workers have been on strike since may 10 the strikers who work in mines port facilities rail lines and offices belonging to the luxembourg based multinational are represented by five locals of the united steelworkers usw métallos and are affiliated with the quebec federation of labour qfl the largest labour organization in quebec with more than 600 000 members the strike follows workers unequivocal rejection of arcelormittal s final and comprehensive offer workers voted against the company s may 7 offer by percentages ranging from 97 percent to 99 percent union bargaining committees had recommended that the offer be rejected but that was only under pressure from rank and file members who had overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement negotiated by the steelworkers on may 1 just 10 days earlier the usw had urged workers to accept the earlier offer even though it was inferior to the one massively rejected on may 10 details of the company s offers have not been released according to arcelormittal the tentative agreement supported by the usw called for wage increases totalling 12 percent over four years which at best would have amounted to a freeze in real wages given the increase in the cost of living as for the union it only said that the issues at stake in the contract negotiations include working conditions pensions and insurance bonuses and work schedules in 2017 workers voted 83 percent in favor of a new four year contract that contract contained wage increases ranging from 2 2 to 3 percent per year and continued defined benefit pension plans although the employer had pressed for them to be transformed into defined contribution plans with no guaranteed pension amount upon retirement usw regional coordinator nicolas lapierre called the 2017 agreement a major victory trust has been restored we re back for four years the tentative agreement is clearly satisfactory now as workers anger demonstrates that the 2017 agreement was in reality no victory the same usw bureaucrats are reduced to pleading that the workers poor conditions are the result of promises made during the 2017 negotiations went unfulfilled the union however has not seen fit to explain why these promises were not written into the collective bargaining agreement or if they were why the union has not enforced their compliance including through job action arcelormittal workers must learn from these experiences they will not be able to reverse the attacks on their working conditions by letting a pro capitalist union beg for satisfactory crumbs on their behalf the workforce at one of quebec s most profitable production facilities have enormous potential power moreover the objective conditions exist to broaden their struggle and make it the spearhead of a working class counteroffensive against the ever widening big business government assault on jobs working conditions workers social rights and public services in 2016 the company cited iron ore prices of less than 60 per tonne to demand concessions canceled planned investments and threatened to shut down its operations in northeastern quebec 15 years earlier than planned today iron ore is worth more than three times what it was then reaching historic highs of more than 193 per tonne but the company is still asking workers to be reasonable and not raise any demands that might impact on its profits arcelormittal the world s second largest steel producer and according to forbes magazine s 2019 rankings its 120th largest company has benefited massively from staggering increases in iron prices the multinational company earned net profits of nearly us 2 3 billion in the first three months of 2021 an increase of more than 1 billion over the already large profit of 1 2 billion that it made in the last quarter of 2020 arcelormittal is about 40 percent controlled by lakshmi mittal an indian born billionaire now living in england he is the 196th richest person on earth with an estimated fortune of us 9 7 billion according to the 2020 forbes ranking mittal is soon to be replaced by his son aditya mittal as ceo of arcelormittal a position that earned him us 6 2 million in total compensation in 2019 the company announced that it has made share buybacks of 650 million in the first few months of 2021 and that 570 million will be used for the same purpose during the rest of the year share buybacks are a form of speculation in which the company buys back its own shares to push up the stock price thereby benefiting shareholders the company also intends to pay a dividend of 0 30 per share which will funnel hundreds of millions of additional dollars into shareholders pockets arcelormittal s share value has jumped 168 percent in the past year the ruling class is joining forces to put pressure on the striking workers as soon as the strike began quebec labour minister jean boulet expressed concern that a long strike would have a major impact on the entire economy of north shore quebec and the province as a whole in the first days of the strike police issued hefty tickets to picketers on the grounds that they had violated the province s anti covid 19 curfew when they picketed at night to ensure management did not bring in scabs or otherwise violate quebec s anti scab law workers observed that in the weeks prior to the strike the police and the coalition avenir québec caq government had had no objections when arcelormittal made them work night shifts and overtime to increase its profit margins in response to these provocations steelworker officials have simply repeated that they are ready to return to the bargaining table they are thus playing the role assigned to the union apparatuses by the ruling class that is to contain and suppress rank and file opposition so it does not go beyond the pro employer state enforced collective bargaining framework in 2018 19 the usw and qfl betrayed the courageous struggle of workers at the abi aluminum smelter in bécancour quebec who were locked out by the alcoa rio tinto alcan joint venture for 18 months the unions did everything they could to isolate the abi workers anti concessions struggle they urged them to focus on making pathetic appeals to alcoa and rio tinto shareholders and systematically divided them from alcoa and rio tinto workers in australia spain and the united states who were waging similar struggles against management attacks instead as the quebec union bureaucracy has done for decades it peddled the poison of quebec nationalism claiming that premier françois légault and his hard right caq government were a potential ally of the workers that could be persuaded to come to their aid légault a multimillionaire and former air transat ceo responded by taking an openly pro employer stance and publicly denouncing the workers fat salaries and their inflated demands isolated and exhausted abi workers finally reluctantly voted for a deal full of concessions including pension cuts to counter the usw s deliberate isolation of their struggle and demobilization tactics arcelormittal workers must form a rank and file strike committee and elect trusted workers to it this committee should demand that all negotiations between the steelworkers and arcelormittal be held in public in addition since the union has already demonstrated that it is willing to negotiate tentative agreements that run counter to workers demands the rank and file committee should demand that no future company offer or tentative agreement be submitted for a ratification vote without workers having at least two weeks to study it in advance the committee s most essential task must be to broaden support for the strike by forging links with workers elsewhere in quebec canada and internationally who are resisting the employer drive to squeeze greater profits from workers explicitly rejecting the unions reactionary quebec nationalism the arcelormittal strikers should make a special appeal to the 1 300 steelworkers at allegheny technologies in pennsylvania and four other us states who have been on strike against company demanded concessions for two months they must also build solidarity with arcelormittal workers in europe and the united states who have also been exposed to ruthless attacks by the multinational giant during the pandemic one example of this came last august when the company announced the destruction of over 800 jobs at its us facilities everywhere the covid 19 pandemic has confronted workers with the irrationality of the capitalist system the ruling elite has systematically prioritized profit over saving lives and is now exploiting the pandemic s economic fallout to amplify their attacks on jobs wages pensions and working conditions in every country this fact is expressed with particular clarity at multinational corporations like arcelormittal which scour the globe for the cheapest and most productive labour power and exploit the rotten nationalist corporatist politics of the unions in every country to pit miners and steelworkers against each other along national lines only in a unified political struggle with their class brothers and sisters across canada the us and overseas can the striking arcelormittal workers resist the company s global onslaught in this way their struggle can serve as a catalyst for an international worker led counteroffensive against capitalist austerity and for a complete reorganization of the economy to place the social needs of working people and their families ahead of the corporate drive for ever greater profit

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel political battles have clouded the scientific realities of vaccine manufacturing which by itself point to a fairly clear picture that the situation will improve only july onwards until then daily vaccination numbers will remain at undesirable levels despite some incremental improvement so why were then daily vaccination numbers better last month than now the reason for that is on april 1 india had an opening stock of about 15 million doses which had piled up through february and march owing to modest rates of vaccination for various factors including low infection rates and vaccine hesitancy the demand soared in april due the second covid 19 wave but availability of reserve stocks helped bolster capacity even though production remained at the same levels by may 1 however all stocks including the reserves had been exhausted so vaccination began this month with a zero balance relying completely on current levels of production the target for this month was in the vicinity of 80 82 million doses hugely dependent on covishield production of about 65 million doses until friday those in the know of the details told et that serum institute of india sii had provided over 38 million doses and another 26 million were in the pipeline so it would probably meet its target bharat biotech for its part had supplied nearly 7 million doses and was likely to supply an equal number of doses by month end the details aside what s important to understand is that vaccines are produced not in a continuous cycle but in batches this means the monthly target at the start of the month won t be available from day one itself because of the fact that vaccines are produced in batches the availability cannot be spread out evenly across all days of the month they usually get bunched up so when a batch rolls out the availability automatically increases and consequently more doses are pushed through the system which is why availability may appear better on some days of the month than others this whole system therefore follows a complex production distribution cycle which also includes mandatory testing of samples in each batch apparently in the month of may the cycle is such that more batches become available towards the second half of the month so what s the big expectation in july the key to ramping up production is getting the infrastructure which means new bioreactors so that more batches can be processed of course proportionate raw material and ingredients should also be available which is why the conversation with the united states is so vital the government s big bet on this score is on covaxin touching a production level of 70 75 million doses in july in fact a large part of india s vaccination target for the entire year rests on bharat biotech scaling up its current production by 10 times only then will it catch up with sii as an equal partner in the inoculation effort politically therefore it s important to understand that this effort will take time simply because the processes have to meet very strict global health standards so for instance the onus will be on bharat biotech to ensure that facilities being made available to it meet covaxin s quality and safety markers one batch going wrong could put the entire exercise in jeopardy also vital to acknowledge is the fact that there is a global vaccine shortage so imports are difficult countries that have pre ordered are still struggling to get stocks which means that india s inoculation programme will for a large part and good measure be dependent on covishield and covaxin and if that s the case then an atmosphere of political support not rancour may serve the cause better
as squarespace prepares to launch its first ever australia specific campaign mumbrella spoke to the company s vp of creative ben hughes to get an insight into managing a campaign from the kitchen at 3am entering a foreign market and figuring out australian slang while it is uncommon for a company as big as squarespace to keep all of its creative operations in house but from an emmy award winning campaign with john malkovich to winning 2020 adage a list in house agency of the year it seems to be going pretty well for them working closely with chief creative officer david lee hughes leads the team at squarespace that creates all of the company s advertising brand design and content hughes joined squarespace three years ago from stink studios working as executive creative director previously working at west b reel and strange industries amongst others advertisement squarespace creates an annual super bowl ad and is known for often enlisting some of the globe s biggest stars from the aforementioned malkovich keanu reeves idris elba and oscar the grouch in the midst of a big week for the company which saw squarespace inc sqsp n valued at us 6 5 billion a 8 36b in its market debut on the new york stock exchange hughes spoke of a new kind of challenge for his team of creatives today is the official launch of make a name for yourself the campaign which plays off of the australian phenomenon of giving everything and everyone a string of nicknames in entering a new market hughes said that the number one consideration has to be making sure you re connecting with people in a real way as it is too easy to tell who has and who hasn t done their research as a new yorker i hate when brands show up with a bunch of lazy insights that were clearly sourced from seinfeld reruns for this campaign we were lucky to have a lot of research to draft off of as well as local partners and native australians on our team who deftly steered us away from clichés the end product was two films both described by squarespace as following the personal journey of a protagonist and the nicknames they receive throughout their life the resolution is how the protagonist has been able to launch a business online with squarespace and not just take a name but make a name for themselves contrasting the experience of being given nicknames your whole life and the journey of an entrepreneur hughes said the result is a classic coming of age story where the hero learns to define him or herself instead of letting other people do it for them in developing a campaign specifically for the australian market it certainly helps to have a few around who can help make sense of a few of our peculiarities the other big learning was the idea of tall poppy syndrome to be honest it s a pretty foreign concept for americans because we re basically told from birth that we were put on this planet to be the very best but that s also what made it interesting the two ads go live on australian tv today 24 may following roberto the dance instructor and sarah who owns a hair dye business the ads were shot in australia led by director sam hibbard but the whole operation was still run out of squarespace s new york office which meant a change of strategy for the team staring at an ipad at three in the morning while your kids are sleeping isn t as glamorous as being on set in sydney but the fact that the process works at all is remarkable hughes said it is not just working with a team on the other side of the world that is new developing campaigns during the pandemic has proved to be a challenge for everyone according to squarespace research has shown e commerce in australia has grown at accelerated rates as a result of the pandemic with businesses increasingly opting for an online presence and for a company that exists solely as an online product business never stopped i m really proud of the fact that we ve made some of our best work during the pandemic when you shoot remotely you have to give up some control and really trust your partners but that can lead you to places you never could have gone yourself in catering directly to the australian market the online website builder wants to show australians what makes squarespace stand out our differentiator is design we give our customers the tools to build businesses and sell online but also the ability to stand out that s crucial especially for people who are just starting because having a polished beautiful site makes you look professional right from the jump that s why it made sense here to tell stories of people who were at the beginnings of their journeys as entrepreneurs and finally without being able to visit australia during the process of creating the make a name for yourself campaign ben was still able to come away with an inside look into some australian quirks on our treatment call with sam he told us that he wasn t here to fuck spiders and i will not rest until i understand the origins of that incredible turn of phrase the new australian campaign will be run across tv radio online and socials from today updated a correction was made to the market value for squarespace at entry onto the nysx
miami the new england patriots team plane has delivered 500 000 chinese made covid vaccines to el salvador and in the process inadvertently inserted itself into a testy geopolitical fight for influence in latin america the pats plane was greeted upon arrival in san salvador early wednesday just after midnight by china s top diplomat to the tiny central american country the team says it had been aware of the flight but didn t arrange it that was done by a company that leases out the plane when the patriots aren t using it while the boeing 767 emblazoned with the six time super bowl champions red white and blue logo drew much of the local and international media attention when the cargo bay opened to offload a huge crate bearing chinese script ambassador ou jianhong said china would always be a friend and partner of el salvador her comments were a not so subtle dig at the biden administration which in recent weeks has slammed president nayib bukele over the removal of several supreme court magistrates and a top prosecutor which it warned undermines el salvador s democracy bukele who hasn t been shy about leveraging budding ties with china to seek concessions from the u s touted the vaccine delivery el salvador s fourth from beijing since the pandemic began in several social media posts to date the country has received 2 1 million doses from china but not a single shot from the u s its traditional ally and biggest trading partner as well as home to more than 2 million salvadoran immigrants go pats bukele tweeted out thursday with a smiling face with sunglasses emoji even though the team itself had almost nothing to do with the flight across latin america china has found fertile ground for so called vaccine diplomacy that seeks to turn back decades of u s dominance the region is the hardest hit in the world from the virus with eight countries among the top 10 deadliest on a per capita basis according to our world in data an online research site meanwhile a deep recession has wiped out more than a decade s worth of economic growth and governments in several nations are facing mounting pressure and even violent protests from voters outraged by the failure to control surging infection rates this week the u s china economic and security review commission which advises congress on the national security implications of china s rise warned that the u s needed to begin sending its own vaccines to the region or risk losing support from longtime allies the chinese have made every delivery to an airport tarmac into a photo op r evan ellis a china latin american expert at the u s army war college strategic studies institute told the panel on thursday the president comes out and the boxes roll off with chinese flags on them so the chinese unfortunately have done a much better job marketing stacey james a patriots spokesman said the team played no direct role in the vaccine s delivery and dismissed suggestions it was picking sides in a geopolitical fight last year at the start of the pandemic patriots owner robert kraft brokered a deal with china using one of the team s two planes to transport 1 million n95 masks from shenzhen to boston the plane when not in use by the team is leased for chartered flights by philadelphia based eastern airlines james said it s great to be associated with positive missions to deliver vaccines where they re needed said james but this wasn t a political mission as part of its vaccine diplomacy china has pledged roughly half a billion doses of its vaccines to more than 45 countries according to an associated press tally and just four of china s many vaccine makers claim they are able to produce at least 2 6 billion doses this year u s health officials haven t certified the chinese vaccines as effective and secretary of state antony blinken has complained about china s politicization of its vaccine sales and donations meanwhile democrats and republicans alike have harshly criticized china s human rights record predatory trade practices and digital surveillance as a deterrent to closer ties but many in the developing world struggling to inoculate their populations have little tolerance for the badmouthing of china and accuse the u s of hoarding western made shots president joe biden on monday pledged to share an additional 20 million vaccine doses of its own stocks in the coming six weeks bringing the total u s commitment abroad to 80 million countries in latin america are also grateful for chinese investment in major infrastructure projects

introduction zinc oxide zno nanoparticles np have shown promise at inactivating bacteria at a time when the number of new antibiotics in development is decreasing and more worryingly there is increasing prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics currently used 1 based on their ability to inactivate bacteria zno np have already been successfully incorporated into a number of biomedical applications such as in water treatment2 and wound sterilization 3 4 zno np mechanism of bacteria inactivation is thought to be an interplay between a number of processes physical interaction and or electrostatic attraction of the nanoparticle with the bacteria surface resulting in irreparable damage 5 generation of reactive oxygen species ros from the nanoparticle surface interaction with surrounding liquid water due to electron hole pair formation upon ultraviolet uv photon absorption 6 and partial dissolution of the nanoparticles in solution releasing zinc ions zn2 that diffuse across the cell membrane in high concentrations to disrupt normal cell function and cause damage to intracellular biomolecules 7 each individual process alone has the potential to inactivate bacteria under certain conditions but often they work in synergy it is this cumulative effect that is expected to ultimately result in bacteria inactivation the influence that each process has on the antibacterial mechanism is dependent on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles which can differ greatly depending on the synthesis technique multiple characterizations and analyses are often used in attempts to elucidate these properties and understand how exactly they govern the mode of interaction with bacteria small scale synthesis of zno np with unique physicochemical properties has been reported using a range of different techniques such as microwave heating technology 8 atmospheric pressure plasma9 and wet chemistry based methods in bulk liquid like hydrothermal growth method 10 nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical techniques can produce a wide variety of novel morphologies due to the higher influence on chemical reactions in the synthesis procedure and these morphologically complex structures can enhance photocatalytic and antimicrobial properties 11 morphological dependency of photocatalytic activity was reported for zno np synthesized via hydrothermal growth method by adjusting different ratios of zinc salt sodium hydroxide naoh and capping agents or chemicals to achieve the different nanostructures 12 flower like zno np under uv irradiation had the highest reaction rate and degraded organic dye methylene blue more rapidly than needle or sword shaped structures it was attributed to more irregularly scattered surface zinc sites which enhanced the reactivity tetra needle like zno structures were found as the most efficient morphology at degrading sulfamethazine under uv illumination compared to flower like or spherical nanoparticles 13 in another study also with additional uv irradiation zno nanostructures in hexagonal disc shapes were found to have greater photocatalytic effect than rod shaped crystals whereas particle size was less of an influence 14 antibacterial effect of zno is influenced not only by the particle morphology but also by the surface topology and it does not require additional uv illumination zno nanorods were shown to be more bactericidal than spherical nanoparticles with many bacteria impaled by the rods when there was dynamic mixing of the bacteria nanoparticle suspension yet there was no antibacterial effect when the interaction was static 15 the same sharp nanorods with tip diameters of less than 10 nm exerted considerable pressure up to 10 mpa on the outer cell wall of bacteria when continuously mixed in solution 16 elsewhere zno films composed of nanoscopic needles exhibited greater potential to inhibit bacteria biofilm formation compared to micron length flakes 17 and the surface broadness and protrusion of petals in flower like formations were considered responsible for the differences observed in the antibacterial effect of zno structures 18 zno nanoparticles composed of many individual nano sized needle clusters have been synthesized via the hydrothermal growth technique that have a typical crystal wurtzite structure and high purity 10 particle diameter was estimated from electron micrograph images to be approximately 10 µm and the needle like structures appeared to grow outward from a central nucleation point analysis of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps data revealed typical zn 2p peaks and the observed full width half maximum of these peaks indicated the presence of zn2 it has been reported that zno np with smaller diameters were more bactericidal than larger particles the interpretation was that smaller particles transfect through the cell membrane and become internalized more easily than larger particles as well as that the higher surface area to volume ratio could generate more reactive oxygen species 3 based on these prior findings one can assume that particle shape and size may have a certain positive influence on the antibacterial effect of zno however this effect is not completely understood due to the complexity of such studies and variety of zno materials employed our prior studies have hinted at particle shape and size dependency on the antibacterial effect of zno in microbial growth broth with standard unidirectional orbital rotation shaker19 and a concentration dependency for nanosized zno in water with bidirectional reverse spin rotation mixing 20 in this study we thus aim to elucidate the influence of zno particle shape size and concentration on the ability to inhibit growth of bacteria in a range of different environments using synthesized needle like zno structures and commercial zno particles without using illumination we assess the antibacterial efficacy of those zno materials by varying also the zno concentration by characterization under both static and dynamic interaction regimes materials and methods in this section we describe in detail the different types of zno particles used in this study and the preparation of stock solutions we also provide information on the bacteria strains used to assess the antibacterial effect of the zno particles and outline the different techniques that were used zinc oxide preparation zinc oxide particles with needle like cluster formations further referred to as hedgehog zno hh were synthesized by the hydrothermal growth technique according to the published protocol including extensive post synthesis characterization 10 briefly equimolar aqueous solutions of 25 mm zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no 3 2 6h 2 o and hexamethylenetetramine hmta were maintained at 90 c for 3 h precursor salt residue was removed from the sample by washing 3 times with deionized water followed by centrifugation at 18 000 rpm rcf 23542g for 20 min finally the supernatant was removed and the remaining material was dried by lyophilization and ready for use in the antibacterial tests two commercially available zno particles 50 nm nano spheres ns sigma aldrich germany and 10 µm micro grains mg us research nanomaterials inc houston u s a were also tested for comparison stock solutions of 2 mg ml and further dilutions thereof were made using deionized water dh 2 o conductivity 0 05 nevertheless there was no significant differences observed in bacteria cell numbers exposed to all concentrations of zno on agar even for the highest concentration tested 1 mg ml the same concentration of zno did reduce viable cell concentration in the reverse spin bioreactors see figure 1 figure 6 bar graphs showing the number of a e coli and b s aureus bacteria on an agar surface loaded with different concentrations of 3 types of zno hh hedgehog ns nanospheres and mg micrograins error bars correspond to the standard deviation of the mean p 0 05 for all discussion there are several extensive review articles that provide an overview of the possible mechanisms involved in antibacterial effects of zinc oxides 11 22 26 these mechanisms include the photocatalytic properties of zno reactive oxygen species ros generation zinc ion toxicity surface charge particle shape particle size and concentration and the dynamics of the bacteria material interaction owing to the typical energy band gap of 3 4 ev zinc oxide strongly absorbs ultraviolet uv light and electrons from valence band are excited to the conduction band via photon absorption the formation of electron hole pairs at the zno surface can lead to interactions with nearby water molecules initiating a complex cascade of chemical reactions that result in ros generation all antibacterial tests in this study were performed indoors under ambient light conditions without uv irradiation od measurements and viable bacteria concentrations were obtained from a tube which was completely shielded from light whereas the static interaction antibacterial tests mic and zno on agar were exposed to indoor light for a short time and then placed inside a thermostat in the dark whilst some ros have been measured in solutions of zno nanoparticles in the dark 27 the generated concentrations are too low to cause bacteria inactivation 28 based on these findings photocatalytic processes cannot be responsible for the observed antibacterial effects in our experiments zinc ion release from partial dissolution of the nanoparticle in aqueous environment has also been reported to be involved in the antibacterial mechanism 7 bacteria possess homeostasis mechanisms to regulate intracellular zinc ion concentration 29 and as a result it requires millimolar concentrations to become toxic to bacteria 30 in our experiment we measured the zinc ion concentration in mh broth well below this range between 5 5 8 5 µm it has been reported previously that for the highest concentration of zno nanoparticles tested in this study 1 mg ml the concentration of zinc ions produced in bacteria growth medium was 60 µg ml31 and the concentration generated scaled inversely with particle size 32 considering these data we assume that zinc ions play only a limited role in bacteria inactivation in our experiments the electric charge on the surface of zno particles can influence the interaction mechanism with other charged surfaces such as a bacterial membrane 33 the bacterial membrane has a net negative charge on the outside and particles with negatively charged surfaces exhibited lower antibacterial capability than similarly sized positively charged nanoparticles we confirmed this hypothesis in our prior research where positively charged hydrogenated nanodiamonds were more bactericidal than negatively charged oxygenated nanodiamonds 34 we previously measured the zeta potential of all the zno particles used in this research in mh broth and we observed negative values ranging from 17 5 mv for ns to 11 7 mv for hh 35 in another of our studies e coli zeta potential in mueller hinton was measured to be 8 mv 34 elsewhere the zeta potential for s aureus in phosphate buffered saline was measured as also negative 33 this would make electrostatic attraction between both negatively charged bacteria surfaces and zno surfaces unfavorable and we thus assume that electrostatic interactions are not dominant in the antibacterial mechanism of zno in our system the differences in the antibacterial effect of different zno particles in this study may be further explained by the different shape and size of the particles as well as concentration and interaction dynamics the morphology of the synthesized zno hedgehog particles appears to be the predominant feature that influences how it inactivates bacteria they are composed of many needle clusters and we observed from sem images that some tips of needles had pierced the outer cell wall of bacteria and had become implanted analysis of the needle tips showed that in some cases the needle was hollow which would make the walls of the needle incredibly thin and sharp with a needle puncturing the bacteria cell wall it would be unlikely that the bacterium remained viable generally sem images cannot directly distinguish between live and dead bacteria however analysis of the morphology can yield information on viability some bacteria exposed to zno were irregularly shaped with rough rippled cell wall that are absent in healthy bacteria other bacteria observed in sem could still be viable though matula et al have shown than nanorods were more successful at inhibiting e coli growth than spherical nanoparticles at the highest concentration used in this study 1000 μg ml 15 their electron micrographs of bacteria being impaled by nanorods are remarkably similar to our own images using the hh particles the nanorods were created by breaking apart hh zno using sonication prior to antibacterial testing whereas hh zno used here were single particles with the structure intact morphological dependency of the antibacterial effect is also evident for other materials 1 d arrays of silicon nanosheets displayed excellent anti biofilm formation the surface of which was laser ablated to produce a high aspect ratio surface topology containing many nanopillars 36 a similar surface structure produced from ion beam etching of black silicon also had an antibacterial effect with sem images showing the surface was lethal to gram positive gram negative and spore forming bacteria 37 in both these investigations the interaction between the antibacterial nanomaterials and cells was static and without mixing whereas the reverse spin technology used here enhances the interaction potential there are also reports in the literature that show an inverse trend between bactericidal effect and particle size 38 39 we observed this trend for the two types of commercially available zno particles which had uniform particle morphology spherical nano sized and grain like micron sized zno however as we have shown it is possible that relatively larger particles can be more bactericidal than smaller particles when the morphology of the former is not uniform and has intricate nano sized needle like protrusions in this instance it is more accurate to refer to the size of the individual nanoneedles that compose the particle and not the particle diameter specifically for particles with extending narrow tips since the tips will interact with the bacteria first the concentration range 10 1000 µg ml of zno materials tested in this study yielded some interesting microbial responses the highest concentration tested 1000 µg ml resulted in the lowest number of viable cells recorded and the bactericidal effect lessened as the concentration reduced our results agree with other reports in the literature that have also detected a concentration associated reduction of viable cells upon exposure to zinc oxide 5 40 in fact for the lowest concentration tested 10 µg ml we measured a slight increase in average growth rate during the initial 12 hours of growth compared to untreated cells we previously discussed the potential role of zinc ion in the antibacterial mechanism and concluded its influence would be negligible due to the concentration that would be too low to have a toxic effect however zinc ions are also essential for normal cell function it is thus possible that intracellular metabolic processes are stimulated upon exposure to low concentrations of zno nanoparticles due to the cell detecting a slight increase in zinc ion concentration from the surrounding environment 29 the bacteria could then perform zinc associated functions at a faster rate knowing that depleted intracellular zinc ion stores can be replenished from its extracellular surroundings we measured the number of viable bacteria after 24 hours exposed to zno at optimal growth conditions and there was indeed a higher number recorded after exposure to the lowest concentration 10 µg ml than unexposed cells brayner et al also reported an increase in the number of viable bacteria grown in the presence of low concentrations of zno and they also suggested increased metabolism as the reason behind these findings 5 one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance among bacteria exposed to different concentrations of all zno types for α 0 05 the differences between the bacteria concentrations were significant for all zno types against gram positive s aureus and for gram negative e coli at higher concentrations 100 µg ml and 1000 µg ml therefore we can state that there was a significant increase in s aureus concentration in response to exposure to 10 µg ml hh yet a significant decrease in response to ns and mg relative to unexposed bacteria at the same concentration significant decreases in s aureus bacteria were also observed for higher concentrations 100 µg ml and 1000 µg ml of all zno types exposure to hh and mg zno resulted in significant decreases in e coli bacteria for the higher concentrations yet no significant difference was observed for the low concentration 10 µg ml because the differences between control and 10 µg ml zno for e coli were not statistically significant we can state that there was no antibacterial effect against this bacteria strain exposed to this concentration bacteria can develop resistance to a particular antimicrobial agent when the concentration induces sub lethal stress and the question remains unanswered whether bacteria can develop resistance towards nanoparticles in the same manner as they have with antibiotics ability of zno nanoparticles to inactivate bacteria particularly zno with rod like morphologies or composed of sharp protrusions relies on the particle having sufficient kinetic energy in order to interact with the bacteria cell with enough force to irreparably damage the outer surface so the bacteria cannot survive this is routinely achieved in bioreactors by mechanically stirring the liquid containing bacteria and nanoparticles in one direction in order to maximize interaction potential whilst also keeping the insoluble zno in suspension a variation of this technique called reverse spin biosan rotates a tube which contains the bacteria nanoparticle suspension for a defined time then changes the direction of spin and rotates in the opposite direction this enhances interaction potential whilst also maximizing sample aeration we used the reverse spin technology to continuously mix the bacteria nanoparticle suspension because it offered superior dispersal of insoluble material rather than other types of rotation such as orbital shaking where zno np could be pushed outwards due to centrifugal forces and not interact with bacteria reverse spin is also less invasive than having a mechanically rotating device inside the suspension or positioned on top of a rotating magnetic element with a small metallic rod in the suspension with the nanoparticles and bacteria sem images revealed the reverse spin bioreactor that operated at 2000 rpm s 1 did not damage the needle cluster formations in the absence of bacteria this ensured that the integrity of the structure remained undamaged due to the force being applied from the bioreactor and therefore any needles observed in the cell wall of bacteria were a result of direct interaction with a needle cluster minimum inhibitory concentrations mic are often reported in the literature for zno np to determine the lowest concentration that can effectively prevent bacteria growth yet considerable variation in the procedure makes comparison between studies difficult differences in the initial bacteria concentration type of broth used nanoparticle preparation and the environment in which the interaction occurs eg liquid or solid greatly alters the mic and introduces unnecessary variation we chose an established standardized microbiological protocol21 to determine the mic of zno used in our study we did observe sedimentation using high concentrations 512 µg ml nevertheless it did not obstruct identification of typical bacteria growth in the centers of microwells and we obtained mic values within a lower narrow range of 16 64 µg ml the lowest mic against gram negative e coli was 16 µg ml of ns zno followed by 32 µg ml of hh zno and 32 64 µg ml of mg zno these differences could be due to the insolubility of zno and the static interaction environment where the larger material settled on the base of the microwells faster than bacteria would thus creating an unfavorable surface for colonization and inhibit growth here hh zno or mg zno particles would prevent bacteria at the base of the well without necessarily interacting with the bacteria in the liquid volume before sedimentation the hh zno with sharp needles are then more effective against settling bacteria than rounded mg zno however without mechanical agitation the hh zno are less effective than ns zno this is most likely because the small ns zno would remain suspended in solution for a longer period of time and thus probably induce an antibacterial effect through encapsulation as indicated by the sem image in figure 3b contrary mic for all the zno particles against gram positive s aureus were larger indicating the bacteria was less sensitive towards zno exposure than gram negative e coli this is in a very good agreement with the result of dynamic experiments figure 1b the different effect of zno particle sizes and morphologies on the growth inhibition of gram positive and gram negative bacteria was thus confirmed in two different interaction regimes in liquid static and dynamic sem images from dynamic interaction revealed intimate contact between all zno types and we assume that the contact has already been initiated prior to drop casting onto silicon however we did not observe inhibition when zno was added to agar surface before bacteria inoculation even for the highest concentration tested figures 4 1 mg ml the most obvious difference between these data in figure 4 and the results in figure 1 where inhibition was achieved is the interaction kinetics between zno and bacteria that is completely lacking here conclusion in this work we assessed and compared the antibacterial mechanisms of synthesized needle like clusters of zno resembling hedgehogs and commercial zno particles in cell culture broth and on agar surfaces using various concentrations and various conditions no inhibition of bacteria growth was observed on agar surfaces for all the types of tested zno particles growth inhibition was controlled mainly by the interaction dynamics between bacteria and zno in liquid in particular continuous agitation mixing in reverse spin bioreactors greatly enhanced the antibacterial efficacy of all the zno particles moreover the hedgehog zno particles had significantly greater antibacterial effect than commercial zno particles the difference was more pronounced against gram negative e coli than against gram positive s aureus sem images revealed that the needle like structures in the hedgehog zno particles facilitated mechanical damage of bacteria cells they tend to pierce the membrane of bacteria which seems more effective against larger oval shaped e coli than against smaller spherical s aureus zno nanospheres rather envelope the bacteria and zno micrograins have bacteria cracked on their surface the efficacy is thus modulated also by zno particle shapes in particular at lower concentrations there is thus a potential for hedgehog zno in water treatment systems that already utilize some agitation to ensure adequate mixing of the water and antibacterial agents to enhance the disinfection efficiency even at lower amounts of zno however at too low concentrations 10 µg ml zno is not effective or it can even stimulate bacteria growth therefore the optimal zno concentration must be thus adjusted with caution considering specific application

companies that held icos in the united states have been receiving subpoenas from the u s securities and exchange commission sec for months and uncertainty surrounding what penalties might be coming have had a stifling effect on the crypto offering market recently some clarity has come as the sec brought their regulatory hammer down on several ico related companies including carriereq inc d b a airfox a u s company that sells mobile technology that allows prepaid mobile phone customers to earn free or discounted airtime or data by interacting with ads on their smartphones they held a 15 million ico in 2017 the sec handed down severe penalties to airfox for holding an unregulated ico and issued an 11 page order filled with legalese i reached out to kendall almerico one of the country s top security token offering attorneys to help interpret what the sec s rulings in the airfox case mean for the ico market kendall let s start with the basics what did airfox do that got the sec s attention in late 2017 airfox sold blockchain issued digital tokens called airtokens in an ico and raised about 15 million to create a new international business airfox told potential ico investors that the new ecosystem would include the same functionality of airfox s existing u s business allowing prepaid mobile users to earn airtime or data by interacting with ads and would also add new features such as the ability to transfer airtokens between users peer to peer lending credit scoring and eventually using airtokens to buy and sell goods and services other than mobile data airfox also told investors in the ico that airtokens would potentially increase in value as a result of airfox s efforts and that airfox would provide investors with liquidity by making airtokens tradeable in secondary markets sounds like many of the icos out there exactly airfox did what most unregulated icos had done so successfully for the last few years they went online sold tokens to the general public and raised a lot of money they followed the same blueprint that most icos did create a website put out a white paper take in money and provide tokens to the purchasers so what is the problem according to the sec and any attorney who practices securities law what airfox did is clearly selling securities and anyone who sells securities must follow securities laws airfox did not follow any securities laws in selling their airtokens can you expound on that sure let s start with the howey test which we know is a major part of how the sec is going to review any token offering to determine if securities are being sold sec v howey is a u s supreme court case from 76 years ago that defines what is and what is not a security in a nutshell the howey test determines that a company is selling a security if a person who buys what the company is selling a invests money b in a common enterprise and is c led to expect profits d solely from the efforts of the company in the airfox case it is very clear to the sec that airtokens are securities under the howey test because people buying the tokens were a investing money b in a common enterprise the airfox business and were c led to expect profits airfox represented the tokens would be traded on an exchange and inferred that they would be profitable and d solely from the efforts of the company airfox was taking the money and building their international business because airtokens are securities everything airfox did to sell them failed to follow securities laws if airtokens were so clearly securities why did airfox go ahead with their ico without following securities laws that s a question that their lawyers and advisors need to answer any advisor who even has a basic understanding of securities law would look at airtokens and say hey airfox you are selling securities you are selling tokens to the general public that you are alluding to an increase in value to finance a new business apparently airfox s either didn t bother to google what is a security or airfox ignored their advice what are the lessons to be learned for companies who want to sell coins or tokens at this point if you want to touch the u s market in any way either follow securities laws or don t hold an offering despite all the recent warnings and negative publicity i still have ico companies contacting me wanting to use these same methods particularly arguing but i m selling a utility token that got airfox in trouble two things are very obvious after the airfox sec enforcement action you can t call what you are selling a utility token and have securities laws magically not apply to your offering and unless you can definitively prove what you are selling is not a security you need to follow securities laws in your offering let s talk about that utility token issue how can you tell if a token is a utility token or a security one of the biggest lessons learned from the sec s ruling in airfox provides some guidance for companies on this issue so let s look at exactly what airfox did the terms of airfox s ico required purchasers to agree that they were buying airtokens for their utility as a medium of exchange for mobile airtime and not as an investment or a security in other words airfox assumed they could agree with their token purchasers that they were selling a utility token and not a security we learn that the sec doesn t look at it that way calling something a utility token and saying it is not a security is meaningless to the sec the sec also noted that at the time of the ico the utility function being promised had not been created yet so the functionality was not available the airfox app at the time of the ico was a prototype that only enabled users to earn and redeem loyalty points which could be exchanged for mobile airtime airfox themselves even said the prototype was really just for the ico and just for investment purposes so people know how it was going to work and didn t have any real users at the time of the ico so it is clear that the howey test which calls something a security if it is being sold to finance the creation of a business or ecosystem applies here something can t be a utility token if it does not yet have utility and if it is being sold to finance creating that promised utility on that point the sec also said investors purchased airtokens based upon anticipation that the value of the tokens would rise through airfox s future managerial and entrepreneurial efforts that makes it pretty clear people were buying the airtokens as an investment and that the money would be used by airfox to make the company and the tokens more valuable kendall almerico exactly this is a text book case of a token being sold that is so clearly a security under the howey test that it would be nearly impossible to argue otherwise with a straight face i think this is one of the reasons the sec picked airfox they provide a good clear example of what not to do some other tokens sold in icos are not as clearly securities so this ruling gives us some easy rules to follow moving forward i look at the sec s ruling and see it in a positive light for future icos in one way i think the sec seems to have cracked the door open a little the sec specifically set out several reasons why the airtokens are securities and not utility tokens but what if those reasons did not exist what if this ico had taken place later in the company s existence and at the time of the ico the tokens functionality was available the app was a not a prototype but was fully functional the app had real users at the time the tokens were being used only as a medium of exchange and purchasers of the tokens had no anticipation that the value of the tokens would rise through the company s future managerial and entrepreneurial efforts because the tokens were not allowed to be traded on an exchange or otherwise if those facts had been in place i have a feeling the sec would not as easily have defined airtokens as securities of course the marketplace for those tokens would not likely be a 15 million market but i believe the sec might entertain characterizing tokens in that scenario as not being subject to securities laws if it ever happens what penalties did the sec impose on airfox for selling securities without following the laws and regulations it started with the sec instituting cease and desist proceedings against airfox this means the sec told airfox to stop breaking the law because the sec is about to come in and effectively shut their company down with penalties as a result airfox negotiated a settlement with the sec so they could have some hope of continuing in business the settlement requires airfox to pay a 250 000 fine inform each person that purchased airtokens of their right to get their money back if they still own the tokens or if they can show they sold them for a loss issue a press release notifying the public of the sec s order and containing a link to a claim form for investors to get their money back and to file the appropriate paperwork with the sec to register the airtokens as a class of securities this means the airfox now must follow all securities regulations and ongoing reporting requirements as to these tokens an extremely expensive requirement sounds like the sec imposed millions of dollars of penalties and did not pull any punches they dropped the hammer and clearly wanted to send a message to everyone in the ico community the sec made airfox pay a large fine forced them to return up to 15 million back to investors and be subject to a ton of time consuming and expensive paperwork things like publicly disclosing audited financial records this is not a one time penalty but rather an ongoing huge expense for airfox i seriously doubt most companies that held an unregistered ico could stay in business after such a hammering for companies considering an ico what lessons are learned from airfox if you sell tokens that are securities you have to either a register the securities with the sec or b qualify for one of the well known exemptions from registration such as regulation d or regulation a when you sell the tokens in other words follow existing securities laws what else i think most ico companies but very few securities lawyers like myself will be surprised to learn that the sec is going to read and review everything about your offering they are going to read your white paper and review everything they can find online or otherwise with airfox the sec reviewed blog posts and youtube videos of the airfox founders and used comments made on both to satisfy prongs of the howey test of what constitutes a security airfox s white paper informed investors that 50 per cent of the proceeds of the offering would be used for engineering and research and development expenses and proposed a potential timeline of development milestones this also helped satisfy the howey test by explaining that the company was going to use the funds from the token sale to fulfill their business plan the sec also looked at something else i found interesting after the ico airfox attempted to list airtokens on a crypto exchange and the sec even reviewed the crypto exchange application airfox filled out one application question asked why would the value of airtokens increase over time airfox s response was as time lapses the features and utility of airtoken will go up as we continue to build the platform as of today the people are able to download our browser to earn and purchase airtokens to redeem mobile data and airtime across 500 wireless carriers over the next two years the utility of the token will expand and therefore more people across the world will need to have airtokens in their possession to participate on our platform and ecosystem again the company s own words on an application form to a third party company came back to haunt them by providing more evidence of meeting the howey test it seems ico companies need to be extremely careful that everything they do or say is compliant with securities laws in other words do what companies who raised capital selling securities for years have had to do yes without question and because the magic words blockchain or token or cryptocurrency are being used in the offering expect the sec to take an even closer look at every single detail the sec also mentioned something about airfox having too many investors in the ico can you explain that in its ico airfox sold more than one billion airtokens to more than 2 500 investors the number of investors is important a company selling securities is required to register their equity securities under rule 12 g if the class of securities was held of record by more than 2 000 persons and more than 500 of those persons were not accredited investors in other words if you sell securities to 2 001 total investors or 501 non accredited investors you have to be registered with the sec registered with the sec means a lot of paperwork and ongoing reporting and a lot of expense with more than 2 500 investors airfox is subject to these expensive registration requirements because their tokens were considered to be securities the lesson here is to watch the number of investors in your offering even when you are selling tokens that are clearly securities you must pay attention to the rules surrounding how many investors you are allowed based on the laws applicable to your offering there are exceptions to this rule most notably if you use regulation a to raise the capital in a security token offering where you can have far more investors than rule 12 g allows with some limitations you mentioned earlier that if an ico company wants to touch the u s market in any way either follow securities laws or don t hold an offering do the lessons learned in airfox apply to non u s companies or those who do not sell to the u s market that s a complicated question but let me give you the basics keep in mind this varies dramatically based on every individual fact pattern as a general rule if a company does business in the u s or wants to sell to the u s investor market they need to follow u s securities laws if a company is not a u s company and do not sell or market at all to u s investors then u s securities laws may not apply at all but securities laws of other countries will apply and those laws have to be followed airtokens were available for purchase by individuals in the united states and worldwide through websites controlled by airfox the company is based in the united states the websites selling the tokens in the u s were controlled by the company this all subjected airfox to the jurisdiction of u s laws and the sec also i hear this one a lot so let me address it companies come to me and say we are not subject to u s law we set up a company in the virgin islands or malta or somewhere else without getting too technical if you are a new york city based company with offices and employees in manhattan who sets up a shell company in the virgin islands that has no office or employees and you run that company out of new york you are not being clever and avoiding the fact that the sec is probably still going to consider you a u s company all you have done is sent up a red flag prior to their ico airfox told prospective investors that it planned to list the tokens on token exchanges to ensure secondary market trading obviously liquidity in any investment is a huge part of the investment decision by a purchaser how did this play into the sec s order airfox made it clear as do most unregulated icos that their tokens would be traded on crypto exchanges so buyers could sell them and potentially make a profit this satisfies the investment arm of the howey test if investors have a reasonable expectation of profit from being the tokens the tokens are very likely securities interestingly in the middle of their ico airfox announced that it was reducing the token supply from 150 billion to 1 5 billion without changing the anticipated market cap to alleviate concerns raised by many current and potential token holders and token exchanges who prefer each individual token to be worth more imagine a traditional initial public offering of stock where the ipo company suddenly changed the number of shares of stock available but kept the valuation of the company the same hey those shares you first in buyers got for 20 are now worth 2000 each because we decided to sell 1 100thof the number of shares this kind of market manipulation would likely end of with a few people in federal prison changing the material terms of a securities offering in the middle of it is a very bad idea airfox also had a bounty program something common in icos what was the sec s take on that let me explain airfox s bounty program first airfox provided free airtokens to people like crypto advisors who helped the company s marketing efforts airfox had more than 400 people promote the ico and receive airtokens in exchange for things like touting the ico on internet message board posts articles youtube videos and social media posts they also paid one crypto advisor who had previously led similar ico promotions by other companies a percentage of the airtokens issued in the ico in exchange for his services while the sec didn t specifically address this point in their ruling i wouldn t be surprised to see some regulatory or legal investigation undertaken against some of these crypto advisors and those who were paid bounties if any of these crypto advisors or others conducted illegal broker dealer activities or advertising and marketing rules of securities which are highly regulated it s possible we may see some further sec action against these people speaking of advertising and marketing the sec made a point of bringing up how airfox marketed their ico great point the sec noted that airfox aimed its marketing efforts for the ico at digital token investors rather than the anticipated users of airtokens airfox promoted the offering in forums aimed at people investing in bitcoin and other digital assets even though the ultimate users of airtokens were supposed to be overseas not in the u s airfox s principals were interviewed by individuals focused on digital token investing in a blog post airfox wrote that an airtoken presale was directed at sophisticated crypto investors angel investors and early backers of the airtoken project bottom line is that airfox claimed to be selling a utility token but made no effort to market the tokens to the anticipated users of tokens individuals with prepaid phones in developing countries instead airfox marketed the ico to investors who viewed the airtokens as an investment the sec felt this was a very good indication that these utility tokens really did not have an utility if they were not being sold to the people who would use them the obvious lesson here is that if you are going to claim you are selling utility tokens in an offering you should sell those tokens to the ultimate users of the tokens if you do not you are likely selling securities to speculating investors and your argument of selling utility tokens falls apart very quickly any last words for the ico community i ve been talking to and in some cases actually representing token and crypto companies ever since the sec s dao decision in 2017 when the floodgates opened to companies realizing that the only safe way in the u s to issue a digital asset token or coin is to follow securities laws it s not that hard every mistake airfox made was avoidable and everything they did to violate well established securities laws could have been avoided if they had received good advice selling investments to u s citizens is one of the most highly regulated industries in the world to think a company can avoid following these well established laws and regulations just because of a new technology and because everyone else is doing it is ridiculous can i start openly selling cocaine online to anyone who wants to buy it because i keep the records of the sales on a distributed ledger and track each kilo on a blockchain no and nobody would be so stupid to try this is not that difficult if you want to sell tokens without following securities laws to the u s market you need to be 100 per cent certain they are not securities and that is going to be very difficult to do in most cases if you and your advisors are not 100 per cent certain that what you plan to sell is not a security get advice from reputable securities counsel before you do anything once last thing if you find yourself creating arguments to get around parts of the howey test rather than being able to definitively prove your tokens do not fit the howey definition of a security then the sec is most likely going to disagree with you and deem your tokens to be securities editor s note airfox did not admit or deny guilt to the sec the text has been amended
in 1997 restaurateur danny yip moved back to hong kong from australia having worked in the food and beverage industry since the 1980s he vowed he would never open another restaurant again it was overwhelmingly exhausting he recalls during an interview with cnn travel instead upon returning to his home city he founded a successful internet company it didn t take long before he broke his vow missing the action and the fun of the industry he sold his company in the 2000s and opened the chairman a humble two story cantonese restaurant located in a quiet street in hong kong s sheung wan district it ended up being a sound decision today the chairman is widely considered to be the epitome of modern chinese restaurants first chinese restaurant to win no 1 the chairman won the top spot in this year s asia s 50 best restaurants awards the first ever chinese restaurant to win the accolade which is decided on by an academy of 318 voters spread throughout asia it s a straightforward restaurant no frills no gimmicks just brilliant ingredient focused cantonese food says william drew director of content for the world s 50 best restaurants which organizes the awards perhaps its success is in part down to diners reevaluating what s most important and concluding that unshowy destinations that are really dedicated to sourcing the best ingredients and creating imaginative and delicious dishes should be highly valued an obvious example of this is the chairman s camphor wood smoked 7 spiced goose which took months to develop and it s not even on the menu diners need to pre order it first the goose is marinated in the juices of chicken duck pigeon and goose for two days then it s steamed in low heat for eight hours finally it s smoked in a gentle camphor wood fire with a chef having to change the wood midway through the process three days of labor results in tender and moist slabs of goose meat and supremely intense flavors that require no accompaniments the chairman is notable for its consistency through the years but at the same time it has never stood still it does not try to be anything it is not but the culinary team are forever exploring new ingredients and creating new dishes adds drew to yip earning the top spot is a win for chinese cuisine in general being a chinese restaurant it was a special moment not just to us but means everything to whoever is working in chinese restaurants he says many young chefs won t consider chinese cooking when they first join the industry internationally there are many cuisines that have ranked better than chinese french japanese even scandinavian and south american many doubted chinese questioning if there is energy left for this old cuisine the world s complicated relationship with chinese cuisine looking at previous asia s 50 best restaurants lists since 2013 only lung king heen the upscale michelin three star cantonese restaurant in four seasons hong kong managed to come close to the top ranked no 9 and no 10 in 2014 and 2016 respectively the chairman came in second last year it was also the only chinese restaurant to grace the world s 50 best restaurants list in 2019 ranking 41st the 2020 edition of the world s 50 best restaurants awards was canceled because of the pandemic when it comes to the michelin guide it s also uncommon to see chinese restaurants earn plaudits outside of asia back in 2009 when the first hong kong and macau edition of the michelin guide was released lung king heen became the first ever chinese restaurant to win three stars in the french guide s 109 years of history today five out of 10 three star restaurants in the 2021 guide are chinese elsewhere in the region sazenka recently became the first chinese restaurant to be awarded three michelin stars in tokyo s 2021 guide over in europe a wong which serves pan regional chinese cuisine with a modern take became the first chinese restaurant to win two michelin stars outside asia with the release of this year s london michelin guide so why is it rare for chinese restaurants in spite of their global popularity and long history to get international recognition compared to cuisines like french or japanese andrew wong chef owner of restaurant a wong offers a possible explanation during the cultural revolution imperial chefs emigrated to england the us canada and other parts of europe this is important because it has stemmed the growth of chinese cuisine on a global scale says the chef who studied anthropology before taking over the chinese restaurant his grandparents founded in london those chefs traveled used their techniques and integrated them into other cultures with success they made chinese food one of the most loved cuisines globally however because we ve enjoyed such a long history of interpreting and reinterpreting our cuisine within international cities some things have been lost somewhere along the lines communication on the technique craft dedication sourcing and obsessiveness about ingredients has been lost within chinese gastronomy however things have been looking up for chinese cuisine in the last decade more modern chinese establishments are popping up around the world in line with an increased willingness among diners to try unfamiliar cuisines a wong s taste of china menu for example takes london diners on a journey around china serving local dishes that are well researched and well seasoned with historical stories the stars are now lining up and international chefs will be looking to learn about technique ingredients and new flavors from chinese chefs says wong the chairman s blueprint it s impossible to talk about the chairman s success without highlighting the soul of its kitchen chef kwok keung tung better known as keung gor brother keung yip asked kwok to join the chairman after tasting the experienced chef s version of dry fried beef noodles a classic cantonese diner dish that tests a chef s wok skill more than a decade ago you need guts to be able to create that wok hei breath of the wok in chinese cooking says yip and there aren t many dry fried beef noodles that can pass that test in the city to lure kwok to his team yip promised the chef complete autonomy in the kitchen allowing him to create cuisine he d never experienced before the traditional way of doing things isn t a bad way but it could be boring says kwok sometimes you want to try something new at chairman danny offers a much bigger box here we could come up with the strangest ways to cook things when you see something you will get inspired outside service hour yip and kwok spend hours together refining and reinventing their menus during cnn travel s visit they debate some of the most challenging chinese dishes to cook coming to consensus on cold chop chicken a simple dish in which the poultry is scalded in hot broth then plunged in cold ice it s challenging to further refine cold chop chicken says kwok the traditional recipe doesn t allow enough time for the flavors to get into every inch of the chicken yip agrees adding it s the simplest way to cook the chicken focusing only on the original flavor but our version is pretty good and different in the chairman s take the chicken is brined in cold stock for hours allowing them to maximize the flavors without overcooking it says yip working together since the opening of the restaurant in 2008 the duo has developed hundreds of dishes together along the way fostering a deep sense of mutual understanding this is a different approach from traditional chinese restaurants which are mostly recipe oriented by focusing on ingredients concepts and the essence of the food a core concept of cantonese food the chairman has created its own interpretation of chinese cuisine and identity don t you find it boring if every chinese restaurant is serving the same menu yip asks authentic chinese food with international appeal the success of the chairman has inspired fellow chinese chefs far beyond hong kong i was thrilled that the chairman won for me it sent a message that chinese cuisine is finally holding their heads high on an international level says xu jing ye the young chef and co owner of 102 house in foshan china it helps the international food and beverage industry to take chinese food more seriously xu s small private kitchen style restaurant was included on asia s 50 best restaurants inaugural essence of asia list this year many restaurants chefs follow the recipes passed down by their own mentors but they didn t think about the reasons behind the recipes says the young chef the chairman breaks the very strict boxes for chinese cuisines traditionally it has inspired me a lot they create authentic chinese food that is appealing internationally at 102 house xu cooks traditional chinese cuisine while experimenting with different techniques and ingredients all the dishes strive to achieve the essence of authentic cantonese food clean umami filled crisp smooth and tender many people mistook internationalization with merely adding western ingredients or by its presentation says xu but this isn t internationalizing chinese cuisine what we need to do is to help the international audience to understand chinese food thanks to a new crop of young chefs who are passionate about revolutionizing chinese cooking styles while preserving the cuisine s essence in their own unique ways this process is already underway when we have creative thinking we would be very close to rising to the top internationally says yip chinese cuisine has a strong and broad foundation in cooking techniques our ingredients are bountiful our legacy rich i don t think it s difficult for chinese cuisine to catch up on the international stage

china s efforts over the past week to cool down the skyrocketing price of australia s biggest export look as if they may have started to take some sort of effect it s still early days but the price of iron ore dropped a further five per cent at the end of last week after the chinese government set forward a plan to tackle its continually rising price the drop is already hitting aussie mining companies on the asx today rio tinto fell 0 93 per cent to 122 12 while bhp declined 1 1 per cent to 47 75 however the price of iron ore a crucial ingredient in steel making and an economic lifeline for australia is still high amid huge demand around the globe this time last year it was worth about us60 per tonne at the end of last week the same amount was worth over us200 as nations look to recover from the pandemic by spending big on infrastructure they need more steel china is clearly aware of this and has its own huge demand for steel as a result it has increased its steel production to record levels giving australia a much needed and surprising cash windfall at a time when relations between canberra and beijing have been significantly strained however china is looking to do something about this in its monthly briefing the national development and reform commission ndrc recommended chinese firms boost domestic exploration for the steelmaking input explore overseas ore resources and widen their sources of imports related china s empty threat to harm australia australia s iron ore exports to china are at an all time high flaws in china s plan analysts have pointed to flaws in the plan saying china would need to develop hundreds of new mines in a short space of time to keep up with its steel production china has been the main driver of global metal markets for more than a decade and they re showing no signs of slowing down research house capital economics estimates that chinese steel production rose by 7 5 per cent in april compared with march while capital economics believes april s production level may prove to be the peak australia s miners have seen strong activity continue into may however china is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and has promised to take steps to do so which is at odds with its recent ramp up in steel production beijing started the year with a plan to drive steel production lower in 2021 to reduce pollution from the sector which is estimated to account for about 15 per cent of the nation s total emissions this clearly isn t going to plan with steel production hitting record levels but the expectation is that the chinese government will attempt to put the brakes on booming steel production in the second half of this year given australia sells over 60 per cent of its iron ore to china alone this could mean we take a serious economic hit australian mining insiders have told theafr they are wary of what could happen in the near future if china goes hard on its intervention in the steel market global demand feeds industry optimism however they said the level of demand across the rest of the world is so strong that they see no need to panic if china cuts steel production someone else will do it a source inside one of australia s big miners told the publication feeding that optimism is the fact that the steel market around the world is red hot right now european steel giant arcelormittal this month lifted its steel prices for the 12th time since november taking a tonne of hot rolled coil steel in europe to 1050 a1655 up by more than 80 per cent over the past seven months related china to step up domestic iron ore mining iron ore is australia s biggest export meanwhile nucor the biggest steel maker in the united states is taking the stock market by storm and struggling to find workers to keep up with its expanding operations even covid 19 ravaged india is going hard to increase steel exports which rose about 26 per cent in the march quarter according to s p global platts however shiro armstrong director of the australia japan research centre at the australian national university told news com au if china and australia try to diversify away from each other then it will have serious consequences for both nations he said that the idea australian mines can simply find other nations to make up for the iron trade we do with china sounds fanciful it would be unrealistic in the short term and likely in the medium and long term for both nations because it would come at a cost neither governments or mining companies will be able to bear he said government intervention could lead to more uncertainty he said the international market between australia and china is one that has delivered there is not good track record when governments try to intervene in the market and china s efforts could lead to more uncertainty and higher prices there he said none of their policies will work because they would lead to a huge hit to china s construction sector on the flip side for australia he said the demand for iron ore elsewhere in the world simply isn t there especially with prices as high as they are now the latest figures show that china produces over half of the world s steel producing over 996 million metric tonnes in 2019 the next highest was india which produced nine times less with just over 111 million metric tonnes mr armstrong said it would be best for the governments of both nations to stay out of the market we ve had a very beneficial relationship with china that s driven by market fundamentals if both countries start looking to retreat from that open market that s a pathway to living standards in both countries he said china s reliance on australian iron ore which has resulted in massive financial windfalls for our biggest mining companies have come despite trade tensions between the two countries being at an all time high related australia has failed on assertive china china s president xi jinping picture world economic forum wef afp prime minister scott morrison picture nca newswire joel carrett outright ban is unimaginable according to chinese state media ndrc spokesman jin xiandong blamed australia for damaging trade relations consequently we have to make the legitimate and necessary reaction and australia should bear full responsibility for such moves mr jin told the conference we urged the australian side to treat china australian co operation objectively and reasonably to treat chinese companies fairly end the disruption of bilateral trade and investment co operation and take actions to bring forward bilateral relations for healthy development but despite australia and china s icy relationship an outright ban on iron ore is almost unimaginable instead beijing could resort to other tactics to make the export of iron ore more difficult for australia companies energy research and consultancy firm wood mackenzie told bloomberg earlier this month while an outright ban would be almost unimaginable various forms of restrictions delays or increased administrative burdens on australian iron ore imports could yet happen wood mackenzie warned

amid the continuing global pandemic a new wave of covid 19 infections has broken out in taiwan the taiwan pandemic control centre announced on may 23 that there were 287 new cases 284 local cases and three imported cases in taiwan six people have died this is the ninth day that there have been more than 100 new cases with this sudden outbreak taiwan is again shrouded in anxiety about the potential dangers amid an ongoing public debate the government is yet to implement a full lock down to contain its spread according to taiwanese media reports the outbreak has been traced to infections that took place in a quarantine hotel at the end of april some crew members from a china airlines cargo plane returning to taiwan were infected at least one with the british strain according to the taiwan pandemic control centre people line up at a rapid coronavirus testing center after the covid 19 alert raise to level 3 in taipei taiwan tuesday may 18 2021 ap photo chiang ying ying the crew members were quarantined in a hotel near the airport but the hotel did not comply with the epidemic prevention regulations as result cross infection took place between the crew members and hotel employees which then spread to their families now taiwan is experiencing cases in which the infection source is unknown on may 15 taiwan added 180 local cases and another five imported cases a daily record of confirmed cases taiwan s minister of health and welfare chen shih chung told a press conference on may 15 that the new cases were mainly concentrated in the greater taipei area including 89 cases in taipei city and 75 cases in new taipei city the patients were between five and eighty years old taiwan prime minister su tsen chang announced the need for larger stronger and more timely measures to control the outbreak at present taipei city and new taipei city have been upgraded to the third level of restrictions the second highest level gatherings of more than five people indoors and 10 people outdoors are prohibited all entertainment venues and gyms in taiwan are closed and religious venues must halt their activities the government s limited response has provoked public criticism with accusations that the authorities are trying to avoid any impact on the economy by avoiding the imposition of a complete lock down health minister chen shih chung has defended the government s actions with the absurd claim that further restrictions would lead to epidemic prevention fatigue cases have continued to escalate taiwan announced on may 17 that 333 new local cases had been detected in a single day a new daily record the government reacted by suspending the arrival of foreign tourists and flights to taiwan from may 19 until june 18 schools in taipei city and new taipei city are closed until may 28 over the past year the taiwanese government has been boasting of its lack of covid 19 cases holding the island up as a model for epidemic prevention with us backing it argued on the basis of this record that it should be represented at world health organisation meetings a move that beijing rejected as a breach of the one china policy that treats taiwan as part of china despite the resurgence of the pandemic globally taipei continued to ease restrictions leading to what is now a dangerous outbreak some health experts have criticised the lack of facilities to carry out large scale testing chen yi min a taiwanese epidemiologist accused the government of not wanting to conduct large scale testing as the current situation was already difficult to handle su ih jen the former director of the centre for disease control said that the most effective way to prevent the epidemic was vaccination but the country had insufficient vaccines and a golden opportunity to protect the population had been missed taiwan opened its vaccination program on march 22 but its uptake has been slow in part because of the incessant government propaganda that taiwan was a safe country although doctors and medical experts have stressed the importance of vaccination the government has largely ignored that issue to date the vaccination rate in taiwan is less than 1 percent one of the lowest in a relatively developed country the outbreak in taiwan an island nation demonstrates that there is no safe country while the pandemic continues to rage globally concerned by the latest outbreak many people have begun to seek vaccinations but are facing a shortage a doctor told the media that clinics are already full and vaccinations will not be available in taipei city until june taiwan is completely dependent on imports for vaccines but with european and american countries scrambling to stock up vaccines taiwan s access is very limited vaccine supplies are also restricted as a result of tensions between china and taiwan further fuelled by washington s increasingly aggressive confrontation with beijing on may 17 the taiwan affairs office of china offered to provide vaccine assistance but the offer was immediately rejected by the taiwanese mainland affairs council which declared that the chinese government did not have to pretend to be kind over the past year the ruling democratic progressive party dpp which favours greater independence from beijing has joined the us and its allies in denigrating china s offers of vaccine assistance as vaccine diplomacy designed to further china s interests the accusation is entirely hypocritical coming from washington which always used its foreign aid to advance its political and strategic ends the government s attitude has been criticized by opposition parties including the kuomintang which favours closer relations with china chang hsien yao former deputy director of the taiwan mainland affairs council told the media that geopolitical factors should not come into consideration when dealing with pandemics and vaccines despite the criticism the government is maintaining its hostile attitude to beijing chen zong yan taiwan s deputy minister of the interior accused the chinese government of spreading false news about the taiwan pandemic lee chun yi deputy secretary general of the office of the president of taiwan branded calls on social media for large scale testing temporary quarantine hospitals lock down and the use of chinese vaccines as part of beijing s psychological warfare the purpose he claimed was to intensify internal conflicts in taiwan reduce taiwan s productive forces and hit the economy and stock market faced with the increasing case numbers and an unresolved vaccine shortage the taiwanese

western policymakers and the entire international community should make it clear that they support any effort by the iranian people to push back against state repression and to advocate for democracy candidates in the iranian regime s next presidential election in june include alleged mass murderers corrupt embezzlers subjects of both european and american sanctions for human rights abuses and persons who have been implicated in foreign assassinations and bombings the presumptive front runner is ebrahim raisi who was one of the leading perpetrators of the massacre of 30 000 political prisoners in 1988 no wonder that the majority of iranians are expected to reject the elections entirely various iranian officials and state media outlets have already warned of this possibility beyond that the elections which are widely regarded as a sham take place against the backdrop of major uprisings in the final days of 2017 protests broke out in iran s second most populous city of mashhad that immediately spread to dozens of other cities with democratic change being the rallying cry another uprising in november 2019 which presented the clerical regime with an even greater challenge terrified of the breadth and organized nature of these uprisings authorities opened fire on crowds killing approximately 1 500 persistent anger over that crackdown on dissent may have fueled last year s boycott of the parliamentary election it is now emerging as a driving force behind the prospective boycott of next month s presidential election this fact was recently underscored by a video that circulated on iranian social media in which the mothers of activists who had been killed during the november 2019 uprising made it clear that their only vote is overthrow of the regime one of the grieving mothers noted that elections have merely served as a façade for a theocratic dictatorship over the course of four decades if our vote was supposed to fix anything it would have happened in the last 40 years but it did not she said the past 40 years led to november s mass murderer of the youth this land s greatest treasures in recent weeks retirees and pensioners have staged over a dozen protests each spanning multiple cities the government has offered little to no response to their demands for an economic policy that shrinks the gap between their stagnant income and the rising cost of living as a result the most recent of these protests adopted slogans such as we have seen no justice we will not vote anymore similar slogans were taken up by protests that focused attention on the regime s theft of people s savings in the stock market for those who lost savings and joined the massive ranks of impoverished iranians it was clear that the regime s graft permeated the political hierarchy and left no one with an interest in reforming the system the current president hassan rouhani has served as the standard bearer for the reformist faction over the past eight years and he neither opposed the mass killing of protesters last november nor criticized the further consolidation of national wealth into a small number of institutions mostly controlled by supreme leader ali khamenei and the revolutionary guards the iranian oppositional group the national council of resistance of iran has been a proponent of election boycotts for many years and in 2013 it fervently pushed back against the narratives in some western policy circles which held that a reformist president might affect meaningful change in iran s domestic conduct and its relationship with the international community this year is no different as opposition activists have launched a campaign urging the citizens to boycott the election farce the vast majority of iranians have unequivocally rejected such narratives and many have taken the logical next step of endorsing regime change and working toward it through the mass uprisings in 2017 2018 and 2019 western policymakers and the entire international community should make it clear that they support any effort by the iranian people to push back against state repression and to advocate for democracy the recent growth in public protests has led opposition activists to predict that a successful electoral boycott could be a precursor to further unrest similar to the november 2019 uprising iranian officials and media outlets have warned about the same possibility and have implicitly raised the prospect of launching an even more aggressive crackdown on dissent to counter what may be the greatest challenge so far to the mullahs regime only the immediate and overwhelming threat of a coordinated international response can guarantee that the bloodshed from forthcoming uprisings will not be worse than that which occurred during november 2019 if policymakers offer no such threat they will be turning their backs on the iranian people thereby solidifying the position of a nuclear keen theocratic dictatorship that is desperately struggling to find a lifeline dr majid rafizadeh is a business strategist harvard educated scholar board member of harvard international review and president of the international american council he

3 in seronegative individuals observations of varied ve by serotype remained consistent with previously reported results no evidence of disease enhancement was observed tak 003 was generally well tolerated and there were no important safety risks observed the results reinforce the potential of tak 003 to help protect those who are living in or traveling to dengue endemic countries our dengue vaccine candidate continued to provide protection against dengue throughout three years and was especially robust in preventing hospitalization said derek wallace vp dengue global program leader at takeda these results reinforce my confidence that tak 003 can help address the significant global burden of dengue as previously reported the tides trial met its primary endpoint of overall ve against

by laura aka for working nation broadcast version by danielle smith for tennessee news service reporting for the workingnation public news service collaboration we all witnessed the significant impact the pandemic had on frontline health care workers one in five health care workers has left their job since 2020 according to one industry report and the exodus is not over research suggests that up to 47 of health care workers plan to leave their positions by 2025 the u s is suffering from a significant health care worker shortage and the data shows that this is going to have near term and long term effects on both patient care and hospital and physician performance says definitive healthcare nashville considered a major health care hub has not been immune to worker shortages to address its talent pipeline needs vanderbilt university medical center vumc is collaborating with local education institutions including high schools community colleges and state colleges to create learning opportunities and fill open jobs where the shortages are peggy valentine ed d vice president of allied health education at vumc was brought on in 2021 to help address the organization s need for allied health workers she says there were a lot of positions that were in high demand you can t really run a hospital without these positions i came on poring through these reports in terms of where the vacancies were located we found that there were a number of professions where there were over a hundred vacancies such as medical assistant emt paramedics pharmacy techs medical laboratory scientists valentine notes when you think of allied health there are over 200 distinct disciplines maybe more because it keeps growing you combine them all together it represents about 60 of the health care workforce they include the technologists people who work in the laboratory people who work in x ray people who support the work of nurses support the work of physicians it may be in the operating room where you re a surgical assistant it may be doing the cat scan or the person who runs the machine for ultrasonography just a very large group of professionals to support this important work she explains partnerships with local postsecondary institutions are instrumental to vumc s efforts to grow its talent pipeline they already had these programs up and running there s no need for us to reinvent the wheel nashville state community college the first collaboration launched in 2022 was with nashville state community college nscc with a focus on medical assistant training the opportunity to learn central sterile processing through nscc was added later the first cohort of medical assistants was people who worked here at the medical center maybe they worked in dietary delivering food trays or they worked in environmental cleaning we had people who worked in various positions who always wanted to go back to school but never had the resources to do so says valentine vumc pays for their employees tuition books uniforms and supplies while they maintain their salaries and benefits explains valentine after the completion of the first cohort she says the workforce opportunity was extended beyond employees of the medical center to the wider community partnering with organizations like grace place ministry and uprise nashville students from the community are given stipends to help offset the costs of expenses like transportation and childcare as valentine says those kinds of things that people worry about nashville is a good representation of what s happening in health care nationwide says donna whitehouse dean of the school of health sciences at nscc the reason for the health care shortages we have the baby boomer retiree exodus we have the leftovers of covid burnout that came along with the intensity of not just the caseload but just the depth of what caring meant at that point in time with the great loss of people whitehouse says we are hearing from our alumni that the billable productivity requirements for rehabilitation professionals such as occupational and physical therapists have significantly increased over time productivity requirements especially on our rehab side of things used to be 80 to 85 of your work time was considered time with patients and then you had some time to do some paperwork now they re looking at 90 to 95 of that time to be billable and that s a quick pace in order to be able to get things completed she adds that other challenges include the cost and geographic location of educational opportunities the need for more flexibility around work schedules and having enough educators to teach the training we have to really credit vanderbilt with their open mindedness and their creativity in addressing this workforce shortage says whitehouse also fronting scholarships for our surgical technology students once those students have been accepted into our program helping fund any additional costs that they have so they can continue their education she notes whitehouse continues in this case tennessee residents who qualify for programs like tennessee promise or tennessee reconnect can attend school tuition free but we know that there are more costs to attend than just tuition so vanderbilt has stepped in vanderbilt has made not just an investment in getting people on those ground level positions and getting in those short term training programs but they are also investing in their long term career towards a credential that requires a little bit more extra time and a little bit more extra education through an accredited program whitehouse points out we ve had over a hundred students who have completed the vanderbilt nashville state ma program our first time ma certification rates are well over 80 that s the first time test takers we have a 100 certification rate overall sometimes it takes more than one time but we get it here s the kicker of those people in that program 90 have seen it all the way through you re not going to see those numbers in a whole lot of places close to 95 of the people who have gone through the program and then gone to work are still at vanderbilt tennessee state university after covid there was a national shortage of respiratory therapists and there still is says brenda k batts d h a director of the cardio respiratory program tennessee state university tsu she continues with that vanderbilt started a new initiative to recruit respiratory therapists they started a scholarship program with tennessee state university s cardio respiratory program within that scholarship program if accept the scholarship they have to commit to a time period to work at vanderbilt for a year or more batts says sometimes students have to leave the program one of the things we do know is that in the last year many students at tennessee state have financial hardships when you have a scholarship that can help lift that heavy burden and help you complete that journey it s so rewarding we had 10 that applied to that scholarship program and they accepted 10 all of them are ecstatic about working at vanderbilt many of them wanted to work there anyway according to the bureau of labor statistics employment of respiratory therapists is projected to grow 13 from 2022 to 2032 much faster than the average for all occupations about 8 600 openings for respiratory therapists are projected each year on average over the decade batts says it is crucial to create awareness about the role of the respiratory therapist some respiratory programs have a problem with recruiting people i think people are misinformed because they think oh you have to have go to school forever no ma am we need to identify the two ways that you can enter our profession there s a two year program that feeds into the four year program you can have a two year degree but vanderbilt will invest in you to go back and get the four year degree in addition to the vanderbilt collaboration batts says outreach in the community is important including afterschool programs she says the martha o bryan center is one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the middle tennessee area we take our respiratory therapy students who have to do a total of 80 hours of service work over two semesters the respiratory therapy students become teachers of those young people we showcase our profession and we take all the tools with us the mannequins the intubation of procedures pearl cohn high school similar to batts tyler welch academy coach of the academy of health science and personal care at pearl cohn high school says it comes down to exposure young people have a hard time i think seeing where they fit in the big picture it s actually from their life experiences says welch when they go to the emergency room or when they go to the doctor s office everyone they interact with has scrubs on i started realizing they were generalizing a nurse when you start looking at well i want to become a nurse the pathway to be a nurse can be more difficult than some of the pathways to become a nurse i started realizing these certification stacks are what actually can lead to ultimately being a nurse when we say medical assistant certification they don t really know what that is but we say hey it s a path to nurse welch notes that vanderbilt has visited the high school giving students the opportunity to explore different jobs including the already mentioned medical assistant hr positions nurse practitioner traveling nurse and surgery techs by the time students complete high school they have osha and cpr certifications additionally when they finish the medical assisting coursework and an appropriate clinical internship students may sit for the certified clinical medical assistant ccma exam welch says the academy has recently implemented a program to teach professional and employability skills he offers an observation i feel like it s really hard to go from high school to the job i feel like that s a big jump i could be wrong but that s what i feel like we need to get that postsecondary piece we have to find a model that really keeps them into it welch says to hear what vanderbilt is doing with nashville state if we could learn to build that bridge hey prefer our students if they re prepared and ready let s build that bridge where it is changing family trees welch notes we all see that there s a problem and we have to figure out a way to solve that in the medical field there s some postsecondary schooling skills work and it s a long game nowadays everything is a sprint instant gratification so there has to be some other teaching going on than just this is the skeletal system we have to do our part to prepare the kids so then they can be in that environment to take hold of the opportunities that are there i just feel like that pathway is ready to really explode and do what it s supposed to do tennessee state university s batts says about the stakeholder collaboration it s a partnership within a community coming together to address the needs of our community she continues i try to make a difference in my community and that s what drove me to do the different aspects of education i wanted to learn more about how to fix a problem that kept me up at times kids with asthma people down from copd and health disparities a lot of the students come from those same communities so they re already vested in it nashville state community college s whitehouse says if we take advantage of these opportunities to ladder up it s endless what we can do and it s just a matter of making the connection i want to talk about helping people connect to these opportunities because we need them we have seats available we need people to come in to provide health care services in a variety of different ways we can get you connected and into a program that is going to put you on that path for success says whitehouse not only put you on a path for success but we know connecting workers to high wage jobs then changes family trees right she adds think about times in your own life when people have invested in you and the fact that when someone invested in you they thought you mattered that feeling of mattering to someone else is motivation to continue to move forward and that s exactly what this opportunity is lastly vumc s valentine notes not everyone can go to college right now it has been very important to reach young people to let them know that if you don t go to college there are other options short term training programs until you figure out what you want to do sometimes the work experience you gain at one level can help you at your next level and courses you take may transfer into that next level with high school students it s very important to let them know if you don t go to college it s not the end of the world you can go later but there s some things you can do short term when you can still earn a decent income until you figure out the path forward valentine continues they may be the first one in their family to reach this level it opens up the doors of opportunities for them and generations to come because the children will look at their parents and say wow if mommy could do this then i can go back to school and do this too it also moves the needle in terms of having a more diverse workforce we re moving the needle in terms of ridding our communities of health disparities we re setting the examples for the next generation that s coming behind us and to me it s the most important work that we can do for our communities laura aka wrote this article for workingnation get more stories like this via email
savers under 30 years old will have many claims on their money saving for the future can sometimes get relegated behind the immediate demands on their cash but is vitally important in this series we will look at how young savers with this focus on the future can put their money to work we will examine the options for those with various starting pots whether they are built through saving from an early career or by other means such as inheritance from grandparents in this first part we focus on how savers with 10 000 can hope to grow that pot to 50 000 investing the money with rates on savings accounts paltry young savers who won t need to use the money for five years at a minimum should look to invest it in shares or funds a stocks and shares isa will make any gains tax free but before deciding on which investments to pick they will need to find the right fund shop or broker for them chris bredin of the lang cat a consultancy said young investors should aim to keep costs low especially with a smaller one off investment to play with that means they should pick from fund shops which charge based on a percentage of the investments held with them if ongoing costs are important to you it would make sense to stay clear of fixed fee platforms which are relatively expensive for investments below 50 000 mr bredin said vanguard is one of the cheapest options charging 0 15pc on top of the cost of funds or 15 for every 10 000 invested
while you mention how oils fats sugar salt and other parameters involved in cooking react with other ingredients how is the science affected when you go for a healthier alternative like palm jaggery instead of white sugar wheat flour instead of refined flour or a vegan variant to milk i am personally not a fan of advocating for health ingredients the consensus on these things change often every few years it also depends on how you define health a term that means different things to different people that being said if you decide to switch to a food substitute for whatever reason it doesn t mean it will always work in a recipe substitutes aren t chemical equivalents of ingredients they re replacing in a recipe that is the most important thing to keep in mind the recipe usually needs quite a bit of tweaking and from experience i can tell that not only does texture change but also taste stevia leaves a metallic taste that some people pick up palm jaggery does not always give consistent results in baking you can t simply sub vegan milk in an ice cream recipe that uses dairy they re chemically different so you need to work out ways to reduce the formation of ice crystals flours behave differently and even within wheat there are hard and soft wheat variants that lead to very different textures in most cases when substituting you ll need additional ingredients to replicate the original textures and also adjust the ratios of the ingredients

has increased that ericsson will in those tenders be allocated a significantly lower market share than its current market share the geopolitical situation can have consequences on the entire industry with an increased likelihood of further industry split separation of global value chains and separation of global standards for mobile telecommunications this overall development has also led to

song qiyu right founder of beijing comedy center interacts with the audience on may 3 courtesy photo when a33 a theater in beijing hosted a stand up comedy show on may 10 to the surprise of the organizers nearly 250 people turned up to laugh at the punchlines six years ago such attendance would have been unbelievable indeed there were even instances of shows having more comedians than viewers at the show wan da was one of the performers the 58 year old is a member of beijing comedy center a stand up comedy club established in 2015 wan articulated the concern of the industry many people are worried about the future of stand up comedy a genre that is very popular in the u s after its introduction in china can it adapt itself here he said then he answered his own query as the results show there is no need to worry we have survived and carry on some of the best u s traditions like poking fun at the u s president he said making the audience laugh according to a report by online ticketing platform damai the box office of stand up comedy shows increased by over 300 percent during the may day holiday from may 1 to 5 the number of viewers went up seven fold compared to the same period last year thanks to programs such as rock roast a comedy talk show competition with amateurs now into season 3 and short comic skits on streaming platforms more people are becoming familiar with the genre song qiyu a comedian and founder of beijing comedy center told beijing review thanks to these shows the popularity of the genre was not affected by covid 19 but helped people relieve their pressure and fears during self quarantine going to the theater to watch stand up comedy in places such as beijing and shanghai with their strong stand up comedy culture has even become a fashionable event for tourists from third and fourth tier cities song said as the industry grows these cities will also have more comedy clubs producing performances with local flavors he added in the spotlight stand up comedy captured the national imagination in 2010 when jilin province born humorist joe wong s performance at the radio and television correspondents association s annual dinner in washington d c gained much attention across domestic social media platforms wong was surprised by the flood of messages from chinese netizens they loved the performance a comic joking with a mic in hand tickling the audience s funny bone at that time the genre was still novel in china wong told china news weekly but a couple of years later the tonight 80s talk show helped the western import grow roots and become a young but popular member of the chinese comedy world in the beginning chinese stand up comedians participated in open mic sessions live shows where amateurs from the audience get a chance to perform in bars and small theaters to improve their scripts and performance taking their cues from the audience s response it gave new comedians a chance to perform in front of a small audience the tonight 80s talk show s success drove audiences to offline performances and they began to frequent the bars and theaters for a dose of belly laugh song was one of the performers at those open mic sessions in beijing and it became an important way for him to select his comedians after establishing his club he found wan a reporter writer focusing on judicial subjects in 2017 unlike the mainstream stand up comedians young people concentrating on trendy topics wan is older and highlights the responsibility of a media worker and public speaker in his comedy that same year roast a chat show that invited celebrities to come on and be roasted launched on a video streaming platform roast and rock roast quickly became the hottest tv shows of the year triggering wider discussion on social topics the first season of roast which lasted for two months notched up over 1 45 billion views marking stand up comedy s conquest of the wider public view generally our audiences are mostly in the 20 35 age group but recently some older people are also going to the theaters song said many people today watch offline shows as part of their cultural life some famous actors are so popular that it is as difficult to get tickets to their performances as it is to get tickets to the concerts of top public idols song s club hosts a show each week at big venues like a33 with over 330 seats instead of little bars every performance is popular on ticket booking platforms the real thing su mei a 27 year old bank officer in beijing is a stand up comedy enthusiast a regular watcher of both chinese and u s performers videos on the internet she experienced her first offline show last year seeing the actors who used to be two dimensional on the internet up close made the performance livelier she said offline performances also include interactions with the audience and improvisations according to occasions which lead to the audience having a better understanding of the genre generally stand up comedy consists of two types of acts a solo gig by a well known comedian or a show with six or seven performers including amateurs and newcomers the latter prevails in the chinese market where each artist gets 10 to 15 minutes in a 90 minute show which means they need to fire off four jokes a minute and put on a short skit for five to seven minutes for wan it s a piece of cake an extrovert he is willing to entertain people through social activities another part of comedy i like to share my thoughts and make people happy so all i need to do is to accumulate enough material for my performances he told beijing review compared to chinese traditional comedy performances such as cross talk stand up comedy has a lower bar as it doesn t need years of professional training or practice the low threshold allows everyone to take part work experience and personal observations of life are the sources of their inspiration different lives and jobs make the performances diverse giving them distinctive individual colors he said this is also the reason why many stand up comedians have a separate day job to relieve the economic pressure he said the core of stand up comedy is free expression shi laoban the founder of danliren another stand up comedy club in beijing told china daily in the u s the artists highlight topics such as religion race and women s rights but shi said the humor of chinese stand up comedy is different the personal style is still paramount also the chinese love playing with words su thinks this is the secret of the genre s popularity in china we all have the desire to express ourselves the comedians talk about their families jobs and relationships which are also part of our daily lives the comedy gives a voice not only to those performers but also to us an emerging industry su told beijing review the more performances she sees the higher up her bar goes for instance she does not like repetitive memes and punchlines as well as swear words wong is happy to see the development and vitality of the industry in china china has the best environment in the world which is unimaginable in the u s for instance many comics can earn over 8 000 yuan 1 243 a month which is enough to support their day to day life that is not the reality for many u s comedians and scriptwriters who have worked in the industry for four or five years he said however he has a warning too there is a huge space for the genre in china but we should be wary of growing too fast as the market still needs a stock of good work in china the income boosts teams of full time comedians with fresh college graduates joining them through their joint efforts the emerging industry will improve its standards and its popularity as well as influence i hope we have more performers with passion and inspiration in the future song said after his performances song stands outside the theater saying good night or thank you to each member of the audience or asking how the show was that is his way of showing his appreciation for their enthusiasm and the genre itself printed edition title toast with a roast copyedited by sudeshna sarkar
stockholm may 24 2021 prnewswire as previously disclosed by ericsson nasdaq eric in its q4 2020 financial report and in its 2020 annual report there is a risk that the decision by the post and telecommunication authority pts to exclude chinese vendors products from the 5g auction in sweden may adversely impact the economic interests of sweden and swedish industry including those of ericsson this risk has been included in the risk factors in ericsson s emtn prospectus the update coincides with ericsson s proposed issue under the emtn program and the change in relation to the risk factor as shown in the q4 report is reflected in the italicized text below updated extract of text from q4 report ongoing geopolitical and trade uncertainty from a range of factors may have a material adverse impact on our business operations business prospects and consequently on operating results financial conditions and our ability to meet our targets there are uncertainties for the future bilateral trading relationship between china and several countries as a result of restrictions towards chinese vendors in national 5g networks in sweden the post and telecommunication authority pts has taken a decision to exclude chinese vendors products from the 5g auction of special relevance for ericsson in this context is the trade relationship between sweden and china since ericsson even though it is a global company with a presence on all global markets has its headquarters in sweden and therefore risks collateral damages from a weakened swedish chinese relationship as a result of this decision there is a risk that the above lead to measures taken by china that are targeted at the economic interests of sweden and swedish industry including those of ericsson while ericsson is invited to various ongoing tender processes in china the final outcome remains uncertain and it is the company s current assessment that the risk has increased that ericsson will in those tenders be allocated a significantly lower market share than its current market share the geopolitical situation can have consequences on the entire industry with an increased likelihood of further industry split separation of global value chains and separation of global standards for mobile telecommunications this overall development has also led to several countries evaluating how to ensure uninterrupted access to telecommunication network infrastructure for example through promoting disaggregation of the radio access network and support of national communication network infrastructure champions as alternative to the established global vendors such as ericsson although the timing and extent of this remains unclear all of the above may have a material and potentially lasting adverse

getty a college degree is one of the best investments you can make if you want to succeed financially in life go to college high school students hear this conventional wisdom from everyone from education policy wonks to high school guidance counselors to parents statistics back this up people with bachelor s degrees can expect to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more over the course of their careers than high school graduates economist beth akers says this is true but it s only half the story in finance investors know that they can t only look at the average return of a stock or bond they also have to consider the risk that the asset won t pay off but somehow this bit of common sense is largely left out of the conversation on higher education college has a high return but it can be a risky proposition as well making college pay akers new book is written as a how to guide for prospective college students to navigate risk return tradeoffs as they pursue education beyond high school akers calls it the advice she wished she had received as an 18 year old but the book should also prompt the rest of us to reconsider how we talk about higher education akers shares the story of buying her first home the process involved wading through a mountain of paperwork and jumping through a series of bureaucratic hoops before she could close the deal there were income and credit checks building inspections and insurance contracts to complete the process could be maddening but it was all aimed at eliminating sources of risk buying a house is usually a good investment but not so much if it happens to be built on top of an active volcano higher education is different the road to college is lined with cheerleaders telling aspiring students that a college degree will be a golden ticket to success akers writes guidance counselors treat college as the natural next step for most high school students the federal government offers students tens of thousands of dollars in grants and subsidized loans with minimal quality safeguards we expect teenagers to make some of the most economically consequential decisions of their lives before they are legally allowed to drink alcohol often they make those decisions with minimal knowledge of the risks associated with every turn in the road one of the largest sources of risk is not graduating people who drop out of college don t get the financial returns of the degree but are stuck with student debt anyways taking longer than four years to finish college is also a major source of risk extra years in school mean less time in the labor force with commensurately lower lifetime earnings another problem some majors don t have the payoff students may expect there are also sources of risk completely outside the student s control if she graduates into a recession her college degree may not prove the guaranteed ticket to well paid employment that she hopes skills learned in college may also go obsolete through technological change considering risk can and should change students decisions a more expensive but higher quality college may be a better bet if it reduces risk public community colleges are cheap but they have shockingly high dropout rates cheaper tuition isn t good for much if students don t get the promised returns many of the proposals to reduce the end price of college such as larger pell grants or free tuition do little to address risk what would reduce risk in the financial sector investors use insurance for this purpose akers profiles some schools such as adrian college in michigan that have introduced guarantees to cover their former students loan payments if they don t find good employment one company now offers degree insurance to make students whole if they don t earn the promised salary for their degree program but every investor knows that the best way to reduce risk is diversification don t put all your eggs in one basket and don t put all your money in one stock yet the standard model of postsecondary education encourages students to invest almost all their time and money in a single degree akers devotes a chapter to unbundling higher education alternatives to the traditional college model such as competency based education and apprenticeships show promise but are largely seen as complements to the existing higher education infrastructure an fully diversified postsecondary experience would look unrecognizable relative to the status quo while akers doesn t take the argument this far in her book adequate diversification in postsecondary education would likely make the four year college degree a thing of the past instead people might head straight from high school into the labor force but occasionally take classes throughout their lives to gain experience in diverse skill sets to match the changing needs of the economy short term classes that do not accumulate to a degree would reduce the risk of non completion moreover those classes would be integrated with jobs in order to ensure that students skills are well matched to labor market needs incumbent providers in higher education would hate this idea why sell individual classes when you can sell an all in four year degree regulation and funding are built around the traditional higher education model so overturning it is a tall order but risk in higher education isn t going away unless something major changes we owe it to students to try
though most companies start small the dream of many is to grow into big business with a range of services or products designed to make life better for their clients and customers they also plan to have subsidiaries leveraging the opportunities available in the industry as well as the environment while some live this dream most chase it in perpetuity without actually experiencing it though some companies remain small by preference most are not able to make the transition from being small to becoming big some die in the process while others barely exist according to a research conducted by jessie hagen vice president small business administration at byline bank in the united states of america poor cash flow is the primary reason small businesses fail to grow according to her 82 per cent of small business failure is traceable to poor cash flow management while 79 per cent of businesses fail because they started out with inadequate funding therefore cash is the single most critical survival factor for a business if a business has challenges with cash flow it will struggle to exist and experience sluggish growth it is highly unlikely to make it into the big league but the problem with illiquidity is deeper and much more serious than cash shortage because the poverty of an organisation conditions the thinking of its people and they are unable to generate creative ideas that will get them out of the poverty circle some researchers at princeton university found out that poverty and all its related concerns require so much mental energy that those battling with shortage have less brainpower remaining to devote to other areas of life the researchers aver that being poor may keep a person from concentrating on the very avenues that would lead him out of poverty according to the finding a person s cognitive function is diminished by the constant and all consuming effort of coping with the immediate effects of having little money such as scrounging to pay bills and cut costs thus the person is left with fewer mental resources to focus on complicated indirectly related matters such as education job training and even time management all of which are necessary for him to experience the desired change so poverty keeps the poor so embroiled in their lack that they can t break out of that circle to generate more as it is with persons so it is with organisations companies that struggle with cash flow are totally consumed by their shortage and how to survive it that they never get to taking decisions that will extricate them from the scourge how poor cash flow affect organisations poor cash flow affects organisations in a number of ways here are some of them too engrossed with survival to see opportunities a company that has cash flow challenges runs a shoestring budget because money is never enough to finance its activities and projects consequently rather than focusing on opportunities that could take it beyond its current level it concentrates on meeting daily obligations so an organisation like that is more interested in living from day to day than in planning for the future such organisations cannot come up with long term vision because the whole of its attention is on making it till the next day all hands are on deck to pay suppliers contractors and staff such that exploring opportunities that may be available in the industry and the environment is not given any priority too careful to take risks organisations that have issue with liquidity are not emboldened to take risks they usually prefer to play safe and put their limited resources in business investments they are 100 per cent sure will yield a return not any business that has a chance of going awry but a company that does not take risks cannot grow big confused and discouraged after many months of working on their search engine without getting the desirable result larry page and sergey brin founders of google decided to sell their invention to george bell ceo of excite for one million dollars in 1999 the twain arrived at this decision because they had put all their money in the invention without the expected outcome in addition building the search engine was taking too much of their time and affecting the completion of their graduate studies so they decided to let go of it but when they got to bell rather than give them 1million he offered them 750 000 the duo exchanged glances and decided not to sell their invention for that amount they decided to rather go broke than sell the search machine for that pittance though disappointed by the turn of event they chose to hold on their decision paid off as a few months later some venture capitalists kleiner perkins caufield byers and sequoia capital put 25million in the business that was the turning point for google which today is one of the largest companies in the world cash crunch almost forced google founders to sell their fortune for a trifle but they stopped at the last minute not many companies with liquidity challenges are that fortunate cannot build momentum organisations that are in short cash supply lack the patience to allow great ideas to crystallise before moving on to something else for the reason that they are short of cash such companies are always in a haste to make things happen consequently if they try an idea and it does not immediately result in money they try something else such companies are consistently inconsistent and their inconsistency results in sustained shortage unable to attract right personnel the only factor of production responsible for wealth creation is labour but for a company s personnel to generate required revenue they must possess the right skills set as well as the right attitude however organisations that have cash flow issues hardly go for top rated employees with proven ability to pull in the kind of resources the organisation requires to break the poverty cycle because of cash consideration how companies break poverty cycle companies can break the cycle of illiquidity by taking the following steps change your thinking about the situation the words of albert einstein remain true according to him a problem cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that produced it this means every situation good or bad is a product of a thought process a situation remains the same until there is a change in the thought process that produced it so to move from illiquidity to buoyancy requires a change in the thinking process abundance is a product of a thought process so is shortage if the domineering thought in an organisation is shortage the company will experience shortage this may look insignificant but the truth is that every action taken by a company is a product of a thought the strategy deployed by a company is derived from a thought process so if the domineering thought in an organization is dictated by the unsavory situation the company is undergoing its decisions and actions will be determined by its situations and breaking the cycle will be herculean even in difficult times the actions of great companies are dictated by vision not their current realities the leadership of an organisation that is going through difficult times is changed only when the board comes to the realization that the leadership is unable to make a shift in its thinking from what is to what should be when apple faced illiquidity and stock slump in 1997 the board wanted a new thinking in the organisation but the ceo at the time gil amelio seemed fixed in his ways and was unwilling to try anything else so he was eased out and job steve was returned to the company steve went into the job with a new thinking and the fortune of the organization changed gradually so it is critical to develop a new thinking so as to take new steps that will take the organisation out of its liquidity challenge go against the grain change cannot happen without a change isaac newton s first law of motion states that a body at rest will remain in that condition unless an outside force acts on it so what births the change a company needs is something that it is not used to if a company keeps doing what it has always done it will keep repeating its past experiences poor companies remain poor because they never step out of their familiar zone in spite of the discomfort they face leadership is nothing without courage it is the call of leaders to make tough calls and take difficult decisions so the leader has to lead the organization against the grain to escape the rut the company has to try something new to get a different experience never wish things were easier jim rohn counsels that no one facing difficulties should wish things were easier instead of travelling that route wish you were better wishing things were easier will encourage you to look for an alibi not to do what you ought to do a situation will change when there is a determination to change it so what a leader whose organisation is faced with illiquidity should do is to increase his capacity as well as that of his team mates there is no situation an organization finds itself that some others had not been through find out what got them out of the pit and apply the principles situations surrender when confronted by men that are armed with knowledge have a long term plan one of the factors that keep poor companies in the poverty loop is the inability for long term projection they usually think short term and that limits their ability to take the right decisions that will enable them to get stronger and become more buoyant on the long run current realities are the results of steps taken in the past the realities of the future will be determined by actions taken now and the plans that are put in place now great changes don t happen overnight they happen overtime but only to those who plan for them therefore to get out of illiquidity companies must have a long term plan and execute the plan because an unexecuted plan is of no use to the planner last line falling into illiquidity may be accidental but getting out of it cannot but be intentional you should not miss these headlines

see earlier by peter brimelow the democratic party has tipped great news for the gop which doesn t deserve it the latest clash between israel and its palestinian subjects has exposed a new fissure within the u s left new anti white hard left voices in the democrat party are demanding the u s stop supporting colonizer israel historically american jews have been liberals who supported black causes mass immigration and israel as did the neoconservative jews who became influential in the gop yet now blacks immigrants and the leftists they have elected are undercutting support for america s greatest ally and jews are being attacked in american streets this must be a rude awakening some america first nationalists have tended to argue that blind support for israel is not in the national interest but that is decidedly not why the left now hates israel one reason naturally is the old marxist standby colonialism there s also rising anti white sentiment due to the unchallengeable moral hegemony of the black lives matter movement and the tipping of the democrat party and its leftist auxiliaries because of third world immigration the fundamental unavoidable reality at the heart of this conflict is there is an asymmetry of power here peacock nbc s streaming platform host mehdi hasan said last week one side is the occupier the other side is occupied hasan is an indian muslim immigrant born in britain hasan s fellow muslim ayman mohyeldin expressed a similar line on msnbc mohyeldin was born in cairo egypt not illinois and white leftists are falling in line popular hbo host john oliver said likewise and claimed israel practiced a form of apartheid feminist commentator anita sarkeesian an immigrant from canada with iraqi armenian parents shared this sentiment settler colonialism is a form of colonialism that seeks to replace the native population of the colonised land with a new society of settlers israel did not exist until 73 years ago when they were a settler colony that took over palestine and have been violently maintaining their position ever since if you don t know this history here is a good primer to get you started pic twitter com csll17aepe anita sarkeesian new show out now anitasarkeesian may 11 2021 of course this sounds a lot like the things leftists have long said about the united states white europeans replaced so called native americans etc etc but now the left is saying the same about israel and its top spokesmen don t want the u s supporting it influential democrat reps ilhan omar rashida tlaib and alexandria ocasio cortez for instance decry america for supporting the colonizers and back legislation to stop arms sales to israel aoc even called israel an apartheid state apartheid states aren t democracies alexandria ocasio cortez aoc may 15 2021 but then decided she had better denounce recent violence against jews in new york and elsewhere we will never ever tolerate antisemitism here in ny or anywhere in the world the recent surge in attacks is horrifying we stand with our jewish communities in condemning this violence you can help take nyc s free 1hr bystander intervention course alexandria ocasio cortez aoc may 21 2021 and who are these three they are in a nutshell third worlders who aren t in any sense americans or even vaguely connected to the west omar is somali refugee who says living in america is an everyday assault the angry foul mouthed tlaib is the daughter of palestinian immigrants their hatred of israel has always been open aoc was born in the u s to parents of puerto rican stock which means they weren t really americans either recall that the late charles krauthammer wondered why anti semitism was rising in europe many of his fellow neocons undoubtedly wonder why it is rising in the united states today because the likes of omar are elected to congress to rework james carville s famous utterance it s the immigration stupid then there s the rising power of leftist blacks who see everything through the prism of race missouri rep cori bush right a blm organizer for instance connects racial causes in america with those of palestine we re saying that our own government is funding a brutal and militarized disposition towards our very existence from ferguson to palestine palestinians are fellow poc and must be defended this view is also shared by new york rep jamaal bowman right who says he understands what it means to live in a society designed to perpetuate violence against people who look like me blm even issued a statement of solidarity with palestinians this week we are a movement committed to ending settler colonialism in all forms and will continue to advocate for palestinian liberation always have and always will be freepalestine black lives matter stands in solidarity with palestinians we are a movement committed to ending settler colonialism in all forms and will continue to advocate for palestinian liberation always have and always will be freepalestine black lives matter blklivesmatter may 17 2021 additionally nearly 150 prominent leftist advocacy groups spanning the range from feminists to non white interest lobbies signed a joint letter denouncing israel s plan to secure a jewish majority state the letter essentially called israel white supremacist the anti israel hectoring has worked remarkably well establishment democrats such as new jersey sen robert menendez heretofore a fervent israel supporter now seem surprisingly open to these ideas said menendez i am deeply troubled by reports of israeli military actions that resulted in the death of innocent civilians in gaza as well as israeli targeting of buildings housing international media outlets president joe biden previously reliably pro israel felt the heat and melted when tlaib got in his face he caved and insisted israel must cease hostilities and work toward a ceasefire with the palestinians it appears that prime minister benjamin netanyahu agreed to biden s request meanwhile tens of thousands of people demonstrated against israel s actions across america many were muslim immigrants bolstered by their ever increasing numbers in a manner similar to blm and antifa goons who staged the floyd hoax riots and attacked police and innocent bystanders muslims in los angeles and new york hunted down and beat up jews tonight pro palestinian individuals were driving with megaphones around la cienega beverly a heavily jewish area in los angeles and threw objects at jews at a restaurant table some threw things back the pro palestinian group came to the sidewalk to fight 1 pic twitter com rc72jhbppj sia kordestani siakordestani may 19 2021 can t load tweet sorry that page does not exist israel has also faced criticism for deporting africans and other unwanted foreigners critics in the u s says that s not jewish and demand israel become a refuge for all james zogby founder of the arab american institute credits blm the base of the party is moving in a very different direction than where the party establishment is if you support blm it was not a difficult leap to saying palestinian lives matter too zogby isn t alone the rise of identity politics made this almost inevitable daniel gordis senior vice president at the shalem college in jerusalem told lerer and medina it looks like weak against the strong the disenfranchised against the enfranchised the stateless against the state but the rise of identity politics occurred because the democrat base of voters is increasingly young and non white two demographics that don t care for israel solid surveys on the topic based on race are rare but the few that exist show an interesting picture a 2014 survey found that blacks and hispanics were more likely to blame israel than hamas for hostilities nearly half of whites blamed hamas while only 14 blamed israel more hispanics blamed israel 35 30 while blacks were nearly evenly split 27 blamed hamas 25 blamed israel a plurality of young people 18 through 29 years old faulted israel most americans 65 or older blamed hamas the differences are even greater today blacks are more likely to side with the palestinians than israelis 21 10 while hispanics are only slightly more likely to favor the israelis 23 17 whites on the other hand favor israel by more than 20 points this change follows for democrats as a whole democrats only slightly favor israelis over palestinians 43 38 most democrats also believe america must exert more pressure on the israelis to establish regional peace and 67 favor palestinian statehood in contrast 80 of republicans side with the israelis 65 believe america must exert more pressure on the palestinians a majority oppose palestinian statehood even among jews the differences are stark two thirds of jews aged 65 and older identify strongly with israel only 48 of jews 30 years old or younger share that attachment many young jews say they suffer from an identity crisis over the recent conflict they see the similarities between blm and the palestinian cause younger jews are also more likely to identity as non white as america becomes less white fewer of its people will support israel this must be bitter news for neocon immigration boosters like bill kristol they thought their invade the world invite the world strategy would make israel safer instead it made their favorite state much more vulnerable we would not have random jews being attacked in the streets if it weren t for mass immigration and the blm ification of the left as vdare com editor peter brimelow wrote in national review almost 30 years ago discussing the possible political consequences of immigration these political consequences need not threaten the integrity of the state polity just its foreign policy thus domestic ethnic group pressure clearly plays a role in washington s essentially contradictory attitudes to the white settler communities of southern africa and the middle east well now american zionists face an imported competing ethnic lobby will the u s turn against israel like it did against south africa the american left s anti white racism doesn t just apply to the historic american nation it encompasses the whole world there are no more exceptions to their rule even nations that don t see themselves as white have to abide by their rules oppressed non whites are good oppressor whites are bad on present course there will come a time when zionists wish they had supported the historic american nation rather than helped replace it washington watcher ii is an anonymous dc insider
back in february as the world was beating a path to taiwan s door for help to tackle a shortage of semiconductors the health minister got into a scrap with china over covid 19 vaccines beijing he suggested had used political pressure to derail taiwan s plan to purchase five million doses directly from germany s biontech se rather than via a chinese company which held the rights to develop and market the biontech pfizer inc vaccine across china hong kong macau and taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying retorted that taipei should stop hyping up political issues under the pretext of vaccine issues also read asia s covid surges should worry us all three months later taiwan is paying the price for a lack of vaccines with a surge in virus cases that threatens to trigger a lockdown having successfully sidestepped the first covid wave the government now faces a health emergency only about 1 per cent of its population is vaccinated so far with the potential to disrupt the chip industry that dominates the local economy and which is critical to an already squeezed global supply that s a link made by the head of taiwan s office in new york who warned of logistical problems without access to more shots yet by shunning vaccines from china and warning of more chip shortages if it can t source enough doses elsewhere the government is giving even greater incentive to the world s biggest economies to make investments that may erode taiwan s competitive edge in semiconductors over the long term taiwan s predicament illustrates its strategic yet vulnerable position at the confluence of us china tensions separated by a 110 mile 177 km wide strait taiwan is regarded as a province by beijing and its conquest is president xi jinping s key goal for historical and ideological reasons the us is an ally of taipei s democratic government and a big buyer of its exports dominated by chips produced by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co the onset late last year of chip shortages that have hobbled industries from autos to computer gaming had looked to give taipei global leverage tsmc is the world s leading provider of cutting edge semiconductors and holds 56 per cent of the so called foundry business of manufacturing chips designed by customers including apple inc and qualcomm inc but taiwan has suffered a sudden reversal of fortunes the pandemic comes just as a drought triggers power outages stoking economic uncertainty and a slump in what was the world s best performing stock index in the four years to january what s more the very source of taiwan s recent geopolitical clout its dominance of the market for cutting edge chips is under attack as governments from the us to europe and japan alerted to the strategic nature of the semiconductor supply chain seek to spur production at home china is pumping billions into catching up after washington imposed export controls on us chip technology i think we ve become too dependent on taiwan and korea that s the point we need a more balanced global supply chain pat gelsinger chief executive officer of silicon valley s intel corp the world s biggest chipmaker said in an interview the us and europe should act more aggressively to counter the imbalance of asia s lead in manufacturing semiconductors that are mostly consumed in the west he said intel is a rival and plans to challenge tsmc at the cutting edge but gelsinger isn t the only voice making for uncomfortable listening in taiwan commerce secretary gina raimondo said this month that while the biden administration is working with taipei and tsmc to address the chip shortage it s also looking to reduce us dependence on taiwan tsmc is in the process of building a new fabrication facility in the us some in washington have suggested that taiwan is a backdoor to china by enabling tech transfers republicans michael mccaul and tom cotton have called on the administration to engage with taipei to do more to mitigate the risk of taiwanese companies providing services and technologies to entities of concern a reference to chinese state backed companies with links to the military with the prospect of some 50 billion in government funding to build out chip making in the us and the promise of still more in europe and south korea there are signs that taiwan is starting to feel the heat the government is working to draft a new export control list targeting technologies with military use to tighten curbs on exports to china and raise the penalty for violations according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be named discussing policy deliberations that s after alchip technologies ltd s stock took a beating in april when the washington post reported that it supplied chips to phytium a people s liberation army affiliated entity alchip said it has always been in compliance with government regulations and that phytium projects were on hold taipei has become more alert to the possibility of chinese companies ramping up efforts to recruit taiwanese engineers last month the cabinet met to discuss how to prevent the outflow of local talent with the ministry of labour instructing local job search websites to remove ads recruiting taiwanese citizens to work for china particularly in the semiconductor industry companies and headhunters can be fined as much as nt 500 000 17 900 for advertising such jobs and nt 5 million for facilitating local engineers employment with chinese companies on the mainland ministry official huang chiao ting said job search site 1111 said it has removed close to 3 000 job listings investigators have visited the local offices of four chinese companies including bitmain technologies ltd within the last two months to look into allegations they recruited engineers illegally by more aggressively investigating chinese companies efforts to poach taiwanese engineers we hope we can help prevent potential trade secrets leaking to china should local talent get hired away said judy chen a spokeswoman for the hsinchu district prosecutors office she declined to name the other companies probed members of the ruling democratic progressive party are considering amending the law to boost penalties for intellectual property theft lawmaker chao tien lin is proposing life sentences for those found guilty of economic espionage a crime not currently on the statute books in taiwan also read chip shortage in focus as japan automakers ready to report profit drop taiwan needs to win trust from its partners and help prevent china from building a supply chain from stolen technology chao said in comments provided by his assistant whether it s enough to allay concerns in washington may become clearer with the publication of president joe biden s review of the semiconductor supply chain the 100 day review is due to conclude on june 4 what s already known is that there is bipartisan support to build us chip making and taiwan is in the cross hairs taiwan dominates semiconductor manufacturing and one company taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company virtually controls the market senator john cornyn a texas republican who introduced the chips for america act to boost us production said on the senate floor this month the sustainability of taiwan s industry has also come into question after it suffered power outages this month focusing attention on environmental factors including water shortages and uncertainty over future electricity supply for power hungry chip plants taiwan can potentially overcome the virus outbreak as well as the power and water shortages showing its companies can still satisfy global demand by manufacturing mostly in taiwan without any issue said arisa liu a researcher at the taiwan institute of economic research in the short term that will require vaccines most likely from europe or the us according to chunhuei chi a former health policy adviser in taiwan who is now director of the centre for global health at oregon state university many politicians in taiwan urged the taiwanese government to use microchips as leverage for vaccines while the government is reluctant to use that leverage explicitly if the us is concerned about the supply of chips from tsmc the us would have incentives to provide taiwan with vaccines to make sure production will not be disrupted by this outbreak he said share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit
when black lives matter protests spread across the nation last year many banks responded with splashy pledges to do better in part by hiring and promoting more people of color now some of those banks are tying executive pay to certain diversity and inclusion metrics a recent analysis of 60 companies executive pay packages suggests that more banks are incorporating diversity equity and inclusion factors into executive pay decisions this year than in the past while the details can vary from bank to bank the basic intent is still the same if diversity is going to play a more prominent role in the business strategy then banks need to hold executives accountable for those efforts and pay is one way to do that boards are learning how these incentives are working said shaun bisman a principal at the consulting firm compensation advisory partners which conducted the analysis this is really in the beginning stages where companies and boards want to see how these incentives are working before they set these more quantifiable goals larger banks will likely emerge as the trendsetters with smaller and regional banks following suit as regulators shareholders and the public more closely scrutinize whether companies follow through on their diversity pledges wells fargo for example said last year that it would tie senior leaders compensation partly to their progress on improving diversity at the company a report last year by the democratic staff of the house financial services committee faulted big banks for what it characterized as a lack of diversity among their senior executives and on their boards of directors the findings were based on the results of a survey of 44 large banking companies while 58 of those firms employees were white 80 of their board members were in its analysis of executive pay compensation advisory partners looked at publicly held bank holding companies that had over 10 billion of assets and also filed proxy statements before april 10 of this year about one third of those companies included some kind of diversity equity and inclusion factors in their executive pay plans this year said kelly malafis a founding partner at the firm roughly three quarters of those banks or 24 of the overall sample used a discretionary adjustment related to diversity and inclusion meaning that the compensation committee could choose to adjust the amount awarded based on the firm s progress or lack thereof typically the diversity and inclusion factors are tied to annual bonuses rather than long term incentives while comparable data from earlier years was not available malafis said that tying executive pay to diversity and inclusion is a fairly new practice as a result companies are generally looking at qualitative factors or a range of improvement on certain goals as opposed to hard numbers when making pay decisions she added part of that is maybe they don t know what the right number is or they want to look at several different factors not just the numbers but maybe also the promotions and performance and progress malafis said some of it is they know it s the right thing to do but they re not sure how to measure it comerica in dallas began incorporating diversity and inclusion metrics into executive pay this year said megan burkhart chief human resources officer last year the 86 3 billion asset company created a scorecard that it could use to track its progress on a variety of diversity indicators including succession planning volunteerism business outreach and supplier diversity for about 320 executives across the organization a portion of their individual awards will depend on how much progress the bank makes on those measures we believe that tying these metrics to compensation certainly increases the attention to it and will help us to ultimately achieve the goals we ve set for ourselves burkhart said comerica also plans to evaluate its criteria on an ongoing basis said nate bennett the company s chief diversity officer and head of talent acquisition on the issue of supplier diversity comerica is now looking not just at how much it spends on diverse suppliers but also whether that spending keeps pace with overall supplier spending while comerica had increased its spending on diverse suppliers the dollar amount hadn t increased at the same rate as overall spending some of the parts of our scorecard are a moving target and require almost constant discussion on an annual basis bennett said the 176 2 billion asset keycorp considers diversity equity and inclusion goals among a number of non financial factors that it uses to calculate executive pay said brian fishel chief human resources officer the company recently started getting more prescriptive about the diversity and inclusion factors it considers fishel said those factors include representation of women and minorities in the company s management ranks employee volunteerism and engagement with internal programs cleveland based key has also broadened the conversation about diversity to include issues like mental health in addition to racial and gender representation according to fishel more companies are beginning to evaluate the use of environmental social and governance metrics in executive compensation said gillian emmett moldowan a partner who specializes in compensation and governance at the law firm shearman sterling that trend has accelerated over the past year driven in large part by the pandemic we are seeing the diversity and other social or human capital targets along with environmental targets more commonly in annual bonus plans than in long term performance stock incentives but that may shift and that s something to keep an eye on she said moldowan said that prior to the past year she had generally seen more compensation plans tied to environmental or sustainability metrics than to social issues like diversity and inclusion the use of social metrics which could also include employee safety and wellness in addition to diversity and inclusion has significantly increased this year she said for now most bank compensation committees will feel more comfortable awarding diversity and inclusion bonuses when they are attached to a range of improvement on certain diversity metrics as opposed to meeting more specific targets said malafis of compensation advisory partners it s easy to put a hard number around representation but is representation the full picture it s diversity equity and inclusion so what does that mean and how do we measure it she said that s where the conversations are happening there are companies that don t want to make it just about representation it has to be a more holistic approach
back in february as the world was beating a path to taiwan s door for help to tackle a shortage of semiconductors the health minister got into a scrap with china over covid 19 vaccines beijing he suggested had used political pressure to derail taiwan s plan to purchase five million doses directly from germany s biontech rather than via a chinese company which held the rights to develop and market the biontech pfizer vaccine across china hong kong macau and taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying retorted that taipei should stop hyping up political issues under the pretext of vaccine issues three months later taiwan is paying the price for a lack of vaccines with a surge in virus cases that threatens to trigger a lockdown having successfully sidestepped the first covid wave the government now faces a health emergency only about 1 of its population is vaccinated so far with the potential to disrupt the chip industry that dominates the local economy and which is critical to an already squeezed global supply tsmc is the world s leading provider of cutting edge semiconductors and holds 56 of the so called foundry business that s a link made by the head of taiwan s office in new york who warned of logistical problems without access to more shots yet by shunning vaccines from china and warning of more chip shortages if it can t source enough doses elsewhere the government is giving even greater incentive to the world s biggest economies to make investments that may erode taiwan s competitive edge in semiconductors over the long term predicament taiwan s predicament illustrates its strategic yet vulnerable position at the confluence of us china tensions separated by a 177km wide strait taiwan is regarded as a province by beijing and its conquest is president xi jinping s key goal for historical and ideological reasons the us is an ally of taipei s democratic government and a big buyer of its exports dominated by chips produced by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co the onset late last year of chip shortages that have hobbled industries from autos to computer gaming had looked to give taipei global leverage tsmc is the world s leading provider of cutting edge semiconductors and holds 56 of the so called foundry business of manufacturing chips designed by customers including apple and qualcomm but taiwan has suffered a sudden reversal of fortunes the pandemic comes just as a drought triggers power outages stoking economic uncertainty and a slump in what was the world s best performing stock index in the four years to january what s more the very source of taiwan s recent geopolitical clout its dominance of the market for cutting edge chips is under attack as governments from the us to europe and japan alerted to the strategic nature of the semiconductor supply chain seek to spur production at home china is pumping billions into catching up after washington imposed export controls on us chip technology i think we ve become too dependent on taiwan and korea that s the point we need a more balanced global supply chain pat gelsinger ceo of silicon valley s intel the world s biggest chip maker said in an interview the us and europe should act more aggressively to counter the imbalance of asia s lead in manufacturing semiconductors that are mostly consumed in the west he said intel is a rival and plans to challenge tsmc at the cutting edge but gelsinger isn t the only voice making for uncomfortable listening in taiwan commerce secretary gina raimondo said this month that while the biden administration is working with taipei and tsmc to address the chip shortage it s also looking to reduce us dependence on taiwan tsmc is in the process of building a new fabrication facility in the us taipei has become more alert to the possibility of chinese companies ramping up efforts to recruit taiwanese engineers some in washington have suggested that taiwan is a backdoor to china by enabling tech transfers republicans michael mccaul and tom cotton have called on the administration to engage with taipei to do more to mitigate the risk of taiwanese companies providing services and technologies to entities of concern a reference to chinese state backed companies with links to the military with the prospect of some 50 billion in government funding to build out chip making in the us and the promise of still more in europe and south korea there are signs that taiwan is starting to feel the heat control list the government is working to draft a new export control list targeting technologies with military use to tighten curbs on exports to china and raise the penalty for violations according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be named discussing policy deliberations that s after alchip technologies stock took a beating in april when the washington post reported that it supplied chips to phytium a people s liberation army affiliated entity alchip said it has always been in compliance with government regulations and that phytium projects were on hold taipei has become more alert to the possibility of chinese companies ramping up efforts to recruit taiwanese engineers last month the cabinet met to discuss how to prevent the outflow of local talent with the ministry of labour instructing local job search websites to remove ads recruiting taiwanese citizens to work for china particularly in the semiconductor industry companies and headhunters can be fined as much as nt 500 000 us 17 900 for advertising such jobs and nt 5 million for facilitating local engineers employment with chinese companies on the mainland ministry official huang chiao ting said job search site 1111 said it has removed close to 3 000 job listings investigators have visited the local offices of four chinese companies including bitmain technologies within the last two months to look into allegations they recruited engineers illegally by more aggressively investigating chinese companies efforts to poach taiwanese engineers we hope we can help prevent potential trade secrets leaking to china should local talent get hired away said judy chen a spokeswoman for the hsinchu district prosecutors office she declined to name the other companies probed members of the ruling democratic progressive party are considering amending the law to boost penalties for intellectual property theft lawmaker chao tien lin is proposing life sentences for those found guilty of economic espionage a crime not currently on the statute books in taiwan taiwan needs to win trust from its partners and help prevent china from building a supply chain from stolen technology taiwan needs to win trust from its partners and help prevent china from building a supply chain from stolen technology chao said in comments provided by his assistant whether it s enough to allay concerns in washington may become clearer with the publication of president joe biden s review of the semiconductor supply chain the 100 day review is due to conclude on 4 june what s already known is that there is bipartisan support to build us chip making and taiwan is in the cross hairs taiwan dominates taiwan dominates semiconductor manufacturing and one company taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company virtually controls the market senator john cornyn a texas republican who introduced the chips for america act to boost us production said on the senate floor this month the sustainability of taiwan s industry has also come into question after it suffered power outages this month focusing attention on environmental factors including water shortages and uncertainty over future electricity supply for power hungry chip plants taiwan can potentially overcome the virus outbreak as well as the power and water shortages showing its companies can still satisfy global demand by manufacturing mostly in taiwan without any issue said arisa liu a researcher at the taiwan institute of economic research in the short term that will require vaccines most likely from europe or the us according to chunhuei chi a former health policy adviser in taiwan who is now director of the center for global health at oregon state university many politicians in taiwan urged the taiwanese government to use microchips as leverage for vaccines while the government is reluctant to use that leverage explicitly if the us is concerned about the supply of chips from tsmc the us would have incentives to provide taiwan with vaccines to make sure production will not be disrupted by this outbreak he said reported by alan crawford debby wu and iain marlow c 2021 bloomberg lp

the decision by the reserve bank to retain the repo rate at 3 5 home loan base rate at 7 is great news and underscores the best buyer s market in decades according to samuel seeff chairman of the seeff property group while to date much of the updraft in the property market has been interest rate induced driven by first time buyers seeff says overall volumes which is about 20 000 per month at best remains well below what it should be for such a low interest rate this is due to a large sector of the market not transacting to any notable degree for some time this may however be about to change seeff says there are early signs that confidence could be returning to the upper end of the market president cyril ramaphosa s recent actions against corruption both in terms of his zondo commission testimony and demonstrable implementation of the anc s step aside rule has been a confidence boost we have recently seen more high value transactions and seeff has achieved record high sales months boosted by an increase in high value transactions the most recent being sales of r45 million to r55 million and more in the pipeline foreign and second home buyers are also investing again not just on the atlantic seaboard but in the coastal towns such as plettenberg bay as well sa expats also seem to be investing in property with the intention of returning to the country that said seeff remains of the view that the reserve bank should be taking a more aggressive stance to boost the economy 2 economic growth for the year is simply not enough for an emerging market more needs to be done to foster a climate for investment economic growth and job creation he says globally central banks have been far more aggressive with their rate cuts the uk and usa are reporting booming real estate markets with up to 20 to 30 offers on a single property reported in the us in sa the local boom has only really been in the first time buyer sector of the market despite the rapid rise in the cpi to 4 4 it remains within the reserve bank s target range of 3 to 6 percent the hike in inflation is also pandemic driven and not due to overspending by consumers because of a low interest rate the currency continues to hold up well recently rallying significantly against the us dollar and more than recovering the losses suffered since last year april nonetheless seeff is very upbeat about the prospects for property for the year ahead he says we could even start seeing the build up to a market wide boom later this year the interest rate should remain at the current low rate perhaps hiking by a marginal 25 basis points at the most south africa is still one of the best places to live and buy property in and conditions remain favourable for buyers both from an interest rate and price growth perspective price growth has been confined mostly to the mid to low price bands stock levels remain well balanced but seeff expects stock shortages towards the latter part of the year

there is increasing evidence of blockages in the economy as the strength of demand outpaces available supply whether this is raw materials or labour the pressures are clearly inflationary the question

commented wilfred man founder and ceo of magiclytics the pink and blue team knows how to produce amazing fine goods for their niche consumer and they know influencer based marketing is the best way to build their brand but they have previously lacked visibility in trying to implement influencer based marketing strategies like driving in an unfamiliar area with no gps or map magiclytics has proprietary analytics that can offer unique guidance and intelligence in that process including how much response to expect and how to maximize it we look forward to helping pink and blue find breakthrough success clubhouse media group inc otcmkts cmgr has pulled back sharply since trading above 20 share earlier this year but the pullback has not been spurred by poor growth data or bad fundamental changes the stock simply got ahead of itself earlier this year and then pulled back with other growth oriented speculative plays if anything the growth prospects for the company have

the big trend defining markets right now as long end interest rates crawl ever higher is the bias toward the value side of the market over the growth side another way to state this same dynamic is this a bias toward stocks that will show a jump in cash flows as society reopens upon our approach to a vaccine induced state of covid 19 herd immunity one of the most important areas in that constellation of concepts is the physical fitness space and one of the most important reasons to love this space at this point isn t simply that people will be returning to normal consumer behavior in the year ahead versus the year behind but because we have seen enormous consolidation in the space over the past year due to financial stress that factor equates to pricing power looking forward and that represents a huge advantage for shareholders in related fitness names with that in mind we take a look at some of the most interesting names in the fitness space including planet fitness inc nyse plnt b2digital inc otcmkts btdg nautilus inc nyse nls and peloton interactive inc nasdaq pton planet fitness inc nyse plnt bills itself as one of the largest and fastest growing franchisors and

income attributable to planet fitness inc was 5 6 million or 0 07 per diluted share compared to 8 6 million or 0 11 per diluted share in the prior year period we are very encouraged by the clear and steady improvement in overall sentiment we witnessed in america during the first quarter and the corresponding impact it had on our business we re pleased to announce that we experienced sequential net member growth in each month of the quarter ending march with 14 1 million members said chris rondeau chief executive officer even in light of this news plnt hasn t really done much of anything over the past week with shares logging no net movement over that period planet fitness inc nyse plnt generated sales of 111 9m according to information released in the company s most recent quarterly financial report that adds up to a sequential quarter over quarter growth rate of 16 4 on the top line in addition the company has a strong balance sheet with cash levels far exceeding current liabilities 503 9m against 115 2m b2digital inc otcmkts btdg is a very interesting name in this space in fact most people probably don t realize the name is in the fitness space but it is b2digital is best known as the premier development league for mma in other words it has established itself as basically the farm league for the ufc but the company s business model is actually levered to its growth as a training facility chain through its one more gym segment while its increasingly high profile mma live events segment is making money its main function is to build a household name for the brand to draw in demand for its gym network the company has we should note a rapidly growing network of fitness facilities with a market cap of just over 5 million it is on pace to possibly drive 4 5 million in sales over the coming year from its gym network not to mention as much as another 1 5 million from its live pay per view mma events as it expands locations and drives growth from recent acquisitions and that s in spite of the massive headwind that has been in place thus far this year from the pandemic b2digital inc otcmkts btdg most recently announced a continuation of that trend with the company just announcing the closing of its acquisition of the equity assets and interests of club fitness inc an alabama corporation located in alabama according to the release this fitness facility will become the fifth one more gym location to be owned and operated by b2digital as a fitness and fighter training facility linked to the company s b2 fighting series combat sports brands the company plans to renovate the facility and add jiu jitsu boxing and mma instruction areas to integrate it fully into the b2 training facilities network the company continues to seek to drive long term shareholder value by cultivating the strong synergy between its b2 fighting series and one more gym brands creating an ecosystem for fighter development as well as a high impact marketing channel targeting aspiring fighters and mma fans the birmingham area has great potential for the b2 brand commented greg p bell chairman ceo of b2digital this location should fit into our model hand in glove given our existing branding footprint in the region and its overall potential as a high quality training facility location this acquisition continues to make good on our stated plan to acquire 1 2 new gyms each quarter to drive and increased our revenue growth for b2 we continue to anticipate brand derived revenue growth for each acquired gym leading to continued overall performance in the business over the short intermediate and long term horizons b2digital inc otcmkts btdg pulled in sales strong sales in its last reported quarterly financials with top line growth of 126 and an estimate for
