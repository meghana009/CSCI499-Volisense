japan with her indent heritage so different from ours is non poised on the threshold of democracy will she turn our way or russia s nora waln author of the house of exile and beaching for the stars has been living m japan for the past two years ii ith her disarming quaker spirit she has penetrated farther than most americans in her understanding of the uncertainty and the aspiration of the japanese people her findings will come to us in the form of a regular monthly article next month she will tell of the grass roots revolution in japan ami of how the wealthy japanese family has responded to the reform by nora waln 1 rain pelting the roof woke me sliding back the walls of the room which opens to the court of the wing where i sleep when i am yasuko s guest i was close to the downpour yet protected by the eaves when the shower was over the darkness was the fragrant dark of country night in an upland hamlet i heard the river and the clatter of wooden sandals on the highway as a traveler passed the hell insect called suzurnushi hummed a tinkling cadence light came above the wall through the branches of a walnut tfee the lull moon shone down front a sky veiled bv float ing clouds i saw the beauty of the courtyard in while light dappled with shadow peace was on every clean washed stone and shrub there was light enough to read or write i reached for my diary and put down as well as i could remember all that had happened the previous day after mrs masa mukaibo my companion interpreter and 1 went to 1 jeno railway station in tokyo at seven thirty in the morning to board the train that brought us north into the car with us came children and the adults who were taking them to country relatives now that schools had closed for doyo the season of greatest heat and old men and old women in neighborhood parties wearing the names ol their villages on arm bands who were en route to the big buddhist temple at nagano city where they believe that the keys to heaven which should be touched before life ends are kept and others i he school children offered the old people seats places were found for everyone the crowd was in holiday mood excepting several men who acted hostile and suspicious and the tired women and children with them they were men of nagano prefect ure on t heir way home after long absence yet 1 here was no radiance in them in the company of two thousand the vanguard of ninety five thousand prisoners of war expected back from the soviet i nion they had come into the port of maxuru w ith manners more brusque and with singing more harsh than when they went away they were separated now from the great company of repatriates with whom they had shouted in the streets of the capital that they were back to unite japan with the mainland of asia a few looked bewildered some were alert as if to an unseen danger the women and children who had gone south to meet them were very quiet the train left tokyo and crossed the fertile plain which was under water in disastrous flood when f arrived in japan two years ago now as far as mv eyes could sec on either side were neat settlements firmly banked rice paddies filled with good crops patches of soya beans root vegetables many kinds of edible plants and busy people homes had been rebuilt shrubs replanted groves of graceful bamboo flattened by the rushing waters had stood up and grown taller since the flood subsided stone images ol jezu protector of children and wayfarers if knocked down had been set up again at the crossroads they guarded one near the train window had vases filled with fresh flowers at his feet we came to the hills their barrenness had caused the flood the slopes from which lumber had been taken by government order during the war had been reforested by general macarthur s order with little t rees among the hills were valleys gardened as trimly as well tended english kitchen gardens fruit trees were trelliscd against the outcroppings of gray rock every tiny space in valley or on mountain ledge that could be tilled without causing soil to slip away was cultivated even if it held no more than a few potatoes wheat buckwheat and barley were grown in rows like garden plants because farmers have learned that the most handfuls of grain can be produced this way occasionally we saw a small ox or a horse drawing a little plow or cultivator but nearly all ihe work was being done by hand where every clod has to be carefully husbanded farmers fear that waste will be caused by the clumsiness ol animals or machines though agricultural advisers want to modernize farming at homes with thatched roofs women had their bright quilts out to air spread in patches of whiteness newly washed clothes drying in the sun were like snow upon the grass i saw the repatriates looking intently children outside waved to children in ihe train and our children waved back nobody in the car or in the fields we passed was in rags and tatters this fourth summer of the occupation many of ihe field workers had on new widebrimmed straw hats a young woman wearing a blue cotton kimono and a crimson obi had her skirl pinned up to save the hem from soil she straightened from her reaping and waved a bundle of cut grain 2 behind me i heard the sound of weeping one of the hardest faced repatriates sat straight up and cried 11 is sobs were heartbreaking he had neither wife nor child with him we were all quiet nobody spoke or went to comfort him impulse moved me but caution held me to my seat long ago in china i was taught never to intrude when another lost control he regained self control as soon as he could we passed through the first of many tunnels water wheels turned on the swift current of little streams close by little sheds in which there are always many homemade arrangements for using water power in domestic tasks hoys who had been fishing both had strings of trout the americans have helped us stock our rivers and lakes better than ever before a mother told her children so loudly that it seemed as if she wanted the repatriates to hear the americans of natural resources section of t he occupation know how little we have had and they try to make it more the old fish hatcheries have been improved and new ones made can we go fishing tomorrow her boy and girl asked and she nodded yes soon after this directly across from us a repatriate stood on his seat have you forgotten that we take off our shoes reminded bis wife gently he glared at her and she smiled at him he looked at his feet slowly sat down and took off the russian boots he wore then stood on the seat again mime ga ippai he began in a rough voice meaning my heart is full sa nanto mo iyen he faltered 1 can t put it in easy words don t try interrupted a man who did not look as if he were a repatriate he did not look so rough well fed and physically strong as they did he pulled a red hag up from his vest pocket and pushed it clown again let s sing and he stalled a song about wake my country a few joined in some women several boys and girls hut it was feeble comeon said he addressing the repatriate who had cried you can sing the man hesitated then sang he had a big voice soon he was leading conducting with his right hand there were scattered voices from all over the ear when those willing to try did not know the words he went back over the verse as if practiced at this they sang one song and then another until i felt caught in a nightmare was i back in nazi germany again inner terror gripped me the school children were following him they closed with the japanese army song banda no sukara right after the red youth of the world from prague the repatriate who had tried to make a speech did not sing although he was ordered to do so he sal down for a while he held his head in his hands and then he looked up and down the car and finally stared beyond his wife out of the window she touched his knee he jerked away finally the singing was over it was noon we opened our lunches venders on station platforms offered fruit for sale watermelons plums apricots and fine peaches purchases were made through open windows all the journey passengers got off and on at every depot trainmen in uniform came on the platform nl each halt welcoming the incomers saving farewell to country people going away and generally attending to things as if the railway were theirs the railway men all look worried said a farmer in front of us to his son sixty five thousand were dismissed inst week ips rumored that the american advised plan is going to throw a million or more out railway men have counted on the job for life as a nation we have all been happy that we could build this foreign idea of travel and find work lor so many in it where the british used eight men we could find employment for forty eight or more it s the dodge plan said his son it s reduction of staffs in all branches of industry and government to the number who can do the work we arc studying it at high school in a new course called social economics efficiency without humanity our teachers call it the fathers of many in school have lost their jobs the families are frantic they don t know what to do jim s mother is selling her kimonos to the u s military government team s wives that won t help for long we went into a tunnel the farmer was silent until we came out now he said firmly mm remember this son shogun mac aloof and benevolenl is one of the best rulers we have had in alt our long history a man is not judged by his nationality but by his deeds you must not forget what i am going to say pass it down the generations he came in a war lord and he got our men disarmed and back into their homes without the use of his soldiers violence there was bitter feeling among us and yet not one dared to fight another in civil war he has seen to it that we got enough imported food to keep down famine and he has helped bring our farming to the highest yield we have ever had we have got good seeds and good fertilizers our teachers say that others are now making the plans he must execute whatever the future the past is to be remembered insisted the father a repatriate turned to speak to them the problem is exactly the same as before the war not enough land for so many people all that the americans have done is to keep down social unrest by supporting you at the cost of their taxpayers that cannot go on forever they have an industrial program for getting in enough raw materials processing them and finding oriental markets which will buy enough to pay for the margin of food we must import to live on a modest scale i m president of my women s club and i do not want to hear criticism of the americans they have helped us the soviets send us nothing but trouble a matronly woman spoke up we don t want violence here said another woman we had enough of war the americans brought in an era of peace without saying anylhing since the singing the man

duluth so how did ikonics a modest sized manufacturer of etching and imaging products in duluth become an acquisition target for an east coast cryptocurrency mining startup representatives of ikonics paramour terawulf inc declined to answer that question posed by the news tribune in recent weeks but the most likely answer seems to be that ikonics was a relatively inexpensive vulnerable and thinly traded company already listed on the nasdaq exchange terawulf based in easton maryland has been on the hunt for capital to launch its bitcoin mining venture which is dependent upon rapidly amassing a lot of computing power as well as obtaining access to a steady supply of inexpensive electrical power terawulf also needs investors but taking a company to market through an initial public offering is a time consuming expensive and complicated undertaking the company saw a quicker route advertisement it bought out a business that already was publicly traded and then took it in a new direction spinoff plan from the start terawulf made it clear that it had no interest in building ikonics legacy business in fact it announced its intention to sell those assets and operations related to screen printing etching and photochemistry applications sue boudrie operations manager for ikonics advanced material solutions looks through a perforated engine inlet liner on sept 25 2018 ikonics uses abrasives to create thousands of tiny holes in the material which is used to deaden sound on an airbus a 320 ikonics which is up for sale employs 83 people company wide including 78 in duluth according to its website bob king file duluth news tribune ikonics isn t a huge manufacturer by any stretch but its website says the company employs 83 people with 78 of those positions in duluth that s a fair number of local jobs with solid pay it s not clear what will become of them though as terawulf remains a motivated seller at the time of the merger ikonics investors were promised that for each share of the company they held they would receive 5 in cash one share of terawulf one contingent value right entitling them to collect a cut of the proceeds from any future sale of the legacy business completed within 18 months ikonics began trading as wulf on dec 7 2021 so ikonics investors stand to financially benefit from any sale that occurs before that window closes in june 2023 local ikonics officials would not comment on the status of ikonics current operations or the prospects for a sale redirecting those questions to terawulf for its part terawulf representatives declined to discuss the matter with the news tribune advertisement but there have been recent signs of movement pending property sale the news tribune has confirmed that a local nonprofit is performing due diligence in anticipation of closing on the purchase of ikonics newest facility located at 2302 commonwealth ave inside an industrial park created on the site of the former atlas cement plant the deal has not yet been completed but knowledgeable parties indicated it appears imminent assuming no red flags arise in the interim the terms of the pending transaction have not been disclosed but st louis county last estimated the market value of the property to be more than 4 5 million ikonics built the single level facility in 2008 and later expanded it several years later to 35 480 square feet guests and employees celebrate the expansion of ikonics commonwealth avenue facility with a ribbon cutting and a reception sept 22 2016 although the deal hasn t been completed yet a sale of the property to a local nonprofit is expected close soon barring any unforeseen complications bob king file duluth news tribune if the sale does go through ikonics still has another facility in duluth and chris fleege director of duluth s planning and economic development division said the city has been assured any sale should have little impact on production as he was told the company s commonwealth avenue location is mostly warehouse space ikonics other facility is an older four story 48 160 square foot manufacturing plant at 4832 grand ave with an estimated market value of nearly 1 17 million ikonics also has inquired about the possibility of temporarily leasing back space in its commonwealth avenue building while it figures out a longer range solution according to an officer of the nonprofit looking to buy the building so far fleege said city staff has not been asked for any assistance with orchestrating a change of ownership at ikonics or lining up additional new space to accommodate its continued local operations advertisement while duluth city council president arik forsman acknowledged that he doesn t know what a sale of ikonics local operations may bring he said it would be a shame to see those jobs and those facilities not continue to operate so i hope they find a buyer who is in the same state and sees them as a value add and they can continue doing what they re doing and maybe even expand market buzz the buzz around terawulf was intense especially as the company touted its plans to operate using at least 90 carbon neutral energy sources the company brought its first facility online in march the lake mariner cryptomine in upstate new york drawing on hydropower terawulf also is working to open a second nuclear powered bitcoin mining facility in pennsylvania later this year one of the criticisms of the industry has been the amount of energy it consumes as racks full of computers race to solve mathematical problems adding to a blockchain database and being rewarded with cryptocurrency as they do bitcoinenergyconsumption com reports that it takes 2 170 kilowatt hours of energy to produce a single bitcoin as much as the average u s household would use in 74 days on an annual basis bitcoin mining operations around the globe now are expected to consume roughly the same amount of energy as thailand with a population of nearly 70 million people cryptomining can be such an energy hog that china has banned it completely yet terawulf has promised it can mine and grow without harming the environment actor gwyneth paltrow founder and ceo of goop speaks at the 2022 milken institute global conference in beverly hills california u s may 4 2022 she was just one of the celebrities drawn to invest millions of dollars in terawulf as it went public mike blake reuters that proposition was an attractive pitch drawing in investors including some a list celebrities actress gwyneth paltrow was part of a group that provided 200 million

duluth news tribune ikonics stock traded at 11 31 per share the day before the merger agreement was announced but the price soared to 42 31 on nov 19 2021 on news of its new ownership and speculation that cryptocurrency and more specifically bitcoin would continue to grow in value but the timing of wulf s launch could hardly have been worse for its early investors the stock s value has fallen even more sharply than the troubled crypto market in recent days terawulf briefly traded below 3 per share more than a 90 plunge from ikonics high just before its ticker symbol officially changed to wulf to be fair all cryptomining operations have taken a hit as the value of bitcoin the largest share of the crypto market has been cut by more than half since it peaked above 65 000 in november and some analysts have suggested this actually is an opportune time for the intrepid to invest in a downtrodden market and young up and coming business such as terawulf bitcoin for beginners bitcoin has bounced back from previous downturns such as it experienced in 2017 noted vivian fang an associate professor of accounting who teaches about cryptocurrencies at the carlson school of management she said it s her opinion that cryptocurrency is more than a flash in the pan and will have staying power despite its ups and downs fang explained that cyptocurrency is a digital currency built on decentralized systems that rely on cryptography for security it s completely digital there are no actual coins these are basically encryption techniques that are used to ensure transactions are recorded on the blockchain and those records cannot be tampered with she said fang described what she considers the biggest innovations in cryptocurrencies they rely on this distributed ledger technology which is often referred to as blockchain technology to record transactions these transactions are recorded because blockchain is just a network of computers and that network allows multiple parties to share data she said advertisement fang said new data can be uploaded only if the participating computers on the chain agree to acknowledge a new transaction allowing cryptocurrency to be traded and moved from one digital wallet to another these updates or transactions are not determined by a human or a central authority but by a software driven consensus she said in the case of bitcoin the biggest cryptocurrency it relies on proof of work consensus really it s just a bunch of computers racing with their computing power and trying to solve a mathematical problem you can almost think of it as a complicated puzzle where you re looking for one missing piece and there s no algorithm you can use all these computers are basically using brutal force they try every single possible piece possible to see if it fits she said when they find a fit they announce it to the network and other computers would agree fang said the first party that gets it right receives a reward in the form of the currency that corresponds to the blockchain this story was updated at 10 16 a m may 31 to correct the name of the carlson school of management and terawulf s first cryptomining

a graduate of harvard and the harvard medical school dr david d rutstein has been professor of preventive medicine and head of the department at the harvard medical school since 1947 he is a member of the staff of the massachusetts general hospital and live other boston hospitals david d rutstein m d almost every american family sooner or later must pay for medical care for an ailing parent or grandparent this is so because people 65 years of age and over are sick more often have more chronic illness such as cancer or heart disease and are less able to pay for medical care than are younger adults indeed the staggering cost of hospitalization and medical treatment is the commonest cause of pauperization of the elderly congress has recognized the seriousness of the problem and to meet it two different kinds of bills have been considered one type extends the old age and survivors insurance coverage of the social security act so that medical benefits can be paid automatically to the aged sick from insurance premiums collected during the working life of the insured obviously special provision would have to be made to meet the temporary problem of medical care assistance to those not under social security and those already retired who did not accumulate medical care benefits during their working lives because the law did not then include these benefits such a law would also prevent illness from bankrupting our older citizens the other type of bill extends the welfare provisions of the social security act so that medical benefits can be paid from federal and state appropriations to the aged sick if they can prove that they are unable to pay the law which was passed by congress last september social security amendments of 1960 title vi falls into this second category it provides for payment of certain medical bills on evidence of need through individual state plans financed from federal and state appropriations calculated according to a matching formula the need is determined by a means test a social worker or more likely a clerk trained as a social investigator questions the applicant checks on his assets and makes recommendations to be approved by the responsible local welfare officer exact benefits to any individual will depend on his state of residence there will be many different plans since each of the fifty states must submit its own plan based on appropriate enabling legislation so far only four states and puerto rico have submitted plans for federal approval where state legislation has already been passed the aged in order to be eligible for financial aid must have exhausted most of their assets and must have a financial status barely above the welfare level there are however enough loopholes to permit the aged sick if they have the necessary political influence to protect their assets and still obtain financial aid for payment of their medical bills as a result our self supporting old people may now find themselves at the mercy of the local political boss when they become sick although the exact details of operation of the present law vary from state to state certain generalizations can be made the first and immediate result of the law is to assist the states in paying for those aged already on relief rolls the state may either substitute federal funds for existing state expenditures or expand its medical care program for the aged sick on the welfare rolls or it may do both in neither case does this bring aid to patients who are not already on or eligible for relief insofar as the self supporting aged are concerned the intent of the present law is to furnish medical assistance on behalf of aged individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the cost of necessary medical services but it is impossible to estimate the cost of the necessary medical services in advance in order to conserve assets because the physician cannot predict the patient s future elderly patients whose heart attacks cancer and strokes bring them to the hospital during acute flare ups can recover in a short time suffer temporary or permanent disabilities of varying degrees of severity develop one of many possible complications or die any time in the course of the disease in contrast for welfare patients who have no assets to conserve the lack of predictability is unimportant since medical costs can be estimated from time to time on a short term basis and funds can be provided as needed except for the restriction no lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of his medical assistance for the aged the responsibility for determining financial eligibility is placed on the states each state may establish the definition of assets to be taken into consideration in the means test the financial limit above which no assistance will be granted the state also decides whether other kinds of assets will be excluded from consideration for example in massachusetts before financial assistance can be given all assets other than real property and life insurance have to be expended down to a sum of 2000 to 3000 depending on the sex of the patient and whether or not the spouse is alive all children of the patient are liable for repayment in full of the financial assistance granted i t is assumed that in enforcing this latter provision all children will have to submit to a means test this new federal law will degrade the selfsupporting aged because it does not prevent financial bankruptcy instead after remaining assets are expended almost down to the present welfare level the applicant must submit himself to the usual series of welfare investigations and procedures it will come as a shock to those who consider themselves to be self reliant americans to find that through no fault of their own as a result of illness they will be treated by society as if they were on relief let us see how the law would work in a typical case two weeks ago mrs caroline jones 68 years old suddenly had a stroke she was taken to the hospital unconscious but has improved so that she is now almost completely alert her entire left side is paralyzed although she is regaining control and strength in her lingers the doctor thinks that if she has no immediate complications she may leave the hospital in about one or two weeks provided a bed becomes available in a good nursing home or someone can be found to care for her at home the doctor has warned the family that the outcome is uncertain she may make a complete recovery but there are many possible complications and even without them she may have any degree of permanent disability including complete invalidism mrs jones has been living in her own home and caring for her 72 year old husband he has been short of breath since a coronary attack five years ago until his retirement at 65 he was a skilled machinist and made good money he had always been a proud man never wished to be dependent on others and had accumulated considerable savings and a few thousand dollars worth of government bonds owned his own home outright and had a life insurance program following his retirement he supported himself with odd jobs but he has been unable to work since his heart attack the cost of his long illness and his lack of income except for social security payments of 125 per month have left him with total assets of about 5000 plus the equity in his 12 000 home on which he recently had to take a mortgage of 7500 his hospital and medical care insurance which was a fringe benefit of his employment in a large electrical company was canceled on his retirement the joneses have two children the daughter is married to a schoolteacher george allen they live nearby in a small house with five children three in high school and two in a local college the joneses son moved to the west coast where he works in an airplane factory he sends his father a small check every month to help out two of his three children have recently married and are beginning families of their own the third a daughter had severe paralytic polio as a child and needs constant attention he has been very frugal because he wants to make sure that his daughter will always have the necessary medical care mrs jones s son in law george allen begins to worry he has estimated that the hospital and medical bills to date are from 500 to 700 after mrs jones leaves the hospital her medical care will cost from 75 to 125 per week for an indefinite period the expense of this new illness added to mr jones s care could quickly bankrupt the family mr allen has heard of the new law to provide funds for medical care for people over the age of 65 but when he calls up the local welfare department he finds that no money can be provided before a means test is performed this will involve an analysis of the financial status of the patient and her family and will take time the guess is that this case can be reached in three to four weeks meantime mr allen is sent an instruction sheet outlining the conditions under which financial aid can be granted among other things he finds that about half of the joneses remaining assets will have to be expended before aid can be requested and that all payments made for medical care may be recovered from his wife and her brother at a later date george allen becomes frightened and wonders whether he can conserve some of the family s assets he calls his lawyer who arranges an appointment for him with the councilman from his district the councilman is very friendly but makes no specific recommendations he explains the law with particular emphasis on excluded categories of assets the councilman then suggests when you are ready to make an application send it along to me and i will see that you get a decision without delay mrs jones s case is typical the financial problems would have been the same if she had had a heart attack cancer or any other common serious disease of the aged the delays and uncertainties in obtaining benefits under the present law may also interfere with medical care and may defeat attempts at preventive medicine when disease needs early treatment and comes on gradually another serious effect results in order to avoid impending bankruptcy patients may postpone calling the doctor in the hope that the disease will cure itself however this complicated law may affect the individual several facts are clear a large staff of interviewers will be necessary the cost of administration will be high and local political patronage will be widespread because of the many undefinable medical and economic variables the regulations implementing the law cannot be specific the responsible officials in state and local government will therefore have much latitude for determining eligibility in individual cases the situation is thus tailor made for political favors when old people want to hang on to what little they have left and when the cost of a particular case cannot be predicted and administration becomes complex and prolonged the local political boss will be in a key position if while medical bills are piling up for one of his constituents he can short circuit the slow moving cumbersome machinery of multiple means tests by having the forms filled out and by arranging for a quick foolproof decision further leeway is permitted by the federal prohibition of liens on property and by state exclusion of other types of assets foresighted old people may have their lawyers arrange their estates not only to avoid taxes but also to maintain their eligibility for medical care funds assets may be transferred from such categories as stocks government bonds and saving accounts to pay off the mortgage on the home or to add to other excluded categories of assets once illness has begun legal advice will no longer be helpful since no lawyer can ethically advise transfer of assets in order to defraud the government so if assets are to be transferred at the first sign of illness local political influence may be helpful in protecting the patients against a toosearching means test also children with assets likely to be attached will use whatever political influence they can muster to protect their own personal interests a most serious defect of the new law is the creation of an ethical climate similar to that of the prohibition era self respecting aged citizens facing bankruptcy due to illness will be open to any influence which might protect them from destitution otherwise upstanding citizens will not hesitate to defraud the government or to give their votes in return for political influence to help pay for their medical bills this practice would not be new in our society in the early part of this century it was not unusual for the needy to give their votes in exchange for the necessities of life these practices fostered the power of the local political boss particularly in urban areas the decline of the power of the political boss in the united states was hastened by the passage and implementation of the social security act favors in the form of handouts to be exchanged for votes could no longer compete with benefits which the citizen had earned and received as a matter of right under law this was edwin o connor s conclusion in his analysis of the decline of the political boss in the last hurrah this opinion was supported most dramatically by james michael curley former massachusetts political boss in a television broadcast at the time of the publication of his book i d do it again local political bosses and ward heelers would welcome a pork barrel comparable to the one they controlled before the passage of the social security act in 1935 the present law is exactly what they have been looking for large sums of money are involved congress has estimated that the additional cost of the present program in all of the states for those people not already on relief will amount to 325 million in state and federal funds each year but it is already clear that the cost will be many times this sum and that no exact estimate can be made now in exchange for votes local political bosses may be able to help their constituents become eligible for medical care payments in addition they will control patronage through the many jobs required for the administration of the new law this is particularly so where state law provides for appointment by local government and where merit systems are loosely enforced this new law will inevitably lead to indirect political control over the patient s ability to pay his physicians fees it is therefore surprising that the american medical association has publicly announced its support of the present law in spite of its frequently expressed fear of political control of medical practice self interest alone ought to make the association overcome its blind opposition and favor putting medical care benefits for the elderly into the insurance provisions of the social security act under which patients would have their claims paid as if from an insurance company it is incredible that the american medical association fails to see that a law based on the insurance principle would be free from the political domination over individual physicians which is a major feature of the present law dissatisfaction with the present federal law has caused some states to postpone the enactment of enabling legislation others consider it an interim solution in part because they wish to take immediate advantage of available additional federal funds for the aged sick already on relief for example governor nelson rockefeller of new york in his annual message to the legislature at the opening of the 1961 session said to take advantage of federal funds made available by 1960 legislation i propose adoption of a new 40 million program of additional medical assistance for the needy aged in new york state it is my conviction as i have previously stated that far more comprehensive federal legislation is required to help our senior citizens meet their medical needs i believe that the only fiscally sound approach to the financing of such a federal program is through the proven contributory system of social security the new federal law was a major political issue during the presidential campaign vice president richard nixon indicated his satisfaction with the law as passed by the special session of the congress this was somewhat surprising because the eisenhower administration has favored the concept that the individual insofar as possible be responsible for his own support the present law actually encourages certain patients to become destitute or to refuse jobs if remaining assets or additional income would make them ineligible for major benefits on the other hand senator john f kennedy was dissatisfied with the law and promised that if elected he would press for the enactment of a law based on the insurance principle of the social security act indeed such a law has been given early priority in his legislative proposals to the 87th congress congress has clearly recognized that voluntary health insurance cannot meet the need and financial assistance by the government for payment of medical bills for some of the aged is now a reality but the present law also does not meet the need and furthermore fosters direct local political control over the aged sick passage of a law under the social security act would protect the aged against bankruptcy due to illness it would also in one fell swoop do away with political control debasing means tests and complex expensive administration and would be self supporting let us hope that congress acts promptly
i we of australia and new zealand your english speaking opposite numbers on the west shores of the pacific ocean and particularly those of us who have had the privilege of knowing and therefore esteeming you of the united states have been watching with anxious sympathy your developments since 1932 to few if any in australia has the united states meant more than to me personally nothing but kindness has been shown to me during all my visits and particularly during the long and anxious war years of 1915 and 1916 my wife and i and our children will always remember that with gratitude and so i am emboldened with all humility to write of my impressions during a strenuous two months visit in north america from los angeles through the south to savannah georgia stopping at numerous centres to washington thence into virginia and thence to new york to boston montreal ottawa and detroit to hamilton and middletown ohio to chicago to beloit wisconsin to st paul and minneapolis and to vancouver at all these centres i had the opportunity and privilege of full discussion with many shades of opinions and knowledge i hope that the comments in this article will perhaps make some slight contribution towards the restoration of stability and return of confidence which all will admit are needed in the united states to day the problems of all democracies are the same the difficulties vary according to the number of people and the complexity of each civilization and are influenced greatly by many other circumstances and conditions the homogeneity of the australian people the comparative poverty of the nation the fact that australia is a great export country and depends upon its exports to maintain its financial integrity are pertinent factors in the australian picture again australia started to experiment with measures of social adjustment thirty years ago the prime cause of this early action being the inherent feeling against the growing abuses of the industrial era this feeling was strong in australia because many of its people were sons and daughters either of rebels against early nineteenth century social conditions in great britain or of adventurous spirits who flocked to the country in their thousands in the 1850 s and 1860 s attracted by the lure of easily won gold i was in great britain and germany in 1895 and 1896 and again in 1911 and 1912 i was impressed and somewhat saddened by the growing indications of social revolt against industrial conditions social adjustment of a major type or social revolution would probably have occurred in great britain before 1920 if the great war had not intervened visiting the united states and canada at intervals from 1896 onwards and living for nearly two years in north america during 1915 and 1916 i viewed with growing concern the impact of the overintensive industrialization of this country the dangerously rapid increase of wealth and the absence of any national realization of the necessity for forethought and preparation against accumulating dangers of an out ofbalance social system safe only when on the upgrade of prosperity and then after more than twenty years of work as an indust rial leader for nearly ten years i served under various prime ministers of australia in the study of national problems slowly but to an ever increasing extent i came to wonder whither we were all drifting i was brought almost daily into contact with conditions illustrative of the creaking and groaning financial and industrial system with others i began to realize that we were approaching the end of an era and that stronger and stronger methods of adjustment in our democratic system were urgently necessary otherwise so it seemed to us the desperation of the majority the almost inarticulate resentment against uncontrolled forces would create conditions leading to the dictatorship of a wellorganized forceful minority this minority would plan ahead white ant and then capture the military organization of the country and maintain its power through its control of armaments and where necessary its use of the machine gun such control would probably be welcomed by the desperate many as the only alternative to social chaos and so it has happened in many countries ii the economic blizzard struck australia in 1930 with a force and suddenness unexampled australia had been spending annually for years approximately 40 000 000 of loan money obtained from overseas the development of works financed by these loans came to an end because almost without notice australia found that it could not borrow a penny overseas nearly 30 per cent of our people previously gainfully employed were suddenly thrown out of work confidence was destroyed all expenditure except that absolutely necessary ceased no new houses were being built and the overseas prices of our export products fell alarmingly it was even thought that it might be necessary to declare a state of national emergency but slowly the nation began to face its facts the great majority determined to assist in every way to avoid repudiation of payments for interest and services overseas even to the extent of heavy sacrifices internally over 30 000 000 annually was required to meet these charges overseas the commonwealth and state governments cooperated to a marked degree and were assisted by many of us irrespective of class or section in business and industry an almost unanimous individual approval was obtained for the government s proposal of a 22½ per cent reduction of interest on all australian bonds held in australia amounting to approximately 500 000 000 legislation enforced a similar reduction on preference shares and debentures and other fixed interest stocks following upon this contribution by the rentier the federal arbitration court decreed a 10 per cent reduction in the basic wage of all wage earners within the court s jurisdiction and this was in general applied throughout the commonwealth this action taken by the court after a long patient hearing was decided upon with sincere regret because of the realization that the reduction in purchasing power of the great mass of the people was inadvisable under normal circumstances it was felt however that every step to restore confidence and thereby to restore employment was essential again a minimum cost of production of our main exports was important as a contribution towards meeting our overseas obligations the decision of the court was loyally accepted by the people of australia as a regrettable necessity and no serious industrial disturbance took place the commonwealth bank acting to a certain extent as a federal reserve bank and with the support of the governments in general depreciated the currency by 25 per cent in relation to sterling the depreciation of the currency raised the price of all primary produce including gold other metals wool wheat and fruit so that the producers received for such articles the value of which was determined by overseas prices 25 per cent more in australian currency the states applied special unemployment taxation and the commonwealth assisted the states in many ways to carry on and to help industry for instance it granted a sum of 500 000 distributed by a special committee to the various states to revive the gold mining industry which had fallen from its high estate during years of prosperity when costs were high and the price of gold was low in 1929 the output of gold had fallen to 432 000 ounces the output in 1937 was nearly 1 400 000 ounces relief works were organized moratoria were declared to protect the honest distressed debtor and primary producers such as wheat growers were assisted for some years by the federal treasury through the state governments to the extent of millions of pounds for instance the direct assistance given by the federal government to keep the wheat farmer on the land was over 14 000 000 together with the assistance direct and indirect given by the state governments and by private creditors the total was well over 20 000 000 of these facts i am well aware because i was chairman of the royal commission on the wheat flour and bread industries which established during 1934 and 1935 the economic facts applying to these industries australia had many trials and tribulations during this stressful period of years there was not complete unanimity between all the governments but the adjustments were finally achieved when mr s m bruce was prime minister prior to 1930 he had arranged with the states to consolidate all government loans and establish a central government authority the loan council to control all government borrowing and to guarantee jointly the financial integrity of all states this agreement supported by the strong action of the central commonwealth bank enforced finally the financial adjustments desired by the majority of the governments the commonwealth bank assisted materially to tide over the financial troubles by issuing treasury bills in order to finance the deficits of various state governments slowly since then the finances of the governments have improved until to day collectively the deficits have been eliminated another great problem has arisen however owing to the enormous increase in the estimates and expenditure for defense approximately 40 000 000 spread over three or four years rut that is another story not directly connected with the theme or purpose of this article when i left australia early in february last economic conditions were fairly good unemployment was less serious confidence was good and the national feeling was steadier and more consolidated than i had known it for years true the nervousness about the future of international affairs in the pacific ocean area was a distinct factor in steadying the nation taxation is heavy but is more or less cheerfully borne the reduction in the basic wage of the wage earners had been restored and a prosperity bonus of 6s 6d per week say 1 50 had been added subject to review from time to time but we are still concerned about two great problems 1 the threat to world peace due to the population pressure of three great virile dictatorship nations 2 the comparative absence of study leading to solution of the world wide problem of the adjustment between production and consumption none of us can or should forget that the two things that worry the average citizen of democratic quasi individualistic countries are the fear of sickness and the fear of unemployment we must at long last swing more and more of our research work from material to social investigations all great industries today have scientific research organizations governmental and private but shame on us we have no research institutions for the social sciences the science of mankind the need is urgent vital imperative and woe betide us if we delay we the leaders of industry and commerce and finance have never yet realized our duty to society we have thought too much and too long of financial results of scientific material improvement we have forgotten that democracy predicates and demands individual contribution toward social adjustment and security and that the greater our job and our position the greater our responsibility for social duty and performance however much we may try to comfort ourselves by the repetition of the idea that the dictatorship form of government is inherently unsound and unstable there is little evidence to support this pseudo comforting thought when consideration is given to the ever growing complexity of national life by common consent dictatorships are solving temporarily at least problems which democracies have failed to solve i might almost say have not attempted to solve namely the increasing disparity between our abilities to produce and to spread the benefits of increased production governments are necessary to industry and commerce industry and commerce are necessary to governments but the greater opportunities for service lie with industry and commerce i fear that the reverse has been applying of late years and whose fault is it is it not a fact that franklin d roosevelt neville chamberlain anthony eden léon blum john l lewis harry bridges premier aberhart of alberta hitler mussolini stalin and indeed all of us are products of certain sets of conditions are not conditions controllable if sufficient prevision and consequent action are applied iii and now i come to the impressions gathered during two intensive months in north america i was alarmed by the first impact with the mental atmosphere in your great country on the steamer from australia and after i landed discussions proceeded normally until the president and the federal administration were mentioned and then the deluge normality disappeared and storms rose and i could get no further however a little experience led to methods of approach which avoided this trouble and then i found almost invariably a serious disquiet and much searching of heart and mind there was a sincere desire to discuss the problem and no effort to avoid plain facts and possible unpleasant eventualities also always a request for an unvarnished and complete expression of my own views and impressions and so i gained encouragement and hope briefly one thing and one thing only alarms me in the united states to day and that is the ever widening chasm between the two great buttresses of any democracy the central government on the one hand and the leaders of the great organizations of industry commerce and finance on the other and the social responsibility to the great mass of the nation is in danger of being more and more overlooked as the song of hate rises in intensity as the chasm widens and deepens and as the social structure shakes and trembles on the edge i think that at this time of writing that is not an exaggerated picture at least i write as i feel and i believe that my two years of active life in this country enable me to sense the atmosphere reasonably quickly and accurately at any rate the survey i submit has the agreement and support of almost everyone i have met realizing that the failure of your great nation to adjust on a democratic basis will mean the disappearance of democracies in our british commonwealth of nations i have called up the courage to write as i find with a prayer that my small contribution will help things change quickly and even before this article is published i believe the promise of improvement will have appeared i have been more optimistic than many of the men and women with whom i have conferred during the past two months and this is so because i have found throughout the nation many people who are beginning to realize that they each individually must take a hand that democracy is based upon the individual and that the inevitableness of gradualness must be adopted as the watchword of democratic adjustment i quote from the new york times of sunday april 3 a portion of an article by winthrop case the business cycle now at a decisive stage the problem seems to come back once more to the question of confidence revival in the all important durable goods industries and the reduction in their unemployment rest on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time for the individual this implies confidence in the job and this in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry s leaders fortunately congress is showing a more conciliatory attitude toward business whether business has or has not coöperated as much as it ought whether or not the administration has shown itself vindictive or punitive are beside the point the fact remains that our economic system for better or worse must in the end be carried on by its individual leaders the government may help or it may hinder but it cannot drive the elastic limit of the nation has been sorely tested your nation has been trying to achieve in five years what we in australia under easier conditions and with a more homogeneous people have partially achieved in thirty years the great mass of the people of any democratic country are content to wait provided they know that a policy of adjustment and amelioration is in progress with the approval of the majority of the leaders of all sections of the community the great internal problem facing all of us is to find out how all sections of a democracy can live together in reasonable comfort ever disputing ever striving for improvement but with inherent mutual consideration and respect if we fail dictatorship comes and then individualism lies only with the dictator and with regimentation of the whole nation to me the great tragedy of the present position is that the greatest and richest democracy in the world which should be leading us in our struggle to avoid the danger of dictatorship is to day so torn with internal strife as to be impotent internationally in this respect we in australia are a small nation internationally of little moment some of us are striving to assist by for instance directing the policy of our companies producing commodity goods towards minimum fair returns on a reasonable capitalization with the purpose of maintaining internal price stability on the lowest possible level in other words we believe that industry can help by aiming at security and stability rather than at excessive fluctuating profits this policy will help the maintenance of confidence and combination of the highest volume and velocity of currency circulation and therefore maximum employment further we are helping in the study of national economics and are urging the importance of an economic general staff for the commonwealth a recognized and approved economic fact finding body staffed by the best brains in whom the people have confidence the remaining democracies of the world must get closer together and help each other more to learn know and understand the steps which must be taken to adjust continuously toward a better and fuller life for everyone including the forgotten man we have to realize and understand the increasing tempo of change we must actively remember that peoples of our race do not want dictatorial unified clique control rather do they subconsciously pray for security on some reasonable or even primarily a comparatively lower basis so long as they have hope and a chance for their children they do not want to destroy private enterprise and will respond so long as they understand and are coöperatively informed of affairs and the development of a policy of progressive adjustment ignorance and suspicion are the main causes of industrial trouble we none of us have yet brought ourselves to a full acceptance of the necessity for mental honesty in our comments and proposals on industrial and national affairs we cannot too often tell ourselves that the real wealth of a nation the only enduring worth while wealth is in the spiritual mental and physical health of the citizens and that in a democracy we are all trustees while recognizing the difficulties of rival unions i must say that the right of men with only their labor to sell to organize is fundamental and our experience is that when this is accepted slowly but surely the unions develop leaders who are students of economics and moderate men who know that a quart cannot come out of a pint pot a spirit of compromise and coöperation will lead to an adjusted democracy if we will all help this article sounds like a sermon but it is at least based upon a long life of experience and observation and an appreciation of an exceedingly critical and temporarily dangerous state of affairs

seven tricks to dodge the storm threatening your portfolio experts fear the inflation crisis will bring more volatility and even recession volatile share prices are likely to remain a feature of stock markets in the coming months as inflation stays high households are financially challenged the war in ukraine drags on and fears of a global recession mount for some investors sharp share price falls can be undermining and lead to irrational behaviour such as selling long term investments into a falling market other investors who have built their own investment portfolios from scratch through the use of tax friendly isas and pensions can suddenly feel isolated they start to question whether their investments remain fit for purpose and wonder if the spread of their funds and shares is still appropriate for the difficult times that lie ahead yet help is at hand there are a number of investment tools and rules of thumb that investors can use to steer them through choppy stock markets by employing these tools and rules now investors can help to keep their long term investment wealth intact 1 why it can help to be a copycat most investment platforms offer model portfolios for customers who need a bit of inspiration or who are not confident designing a portfolio from scratch they tend to be a list of around five to eight funds which when bought together make up a well balanced portfolio with the chance of good returns platforms tend to offer an option for cautious investors a second for investors happy to take on a bit more risk and a third for adventurous investors there are also model portfolios for income investors these portfolios are freely available for anyone to see not only platform customers just search for them on the investment platform websites these model portfolios can be a great tool for checking if your own is on track you do not have to follow a model portfolio to the letter instead you can use it as a useful yardstick pick the portfolio that most aligns with your investment objectives and then see how it compares with your own for example if you are a cautious investor but have a higher proportion of shares than model portfolios for cautious investors you may want to dial down your holdings of equities and buy more bonds or if you are an income investor and your dividends are not as generous as those offered by model income portfolios you may wish to examine where you are going wrong most investment portfolios will have seen their values drop in recent weeks but if you compare your investment returns to those of a similar model portfolio you should get a rough idea of whether yours is performing as well as you could hope or needs tweaking 2 try a comparison with an index an investment portfolio can easily get misshapen you may start with a well diversified portfolio but as some investments perform better than others it can become skewed to check if you re on track you can compare your portfolio to an index that you re trying to beat for example the msci world index is made up of the biggest companies in the developed world companies listed in the united states currently make up 67 per cent of the index japanese businesses six per cent and uk companies 4 5 per cent you can benchmark against these weightings so for example if you have a higher proportion of us companies or us funds in your portfolio it might be that you have more confidence than others in the us market outperforming in the future but if your intention is not to bet big on the us market you may want to sell some of your us funds or hold off buying more for a while 3 use clever online pension calculators will your investments provide you with enough money to take you through retirement or will you fall short it s a hard question to answer but for pension investments there are useful tools available such as online pension calculators these ask you questions about how much you have saved and what you are invested in they then calculate what level of retirement income that could produce or how long your money is likely to last for to come up with such numbers they have to make assumptions so the answers will be a bit rough and ready but they will give you a sense of the direction you re heading in you can find a number of pension calculators online from the government funded money pensions service visit website moneyhelper org uk 4 is your platform giving you a nudge if you are a diy investor it is up to you to make decisions about what you buy and sell even if you ve gone astray and are taking on a huge amount of investment risk your investment platform can t warn you they are not set up to give financial advice yet some investment platforms are finding a way to tread the fine line between giving customers a nudge if they need it without it counting as advice for example wealth platform hargreaves lansdown has nudged over half a million customers in recent months to tell them their portfolios lack diversification of these over a third have made changes to their portfolios as a result so if you receive an email from your platform warning you that your portfolio needs a little tlc take heed increasingly platforms also have tools that allow you to x ray your portfolio in other words view how you re invested by geography or sector all of these are useful for checking if you are on track 5 check how many funds you have there is no one perfect number of funds that you should hold at any one time in an investment platform the key is to have enough so that you don t have all your eggs in one basket but not so many that you lose sight of what you have rob morgan chief analyst at investment company charles stanley shares his rule of thumb he says keep the number of holdings sensible enough to diversify not so much so you lose track ten to 20 funds should be enough for most people remember though it s about quality not quantity some funds are designed to offer you everything you need the likes of global tracker funds or mixed asset funds if you hold one of these you may not feel that you need to branch out further 6 split portfolio into core and satellite one common investment pitfall is putting too much money into specialist investment funds which tend to be volatile by specialist i mean the likes of biotechnology technology space exploration or single country funds there is nothing wrong with holding such funds but you should ensure broader based investments which tend to be less risky have a greater prominence in your portfolio charles stanley s morgan recommends categorising your investments into core and satellite funds to make sure they are sized correctly in your portfolio he says think about the makeup of your portfolio the central core should be mainstream investments the bedrock around this should be satellites funds that are more specialist in nature and personalise your portfolio he adds it is important not to let a single investment theme or sector dominate your portfolio which is why higher risk specialist investments should be satellites rather than core holdings for a majority of investors 7 take a breath before acting currently it is easy to look at your portfolio that is rapidly falling in value and assume it is not on track but this is not necessarily the case most assets are currently falling in value equities bonds cryptocurrency with global stock markets down around 16 per cent this year to date so before you make changes to your portfolio pause and take a breath you may not be faring any worse than most other investors gemma boothroyd analyst at investment platform freetrade says market volatility is the perfect breeding ground for nail biting and portfolio self doubt but remember volatility is a function of stock markets and other financial markets if your portfolio has been hit by asset falls this year don t take it as a sign that it s not on track market volatility is how investors find opportunity and it s the price you pay for the hopeful long term outperformance of shares over cash she adds being level headed when you check on your portfolio will make a world of difference to the long term outcome it may sound fluffy but if you re checking on your investments in a state of worry you re going to spring into action and it won t necessarily be the right thing to do

can shares in britain s big beasts of industry power up your returns there may be bargains for investors among the gems of our industrial heritage although the uk stock market has proved remarkably resilient this year up a fraction compared to a near 18 per cent fall in us equities some parts of the market have performed poorly one of the worst is the industrials sector which is down nearly 16 per cent so far this year but amid the gloom investment experts suggest there are bargains to be had if you know where to look the industrials part of the market comprises some 90 firms by market capitalisation they represent 11 per cent of the ftse all share index industrial stocks include freight companies defence and aerospace businesses and there are some heritage names among them such as bae systems and rolls royce the sector tends to struggle when the economy is contracting this is because companies hold off investing in new equipment order numbers shrink and the number of new construction projects dips rising inflation can also hurt industrials as increasing costs cannot easily be passed on to cash strapped customers however amid this rather difficult backdrop there are opportunities for brave investors last year the government committed to investing in infrastructure clean energy and transforming businesses using artificial intelligence defence spending is also growing in response to russia s invasion of ukraine global targets to lower carbon emissions will also require investment that will benefit companies within the industrials sector chris beauchamp is chief market analyst at online trading group ig he says yes the economic outlook is deteriorating but barring a full recession we should still see earnings from many of these industrial companies tick higher companies are grappling with inflation and it will put financial pressure on the sector generally but so far a steady flow of orders seems to be offsetting these headwinds charles luke is manager of investment trust murray income he says that the companies likely to remain most resilient share common characteristics niche businesses that are market leaders have robust balance sheets and a variety of revenue streams strong intellectual property and experienced management teams are also good points he adds rob burgeman is a senior investment expert at wealth manager brewin dolphin he warns that even the most robust industrial companies face a particularly strong headwind in the form of rising energy prices that he says makes it difficult to predict the future with any real confidence he adds sometimes visibility is good you can look across sunny vistas for 18 months or two years and have a clear picture of how economies will fare at other times the outlook becomes cloudier and foggier as uncertainties mount right now i would suggest that we can barely see beyond the ends of our noses but even pessimists have some industrials businesses that they rate murray income s luke likes engineering giant weir and believes its share price is currently attractive he says weir enables shareholders to invest in green themes such as energy efficiency and the energy transition weir s shares are down 8 per cent this year at 15 74 guy anderson manager of investment trust mercantile rates technical products supplier diploma it distributes seals and filters for wind turbines as well as instruments for diagnostic laboratories the shares are down 24 per cent this year at 25 74 the business has demonstrated its value in helping customers maintain resilient supply chains and has therefore been trading strongly he says burgeman likes ashtead an equipment company with a big slice of its business in the united states the company has a great runway for growth over the years ahead as it operates in a very fragmented market he says bae systems is likely to be a beneficiary of heightened geopolitical tensions and a surge in defence spending following the continued war in ukraine its shares are already up this year by 40 per cent at 7 67 funds and trusts to back industrial shares buying individual shares can be a high risk way of investing in the sector for many

longer term track record he says it has turned 1 000 into 1 137 over three years although its share price is down 21 per cent in the past year aberdeen uk smaller companies growth run by harry nimmo is another burgeman pick it holds a number of companies in the industrials sector burgeman believes the fund is slightly misnamed as it is more focused on medium sized rather than smaller companies holdings including power supplier xp and music hardware and software company focusrite it has turned a 1 000 investment into 1 039 over three years but has fallen 23 per cent over the past year with the future cloudy for many uk listed companies industrial stocks should only form part of a well diversified uk portfolio those who invest should be prepared to hold on until better economic

henderson international income eleven years of rising dividends from backing firms that stand up to economic headwinds dividends to shareholders from companies worldwide continue to recover from the hit they took in the pandemic the latest data from investment manager janus henderson indicates global dividends in the first quarter of this year were 11 per cent higher than in the same quarter of 2021 although the robustness of dividends could be challenged in the months ahead as inflation refuses to go away and global economic growth slows the data confirms that dividends are not just a feature of the uk stock market they are paid by many international companies including those operating out of asia and some of the world s emerging economies many investment houses have recognised this phenomenon in recent years with the launch of global equity income funds for example there are 46 global equity income funds with performance track records going back at least five years the best performers in terms of overall investment returns not just income payments are jpm global equity income liontrust global dividend and guinness global equity income all three have generated total returns of 60 per cent plus over the past five years there are also a smaller number of stock market listed investment trusts that have a global income bent what makes some of these trusts especially attractive for income hunters is that they have a long track record of delivering annual dividend increases to shareholders for example scottish american managed by baillie gifford has 48 years of annual dividend growth under its belt while murray international and invesco select global equity income have 16 and 11 years respectively not far behind is henderson international income a 345million investment trust which is on course to notch up 11 years of dividend increases in its current financial year which ends on august 31 it has already paid a first quarter dividend of 1 8pence per share shareholders will receive a second payment of 1 8pence on tuesday both represent 20 per cent increases on the year before to put the payments into context the trust s shares are currently trading at around 1 75 ben lofthouse has run the trust since launch in 2011 although he admits the outlook is a tough one he is convinced he has built a portfolio comprising companies 67 of them that have the ability to stand up to economic headwinds if you look at the portfolio he says it has healthy positions in health care businesses consumer staples companies and financials sectors that continue to do well a result of many companies having sufficient pricing power to ensure their profit margins are not eroded by rising costs he points to strong revenue growth of 16 per cent reported by us drinks company coca cola in the first quarter of this year as evidence of this the company is one of the trust s top 10 holdings another key investment german car maker mercedes benz reported similarly strong financial results over the same period one of the big attractions of such income orientated investment trusts is their ability to build up reserves that they can then dip into when corporate dividends are in decline the henderson international income trust did this in the last two full financial years lofthouse says the trust still has sufficient income reserves in the tank to cover the equivalent of half last year s total dividends of 6 3pence over the past five years the trust has delivered total returns of 33 per cent its market code is b3phcs8 and its ticker is hint annual charges are a tickle over 0 8 per cent

thoroughbred industry administrators can t afford complacency despite record prizemoney and unprecedented buoyancy in bloodstock markets several prominent figures have claimed despite the challenges posed by the covid pandemic almost all of australia s major weanling yearling and broodmare sales have experienced record growth in the past 18 months at the magic millions national broodmare sale on the gold coast earlier this week 18 mares sold for 1 million or more with the average price above 228 000 almost identical numbers to the corresponding sale in 2021 but well up on pre pandemic levels the average price of yearlings at the magic millions gold coast yearling sale inglis easter yearling sale and inglis premier yearling sale in melbourne all reached record highs in 2022 there was more than 590 million spent across the book 1 catalogues of the five major yearling sales in australia and new zealand in 2022 an increase of almost 18 across the same sales in 2021 godolphin australia s managing director vin cox who was formerly the managing director of magic millions said it is hard to recall a time when the market was in such a position and he believes it s largely being driven by record prizemoney levels in most states it s bloodstock market probably as strong as i ve ever seen it cox said the depth of market is quite astounding and it obviously starts with the yearling market and the yearling market right across the board has been very strong when the yearlings are selling well the breeding stock follows behind it and the stallion fees come behind that we re in a good spot prizemoney is a huge factor in driving the prices and horses are an easy sell in that regard cox believes that the growth is sustainable in the short term although he doesn t think an inevitable plateau is any cause for immediate concern is it sustainable yes is it going to keep jumping up with the huge steps that it s been taking in the last 10 years i don t think there will be a day where it does plateau off but i don t think that will be a bad thing it ll just consolidate that market and give it a huge foundation that people can rely on and invest in coolmore s tom magnier who has bought and sold bloodstock at every major sale in 2022 said the australian industry is the envy of its international counterparts magnier said australia s greatest strength is its mainstream relevance which he believes continues to drive interest in participation via wagering and ownership what is going on in australia is not happening anywhere else in the world magnier said we ve seen what yulong are doing here this week but if it s not yulong it s somebody else the whole world is watching what is happening in australia the prizemoney is great and so many people want to be a part of it the passion that australia has for racing is a huge thing everybody wants to be involved and you can own a horse with 10 of your friends and you can be running in races worth millions you can actually run it as a business and you can t really do that anywhere else in the world watch industry figures discuss the strength of australia s bloodstock market like magnier aushorse and thoroughbred breeders australia ceo tom reilly said the level of participation in the sport is the envy of many other racing jurisdictions there are lots of reasons to be positive reilly said we had a really strong yearling sale season and it was quite unexpected that prices would be up the strength right across the market from the most expensive horses through to the middle of the market what we re seeing here at magic millions this week is that breeders who ve had success in the sales ring are reinvesting and putting back into their business by making significant outlay in terms of capital expenditure on mares and weanlings we re incredibly lucky in australia in a few different respects for one we ve got a good funding model which allows people to have some success on the track and pay their way or if they get a good horse to make a great return in prizemoney secondly in australia there are over 100 000 individual people who have a share in a racehorse so it s the most egalitarian ownership base and the biggest ownership base in the world it s more owners than they have in the whole of europe and north america combined that broad base supports so much in the industry but reilly said there remains several immediate threats to participation in racing that the industry must continue to address reilly pointed to last saturday s federal election which saw australia s greens party achieve its best result at an election as a timely reminder that racing will continue to be scrutinised by those outside the industry he said community education about equine welfare and other important aspects of racing is needed to ensure the industry maintains its social licence to operate reilly believes that if punters feel comfortable wagering on an ethical and responsible sport the industry can maintain its record prizemoney levels and participation via ownership and bloodstock investment can remain strong we ve really got to guard against complacency he said we ve got an industry that has been under real scrutiny especially for welfare issues we had the abc program a few years ago and on the back of that thoroughbred breeders australia along with some other groups commissioned a really good report which was led by denis napthine some of those recommendations have been adopted but we need more of them to be we just had a general election and we saw 12 greens senators elected and potentially three or four greens mps and this is a party that advocates for the abolishment of horse racing are we explaining the industry well enough not just in a welfare perspective but are we engaging the audiences well enough how are we promoting the sport nationally are we all working in silos or is there a willingness for people not just racing authorities but stakeholders within the industry to come together and work collaboratively to really be the leading thoroughbred jurisdiction in the world

when nigeria s president major general muhammadu buhari retd defeated the incumbent president goodluck jonathan in february 2015 investors were upbeat the peaceful handover of power from jonathan to buhari brought back investor confidence that was lost before the election due to apprehension in response nigerian stocks gained most in the world with the yield on a 500 million eurobond offered by the country falling to the lowest level since december 2014 due to a growing confidence a falling yield on a bond means that investor confidence in an economy is rising but the reverse is the case for a rising bond yield on april 1 2015 the stock market all share index rose by 8 4 per cent and the naira firmed at n217 in the parallel market gaining 0 46 per cent the nation s currency remained stable at n197 at the interbank market since february consequently renaissance capital remarked that a buhari win implies reformist policies noting that it would be positive for investors however soon after buhari was sworn in his boom turned to bust as all the market indices began to tumble by august 2015 the stock market had lost n2 5 trillion due to what the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci described as lack of policy clarity and economic direction investors became jittery six months after buhari came to power he moved from one government ministry to another assuring them of his vision and mission for the country ordinarily according to market analyst ike ibeabuchi there was nothing wrong with the move but while he dilly dallied the economy began to wane and he had to pay a heavy price for that for that critical ministerial appointments were ignored which turned out to be his achilles heel investors soon started demanding an economic direction council urged the buhari administration to make a clear pronouncement with respect to its fiscal policy foreign exchange policy tax policy subsidy policy trade policy reform of oil and gas sector upstream and downstream the power sector the 2015 budget the auto policy sectoral policies etc all these are necessary for investors to have a clear insight into the policy direction of the government and take strategic investment decisions the lcci said in its statement released in august 2015 three months after buhari s swearing in the delay began to have impact on the currency in response the lcci said council therefore calls for a more strategic framework for the management of the foreign exchange market council urged the president of the federal republic of nigeria to quickly set up an economic team that will interface with the cbn the organised private sector and the key economic ministries to come up with a sustainable model for the management of the foreign exchange market investors told our reporters by august 2015 that they were awaiting buhari s ministers recession came while nigeria burnt buhari fiddled the urgency needed by the economy was not matched by buhari s responses according to analysts at the time buhari was reluctant to appoint ministers the oil price was ebbing the average oil price at that time was 50 about 3 below the benchmark oil price in that year s budget according to analysts even when buhari ended up appointing some ministers investors were sceptical about their capacities to deliver due to global headwinds oil price fell to 28 per barrel by december 2015 forcing the government into a panic mode one of the hallmarks of the buhari administration was protectionism with his mind set on stopping unbridled imports buhari s government shut down borders and this proved costly for the economy especially in relation to food inflation in 2016 africa s most populous nation fell into recession its worst in 33 years the gross domestic product recorded a contraction of 3 62 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 with the cumulative gdp for the first nine months of 2020 standing at 2 48 per cent in 2020 the administration recorded another recession this time due to covid 19 which hit many countries indices continued to plunge the record of buhari s administration on several economic indices are not looking good unemployment rises by 437 as at the fourth quarter of 2014 nigeria s unemployment rate was 6 2 per cent according to data by the national bureau of statistics nbs as at the fourth quarter of 2021 the nbs disclosed that the joblessness rate in the economy had risen to 33 3 per cent making it one of the worst in the world and signifying a 437 per cent increase over the seven year period unemployment will continue to rise as school leavers join an economy that is weak at creating jobs said augusto co which had predicted that the unemployment rate would hit 35 per cent in 2021 naira weakens by 181 the exchange rate management system is perhaps the area that has attracted most criticism to buhari and the central bank of nigeria cbn as at may 2015 naira exchange for dollar at n197 at the interbank market and n217 at the parallel market on friday may 26 2022 naira to dollar exchange rate was n415 72 at the importers and exporters window and nearly n610 at the parallel market by implication dollar has weakened by 111 per cent in the official market and 181 per cent in the parallel market since buhari came to power analysts generally blame the cbn for its focus on demand management rather than on the supply side which deals with foreign exchange earnings the chief executive officer of centre for the promotion of the private enterprise dr muda yusuf said in one of his statements that the cbn has not allowed the market to determine the market rate it needs to give the market a chance its current approach would continue to deepen distortions in the economy perpetuate round tripping fuel speculation suppress forex supply and boost underground economy he noted that what was happening in the foreign exchange market was a result of the cbn policy choice of a fixed exchange rate regime and administrative allocation of forex which should not happen he further said that suppressing the market was like swimming against the tide adding that moving retail forex transactions from bdcs to the banks was like kicking the can down the road the same issues would manifest even with the banks managing a subsidy regime is typically a herculean task we have seen this happen with fertiliser subsidy and petrol subsidy the story cannot be different with foreign exchange subsidy rises by n3 9trn as at 2015 when buhari came to power petrol subsidy had been pruned to n100 billion in the 2022 budget buhari proposed n4 trillion to the national assembly in a subsidy regime that has been described as fraudulent and opaque oil theft has also worsened as the country loses n30 to n60 trillion annually according to a 2022 research supported by shell the president of man mansur ahmed told sunday punch that petrol subsidy was a yoke on the nigerian economy arguing that placing much importance on petrol over issues of health and infrastructure was misdirected we believe that subsidy is a yoke on our economy first of all the social sector is critical maybe people feel that fuel is so important but if you compare it with health education and security you will notice it is nowhere near them he said a professor of energy economics at nnamdi azikiwe university uche nwogwugwu condemned the n4tn petrol subsidy saying that it was a tax on consumption he said the amount was enough to subsidise the cost of local refining noting that channelling nigeria s scarce resources to subsidy when issues of funding education infrastructure and security were on the front burner was a waste of money nobody knows the basis of the n4trn subsidy we in energy economics say that any subsidy on petroleum is corruption a lot of development can be done with n4trn and we can develop alternative energy sources of energy and renewable energy with that amount to rely less on fossil fuel a development economist aliyu iliyas decried the poor state of the country urging the federal government to eliminate fuel subsidy he said well the fact remains that the country is in a serious mess as the revenue is very poor consequently the government has to borrow however the government s borrowing rate is very dangerous if you look at the oil market now the price of oil has been increasing for some time now but the country isn t benefiting from it because we are not producing at home unfortunately as the price of oil continues to rise so also will our subsidy bail out which causes a series of problem so the best decision is not to borrow to pay for subsidy but to remove it and focus on revamping refineries in the country in addition to the dangote refinery that we are waiting for however with the route the government has chosen it is clear that the economy will suffer and so will the nigerian people we should expect inflation to rise in the next few months and development in the country to suffer inflation soars by over 78 inflation is not spared as prices have risen by over 77 8 per cent since buhari came to power inflation has since 2015 risen from 9 01 per cent average number in 2015 to 16 02 average so far in 2022 when inflation rises cost of living increases and standard of living deteriorates according to analysts more people are pushed into the poverty class with a rising inflation rate interest rate fares better by june 2015 the monetary policy rate mpr which is the benchmark interest rate was 13 per cent this is the same today though the cbn had earlier maintained it at 11 5 per cent when the cbn raised this rate last tuesday several analysts said it would have implications on the economy the deputy president of the lcci gabriel idahosa described the development as an inevitability considering the recent upward inflationary trend it was actually expected because inflation has gone up to 16 per cent the cbn target is 13 per cent so we have lost the downward trending inflation rate that has been on for quite a number of months by last week the financial community expected the cbn to increase the interest rate starting with the one just announced it was predictable he said the lending rate increase would give rise to more hardship due to the higher cost of borrowing that would apply to all sectors of the economy similarly the director general of the nigerian american chamber of commerce sola obadimu condemned the decision by the cbn he further stated that indiscriminate increase of lending rate by the cbn would inevitably drive up the cost of doing business more misery for nigerians the misery index in 2015 was 47 7 points but it has risen to 50 48 points meaning that more nigerians are now more miserable than they were in 2015 similarly in 2018 nigeria was adjudged by the world poverty clock as world s poverty capital according to the world bank poverty rate was 33 1 per cent by end of 2014 beginning of 2015 but poverty rate will likely sit at 42 6 per cent in 2022 similarly economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 5 94 per cent and 2 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2015 the number was 3 11 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 generally however growth has not been strong in the last seven years due to two recessions experienced so far copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this

nearly forty years ago nora waln a young quaker passed through the battle lines of the warlords on her way to mongolia where at the behest of a swedish publisher she wrote her first book about frans august larson duke of mongolia subsequently in china where she wrote her famous narrative the house of exile and still later in hiller s germany where she gathered the source material for reaching for the stars she traveled unafraid this is the latest of her adventures carried out after khrushchev had built the wall asians have enriched my life they have intelligence and gaiety but people of a different race from mine are not easy for me to understand even when they are people i respect and enjoy in east prussia with friends from the mongolian plateau with whom i was traveling as their guest i stood leaning against the fence of a paddock on a horse breeding cooperative and i turned on my radio this transistor radio manufactured in japan is tiny it fits into a small handbag or the rear pocket of my riding pants my mongolian friends bought it as a gift for me in a store in east berlin i got the eight o clock morning news and i translated an item concerning them i told them that the british considered it a foregone conclusion that their country would get a scat in the united nations in new york they were lour men and a woman they listened gravely but they showed no elation and they made no comment until they noticed my puzzlement it is the price we have to pay for russian help to keep our virgin pasturelands said the young horseman whose mother is my special iriend in sunit russia protects us from the chinese the young woman with them was a graduate of urga university and she did postgraduate work at the university in east berlin when i asked her what she thought about mongolian admission to the united nations her reply was i would rather that we did not get a seat but a delegation will go because the russians want us there we know that you like chinese people said another man slowly but you must realize that chinese and mongols are natural foes the chinese have no respect for turf they look down on us for liking to be nomads living in good tents raising fine herds and we despise them for settling down in villages destroying pastures digging up the grass fencing in community wells century after century when strong the chinese have come in above their own creat wall and we do not want them insisted another our ways and their ways differ when the manchus ruled china we were united with the manchus but we have never been united with the chinese after they destroyed the manchu dynasty in 1911 the chinese thought they owned mongolia we were weak then chinese farmers got in and destroyed thousands of our acres we do not belong to the chinese government on formosa said the woman firmly and we do not belong to the chinese communists we are free because the russians help us copyright 1962 by the atlantic monthly company boston 16 mass all rights reserved you know that venereal diseases among us and rinderpest among our animals are our shame and our curse put in one of the men the swedes have helped us control cure and prevent these diseases the danes have helped us germans have helped us but the russians have sent us more doctors for people and for animals than have all others combined we will be in new york voting for the soviet union if elected to the united nations i said no more they drifted off exploring and examining the pasture where we were one took his long bladed knife out of its sheath he stooped and cut a piece of turf i heard their exclamations the grassland here in east germany was as thick as the best grass on the mongolian plateau were far northeast of the broken city of berlin in a part of germany often spoken of as the land where the wolf says good night politely to the fox the october day was warm and sunny it would be a leisurely day for me the mongols intended to purchase the stallion that they had been sent from their homeland to buy they carried with them the gold for the horse they would make no show of eagerness hours would pass before they would let the wonderful black be shown to them again the bargaining would be slow and shrewd yesterday they had bought a stallion three rams and a bull previously they had bought other animals at other stockbreeding farms where we stopped the total of these purchases ran into a good deal of money but the whole lot was of minor importance to them the black stallion they had traveled thousands of miles to get was in the stable to my left the five mongols who were here had been carefully selected for their job although she was a scholar who spoke fluent german the young woman was as sharp concerning horses cattle and sheep as the men and with them they had two able german brothers born of christian missionary parents reared on the plateau the delegation had been briefed for their task their commissioners in urga had knowledge of this worthy stallion and they gave this information to the delegation they had been shown pictures of the stallion and they had his pedigree before they departed from mongolia yet when the black horse had been paraded yesterday the delegation had shown no interest they had asked stupid questions and bought the other stallion mongols are that way the scene around me was beautiful away to the rim of the horizon stretched the green pasturelands and when i turned 1 could see the homestead fine trees with stout trunks and far spreading branches grew singly in clumps of two and three and in avenues planted where they could protect the manor house and the barns evergreen firs oaks beeches poplars strong trees to break the winter winds and hold off driving snow the big barn the little barns the extensive stables the hay sheds the manor house with its cluster of cottages had been built of good stone and excellent timber by competent builders the roofs had not sagged pillars had not sunk doors and gates did not swing on broken hinges rail fences on paddock and corral had not broken down for more than three hundred years until sixteen years ago this estate with its rolling acres was the property of aristocrats generation after generation famous for their horses now it is a cooperative farm run by a communist committee to horse breeding the communists have added sheep and cattle breeding and a school for animal husbandry it has been said of me that i make trips where others might not go some say that if the devil himself asked me into hell i would have a look at the place under his guidance yes that is true i think it sensible to know what is going on if one has the opportunity that is my attitude in regard to china and mongolia my approach to germany when nazi and today when half communist where 1 enter i go not to spy not to condemn unseen but to learn i am not naturally brave but i have learned that courage is not being unafraid it is going ahead matter of factly when scared in the communist part of germany i am at times almost overwhelmed by surging memories of nazi cruelties because these cruelties are repeated now the country through which i traveled with the mongolians was not new territory to me 1 had been in this eastern part of germany with my husband always coming by motorcar visiting in the great country houses on junker estates we had ridden fine horses enjoyed musical evenings at which my husband sang taken pleasure in warm and gracious hospitality in return we had entertained these germans in a villa we had at le touquet in france and at my husband s country house in buckinghamshire england i know that the heir to this estate on which the black stallion was bred is alive he has a wife and five children when i asked about him and his family i was told by the cooperative leaders that they were away my question as to where they had gone was answered evasively it was the same on every junker estate where i went with the mongols sie sind gegangen is what the german communists in the cooperatives said about the nobles they are gone the communists assigned the horsemen to stay where they were at the war s end they may not seek other jobs or move if they do and are caught they are treated as criminals in many of them i saw an unmistakable sadness as if the destruction of the way of life they have known has hurt them beyond healing their hours of labor are longer than they were when my husband and 1 visited in east germany in addition they must attend lessons in communism learn songs and slogans take part in processions and rallies often a communist leader in a cooperative introduced us to the head horseman praising the man saying that this man was one who never went to bed until every horse was curried and brushed fed and watered bedded with clean straw they said that the apprentices found such men examples difficult to copy as we traveled through the country i saw much waste in unharvested crops more grain potatoes sugar beets and other farm produce had been planted than were being harvested townspeople and schoolchildren were working at the harvest but the labor force looked small for the work to be done the excuse our guides gave was that east germany has suffered a sixteen year drain of population impatient people running off and that the necessity to call able bodied men to arms last summer left few to work in the fields the horse breeding cooperatives to which we were taken were different horses cattle and sheep were well cared for the pastures were in good condition in the stables all was neat and orderly wood brass and leather showed the mark of hard rubbing glass over the pictures of famous horses was without a flyspeck old silver cups on display were without a stain the apprentices on these farms nearly broke me so many were so young in europe and in our united states we had shameful child labor in an earlier time i presumed that era to be past it is newly begun again in east germany in factories and on the land i saw children boys and girls from five to twelve years of age toiling uncounted hours i saw them working in the fields under great electric lights which turn night into a continued day on these stockbreeding farms the child apprentices were up every morning before i was up and i am an early riser awake before the sunrise children live in dormitories without adequate blankets without pillows the winters are bitter in east germany i saw many who appeared to have tuberculosis in east germany there is a shortage of doctors the doctors who are there are short of needed supplies medicines salves even bandages on the slick stockbreeding cooperatives children toil at cleaning stables brushing and combing animals sweeping putting down hay cleaning bridles and saddles scouring rubbing polishing those over ten are honored by being permitted to tend horses the younger ones can tend sheep and milk cows they sleep and eat in barn dormitories in sheds in any space available the mongols do not separate children from adults and in their tents the little children have the favored place they remarked on the east german situation they did not find it sensible that way the germans will die out they said as a people they will diminish i was thinking of the children when a handbell rang a stableboy was clanging it calling to the mongols and me in front of the big south facing barn horses were ready for us five lively young geldings and a placid mare the mongol who is my special friend gave me a bent knee from which to mount the quiet horse as i settled into the saddle a girl groom told me that the mare s name was erica and she was an ambler the mongols looked the geldings over the leader of the cooperative watched the mongols elderly grooms held the restless horses on lead reins the horses arched their lovely necks switched tails shifted their feet they were closely matched and all offspring of the black stallion we were told they were show horses their elegant hooves oiled and blacked and highly polished teen aged boy and girl stablehands stood by very evidently proud of what their cooperative could show although the mongols wore their native dress they did not appear out of place in this setting they were at ease with horses and horse people their manner displayed no astonishment at the fantastic geldings the germans clad in riding breeches open necked shirts and stiff boots did not look more comfortable than the mongols in their long close fitted gowns of blue cloth the dress with a fold that allows ample room for mounting and riding astride their slim waists and their straight backs were given firm support by girdles of silk cloth in bright colors yards long wound tightly around and around in a broad band with the ends tucked in smoothly their boots of soft leather decorated with tooled patterns had inside pockets in their wide tops as at home in mongolia here the mongols carried on their persons everything needed for their way of living pocketed in their boot tops in their gowns and thrust into their waist sashes were silver and leather cases holding flint and tinder for making fire snuff bottles long bladed knives and chopsticks their eating and drinking bowls longstemmed pipes and well filled tobacco pouches tea grain and salt fastened to their girdles with thongs were leather bottles for fermented mare s milk their things were treasured possessions made by native craftsmen of wood and leather silver and gold ivory and jade amber and turquoise and rose quartz had been used in the making each thing had its traditional place in their garments securely held so as not to shake out and be lost however roughly they rode in their travel luggage gay patterned woolen saddlebags they brought with them to east germany a goodly supply of brick tea homemade cheese in hard cakes and plenty of their highland rock salt also a black iron kettle for making tea as they like it with a tripod to hang it on over the lire this group of mongols is the sixth delegation that has been sent to east germany to buy stock and they came prepared because they had been warned about food and drink i he mongols are independent people they bought grain and parched it as needed they bought butter to put in their tea when they wanted meat they bought a sheep and cooked it after an exchange of glances concerning the geldings the german speaking mongol woman asked lor lighter bridles no double reins no snaffles single bits she said the cooperative leader told a groom to fetch light bridles the groom did not want to do it he reminded the leader that these were spirited horses valuable oat fed in need of control or they might be ruined the groom was not answered under a commanding stare he gave over to a stableboy the restless gelding he held with bent head he disappeared into the barn the mongols each went to a horse they shortened stirrups refixed girths when the bridles were changed they mounted the horses kicked and snorted bucked and bounced probably afraid of the strangers the mongols let their mounts racket a short time then sent them forward with knee stabs in horse ribs a shrill yell close above horse ears the horses leaped forward without whip or spur the mongols rode perched with knees high seats not touching their saddles as they went away hands light on loosening reins giving their steeds freedom to go they did not pull their horses around each went in the direction the horse was headed in when it started soon the geldings were galloping with long smooth strides the thud of their hooves on the turf was a pleasant drumming birds flew up from the grass grazing horses cattle sheep gave them way over the rim of the earth they went wild horses wild riders my mount watched the other horses go her cars up her head stretched forward but she made no attempt to follow on the tour we traveled with other tourists in volkswagen buses and the mongols found the scats irksome nights we were billeted in country mansions they did not like the beds every morning they had to be given swift horses to ride to stretch their muscles clear their minds before they could get on with the business of their day always they got me a quiet horse i did not attempt to ride with them after they were off i rode when ready i pulled erica around to look at the german brothers sitting side by side on the ground their backs to the barn they had taken out their folding chessboard they never rode in the morning and they were always silent until needed i heir job was to interpret for the bargaining and to get the stock to mongolia they were soon putting out their chessmen ready to play on from where they left off yesterday i heard the starting up of the engines of the two buses of our tour which had been parked overnight in an open shed and i did not have to direct erica to get her looking that way we both watched the drivers back out and drive to the tree lined avenue they halted one behind the other and tooted horns people from india from burma from southeast asia and from various new nations of africa came out of their billets in mansion and cottages we had been together long enough to be a group they waved to me nearly all wore native costume the sari of a woman from india was not more charming than the flowing robes of an african man the colors were gorgeous there was zip and zing in these tourists from asia and africa i have encountered them east and west of the soviet line i hey were not cautious about friendship strangers soon became friends if those who wanted to converse did not have a common tongue they found a person who could interpret usually they were educated several spoke english others fluent german they told me that before leaving their homes they had learned that it is difficult nigh impossible to get passes to cross from communist controlled democracies to free enterprise democracies they are interested in both so families and friends had split up when buying their tickets they planned to compare notes when they got back home i found these tourists very interesting i never heard any of them complain they were not fretful they seemed to vie with each other in patience and in graciousness as neutrals they were investigating and enjoying themselves every day of the tour the others went sightseeing i always stayed with the mongols so did the german brothers at evening the others rejoined us and we had a program for the whole group the guides gave lectures and then answered questions that done the tourists took over in unscheduled displays of instrument playing singing reciting dancing showing their native cultures one morning after the tour buses went off i persuaded erica to exercise on the pastureland she showed her paces and i had a good ride i was letting her wander and nibble grass when a little girl joined us on a white pony she introduced herself as the youngest granddaughter of the oldest groom she had been sent to conduct me on a pretty ride her name was hedwig her pony was snow white we rode about three miles to a natural spring where we dismounted and drank fresh water from our cupped hands a pail is kept there for horses hedwig gave erica and snow white little drinks not too much she said because it is not good for horses to drink much far from home later we saw a squirrel in a tree and further on we dismounted again to wish on a magic stone we were riding through a grove when my mongol friend rode up behind me he and his mount had become friends i introduced hedwig and snow white over the open pasture we rode to the barn hedwig set our speed snow white galloping fast the showy gelding tossing a silly head fluttering mane and tail would have been a success in any horse opera erica cantered like a rockinghorse we arrived at the paved place in front of the great barn to find the others gathered in a circle having their mongolian tea as they did twice each day they had their black iron pot steaming it hung on its tripod over glowing coals the tea is prepared by bringing fresh water to a boil throwing in powdered tea scraped from the brick which is prepared of tea grown and cured in south china and sold in mongolia then rock salt lumps of butter and last handfuls of grain they preferred chinese millet but here they used german wheat seated around the pot they ladled out what they desired into their bowls with a long handled ladle drank the fluid ate the grain with the pushing help of their chopsticks offered a taste hedwig took a sip of the brew and a few grains of wheat then quickly she ran off but soon she came back with a tray filled with a german lunch slices of buttered bread cold meats cheese lettuce and radishes she carried the tray to each of us everyone took at least a little her grandfather called her and she left us her offering the mongols filled and refilled their bowls two and three times from their iron pot brew and when their appetites were satisfied they were ready to do business concerning the black stallion a wooden table was set up at the edge of the green pasture and with it twelve wooden chairs the german brothers the interpreters each took a chair at the table s ends along the sides were the four men and the woman from mongolia and five men of the horse breeding governing board they were three russians and two germans they had arrived the day before the job of the farm s cooperative committee was to show horses when asked and reply to questions the mongolian woman took as keen a part as the men questions were asked concerning the mares the stallion had serviced the percentage that had foaled was ascertained mares were brought out and paraded offspring of the stallion were shown the horse s daughters and sons of varying ages their records were asked and given on and on the talk and the showing progressed while the shadows lengthened from trees and buildings the two buses returned with the asian and african tourists just as the black stallion was brought out and paraded the horse was glorious the tourists drew in their breaths with ohs and ahs walking like the king of horses the black turned and wheeled went back and forth seeming almost not to need the attendance of the three handsome blond grooms assigned to show him these grooms were young russians they wore neat russian riding trousers and tunics of smooth beige cloth black patent leather riding boots riding gloves and their waists were girdled with belts of silver fashioned by the mongols own craftsmen each with the twelve animals of the zodiac on it the young men and the horse there in the evening light were as breathtaking a show as ever i saw in my life s journey before lanterns were needed the two german brothers were able to tell the members of the horsebreeding board that the mongols would purchase the stallion if a price that they could afford could be arranged after supper the bargaining started in what used to be the dining room of the mansion it was not ugly haggling there were no loud voices no bangings on the table no sulks it was polite patient and long at midnight a telephone call was put in to east berlin the answer was that the powers there in charge of horses would call powers higher up and telephone back the answer when the response came it was no the mongols went abruptly to bed next morning they had their ride on fine horses no geldings mares and stallions sired by the black after tea they raised their offer and new bargaining went on with more telephoning by four in the afternoon they owned the stallion or would when the agreed price had been paid the horse buyers had their gold with them they had orders from their government authorities to pay at the time and place of purchase their gold was not in coins nor was it refined into the shining gold bars the chinese use it was pure gold dug washed and dried taken out of their own land they carried it in leather bags the five mongols and the two german brothers each carried gold the horse breeding board did not want it they declared that the money transaction must be handled by their governments the mongols stubbornness caused more telephoning but they paid with their gold they bought this great stallion for breeding into their native mares with sacred gold given by their own good earth provided by their own gods with ancient ritual they had taken it from the soil of mongolia with ancient ritual they would show the stallion at the place where the earth s surface was broken to take the precious metal their government is communist with the slogans of the germans marx and engels the teachings of the communist russians but they are an old civilization proud of their own traditions loyal to ancient ritual this is how all the great imported stallions of their history have been purchased the gold was twice weighed on scales the mongols carried and on german scales when the price was satisfactorily passed from the buyers to the sellers then the mongols revealed a further bag of their gold a beautiful small bag with green jade ornaments at the ends of its drawstrings this they presented as their happiness gift we left all the breeding stock on the cooperatives where it was purchased it was not branded or marked in any way the mongols and the two german brothers have keen observation and sharp memory concerning animals from germany my friends were going by air to moscow to take part in a display of horsemanship then to fly on home five previous times the german brothers who have their own self selected helpers have gathered the stock and delivered it in urga they use special animal carrying planes built in russia there has never been question as to any of the animals not being those bought every horse bull and ram has arrived in good condition the chess playing germans are competent in addition to planned sightseeing which caused two half day halts we had other delays on our way back to the east berlin bus depot these were caused by encounters with autumn maneuvers conducted by the soviet commander marshal koniev three times we had to reverse our route go back several miles and take other roads each time our travel plan changed our guides telephoned to headquarters of the tour management so that they would know exactly where we were there was no secrecy about this extensive peacetime practice in readiness for battle guides gave us explanations over the bus loudspeaker and at the evening meetings in the guesthouses where we stopped overnight marshal koniev had more than half a million men in action operating them as a mobile east european combat force he was training germans and russians foies and czechs and hungarians to fight under one command in unified operation and he was making full use of a radio communications system which according to our guides leads into the kremlin the indians and the africans frequently talked politics the mongols did not take part nor did i on our radios we heard newscasts about the test explosions of thermonuclear bombs only then did the mongols speak about the world situation they feared the fallout the indians in particular worried about a possible nuclear war a war which would put an end to human life on earth the africans agreed with the indian statement that men have too much knowledge without enough wisdom we arrived at the bus depot i was soon to fly out of west berlin and travel on into sweden i like to travel light as arranged with my mongolian hosts we gave my suitcase and its contents to the two german women guides on our tour i said farewell to them to the male guides to the bus drivers to the two german brothers to the africans and the asians and last to four of the mongols then accompanied by my special friend s son i walked on to the friedrichstrasse checkpoint the only way open for me to cross into west berlin i was astonished as we approached to see everyone who had been on our tour gathered there behind the east berlin police guard clasping hands bowing warmhearted and ceremonial we said farewell again i asked them all to visit me sometime they all asked me to visit them in their homes sometime then i walked away

tear down work continues at washington village in norwalk in 2018 file photo a may 17 column by duo dickinson titled tear down culture makes it easy to forget about history is right about the value of history but ultimately misses the forest for the trees preserving connecticut s past shouldn t come at the expense of its future and valuing history shouldn t choke off dynamism in the present fortunately it s entirely possible for connecticut to simultaneously grow and preserve its history the issue isn t some kind of tear down culture it s our ahistorical zoning regime that makes it nearly impossible to build any new places we love the core of dickinson s argument is that our buildings simply extend our values and that history is a valuable resource not just in connecticut but wherever it exists in every place that harbors us even in a housing boom but there s a key issue with his main point connecticut isn t in a housing boom as camila vallejo reported in the ct mirror this january fewer building permits for new housing were granted in 2021 than in every year since 2011 similarly a july 2021 article in the hartford courant detailed that in 2020 connecticut towns and cities permitted 5 471 homes which paled in comparison to the 28 000 issued in the 1980s dickinson writes that the state s issue is more people looking for a place to live than the existing housing stock can accommodate but of course there isn t a fixed housing stock we re simply choosing not to build any connecticut isn t facing a tear down crisis it s experiencing a housing shortage crisis advertisement article continues below this ad one of the key drivers of our housing shortage is our restrictive ahistorical land use regime indeed the problem isn t that connecticut is tearing down too many cherished buildings it s that connecticut has one of the nation s largest hidden historic preservation programs except it s for 1970s and 80s suburbs our current zoning paradigm of large minimum lot sizes one size fits all single family zoning and massive parking requirements preserves the aesthetic look of 40 years ago hardly anyone s idea of an architectural golden era for example my neighborhood in trumbull began with the 1950s post war housing boom and it continued to grow up to the 1980s but since then it s remained essentially unchanged which is completely out of step with connecticut s history historically connecticut has been a place that embraces the past while constantly looking to grow and prosper in the future in 1800 the state s population was 250 000 growing to 900 000 by 1900 then the state exploded increasing to 2 million in 1950 and 3 4 million by 2000 throughout those decades the state adjusted shifting from an agricultural economy to an industrial one and then to a knowledge economy unfortunately that growth has almost entirely dried up between 2010 and 2020 the state s population increased only 0 9 percent the slowest decade increase in the history of connecticut this lack of growth is truly out of step with our state s traditional culture ultimately i think dickinson comes close to grasping that so much of what we think of as connecticut s historic charm is actually about land use he writes that he and his wife really enjoyed visiting the city of key west because of its distinctive sense of place and history and that they learned so much about the town because its historical environment is so well preserved i completely agree about key west s beauty and its cultural character but he s missing the most important part key west isn t so charming because it has some ineffable sense of history but because it was built before the advent of our modern zoning regime and car centric land use advertisement article continues below this ad on some level we all get what makes our favorite connecticut towns so wonderful in april my wife and i took a day trip to essex and chester we toured the connecticut river museum and walked up main street grabbing chocolate and coffee and admiring the gorgeous buildings afterwards we went to little house brewing in chester walking for a pizza at otto and reading about the trolley that used to go through its center essex and chester are exactly the types of historic places dickinson talks about preserving but again i think he misses the mark instead of asking how can we preserve the few town centers and buildings with any charm i think we should be asking an entirely different question why haven t we built any new chesters or essexes since when did our ambitions as a state become so limited connecticut s past residents didn t possess some secret historic charm technology that was lost to time instead they built as humans have traditionally built

on the wok ed today latin americans tend to see all politics including washington s in terms of personal leadership consequently when vice president wallace was removed from the top post at the board of economic warfare with its widely ramifying economic contacts with latin america and mr welles was eliminated as chief contact man for good neighbor arrangements at the state department many latin americans tended to conclude somewhat emotionally that the period of hemisphere understanding was waning from their point of view their favorite washington representatives had been fired and in somewhat more subtle ways certain of our recent overseas policies have been upsetting to the neighbors the democratic elements for instance were distressed by the fact that washington policy seemed to treat the hostile badoglio king victor emmanuel government in italy with scrupulous respect italian democratic elements are strongly represented in several south american countries notably argentina brazil and uruguay and because the united states has appeared hesitant about playing ball with the democratic forces in europe and has seemed to be keen on being polite to reactionary law and order groups like the badoglio government in italy the liberal groups in the latin american republics readily conclude that dictators will also be preferred to liberal regimes in their countries in the post war period argentina gets it straight such uncertainties have encouraged the new7 military oligarchy in argentina to believe that it could get away with murder in its general isolationist and anti democratic attitude toward the war and the linited nations during august the new foreign minister of the ramirez regime in argentina vice admiral segundo storni sent a note to secretary of state hull asking for lend lease arms and oil equipment to restore argentina to a position of equilibrium in the south american military powrer balances and to increase the republic s industrial productivity argentina deserved these concessions the admiral argued because she had sold her food and manufactured products copiously to the united nations and had recently deprived the axis embassies of the right to send secret code messages the storni note also contained elaborate explanations of the failure of argentina to break relations with the axis powers it was a better than average opening for mr hull s talents in his reply of september 8 to the chivalrous admiral the secretary began by refusing the requests he made it clear that argentina is still the best nazi espionage and propaganda center in the hemisphere by favor of its present government and that the republic has not carried through with either its political or its economic commitments toward the war as an american power and is not playing its part in building up the defense of the hemisphere he added that argentina has been paid big money for its economic contributions to the allies and that denial of code privileges to the axis is meaningless so long as trans atlantic telephones are open from buenos aires lend lease arms allotments mr hull concluded are meant for hemisphere defense not for establishing military equilibriums on the american continents and the purpose of oil machinery allotments is to produce larger oil stocks for all the american nations not for individual republics it was certainly the worst rebuke that any american country has received from washington since the good neighbor policy was initiated continued suspicions unwarranted these circumstances are naturally not cited to persuade anyone that the latin americans are right in their suspicions of washington there is nothing to warrant impressions either that the volume of assistance to inter american collaboration is scheduled to he cut down or that imperialistic ideas for the hemisphere are making headway in any sector of our government but understanding between twenty one not wholly compatible republics does not depend entirely on what the facts really are it depends on what the political elements in the latin american republics think the facts are bolivia boils an outstanding case study from this angle is bolivia since last spring a full belligerent bolivia next year is due for a presidential election as a result bolivia is boiling to begin with both of the country s principal parties president peharanda s conservative party more or less in league with the republic s big tin interests and the rather mild labor elements united in a group with the fearsome name of the revolutionary left party are sparring for positions in the 1944 campaign the labor strategists are naturally making the most for the present of the strike at the catavi tin mines early last winter when soldiers of the penaranda army shot up a crowd of striking miners causing many casualties the leftist party pir partido izquierdo revolucionario has been busy ever since trying to pin responsibility for this bloody business on certain members of president peharanda s cabinet partly out of genuine indignation and partly to embarrass the penaranda faction in next year s elections lately the pir has also been charging the penaranda government with lying down on the job of forcing the multimillionaire tin interests of the country to make some improvements in the pay living conditions and social security arrangements of the tin miners such changes were recommended by the commission which was sent down from the united states to bolivia last spring under federal judge calvert magruder of boston while measuring how much sop he must finally throw to the pir and the miners however president penaranda has been busy creating some even more exciting diversions during the winter bolivia began agitating rather plausibly and tactfully the question of recovering by some diplomatic purchase method the pacific port of arica which she lost sixty years ago to chile in a war between the south american west coast powers but since he made a visit to the united states and a grand tour of most of the latin american capitals general penaranda has converted this modest proposal of a negotiation into a militant nationalist issue continued the result is that where chile last winter appeared willing at least to consider some discussions of new arrangements with bolivia about arica the militarygroups in both countries today are going around with chips on their shoulders in fact some alarmists in diplomatic circles regard the chilean bolivian tension as the most dangerous trouble spot in the whole hemisphere at the moment there is the further embarrassment too to president peharanda s hosts on his recent travels who failed to say a flat no to his discourses on bolivia s need for a west coast outlet so that he now claims them alb including the united states as backers of bolivia s demand for arica if there had been a little more plain speaking on the point of shushing militancy over arica until after the war general penaranda might have thought twice before he returned to his people in the political posture of a belligerent nationalist if there were a clearer conviction in all the latin american countries of the partiality of the big united nations for democratic elements and democratic processes in nations associated with them in the war there would be less temptation for adventurers on horseback to try to ride into authoritarian presidencies cracks in inter american solidarity all up and down the inter american front there are rifts and discords similar in kind and origin to bolivia s mexico s war effort has been diminished and her internal politics bedeviled by a constant popular turmoil over rapid inflation and rising prices a circumstance which the nazi and spanish falange propaganda has used both boldly and adroitly to sow distrust of the war partnership with the imperialist y ankees violent political disturbances have barely been prevented in ecuador with revolution and the ousting of the arroyo del rio government as the direct objective even in panama late in august under the guns of the canal zone a conspiracy was detected for an uprising to put back in power the remnants o the pro fascist clique of former president arnulfo arias some of these difficulties are of course in the nature of latin american politics but there would almost certainly be fewer of them if latin american leaders and their thinking followers had a clearer conception of the kind of world the united nations are heading them into more and more as the distressed and weaker countries feel the hardships of the war they are troubled by their confusion as to where they are going in it and this confusion inspires their more irresponsible politicians to increasingly fantastic actions if we do not shortly adopt a stronger and a plainer line both in world and in inter american policy we may see more bewildered politics and more damage to our cause below the rio grande
september 1931 by andré maurois to prepare for this trip you have read a hundred books about america forget them when a traveler describes a foreign country he is tempted to exaggerate its strangeness but i whose business it is not to please you but to instruct you shall tell you that the beings with human faces whom after your six days on the ocean you will encounter on the other side are not as different from your friends in europe or from yourself as you imagine they are men who like us work suffer eat drink and make love read the poets build temples and destroy them are born and die when you have noticed that some of them like yourself are fond of proust and valéry when you have seen in their houses pictures by degas and renoir and heard in their concerts debussy dukas and ravel i am sure that you will abandon shamefaced the extravagant panoply of the spiritual explorer in which i now behold you you are going to america not to the moon be natural don t flatter yourself that you know american because you speak english you would be deceived you will understand new york women and harvard professors but when you encounter groups less impregnated with european culture you will discover a new language the presence in america of ethnic groups so important that they have preserved an independent racial existence has enriched this language with italian german and jewish words which have mingled with the english as arabic with spanish or french at the time of the moorish invasions when babbitt was published for the first time in england it called for a dictionary american is a much younger language than english its words still spring from images as in primitive languages many of them are short lived in 1927 when i was in america for the first time everything that charmed was cute in 1931 the word had become ridiculous almost prohibited you will tell me that awful in england formidable in france have known a like vogue and decadence but in the united states the cycle is briefer and the vocabulary of each instant is more ephemeral you will be astonished to find over there the yes of the english often replaced by a double grunt which is produced without opening the mouth by first expelling a delicate current of air through the nose then by inhaling gently one hears thus two very distinct notes the second the higher which united express a sort of approbation at once languid passive and kindly women oftener than men use these musical and barbarous sounds i have long sought their origin it is to be found i believe in the extreme nervous fatigue of human beings after an american metropolitan day the double grunt has the advantage over an articulated sound in that it expresses polite indifference with physical effort reduced to the minimum copyright 1931 by the atlantic monthly company all rights reserved it is a commonplace that there is no conversation in america like all commonplaces this one may lack niceties of shading an after dinner conversation between professors from princeton yale or cornell is very like a conversation among professors in france or england in new york i attended a dinner of what is called the round table where the political conversation was worthy of léon bérard or briand a tête à tête with an intelligent american woman is one of the greatest pleasures one can have in america but such happy moments are rare and why americans do not give cooking considered as one of the fine arts an important place in life lunch is for them a kind of gratuity paid to the body they hurriedly toss it a fruit a fish and go back to work certain writers in rebellion have founded the club three hours for lunch but they are an agreeable exception even at dinner general conversation is rare everyone talks to his neighbor after dinner the men linger at table a custom inherited from england in new york your host will often propose taking you to the theatre or else he will provide a pianist a singer a lecturer the idea of leaving his guests to themselves and expecting them to get pleasure out of meeting one another astonishes and even appalls him his excessive modesty does not permit his imagining that his friends can be happy merely in being in his house with him and one another he treats them like children on christmas eve you will see in some of the pleasantest homes in new york christmas trees for grown people in other places after a dinner at which you have met remarkable men with whom you would like to exchange ideas there will be a prestidigitator who will do his best to amuse the oldsters thus you must realize that the absence of conversation in america comes not from absence of ideas or lack of intelligence or understanding but from an unconquerable shyness and a prodigious self distrust in no other country will you find such impotence in self expression it is your business to beat down these barriers and to give the great repressed a chance for rest and confidence alcohol will help you i know that in france you drink little in america you will find it hard to keep sober almost everywhere you will be offered something to drink it will be difficult for you to refuse in american eyes prohibition has given to the offer of a drink an importance which never used to exist the man who fills your glass sacrifices for you a portion of a reserve of a limited stock he will be hurt if you appear to take his sacrifice too lightly you will have heard much of dangerous drinks of poisoned wine if you abstain you will give the impression that you lack confidence or courage console yourself with the thought that in the houses of the drys the cocktail is replaced by a glass of tomato sauce but you must understand that there is in this struggle over alcohol something profounder and more noble it is an overture to liberty and the first revolt of the american against the tyranny of custom the american has greater need of alcohol than the frenchman or the italian first puritanism then bourgeois respectability have made of him a being who dares not surrender himself to his natural instincts drink sets him free from age long repressions it is only when i have had something to drink said one of them to me that i can at last be myself the speak easy is the only place in new york where men and women come together for the mere pleasure of companionship without the need of a show and without counting the minutes conversation is better there than in the drawing rooms and the food is better than in the homes of the rich there the father gets to know his son and daughter there family life is revived don t miss it and if you fear the confusion of mind that the cocktail begets in a frenchman do as i did take a swallow then forget your full glass on the table of all the false ideas that you can bring with you the most senseless is the legend of an american indifferent to the things of the mind you will find in this country a literature and an architecture a school of painting i m not so sure what i have seen has seemed to me too much influenced by european modernism to be original but america s books are among the best of our time what ought you to read among novelists ernest hemingway he has the style of a tube of nickeled steel john dos passos thomas wolfe glen way wescott michael gold or if you prefer a more classic strain willa cather thornton wilder louis bromfield christopher morley i don t need to mention the most famous sinclair lewis sherwood anderson dreiser whom you already know among poets t s eliot stephen benét among essayists walter lippmann thomas beer among philosophers santayana john dewey among critics edmund wilson j w krutch among dramatists eugene o neill elmer rice i mention them haphazard from memory and perhaps forget the best but the length of this sketchy list may give you some idea of the riches that await you i am not acquainted with the intellectual life of pittsburgh or detroit but i believe that you will find new york one of the cities most exciting to the mind that there are in the world new york is the clearing house for the ideas of the universe all the important books of every country are translated there one finds there a public for virginia woolf for andré gide for thomas mann the book most read in america to day may be by a swede to morrow it will be by a frenchman a russian this universal curiosity is naturally not without its dangers the life of the mind suffers in the united states from ills which are those of our epoch but over there they have taken on a virulent form the gravest is a swift exhaustion of ideas it has been said that the american people as a whole adopt a scientific idea as they adopt a fashion in footgear to a certain extent this is true freudism behaviorism the humanism of irving babbitt the relativity of einstein have successively and in an elementary form penetrated the middle classes much more deeply than in europe but the american wearies of systems as quickly as he gobbles them up with him intellectual fashions are transitory because the most brilliant minds of europe come here to parade their paradoxes the american brain blasé demands that its spiritual viands be highly spiced the critical mind is lacking not among the best but among the masses you will retort that the masses in europe are sufficiently destitute of it that may be but in france they have common sense not free from impatience a traditional distrust in england a splendid indifference and a profound contempt for ideas which go flying through the brain and keep the motors of the mind from stalling in the united states there is a greater freshness of spirit a more naïve curiosity all that is congenial but carries the danger of formidable mistakes so if you wish to make a swift impression upon the crowd in this country you can do it be brilliant be cynical burn what others have worshiped and worship what others have burned criticize america savagely there will be violent reactions these will enhance your ephemeral glory the newspapers will quote your words you will be a celebrity and in three months forgotten but if you desire as i hope you do to bring to these strangers the best that is in you behave in quite the opposite fashion be natural don t press your ideas upon them strive after precise and delicate shades of meaning as you would if you were addressing the most cultivated and fastidious frenchman you will not make a great stir the reporters disappointed not finding in your conversation the material for headlines will write you up in three lines or not at all but slowly shy modest impartial minds will find you out there are many such in the united states they will make you one of themselves though you may not be a man of genius still you can give them what they lack and what you owe to france the taste for order in ideas constructive skill a long and skillful tradition in sentimental analysis they will bring to you freshness of mind and a directness of approach to moral and metaphysical questions as if these questions were quite new you will show them what it means to be mature to you they will reveal youth you have been told that the american does n t know how to cat but all generalizations are untrue the american cuisine is monotonous you will eat chicken every evening and ice cream twice a day but this cuisine is excellent when it is simple why complain in a country where fruit is abundant and fresh where the morning grapefruit is followed by the midday persimmon where the botanists by intricate graftings have produced a super vegetable a melon which they have named honeydew in new england ask for sea food boston has her fish as marseilles has hers the clams of new york are tender and melt in the mouth in the roadhouses ask for half a roast chicken and lima beans beware of salads american salads are culinary heresies in them you will find slices of fresh fruit criminally soaked in oil cheese and cabbage gone astray hearts of lettuce so tough that your knife makes no impression on them the bread almost always homemade varies in form and flavor you will miss the round french loaf mildly salty but you will like the rolls peppered with hard and fragrant caraway seeds to conclude do not be surprised to find many dishes decorated with strange and irrelevant trimmings this young people has a taste for ornament keener than its appreciation of the pleasures of the palate dress as you would in paris suits sober and dark in new york and the large cities tweeds plus fours and golf stockings in the country at the theatre in the evening a dinner coat is less necessary than in london the roundabout does not offend nor the light colored overcoat in the daytime all the men assume that air of prosperous mechanics that permits the millionaires their soft collars the american proletarian wears a soft hat often a cap at work he keeps it on his head and slips overalls over his suit that gives him in our european eyes the appearance of an amateur who might by chance have been caught tinkering under his car but you ask me do not all americans wear the same costume and the same hat at the same moment so i have read it may have been true once it has not been my experience i have seen caps i have seen soft hats and i have seen young people without hats at princeton they told me of a time when to wear an open shirt collar after the manner of shelley or byron was a sign of revolt punished by social ostracism but these things happened three or four years ago that is to say in the far past in 1930 a student was free to wear what he pleased there were fashions a certain overcoat of beige cashmere trousers of gray flannel but these were not more de rigueur than those of cambridge or oxford only the freshman must observe a proper modesty a dark cap was prescribed for him because the united states is a democratic country you imagine a life without restraint this is because you have never studied the manners of primitive peoples the younger a human group the more rigid its formalism because only by severe rules can men be tamed and made to conform to social life it is in the most ancient aristocracies that we find the freest manners and the most gracious flexibility in solitude the pioneer becomes brutal when he begins to live in society with his fellows it is necessary to impose upon him a code of manners the etiquette of louis xiv was devised for the rude nobility of the fronde the formality of pioneers is astonishing if you should happen to live as i have lived in an american university town the day after your arrival you will find at your door two hundred cards the entire faculty calls upon you even those who find you at home put down a card on leaving and you in your turn if you have the strength for it must return those two hundred calls an invitation by telephone is rare and is considered contrary to good usage if circumstances have made it necessary it is followed by a letter of excuse the smallest happenings are pretexts for letters of sympathy or congratulation an american friend writes to tell you that the dinner last evening was pleasant and that he will cherish a special memory of it on every occasion people exchange gifts small without money value but which foster friendly feelings when you are tired and driven you will find these attentions superfluous on second thought you will see how in this young society they help to sustain life beware of thinking that because it is a country without an hereditary nobility america is without a hierarchy i know few countries where the etiquette of contempt is so varied the anglo saxons despise the other races and these despise one another the southerners scorn the northerners the easterners those of the middle west those who have been in america three hundred years look down on the two hundred year olds and these again upon the americans of a century who in their turn refuse to recognize the new arrivals in the old families where the eldest son bears the christian name of his father there is always a cornelius vanderbilt a percy pyne as there is always a corisande among the gramonts and a francois among the la rochefoucaulds a numeral follows the name one day we shall be saying john jacob astor xvii as we say prince henry xxii of reuss at hollywood the old families are those of the silent films douglas fairbanks mary pickford they have english butlers lace tablecloths a chef in the kitchen old wines charlie chaplin is the swann of this obsolescent world where they speak in whispers with regret of the good old times when the screen was dumb american snobbery clings to very strange symbols of nobility which would have delighted marcel proust to have a telephone number as low as possible is a social advantage a new multimillionaire will be ready to pay the employee who distributes the license numbers of automobiles a fancy price to obtain some number in the first hundred which has been set free by the extinction of a great name a box at the metropolitan opera house has its history like a seat in the french academy the names of the successive incumbents are printed on each programme at performances given for charity when all the boxes are for sale some nouveau riche will think it glorious and flattering to occupy the astor box or the box of the cuttings if you want to be happy refuse yourself to society hostesses who will devour your time and strength choose a few friends there are in new york some delightful and simple homes flee the others if for particular ends you must storm the town that is different be more snobbish than the snobs your hauteur will astonish them your silence will disquiet them your caprices will enchant them these people suffer from too narrow an existence break the bounds you arrive convinced by the tales of your fellow travelers that there is great latitude in morals in america be prudent this is the country in which woman is most rigorously protected adultery is rare its place is filled by multiple divorce young girls beautiful often intelligent have made up their minds to marry what they call their technique is an art of love very different from that of ovid it is true that you as a stranger will be granted some immunity the european is desirable as a lover or a friend not as a husband he would not be like the american at once generous and without jealousy the marriage of a frenchman and an american girl is a marriage of two spoiled children an unstable compound people here are more simple than with us passion does not play so great a rôle you will be surprised to see how some young man arriving on the scene with a young girl who in your eyes is his will quietly stand aside and watch while she gives her attention to another they do not cling as we do to those who flee them it is better to renounce than to suffer how they said to me can you picture in your novels men so occupied with women is it because your heroes have nothing to do theirs is a frank naïveté but if you succeed in rousing one of these glorious creatures the more unaccustomed she is to that uneasy love of europe the deeper her attachment to you will be the american woman finds slaves she seeks a master if you are free play the part the stake is worth it i should like to speak to you further of young men and sport of colleges for young women which are paradise and of party politics which are hell but you are off i can add but a word you go to the land of timidity forget not your sympathy you go to the land of good will never forget that you have a warm heart you go to the land of youth do not stifle your enthusiasm a people is a mirror in which each traveler contemplates his own image in america as elsewhere remember one finds what one brings create for yourself an america of which you may be worthy that is the only one you will discover

paying chief executives 1 million in annual base salary became more passé for corporate america during 2021 of the chief executives of publicly traded corporations with a major triad presence half were paid at least 1 million in base salary yet for all 17 of those chief executives their base salary ranked second and often third in their compensation categories behind stock and stock option award and incentive pay the winston salem journal takes a look each may at the compensation packages paid primarily in the previous year the 10th annual review puts a spotlight on 35 publicly traded corporations and 15 non and not for profit organizations topping the list is amazon chief executive andrew jassy whose 2021 total compensation of 212 66 million still trails discovery inc s david zaslav by 34 34 million stock and stock option awards represented 211 93 million of jassy s compensation corporations are required to report in annual shareholder proxy filings the base salary bonus incentive pay stock and stock option awards deferred compensation typically pensions and perks of their five highest paid executives although federal regulators require corporations to declare the value annually executives typically are required to wait a specified amount of time often one to three years to receive those shares or exercise the options the prevailing theory is that executives will be more inclined to be prudent with shareholder value potentially taking less risk if their own compensation is weighted primarily toward share price performance meanwhile compensation for the heads of five large not for profit health care systems and 10 nonprofit community agencies are based on annual company bondholder filings and their most recent irs filings most of which are from 2019 and 2020 those irs filings typically are first seen on guidestar org amazon and truist financial corp have two executives listed because they had a top level transition during 2021 six other chief executives with triad ties had 10 million plus stock and stock option award compensation caterpillar inc s jim umpleby 17 5 million krispy kreme inc s mike tattersfield 16 14 million laboratory corp of america holdings adam schechter 15 04 million raytheon technologies corp s gregory hayes 14 5 million wells fargo co s charlie scharf 13 48 million and lowe s cos inc s marvin ellison 10 84 million in fact only four corporations provided their chief executives with less than 1 million in stock and stock option awards incentive based stock awards and grants have become a massively disproportionate component of total executive compensation said tony plath a retired finance professor at unc charlotte since the lion s share of these awards and grants belongs to senior executives the reported dodd frank act ceo to median employee compensation multiples aren t just high this year they re up there in nosebleed territory there was a business as usual attitude toward corporate executive compensation even during the pandemic said bowman gray iv a local independent stock broker on balance there was little to no impact gray said in many cases pay at the top continued to rise just as it has in the previous years even in the face of weakened balance sheets however gray said there has been a level of shareholder pushback recently against skyrocketing compensation packages particularly with high profile examples at jpmorgan chase co and intel eight figure compensation a fortune 500 esque list the equilar 100 that measures top 100 ceo pay by annual revenue shows eight and nine figure compensation becoming commonplace the 2022 list had to go to no 91 before reaching a chief executive whose total compensation was below 10 million equilar cuts off consideration for its list on march 31 each year which it calls the halfway point of annual proxy filings that means corporations filing a proxy in april and may are not included the equilar list contains five chief executives with triad ties led by no 32 raytheon s hayes at 21 79 million along with no 35 wells fargo s scharf at 21 35 million no 79 fedex s frederick smith at 14 32 million no 90 truist s william rogers at 10 01 million and no 92 tyson foods inc s donnie king at 8 99 million because of how the equilar list is compiled it does not include another 19 chief executives with triad ties who received more than 6 4 million in total compensation since those corporations didn t rank in the top 100 for revenue two years after the start of the pandemic the early data from 2021 shows that ceo pay appears to be back on the rise equilar said in its presentation equilar said that while salaries and perks increased incrementally over the last two years many companies elected to award their ceos for staying on board and guiding their organizations through turbulent times through bonuses and stock awards the trend coupled with the fact that the economy roared back in 2021 is likely contributing to the spike in overall pay for ceos at the largest u s companies share repurchases another key executive compensation factor has been the resumption of massive share repurchase programs particularly by national and super regional banks that had been shelved during the first few months of the pandemic where share repurchases fit into chief executive compensation is that a corporation typically buys back its stock from the marketplace to reduce the number of outstanding shares because there are fewer outstanding shares the remaining shares tend to become more valuable driving up their price and thus executive compensation tied to stock and stock option awards in 2015 american airlines eliminated chief executive douglas parker s annual salary and qualifications for incentive pay in lieu of stock awards just in 2021 the trade off for parker was worth 7 2 million even as the pandemic continued to limit domestic and international passenger demand making the stock awards strategy even more lucrative was the corporate tax rate cut from 35 to 21 that the then republican controlled congress approved and former president donald trump signed into law in late 2017 the majority of corporations have used those tax savings on corporate share repurchases if stock awards and options are properly designed the benefits received by the corporation will exceed the compensation that is offered to the executive said zagros madjd sadjadi an economics professor at winston salem state university he cited as an example if an executive increases the value of a company by 100 million over and above what would be expected if the executive had merely reached the benchmark that other companies in the industry have realized it is not unreasonable that the executive might receive 50 million in deferred compensation since the benefits to the stockholders in terms of additional stock value exceed the costs of giving the stock grant where some corporations have misfired madjd sadjadi said is when the stock awards are not properly designed this is why a superior method is to require corporate executives to own at least 1 of the company s common stock and require them to purchase it with their own money and hold onto it for the entire time they are an executive plath said a significant factor is the explosion in the number of different kinds of equity based executive compensation there are a plethora of incentive grants and awards in the form of traditional options and grants stock appreciation rights phantom shares restricted share grants and performance shares that have been newly created in the last few years plath said that although more non top level executives are benefiting from the stock awards strategy rank and file employees who hold company stock in their 401 k plans have gained as well not just corporations a comparison of executive compensation for most not for profits and nonprofits can be challenging because they declare those payments primarily in annual irs filings some of the latest compensation figures may be as much as three years old for some local nonprofits yet it s clear that the trend of ever increasing compensation isn t limited to just corporations in february atrium health disclosed that chief executive eugene woods total compensation jumped 24 3 to 9 83 million in fiscal 2021 he received a 7 1 raise in salary to 3 million a 38 5 jump in bonus to 3 81 million 1 3 million in incentives and 1 73 million in all other compensation that was not itemized in the annual report woods 2022 compensation is likely to be even higher if atrium completes a proposed merger with advocate aurora health of downers grove ill creating the fifth largest not for profit health care system in the united states woods and advocate president and chief executive jim skogsbergh would serve as co chief executives for the first 18 months after which skogsbergh would retire and woods would remain as

management pay has become a hot button issue in recent years critics say health care systems use their nonprofit status for tax advantages and public relations purposes while compensation committees have sought to justify corporate level wages and benefits to top executives some critics of paying not for profit executives more than 1 million in annual compensation challenge the notion of the skill level needed to run a health care system wake forest baptist has more than 21 000 employees overall it is the largest employer in forsyth county at about 14 000 novant has 28 092 employees overall in its four state network including about 8 145 in forsyth county both novant and wake forest baptist say executive compensation is based in large part on there being few individuals with the skills needed to manage a large health care system or academic medical center wake forest baptist said academic medical centers are very complex organizations that require a special set of skills and experience to manage relationships with patients students clinical staff educators researchers wake forest university community leaders employers and health care innovation partners the changing legislative and regulatory environment requires hospital executives to forecast future patient needs and determine how to meet those needs cost effectively while navigating often conflicting expectations of patients insurers regulators medical staff and businesses the novant board of trustees has repeated previous language that executive compensation is designed to be competitive and to help recruit and retain leaders the system says a significant part of executive compensation is based upon the performance of the organization and achieving goals that are challenging balanced and focused on improving the services we provide to patients and communities the executive team performs in the top quartile nationally compensation debate dr roy poses a clinical associate professor of medicine at brown university in providence r i and a former physician at three academic medical centers writes a blog called health care renewal in which he frequently tackles the issue of executive compensation so much so that there are 221 blog postings with references to hospital executives compensation by far the most poses wrote that for years the us consistently has had the most expensive health care system of any developed country for that exorbitant price it provides at best mediocre access to and mediocre quality of care we have long contended that a major reason for health care dysfunction is perverse incentives including those that allow top health care leaders to become rich by putting money ahead of patient care we have presented case after case supporting this point poses said that when health care organizations are asked to justify their executives compensation they invoke the same talking points that these payments are necessary to retain executives that the executives are brilliant and doing extremely hard jobs and the compensation is set by the market all three points have been debunked at least when used to justify the compensation of executives in big for profit companies poses said poses has argued that the escalation of health care chief executives compensation has come with some of the same root causes as corporations through making acquisitions or having non health care officials in the top role exalted pay of hospital managers occurred after managers largely supplanted health care professionals as leaders of health care organizations poses said this is part of a societal wave of managerialism most organizations are now run by generic managers rather than people familiar with the particulars of the organizations work rather than putting patient care first paying generic managers enough to make them rich now seems to be the leading goal of hospitals i postulate that managerialism is a major reason the us health care system costs much more than that of any other developed country

in one respect at least we may speak of economic collaboration between the english speaking peoples as having been secured this is in reference to money war debt adjustment remains a will o the wisp the two countries still have to negotiate the shoals of a trade agreement but there has already been a meeting of minds on money this was expressed in the tripartite arrangement with france of september 25 1936 of course the understanding is on a twenty four hour basis as everything seems to be in this world of flux but even so limited a rapprochement is better than the state of affairs the arrangement superseded previously there seemed to be a great gulf fixed between the ultimate monetary goals of the two countries exchange near stability had been attained but only as a temporary convenience and there had been no dissipation of the fear overhanging the world markets since 1933 of an eventual competitive depreciation race such a contest would have been cosmic fiddling with a vengeance but the event in 1936 dispelled such a fear it pledged the coöperation of the three powers in the maintenance of equilibrium in the system of international exchange since then the exchange relations between the united states and the united kingdom have been removed from political controversy in other words the dollar and the pound have not only remained fairly stable in their relations they have been on speaking terms of a much more cordial nature than once seemed possible i am not here concerned with the failure of the three power understanding to keep the franc stable the arrangement was concluded simultaneously with the devaluation of the franc possibly all three parties were at fault in not allowing for sufficient devaluation to meet french needs french instability however has not disturbed the perpetuation of the twenty four hour collaboration between washington and london and it is on the strengthening of this particular link that any economic angloamerica depends an entente which in the eyes of the roosevelt administration is the nucleus of an even wider association nothing less than a return to a common standard for world moneys in the administration s opinion such an achievement is a necessary correlative of secretary hull s effort to promote a world standard of commercial integrity the new standard like the old is gold but as yet only the united states is a close adherent to it i mean that the united states has engaged itself by law to buy and sell gold though not for internal use at a fixed price no other government has done that thus the united states treasury is the market for the yellow metal gold if you like is on a dollar standard the case of the united kingdom is somewhat different there is no fixed relation between gold and the pound but the british though under no legal obligation to buy and sell gold are once removed from such a direct link the connection being established through their dollar dealings under the threepower arrangement clearly if the paper pound and the gold dollar are kept fairly stable the paper pound and gold will remain fairly stable thus the honorable r h brand the british banker describes britain as having since 1931 ridden on the back first of france and then of the united states no doubt americans would like to see the british attach their currency directly to gold one or two overtures to that end have come from secretary morgenthau but the british prefer to see gold remain on a dollar standard at least for the time being such modesty satisfied secretary morgenthau in the fall of 1936 no doubt however he wanted britain to tie up with gold in another way namely to share with america the burden of supporting the gold market pending a definitive stabilization of currencies on gold such coöperation was regarded as the spirit of the tripartite understanding for even at that time the gold problem had become acute in the united states since 1934 when gold and the dollar returned to a fixed relation at a 69 per cent premium the metal had been coming to america in boatloads america s supply had swollen to half the world stock attracted either by the premium or by the safety of american vaults most of the pundits if you can recall the 1936 1937 winter entertained dark forebodings of a gold inflation as a result partly of what mussolini once called this gold hemorrhage from europe paul einzig in his new book will gold depreciate tells a story illustrative of this influx to america a schoolteacher asked his class what was the capital of europe new york replied one of the boys without hesitation nonsense said the teacher i asked what is the capital of europe not where is the capital of europe it was hoped that the tripartite agreement would result in the repatriation at least of french capital nothing of the sort happened in fact another source of gold supply opened up this was the private hoards held in london banks till the devaluation circle had been completed with france s defection from the pre depression gold standard most of the new metal came to america because of a rumor that the administration might reduce its buying price for gold sellers trying to get under the wire feared that america would take this countervailing step to ward off the gold inflation assuredly the administration became restive under what was described as carrying the gold baby just before i left for europe last summer i went to washington and heard open grumbling that britain was not buying enough gold there is reason to believe indeed that the plain intimation went out to london that if there were not more coöperation from britain the united states might in fact be compelled to lower its buying price thealarm in washington however seems peculiar in the light of recently published facts it turns out that the british far from refusing to pull their weight have been industriously engaged in mopping up the dumped gold along with the united states in 1936 britain actually bought more gold than the united states for the six months ended september 30 1937 it bought 500 000 000 as compared with american purchases of about twice that sum what the right proportion should be is anybody s guess it is interesting to record however that britain with a third of america s figure for population holds a third as much gold as america meanwhile the american slump has caused world dishoarders to rehoard and there has been an outflow of gold from america in point of fact nowadays the maintenance of the american price of gold at 35 is on balance in the british interest when president roosevelt offered a premium of 69 per cent on the price of gold he made in the words of the midland bank of london an economic paradise of the rand the world s greatest producer south africa probably the weakest link in the chain of the british commonwealth relies upon gold it follows that south african goodwill toward britain depends upon british goodwill toward gold almost as much can be said for india where unrest has been mollified by the high price of gold and the ready market for it incidentally the experts who used to talk of india as a sponge or sink for gold have been thoroughly disillusioned by the manner in which even the goldloving hindus will disgorge their holdings when the price is attractive the difficulty of restoring britain to a direct gold standard hides a history of disillusionment with america s international monetary policy to the british the morgenthau overture had an ancient fish like smell two experiences are cited president roosevelt s murder of the world monetary conference held in london in mid 1933 and the american silver policy the former experience has an interesting story attached to it president roosevelt in torpedoing the world conference was helped to that decision primarily by a director of the bank of england the late sir basil blackett was that director s name just before the world conference he had written a book called planned money which colonel house brought to the president s attention during the course of the london parley the new goal of monetary policy a domestic commodity dollar which the president then set for america has its rationale in planned money though the goal seems now to have disappeared among the new deal mists in the eyes of the british however such high authority does not improve the look of the monkey wrench which broke up international monetary stabilization mr roosevelt ditched the world plan in 1933 after bringing the british prime minister to america to discuss it this slight still rankles in england at the time the british simply turned elsewhere for monetary allies and banded a new monetary bloc together called sterlingaria dominated by the pound the silver policy came as an equal affront to the british through 1934 1935 turmoil reigned supreme in the silver market possibly many citizens of the british commonwealth made huge profits by selling silver as well as gold to the united states treasury for american requirements ran the price up from 45 to 81 cents an ounce in about six months but to the british these shortrun profits were at the expense of the permanent ruin of the silver market and their fears have come true silver was the only commodity that did not join the upward march of commodity prices in the last recovery movement moreover to add insult to injury there was the grandiose but unsuccessful plan born in washington to force british coöperation in the rehabilitation of silver as a monetary metal this was a scheme to prod england through india it was felt in washington that american buying would elicit british coöperation in managing the market out of fear that the price of silver would rise past the melting point of the rupee for with the indian unit worth more as metal than as coin the british would be faced with indian currency disorganization this price boosting scheme fizzled out in ineptitude though american buying of foreign silver is still being pursued on a selective basis it won nothing from england but criticism to put it mildly nevertheless new factors have arisen which constitute new british arguments for coöperating with america at least in accumulating gold three may be cited 1 britain finds that it has its own hot money problem this makes its gold holdings a kind of trustee account against the day of foreign withdrawals that hot money can be protected only by gold holdings 2 britain now regards gold as a war chest if the american neutrality policy is invoked to the full in the event of a european war then british gold can be shipped in british bottoms to american shores and buy necessary american goods 3 british gold is in part the ultimate reserve for the moneys of sterlingaria in these circumstances the purchases do not appear now as they did formerly as a transference of social values for unwanted gold in the united states too this question has arisen with the derisory comments on the lack of vault space an expensive hole in the ground has been dug in kentucky it is irresistible to poke fun at the world spectacle of arctic miners under stalin s direction digging up gold for reburial in mid america but having bought so much the united states has an even greater stake in propping up its price and seeing great britain prop it up than british producers apart from the obvious stake in maintaining some kind of monetary order for the 12 000 000 000 in america to day constitutes by far the world s greatest mine if the united states were to reduce its buying price the result apart from the world chaos that would be caused would be to depreciate the value of those extensive holdings the extent of the loss that would be sustained is easily calculated gold holdings amount to 12 000 000 000 if there were a cut in the buying price of gold of say 10 per cent the immediate loss to the treasury on this accumulation would be 1 200 000 000 offsetting such a loss would be the savings of sterilization costs nowadays when gold enters the united states it is set apart in an idle hoard the metal being bought out of the proceeds of short term borrowing but interest rates on these treasury bills bear an average of only 0 4 per cent so that on this basis the sterilization of say 1 200 000 000 of gold would cost only 4 800 000 a year compared with a 1 200 000 000 loss 4 800 000 is a trifle but the contrast is seldom made by those who like the satirical author of i d rather be right see the gold movements as merely a transfer from hole to hole still the suggestion of some impediment to the outpouring of gold as a method of warding off inflation harried european monetary minds last summer it was calculated that production had gone up twice in weight and three times in value since 1929 the last meeting of the bank of international settlements voted for a restriction on world gold output two directors i understood favored an agreement with america to mark down the buying price one of them the president l j a trip of amsterdam the scare that unless something was done there would be a world inflation particularly gripped the economists in sweden nobody thought in terms of deflation yet when i landed in america in the month which many european observers prophesied would be the month of inflation if nothing is done about gold i ran into the american deflation i came back with a profound disrespect for economic experts who talk of current developments ex cathedra now with the american slump upon us the gold rumors deal with the possible need to increase the price as an antirecession weapon either the world moves at a dizzy pace or gold has become a perpetual headache may not the trouble arise in part because policy on the part of the two dominant nations is on a twenty four hour basis if the two countries have revived their love for gold if gold has any significance at all the time may be nigh when they should have some policy toward gold at least for translation into action at some future day and that policy must surely be in the direction of extending the use of gold to like minded nations sufficient for the present however to be grateful that the dollar pound understanding has stood the test of eighteen months wear

i i can well imagine the dismay of those americans who had traveled in spain over the news which has come to them from the peninsula in the past eighteen months it was so beautiful a country its people were so courteous and so amiable their life so pleasant peaceful and dignified that the thought of them at mortal strife might have seemed not only tragic but incredible a profound peace brooded over those wide shimmering plains and those lovely mountain valleys those friendly peasants following their oxen or calling home their cattle those happy families engaged in adoring their adorable children on their golden sea beaches the grave and pious crowds which thronged their churches even to the porch for sunday mass those gay religious festivals those ancient sleepy cities every narrow lane and trellised courtyard hinting at beauty and romance how almost fantastic in its horror the thought that civil war had broken into such a paradise and not civil war as we knew it in england and you knew it in america waged within certain limits of decency and humanity by disciplined forces but civil war to the knife altogether ferocious and anarchical as if hell itself were let loose as if a beautiful face were suddenly distorted with fury to the likeness of a fiend such was the first and general impression but the handful of foreigners who lived in the peninsula or had closely followed events and tendencies since the establishment of the republic were if not less horrified at least less surprised they had even seen it coming there were the seeds of revolution and of civil war in the minds and policies of the fanatical factions that succeeded the mild government of king alfonso señor azaña and his friends demagogues and radicals under the sway of the grand orient egged on by the socialists opened vindictive war on the church and the great landowners the religious orders were proscribed mobs were allowed to sack and burn convents and churches the estates of the grandees were confiscated and many of the landowners themselves were banished to an unhealthy part of africa it was a legalized thinly veiled war against the conservative part of the nation now spain is fundamentally a religious and conservative country the forces of the right organized under gil robles did not indeed succeed in securing an independent majority but made themselves the strongest single party in the state defeated the parties of the left and formed a coalition with the more moderate radicalism of senor lerroux the socialists defeated at the polls showed very little respect for that principle of legitimacy which they now profess to cherish their leaders indalecio prieto and francisco largo caballero incited their followers to violence señor a ramos oliveira now press agent to the spanish embassy in london in that case found rebellion natural clericalism was the bane of progressive politics therefore when three clerical ministers entered the government with the radical party on october 5 1934 the revolution broke out the drama of spain 1931 1936 it was a ferocious but short lived war señor companys declared for a separate republic in catalonia which was speedily repressed señor azaña was found in hiding in barcelona the miners of asturias made of sterner stuff and armed with their favorite weapons sticks of dynamite wrecked their provincial capital of oviedo there was some sanguinary fighting and the rebellion moreover served to unmask the sinister power of soviet russia in spain the spanish section of the comintern had been formed as far back as 1920 and a revolutionary school of exiled catalans had been trained in moscow when the republic offered them immunity they swarmed back into spain a stroke in trade union politics the affiliation of the national confederation of labor to the profintern gave the communists an effective working force of 1 720 000 trade unionists for fifteen days the soviet régime ruled in asturias and when it was beaten the official organ of russian communism declared with truth the workers of the asturias fought for soviet power under the leadership of the communists thus two years before there was any thought of intervention by italy and germany soviet russia had shown its red hand in spain and not in spain only in the seventh world congress of that laboratory of revolution the communist international held at moscow in 1935 the secretary general dimitrov described the tactics by which spain would be conquered in the name of democracy and the congress declared in the presence of stalin that the majority of the proletariat must be won for armed insurrection according to dimitrov at that congress and it is a noteworthy prediction one of the most important means to the end of proletarian revolution would be a united front government thus the muscovite dracula prepared to enter the fair body of spain and so it happened the lerroux coalition like most coalitions sank into discredit the socialist leader prieto by the promise of autonomy worked on the simplicity of the basques and so divided the catholic vote the elections of february 1936 were a narrow victory for the popular front of radicals socialists communists and anarchists in a cortes of 473 this combination had a majority of 39 although it polled half a million less votes than the parties of the centre and the right and this despite intimidation at the polls at the urge of irresponsible agitators señor alcalá zamora the ex president afterwards stated in the journal de genève the mob seized the balloting papers with the result that false returns were sent in from many places moreover as he goes on to say the popular front immediately appointed a committee to verify the elections which they did with so much zeal that in certain provinces where the opposition had been victorious all the mandates were annulled and the candidates who were friendly to the popular front although they had been beaten were proclaimed deputies by such means the popular front majority of 39 was raised to 118 and the opposition left practically powerless the president the republican alcalá zamora although his mandate was not due to expire until december 11 1937 was arbitrarily dismissed and señor azaña by that time a mere helpless tool of the socialists was put in his place having thus confirmed their power these fanatical factionaries proceeded to behave as if the rest of spain had no right to exist the revolutionary mob had in part already taken charge in the short space of time between february 16 and june 16 1936 the country had gone down into chaos with 113 general and 228 partial strikes to dislocate industry business had become impossible the conservative party was in a state of siege 69 of its offices had been destroyed and 312 attacked its newspapers suffered the same fate 10 newspaper offices being demolished and 33 assaulted 209 people were killed and 1287 injured in the streets 160 churches were burnt down and 251 partly destroyed in this ferocious attack on the religious and political faith of a great part of the spanish people the police and magistracy were either powerless or forbidden to interfere 30 000 truculent rebels of the 1934 revolt and with them a horde of criminals had been liberated from jail upon the political victory of their friends and patrons employers were forced to take back into their employment the ringleaders of previous disorders industry had become impossible trading precarious the whole country sloped steeply down to anarchy and ruin ii the same forces which worked to destroy the religion and disrupt the civil life of spain worked also to undermine her army general franco who had always set his face against any military intervention in the politics of spain in june 1936 was constrained to address a grave warning to casares quiroga then minister for war lately he wrote commanding officers most of them of brilliant reputation and highly respected in the army have been deprived of their posts and these have been bestowed upon subordinates classified by 99 per cent of their colleagues as men poorly endowed with the qualities those posts demand there is evidence besides that the communists in the spring of 1936 were themselves plotting a coup d état thus in the left socialist paper claridad for april 11 of that year there is the report of a meeting held the day before in the europa cinema madrid at which largo caballero accepted the programme drawn up for spain by the moscow comintern in july 1935 and señor diez the secretary of the communist party described the revolutionary plan once the unification of the trade unions has been effected we must see to the formation of the confederation of workers and peasants so that we may be able to use them to replace the government the day we overthrow it we must also constitute a united militia of the proletariat which will be the embryo of the red army when the revolution triumphs in spain they went further in the preceding march a group of experts in revolution arrived in barcelona from russia and two russian ships the neva and the jevek landed arms for the communists at seville and algeciras moreover the communists in paris sent to their comrades of the red militia in madrid detailed plans for attacks on barracks and the assassination of officers generals were to be attacked preferably in their rooms by picked men who will not recoil before any obstacle and who will deal severely with anyone who opposes them without regard to age or sex all party leaders were to be arrested under pretext of affording them protection on the same pretext prominent capitalists were to be seized with regard to these violence must be avoided unless resistance is offered and they must be made to hand over the sums in their current accounts at the bank as well as all stocks and shares in cases where they attempt to mislead the culprit is to be removed as well as all the members of his family without any exception écho de paris january 14 1937 there is reason to believe that the date of this revolution had actually been fixed for may 1 1936 it was postponed to may 10 and then to june 29 and then again put off there are in my possession says mr f t rogers in his spain a tragicjourney photostatic copies of plans seized in anarchistic headquarters which detail fully the projects of anarchists and communists to seize the full power in madrid even before the murder of calvo sotelo the motive of that crime is shrewdly suspected by m jacques bardoux when he says in chaos in spain a war is wanted it is elementary strategy to get the enemy to declare it if that were the motive it could hardly have been better calculated senor sotelo was one of the leaders of the conservative opposition a statesman eloquent courageous patriotic he had just delivered in the cortes a scathing indictment of the frente popular the anarchy which it patronized the ruination which it was causing and la pasionaria a wild woman of the communist party had shouted you have made your last speech in the small hours of the morning his home was raided by fifteen police under captain moreno in car no 17 of the republican police force he was dragged out of his house and his bullet pierced body was found in a neighboring cemetery the facts were notorious ministers professed to be shocked but the government did nothing either to punish the criminals or to prevent a repetition of the crime the bourgeoisie the capitalist class the civilian and the officer of the army saw their impending doom in the fate of their political leader they were faced with the onus of revolt and on their behalf general franco accepted it but it was fundamentally a movement of defense and of preservation the decent people of spain had to defend themselves or die iii this dreadful dilemma is manifest in all that happened in government territory when the civil war began the government by decree disbanded the army and handed out arms promiscuously to socialist mobs the released rebels of the asturias rebellion often to mere boys and to criminals there were swift massacres of the officers in various garrisons in part of the navy the officers were seized by the sailors and thrown into the sea gangs of ruffians armed by the government instigated by the communists terrorized both cities and villages people suspected of conservative sympathies the churchgoers the well to do those who wore hats and white collars were accused of such crimes as fascism lined up against walls or taken to the cemetery gates and massacred in droves in some cases the lists of subscribers to conservative newspapers were considered sufficient evidence in others envy and spite supplied the fatal testimony in madrid popular tribunals like fouquier tinville s in revolutionary paris tried batches of the bourgeoisie for offenses unknown to any penal code and handed them over to the firing squads some methodical mind in the police bureau devised a system of photographing the victims for purposes of identification and from these and other records it has been possible to compile a sum of these massacres and we may therefore accept the estimate of a correspondent of the morning post in may 1937 who put the total to april 1937 at about 60 000 a figure confirmed by a passage in mr knoblaugh s correspondent in spain the accurate number of those killed behind the lines in the spanish war will never be known in their official reports to their respective governments the american french and english governments were said to have agreed that 60 000 for the madrid area 30 000 for the valencia area and 50 000 for the barcelona area would be conservative estimates these figures if they err err on the under side an old and trusted friend señor luis bolin for many years london correspondent of the madrid newspaper a b c and press censor with general franco told me some six months ago that after a careful survey it was estimated by those competent to judge that no less than three hundred thousand civilians and noncombatants had been slaughtered in government territory since the outbreak of the civil war as to the persons thus liquidated the priesthood may be supposed to come first it is known that at least 6000 were so killed besides several thousands of the religious monks nuns lay brothers choristers and so forth officers of the army and navy members of such political parties of the right as the acción popular capitalists bankers and merchants could expect no mercy unless indeed they trekked their way over the frontier or were hidden by faithful retainers or found refuge in the embassies or were kept in prison as hostages the fate of these reactionaries was possibly to be expected the progressive mind will be more shocked to hear that even the radicals did not escape the general doom of the spanish bourgeoisie thus the radical ex prime minister of spain señor alexander lerroux records in the city and province of valencia not only the radical deputies have been murdered but in certain villages all the members of the radical party have been exterminated at málaga and alicante the radicals were literally hunted down the blood toll taken of the radical party in spain is far greater than that taken of the church and perhaps than that taken of the civil guard which was so savagely sacrified l illustration january 30 1937 iv so much for the treatment of life under this democratic government of spain let us now consider its treatment of property it might be supposed from socialist propaganda that the land belonged to a handful of grandees who between them rack rented a helpless peasantry as a matter of fact the large landowner is an exception the radical measure of expropriation of 1932 applied only to eight out of fifty spanish provinces for the simple reason that in the rest further division was considered impracticable in these eight provinces the estates of over 620 acres totaled 16 000 000 acres divided among 8500 owners which is an average of under two thousand acres per landowner there were besides 55 estates of an average of 2365 acres but even in those provinces of large estates there wore on the other hand no less than 585 406 landowners who held between them 10 600 000 acres or an average of some 18 acres per owner these figures reduce the problem to its true proportions as a matter of fact the act of 1932 dealt with a total of 1 440 000 acres belonging to 99 grandees an average of about 14 545 acres per grandee it actually decreed the expropriation of some 660 000 acres of which by the end of 1933 one third had been divided among 8552 peasants even so the measure was considered vindictive and of little practical utility to the peasants concerned in some cases these peasants actually appealed to be left under their old landowners whom they knew and trusted now however socialist propaganda asserts that 7 1 2 million acres have been divided among the peasantry which if true means some such revolution as dispossessed the kulaks in russia a revolution in which the small holders themselves were dispossessed and the whole agricultural system reduced to chaos as for the church in spain vulgarly supposed to be fabulously rich she has indeed infinite treasures cathedrals works of art jewels dedicated to saints and madonnas and the magnificence which has cloaked her for centuries but these are now nationalized and her means of existence are meagre enough already she had been expropriated by a long series of measures of state in exchange for her properties the concordat of 1860 allowed her a revenue barely sufficient for the support of her clergy her schools and her hospitals and in 1931 the republic decreed the confiscation even of this revenue the church then in spain was miserably poor as for the religious orders when the republic set out to confiscate the property of the jesuits it found an adverse balance of debt of two million dollars what the revolution has done is not so much to confiscate as to destroy the churches were burnt the sacred images and holy vessels were broken down for the gold the silver and the jewels of which they were made and this spoliation was carried out with so much violence and knavery that the state profited little by the process as to private property in commerce and in industry it can hardly be said to have survived the frente popular the gold reserve of the bank of spain was taken and exported in violation of a fundamental law house property was socialized and no one knows at this moment to whom it belongs communist anarchist and socialist committees says mr knoblaugh raced each other to the choicest properties the most luxurious homes the most profitable industries the first one to arrive posted a printed announcement incautado por la c n t or esta casa ha sido incautada por la u g t if the anarcho syndicalists or socialists won the race or controlado por el partido communista if the communists had won those concerns which were seized were also robbed their stock their balances and their safe deposits were taken their management was put in the hands of committees of workmen and ignorance and rapacity soon reduced them to ruin foreign enterprises did not escape the american telephone company at barcelona was taken over by a soviet and so mismanaged that the subscribers had to be forced by threats of death to continue their subscription the barcelona traction light and power company and its subsidiaries mainly british concerns although registered under spanish law were taken over in the same way and three million pesetas in gold belonging to one of them the ebro company was taken out of its private safe in the royal bank of canada barcelona in that great british concern the rio tinto the labor leaders took over the mines and conceived the idea that the english staff would be held as hostages only when general franco conquered that part of spain were practicable working conditions restored in such manner the whole commerce and industry of loyalist spain were reduced to ruination the foreign staffs were evacuated the spanish owners liquidated thus stands that part of spain under its government to day its government that is represented as a free and progressive democracy we are commonly told that after all it is a choice between two evils that if there are excesses on the government side the alternative is the jack boot of a fascist a military dictatorship the truth is that although general franco is a regular soldier he is not a fascist and that he leads not a military force merely but the greater part of the spanish nation he is even now in possession of two thirds of spanish territory and all the islands save one moreover wherever he has gone he has been hailed as a liberator by the noncombatant part of the population he is defending law order and civilization in spain and if he has the assistance of italy and germany it is because they also feel themselves threatened by the same conspiracy but he remains independent the nationalist cause is financed by spanish money and when that cause is won spain will emerge poor indeed and sadly ravaged but in possession of her own territory and her own soul

inaudible last words of her aged father to seek always to seek then this articulate voice of the conscience of humanity ceased forever the press of every country anxiously waited for information concerning the illness of the world s foremost literary figure finally the flash came tolstoy is dead a hush fell over hundreds of thousands of people who had been patiently standing before the news centers throughout the cities and towns of russia young and old removed their hats many wept tolstoy s voice as the conscience of humanity has become a still small one since 1910 although it resounded loudly once again among a group of distinguished thinkers writers and scholars representing a dozen countries who gathered recently in an international conference to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the great man s death the setting was an austere hall of the ancient benedictine monastery on the lovely little island of san giorgio maggiore set like a bright jewel in the sun drenched shimmering green lagoon directly opposite the fabulous san marco shore line of venice high up on the back wall of the conference room an enormous canvas of the school of tintoretto depicting the mystic marriage of the virgin looked down piously on some fifty participants who for days poured forth a torrent of words in four languages on the art and thought of a man whom the church in his own day had denounced as an anathematized atheist and drawing by ilya repin anarchist revolutionist and an accursed and most disdained russian judas the universal deterrence of fear which contributes so profoundly to our anxieties over the state of the world today no doubt focused the thoughts of many of the conference participants on tolstoy s conviction that the tendency to replace moral and spiritual progress with technical progress is one of the main calamities of modern life indeed the presence of several eminent soviet tolstoyan scholars inevitably resulted in the introduction into the debate of cold war overtones tolstoy s works are proudly acclaimed by the soviet union as being among the greatest in the country s artistic heritage millions of copies have been distributed over the years of soviet power and in 1958 the definitive ninetyvolume jubilee edition of his writings was finished certainly in completeness textual accuracy and scholarly annotations the most magnificent monument ever erected to the memory of a famous author and now 1960 has been designated as the year of tolstoy in the soviet union there can be no question of the reverence of soviet people for tolstoy but the official position of the communist party in regard to him is compounded of praise and that familiar moral shuffling in ideological matters that is at once naive and offensive to all who pursue historical truth since lenin devoted several articles to tolstoy lenin s position has necessarily established the line which subsequent official soviet commentators have followed although lenin was much more modest as a literary critic than stalin he unhesitatingly placed tolstoy among the greatest writers of fiction in the world but he made the sharpest distinction between tolstoy the artist and tolstoy the thinker lenin called him the mirror of the russian revolution and praised his stubborn struggle against the repressive measures of the regimes of alexander iii and nicholas ii however he contemptuously dismissed tolstoy s basic doctrine of moral perfectibility and nonresistance to evil and he blamed him for not realizing that the old order could be destroyed only by a class conscious proletariat finally he accused tolstoy of helping to bring about the failure ot the 1905 revolution because of his quietist influence on the peasantry it is safe to assume that tolstoy had he lived would have discerned no essential difference between the authoritarian government of the czars and that of the kremlin in fact he frequently prophesied as much in his writings economic ideals he said could never be real ideals and he saw that the mistake of the marxists and of the whole materialistic school was in believing an economic cause to be at the root of all problems whereas the life of humanity was really moved by the growth of consciousness and religion tolstoy abhorred the violence of revolution and he declared that socialists will never destroy poverty and the injustice of the inequality of capacities the strongest and most intelligent will always make use of the weaker and more stupid even if that takes place which marx predicted then the only thing that will happen is that despotism will be passed on and with surprising prescience he pointed out a further danger in a communist revolution the one sphere of human life which governmental power did not encroach upon the domestic economic sphere thanks to the efforts of socialists and communists will be gradually encroached upon so that labor and recreation housing dress and food if the hopes of the reformers are fulfilled will all gradually be prescribed and allotted by the government soviet critics today either ignore this insight of tolstoy s on the future of communism or else adopt lenin s line of differentiating between the virtues of the artist and the faults of the philosopher occasionally they also profess to see in the novels an implicit faith in the triumph of a world wide brotherhood of men which they hope the reader will identify with the ultimate aims of communism to be sure there is a certain identity in the final aim of a classless and stateless society as one contemporary revolutionist put it to tolstoy in his marxian phraseology you use the tactic of love and we use that of violence but it was just this violence which creates violence the evil begetting power of evil that tolstoy could not tolerate as a substitute for his eternal law the tactic of love for different reasons western critics also tend to make an unfavorable distinction between tolstoy as the supreme literary artist of war and peace and anna karenina and the tolstoy who after his spiritual revelation in 1880 turned his back on art and became the cranky preacher of an uncompromising and impractical moral philosophy a kind of latter day prophet tiresomely warning the world that if his prescriptions for its social ills were not heeded the very existence of civilization would be threatened however tolstoy did not actually turn his back on art after 1880 many artistic works were still to come from his pen including such memorable efforts as the death of ivan ilyich resurrection hadji murad some of his best plays and the superb moral tales it is nonsense to imagine that the great literary artist of before 1880 suddenly transformed himself into a kind of intellectual crackpot once he began to seek the meaning of life the truth which had been his hero from the very beginning remained his hero to the end all the moral and spiritual searching and the intellectual and artistic direction of his being after 1880 are plainly indicated in his diaries letters and writings from his early youth after his spiritual revelation however these factors underwent not a change but a significant development when turgenev on his deathbed pleaded with tolstoy to return to the art which had made him in the much quoted phrase the great author of the russian land he did not understand that for tolstoy the measure of true greatness was not what we are but what we strive to be in the ceaseless struggle to achieve moral perfection nor did turgenev comprehend that the same magnificent qualities that made tolstoy s art immortal his sincerity and love of truth were the very qualities that drove him on in his religious and social mission no the search had to continue and in pursuing it tolstoy won for himself a place among the foremost thinkers in the second half of the nineteenth century it is probably true that if tolstoy had not first written war and peace and anna karenina the numerous works that followed on his philosophy of life would never have received the attention they did in his own day but a major reason for the success of these now forgotten religious social and moral tracts such as what i believe what then must we do and the kingdom of god is within you is that they contain much of the rich art and vision of life of the master novelist for the amazing persuasiveness of these works depends in large measure on tolstoy s uncanny matter of fact imagination and that quality of his fiction which reveals a natural taste for the elemental universal activities of humanity the ruthless realism that provided the matchless descriptions of mortal combat in war and peace is the same realism that conveys the brilliant but grim pictures of life in the flophouses of the moscow khitrov market in what then must we do and tolstoy s agonizing search in confession what i believe and the kingdom of god is within you for the moral law that will determine the future course of his life is simply an extension of the intense artistic search for the moral laws which guide the lives of the great characters of his novels as sir isaiah berlin has pointed out tolstoy perceived with extraordinary clarity and penetration the multiplicity of reality yet he persisted in placing his faith in one vast unitary whole this led him to search for absolutes in a world of incomplete knowledge and imperfect men and his inner need to achieve the ultimate in rational explanation often prompted him to push theory to the limits of absurdity which lie comes very close to doing in his views on history education and art yet the iconoclastic questions which his theories on these matters attempt to answer are nearly always profound and disturbing and compel the thoughtful reader to re examine his own premises this is certainly true of the theories of that undeservedly forgotten book what is art for much of what he had to say in this treatise has a peculiar relevance nowadays when so many so called works of art would justify his findings in a very melancholy way it is not easy to quarrel with his belief that art is a human activity and as such must have a clear purpose and aim discernible by the aid of reason and conscience what distinguishes art from its counterfeit is its communication its infectiousness and the stronger the infection the better is the art as art but the one great quality that makes a work of art truly contagious he argued is its sincerity which contributes most to its becoming a means of union among men counterfeit art he excoriated as pandering to the lowest taste and with startling insight he predicted that it would eventually become the mass art of the future shamelessly exploited for commercial gain a hideous menace to human sanity and culture with that maddening consistency which is as much the hallmark of pride as of humility he relegated his own great works of fiction up to this point to the category of bad art because they did not conform to the moral purpose of his new theory and when an admirer remonstrated with him for not employing his artistic powers to create more novels such as war and peace he replied why you know that is just like the former admirers of some ancient french whore repeating to her oh how adorably you used to sing chansonettes and flip up your petticoats soviet critics make much of the identity of their own position with tolstoy s insistence that when art ceases to be art for all the people and caters only to the wealthy and educated it ceases to be necessary and important and becomes an empty amusement that art should be accessible to all was tolstoy s contention but he also demanded that the artist must be entirely free to infect his audience with any feeling whatever freedom was the core of tolstoy s total thinking about the human state of man the european doctrine of natural law which tolstoy had become interested in as a young man is the starting point of the philosophy that he developed in his old age that is all man s moral aesthetic and spiritual values are objective and eternal and his inner harmony depends upon his correct relation to these values in the 1880s this approach led him to discover in the gospels that the purpose of life on earth is to serve not our lower animal nature but the power which our higher nature recognizes its kinship to there is a power in each of us declared tolstoy which enables us to discern what is good we are in touch with that power our reason and conscience flow from it and the purpose of our conscious life is to do its will to do good tolstoy based the practical application of this purpose of life on his famous five commandments do not be angry do not lust do not bind yourself by oaths resist not him that is evil be good to the just and the unjust and his attempts to observe these commandments drove him into a comprehensive examination of the whole organization of modern society he proved to his own satisfaction that institutionalized religion amounted to a belief in what one knows to be untrue the russian church replied by excommunicating him he next attacked all the institutions of government in terms of the five commandments the result was the theoretical destruction of government a man who will not submit his will to another who loves all nations equally and who will not use coercion or violence against either the just or the unjust such a man can obviously take no part in war be patriotic serve in any capacity in government or hold property since force is required to protect it the russian government unwilling to risk international indignation by making a martyr of tolstoy contented itself with jailing his followers and forbidding his treasonable books and pamphlets to be circulated in effect the task that tolstoy undertook during the last years of his life was the establishment on earth of the kingdom of god which for him meant the kingdom of truth and good he did this by practical example and the advocacy of his writings for despite thousands of adherents who set up organizations to carry out his beliefs he discouraged any church in his name learned to detest tolstoyans and sadly admitted in the end that the spirit of stupidity as well as the spirit of god lived in every man he did not demand that men be truthful and do good in order to achieve a personal immortality but because this was the fullest expression of their own personalities and the only way that peace and happiness could be achieved on earth organized government he deplored as a vast conspiracy against man designed to exploit his labor corrupt his soul and murder him in the violence of war he admitted that the ends he sought belonged to a distant millennium but this did not discourage him from devoting all his extraordinary powers to denouncing nearly every aspect of modern society which he considered a violation of the natural rights of man it is perhaps ironical that tolstoy s beliefs derived primarily from the teachings of christianity as well as from other great religions have frequently been dismissed as of no consequence precisely by the christian west in the east and especially in india tolstoy s beliefs seem still to be very much alive gandhi regarded himself as a humble follower and his tremendously effective civil disobedience campaign stemmed in large measure from tolstoy s teaching and sarvodaya the mass movement today headed by vinoba bhave a disciple of ghandi s aims at the creation of a social order based on the tolstoyan principle of love inspired by nonresistance or nonviolence though tolstoy felt that the japanese imitation of western civilization would bring about japan s undoing he prophesied a great future for the people of the eastern world in his letter to a chinese 1906 he wrote in our time a great revolution in the life of humanity will be accomplished and in this revolution china ought to play a tremendous role at the head of the eastern peoples on the other hand western critics ridiculed tolstoy s more extreme beliefs they laughed at the defense of chastity by this father of thirteen children in the kreutzer sonata and in the personal afterword to that celebrated book and they cynically guessed that the grapes had turned sour for the old man even his wife again fearing pregnancy by her husband of sixty one maliciously told visitors that this would be the real afterword to the kreutzer sonata yet tolstoy never believed that people and least of all himself could achieve his ideal of perfect chastity when nearly seventy he frankly told a friend i was myself a husband last night but that is no reason for abandoning the struggle god may grant me not to be so again perhaps the doctrine that more than any other damaged his reputation as a thinker was that of nonresistance which for tolstoy meant that no physical force must be used to compel any man to do what he does not want to do or to make him desist from doing what he likes few visitors to yasnaya polyana failed to confront him with the obvious conundrums that arose out of such an extreme position this was especially true of americans whose practical mindedness and lack of spiritual qualities he criticized although he was devoted to certain american thinkers and writers such as emerson thoreau whitman william lloyd garrison and henry george and he won a number of eager disciples in america but it was the casual curious american tourists who annoyed him it is just as though they had learned about me in a baedeker and had come to confirm it he once remarked of two of them william jennings bryan however he admired as an intelligent and religious american and when the great commoner confronted him on the problem of nonresistance with the stock argument what would he do if he saw a bandit murdering or assaulting a child tolstoy gave his stock answer that in all his seventy five years he had never met anywhere this fantastic brigand who would murder or outrage a child before his eyes whereas in war millions of brigands kill with complete license in reality tolstoy though adamant about the theory and the ends of his faith was anything but dogmatic about the means of achieving them he realized that the goal he set was often perfection and though he might be uncompromising about it as a goal he never expected men to achieve it striving for perfection became the end we search for mind powers goodness perfection in all this he wrote in his diary but perfection is not given to man in anything it is perhaps only in this limited sense of his doctrines this striving through individual effort to achieve a more perfect world that tolstoy s philosophy can have any meaning for us at this time of international chaos like many thoughtful people today he questioned whether human progress could be measured by its technical or scientific achievements or whether modern civilization in general was moving toward the greater good progress he insisted does not consist of an increase in knowledge or in the material improvement of life there can be progress only in a greater understanding of the answers to the fundamental questions of life a popular worship of scientific progress in a society still incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong represented a terrible danger to tolstoy when the life of people is unmoral he jotted down in his diary and their relations are not based on love but on egoism then all technical improvements the increase of man s power over nature steam electricity the telegraph every machine gunpowder and dynamite produce the impression of dangerous toys placed in the hands of children that governments in their systematic organization of society might logically strive to achieve righteousness tolstoy emphatically denied when an american newspaper asked him in 1899 to comment on a proposal of the czar for a summit conference of the great powers at the hague to consider the question of disarmament in the interests of world peace he replied my answer to your question is that peace can never be achieved by conferences or be decided by people who not only jabber but who themselves go to war all such conferences can be summed up in a single dictum all people are sons of god and brothers and therefore they ought to love and not kill each other forgive my sharpness but all these conferences invoke in me a strong feeling of disgust over the hypocrisy that is so obvious in them the only tangible result of the hague conference was a series of conventions on the more humane conduct of war and shortly after its conclusion the english plunged into a bloody struggle with the boers the power that corrupts tolstoy asserted was just as capable of existing in a democracy or a socialist state as in an absolute monarchy for him political progress could not be measured in terms of democratic or socialist progress for he saw in both the hypocrisy behind universal suffrage and the ever present danger of power his writings are full of warnings of the inevitability of both democratic and socialist states turning into monstrous dictatorships of nonmilitary democracies becoming powerful military states of civilized countries championing fiendish theories of racial superiority and of all the amazing advances of science being turned into frightful instruments of war to kill millions of people more expeditiously all this he foretold will be achieved in the name of political social and scientific progress and there will be no end of such progress he warned as long as humanity continues to worship the law of man as higher than the law of god tolstoyism was in no sense the moral rearmament movement of its day although some of its principles do bear a similarity to those of the buchmanites any careful and systematic study of the whole of tolstoy s thought reveals that he was fundamentally working within the concepts of nineteenth century liberalism carried to its logical and perhaps utopian conclusion such liberal thought inevitably results in the doctrine of karl marx or in the doctrine of leo tolstoy for the end product of both is a classless and stateless society marx sought to achieve his objective by revolutionary action based on a materialistic approach to history which sanctioned the use of violence tolstoy believed that the whole history of the last two thousand years had essentially consisted of the moral development of the masses and the demoralization of governments he placed his faith in the moral development of the masses as a final answer to the universal oppression of the many by the few for him the progressive movement toward a classless and stateless condition of mankind depended upon the growing moral perfection of every individual through strict observance of the supreme law of love and the consequent repudiation of every form of violence the west with its incomplete liberalism today condemns soviet marxism but it has also decided that tolstoy though he may have diagnosed the disease of society correctly has prescribed a kind of incantation for a cure his way of love and moral perfection we say is impractical on the other hand we must now decide how practical is a hydrogen bomb war to end all wars or civilization however much of an incantation his remedy may have been there was nevertheless a certain strength in tolstoy s unworldliness from which we can perhaps learn something for it enabled him to stand above the turmoil of everyday life and reach beyond history beyond time itself to find universal answers to the problems of living nor did the seer of yasnaya polyana ever lose his wonderful optimism returning home one day after seeing a beautiful sunset he wrote in his diary no this world is not a joke and not a vale of trials or a transition to a better everlasting world but this world here is one of the eternal worlds that is beautiful joyous which we can and must make more beautiful and more joyous for those living with us and for those who will live in it after us

january 1931 by william orton i the striking adventures of the two young people in the nursery epic who set out in quest of liquid refreshment furnish a sad example of the instability of popular interest the tale is singularly incomplete whether jack ever got any water what happened to his thirsty friends and relations and the mysterious disappearance of one of the principal characters were surely matters of some moment yet the silence of the legend on these points has been universally ignored by the commentators lest the story of radio should go down to posterity in a similar unsatisfactory condition it may be well to remind ourselves before it is too late of its opening promise a few years ago we were hearing from admirals generals politicians inventors and even quite normal people ecstatic prophecies of what the industry would accomplish for the glory and honor of our country the cause of international understanding and the dissemination of culture and enlightenment on every hand it may of course be true that the subsequent development of radio fulfills general harbord s conception of the glory and honor of our country it is certainly true that a foreigner listening in at random will get a very vivid understanding of contemporary america though not perhaps the sort of understanding mr baldwin had in mind but whether we can accept recent assurances of the broadcasters as to the culture and enlightenment is not so certain there is another feature of the nursery epic that has escaped notice considering the aim of the expedition the party seems to have set out in a somewhat surprising direction a fact with which its subsequent fate was not unconnected broadcasting in america began and has largely remained in the almost unchecked control of the owners of radio patents and the manufacturers of radio receiving sets if people were to be induced to buy the sets there must be something on the air for them to listen to it was at this point that the governments of other countries took hold but the united states government did not manage to get an effective control even of wave lengths until 1927 and by that time the good old dogmas of individualism and noninterference had built a ring fence around the broadcasting business for a business is what it very rapidly became the manufacturing concerns which had originally regarded broadcasting as a necessary expense incidental to the sale of radio sets conceived the idea of turning the sales force into an independent source of income the one demand for the use of radio channels that had money behind it the government being barred was that of the advertisers the size of the demand and the amount of the money exceeded all expectations accordingly unsponsored programmes that is programmes provided and paid for by the broadcasting station which were at first the mainstay of broadcasting came to occupy a mere fraction of the time used to fill in unsold hours and to maintain a modicum of more or less uncommercial interest for the goodwill of the public and the reputation of the station but the main business of the six hundred odd stations now licensed is simply to make money for their owners copyright 1930 by the atlantic monthly company all rights reserved that is as much their main business as it is of any other advertising concern managers entertainment bureaus contact men programme directors continuity writers publicity departments are all organized to that supreme end broadcasting is more expensive than ever but it is no longer the makers or the buyers of radio sets who pay that expense it is the advertisers they pay for example two hundred dollars for thirty minutes evening time of the new england westinghouse stations and are shortly going to pay double they pay over two thousand dollars for a half hour on the blue network of the national broadcasting company over three thousand on the red for the coast to coast chain with both systems they pay over twenty thousand dollars an hour and the demand for time is on the whole steadily increasing let us see it at work here is mr makem let us say small town manufacturer of something we will call the gadget to specify would be invidious since in point of fact it may be anything from bonds to banana oil either by the radio contact man or by his own advertising agent mr makem is introduced to the idea of broadcasting the merits of the gadget he must promptly decide to what sort of public the gadget will best appeal since this with the length of his purse will affect his choice of hours and days if the gadget is mainly a woman s affair dress kitchen or housekeeping he may content himself with the less expensive daytime hours if it has a family appeal he had better try for a booking in the early evening when both father and the children may be listening in at this stage mr makem perhaps begins to wonder whether a little press display might not serve him as well at the cost of less money and trouble he is or should be reminded that whereas his press advertisement might or might not be glanced at by one or two members of the family at most his broadcast will have the undivided attention of his audience while it lasts machines not yet having been devised to render two programmes at once not intelligibly at least and further that the computed radio audience is over four persons per set over four and a half million living souls in new england alone official confirmation of these estimates by the census returns would of course be very useful to the broadcasters and people like mr owen young have a good deal of influence thus fortified mr makem proceeds to cogitate on the innermost excellencies of the gadget for it is these that will determine the nature of the programme is it a smooth suave seductive sort of gadget that can be woven into a fantasy of the dreamy east or is it a smart snappy peppy sort of gadget with an appeal to youth health and vigor fun and adventure and the wide open spaces can the kiddies be brought in can it be dramatized made to save broken bones hearts or reputations in the nick of breathless time at a hundred dollars a minute these matters being more or less decided the programme manager is discovered to have just the thing he probably has a file of prospects several feet long and a queue of auditions running into the middle of next winter the continuity department is put to work evolving a screed in which the smoothness and suavity pep and virility safety and sanity of the gadget are tactfully alluded to if tactlessly the public will kick the programme emphasizes in content style and manner the same intimate virtues so must the voice and personality of the announcer rehearsals are arranged the great night comes and mr makem tunes in wondering will it sell the answer is simple if it has a good programme it will but it must have a good programme the radio public is not the dumb long suffering beast that gazes year in year out at roadside posters it cannot knock down billboards but it can turn a dial moreover it can and does write letters thousands of letters let mr makem offer to give anything away it does n t much matter what or ask for guidance and he will be overwhelmed with them if the gadget is in fact or semblance worth anything and a reputable station will not put it on the air unless its claims are reasonably authenticated the rest is now a matter of decreasing costs versus increasing appropriations for mr makem thus another spell of culture and enlightenment finds its way into the american home and incidentally another fillip is given to the demand for radio sets ii apart from the offerings of the advertisers air time is filled out with the sustaining or unsponsored programmes offered by the stations themselves these vary all the way from the playing of victrola records to musical and news events of a very high order some of the items national and international relays of significant happenings for instance cost a great deal of money others are furnished on a fifty fifty basis performers making no charge for their services and the primary broadcasting concern no charge for its time despite recent improvements in the quality of the advertising programmes it is the sustaining programmes that furnish practically all material of genuine cultural or educational value and the question naturally arises whether the growth of advertising will not eventually crowd out the sustaining programme altogether a decided negative is given by an apparently inspired article in radio news the radio executives we are assured are too conscious of their obligations to the listening public and would no more sacrifice their own time on the air than would the directors of a national magazine sell all space in their publication to advertisers the analogy is not quite accurate but letting that pass and accepting the assurance at face value the fact remains as no loss an authority than the federal radio commission has stated that advertising must be accepted for the present as the sole means of support for broadcasting such by the way is the radio commission s idea of the public interest convenience and necessity which it was created to administer no other first class power has so callously sold its heritage of technique for such a mess of pottage compared with other nations in its use of the new means of communication the land of opportunity looks more like the land of lost opportunities the current american assumption that every advance in technique is ipso facto an advance in civilization has nowhere had so devastating an exposure but the blame lies not solely nor even mainly with the broadcasting companies it rests mainly upon the shoulders of the american people doing lip service to a degree that is literally unparalleled to what are supposed to be the higher aims of collective living it has acted and allowed its rulers to act consistently on the rule seek ye first the maximum percentage and all these things shall be added unto you and by the time it suspects they are not added it has ceased to care much whether they are or no for it must be emphatically asserted that the number of people who are concerned about the american situation in broadcasting is a small and weak minority the broadcasting companies know this however little the intellectual may like to admit it the general public is pretty well satisfied why should it not be it has entertainment distraction in abundance to call the entertainment free is to take liberties with economics but the public is not called upon as it is elsewhere to pay directly to expect cultural leadership artistic or intellectual pioneering from the mass is more than even mr coolidge would venture the mass may respond but cannot initiate here is a recent official comment from the movie industry many artistically important films are box office failures therefore those which are ahead of general public taste must be sold in the same lot with box office successes or they would n t be sold at all at this moment the picture which of all pictures in the past year has been most lavishly praised by critics public groups and newspaper editors is having the largest number of theatre cancellations of any picture in the year s programme it is true that mr sarnoff president of the radio corporation in a recent newspaper article dismissed the claims of the intellectuals in a vein as cavalier as mayor thompson s and pronounced the mass of people quite capable of doing its own cultural pioneering but he neglected to explain how and adduced no samples and if mr sarnoff s views are representative it is futile to expect this sort of pioneering from an industry that is commercially organized and psychologically habituated to rely entirely on mass appeal take education for instance as viewed by the vice president of the national broadcasting company what the public demands of radio said he to the institute of education this summer is entertainment if the educators on the air fail to recognize that fact in the development of education by radio they are merely firing a blank cartridge every person entrusted with teaching by radio should be required to pass an examination on his ability as a showman when education joins hands with radio it enters the show business apparently that is the view of the federal bureau of education to judge from an instruction sheet circulated under its auspices write out your exact wording begin with one or more striking statements present your specialty on the level of thirteen year olds do not overrate the intelligence of your listeners anecdotes short and clearly to the point are good here at any rate is one of the reasons for the sorry story of radio education in america as revealed in recent reports of a committee appointed ten years too late by the secretary of the interior and an investigation by the american association for adult education the kind of education that can be made to conform with the conceptions of messrs sarnoff and ellwood is not the sort of thing in which the best minds of the country can be deeply interested broadcasting stations with an educational aim have had generally speaking to confine their major efforts to courses of the home economics or mildly vocational type and even at that have had to do a good deal of padding seventy seven out of six hundred and twenty seven stations in the united states are owned and operated by educational institutions of one sort or another fifty one of these reporting to the wilbur committee show a weekly not daily average of eight hours on the air of which two and a half are strictly educational the precise extent of educational broadcasting in america is impossible to ascertain a recent letter to the new republic claims that the programmes of the american school of the air a series of talks on history literature civics music art health and nature study sponsored by the columbia system in conjunction with the grigsby grunow company are received by twenty thousand schools the wilbur committee as the result of an inquiry directed to city school superintendents reports 32 6 per cent of such schools 1606 in all possessing radio equipment great britain with one third the population and one fifth the national income reports five thousand schools served by the british broadcasting corporation and a circulation of the follow up pamphlets for school use amounting to a quarter of a million the british broadcasting corporation is a public monopoly ultimately responsible not to a group of private stockholders headed by the radio manufacturers but to the elected representatives of the people in parliament assembled in contrast to the united states bureau of education it proceeds on the assumption that a people capable of self government will be largely composed of adults and its activities provide a striking comment on the thirteen year old theory it broadcasts for instance whole operas but do the people listen well the sales of libretti of broadcast operas run to close on one million annually realizing the deficiencies of radio alone as an educational or cultural medium the b b c issues a vast amount of supplementary literature its publications include two weeklies one a programme guide illustrated with annotations the other a literary journal centred around the more important cultural features and their total circulation exceeds one and a half million bringing an annual income of about half a million dollars in the field of adult education the formation of study groups is systematically encouraged and summer schools are arranged for group leaders and radio lecturers as a sample of popular interest it may be noted that a single talk last spring by professor macmurry on psychology brought 17 000 requests for the supplementary aid to study pamphlet and one by professor burt on the study of the mind brought 26 000 apparently the british like being treated as grown ups iii state efforts in america to assist the educational use of radio have however more than the thirteen year old theory to contend with there is quite another set of handicaps hours are limited and air channels are limited education has no preference in either respect it cannot afford to buy the evening hours that are necessary for reaching adults in fact it seldom gets the chance the broadcasting systems do not accept lectures and educational talks between the hours of six and midnight even for the daytime hours education is financially unable to compete with commercial customers broadcasting stations devoted solely to education are expensive to equip and cannot fill enough time or hold large enough audiences to be sure of their licenses in competition with commercial stations before the federal radio commission the chairman of that commission in a recent address said bluntly that all available radio channels are fully occupied and that if educators want more than the small number they now have they must persuade congress to change the law since the increase would mean closing down some existing stations without sufficient justification if education wants a share in broadcasting says the american association s report it will have to fight for it and will have to secure it by entering the field of competition on an equal basis with other claimants on the other hand mr aylesworth the president of the national broadcasting company speaks of the outlook in more hopeful terms the pleasing progress that we have made in musical education he says in his last annual report following a reference to the damrosch series leads us to hope that we shall soon undertake general educational work but i feel very strongly that this should not be done until a carefully considered programme is prepared by nationally recognized educators of outstanding ability when they are ready we will place our facilities at their disposal without charge this may be either altruism or the more familiar process known as passing the buck it must in any case be taken in conjunction with the repeated assurances of the broadcasters that the educators do not know their job from the broadcasting angle meanwhile the broadcasters point with pride to their own achievements in the direction of potted opera for example says mr aylesworth in the same report we take a standard grand opera and cut it down to an hour because that seems to be about the right period for opera on the air i hope for the time when we will create grand opera for radio broadcasting such an opera would be performed within the hour and not have to be cut we have borrowed and will continue to borrow dramatic writings originally designed for the legitimate stage the radio guild to which presumably mr aylesworth refers is an interesting case in point the radio guild we are told by one of the trade journals was originally a group organized by mr aylesworth s company to present the old melodramas but the public asked for something more accordingly the guild has presented plays of ibsen tolstoy pinero shakespeare st john ervine and other famous authors and how the radio guild productions are presented in the afternoon in order that an entire hour may be available for the production the majority of plays selected it has been found can be adapted to the hour limit without sacrificing strength or important scenes what happens to the minority we are not informed to judge by these presents it may be some time before mr aylesworth s nationally recognized educators of outstanding ability arc able to agree on anything that will satisfy the broadcasters ideas of successful programme material but the root of the trouble lies deeper than that it lies in the acceptance by both the industry and the government yes and even by the educators of the broadest mass standards as the only ones with which broadcasting should be concerned education however is not the only issue affected perhaps it is not even the most important issue the american maxim that every advance in technique is ipso facto an advance in civilization exaggerates the social significance of applied science to a degree at which disappointment is inevitable the radio has brought no new asset of major importance to education and its use involves serious disabilities it provides a means for reaching people who could not otherwise be reached it also provides a means for reaching people whose interest in what they are supposed to want is not strong enough to support any effort or sacrifice on their own part to obtain it it can make available the voices of teachers who could not otherwise be heard though they might be read and can bring sound to reënforce teaching in cases like that of language or music where sound itself is the subject matter this is certainly much listening is for most people not only easier than reading it is more stimulating and an inert but well disposed mind may sometimes be stimulated to a degree at which its reaction ceases to be purely passive on the other hand radio tends naturally to encourage the passive attitude on the part of the learner the one thing that educational theorists are united to oppose it tends the more definitely as it becomes more successful to standardization of approach and content it emphasizes the factual and informative rather than the reflective and analytical and despite the existence of radio personality it can hardly compensate for the absence of the immediate teacher student relationship the british recognize these limitations and do their best to overcome them but when all is said and done it is probable that the educational possibilities of radio have been much exaggerated iv it is in respect of the everyday programmes that the american situation is at its worst whatever is done by way of education will reach only a fraction of the radio public and will fill only a minute part of radio time but on this wider issue the ground of criticism needs to be very carefully defined it is not that programmes are bad on the contrary many of the presentations both sustaining and commercial are very good and both are getting better the trouble arises on ground much more fundamental than that it springs directly from the commercialization of broadcasting itself and the consequences which flow therefrom the wholesale exploitation of sound in the various perversions of money getting is a far worse thing than the desecration of the countryside by billboards it is at once more intimate and more degrading the unctuous bleating of the high priests of salesmanship would be ethically less intolerable were it their own wares they were crying the fact that their voices like their machinery are for hire renders it a form of prostitution essentially akin to its older prototype the corporation that affronts you with its posters has not only no soul but no larynx there is at worst a saving impersonality about its impudence to become accustomed much more to become reconciled to the standards and practices of broadcast advertising is to connive at an irredeemable insult to human decency equally vicious is the conception of the public and of the industry s relation to the public to which its dominant aim gives rise what that conception is the utterances already quoted indicate it is sufficiently epitomized in the remark of one of the leaders that the public will not listen to anything for more than half an hour it is further illustrated if further illustration be necessary in a statement of almost cynical candor recently given out by the national broadcasting company s programme director the requirements of commercial programmes of course make it difficult to achieve perfect balance in commercial programmes the primary object is to bring to radio as many listeners as possible the kind of listeners that will most benefit the particular product which is being promoted the development of these programmes therefore is based almost entirely on this consideration and without particular regard to other programmes scheduled for the same evening the chief consideration is will this programme attract and interest the kind of people who will be influenced to buy the product not does this programme fit in well with other programmes which precede and follow it one cannot help wondering whether it is to this sort of thing that the magic acropolis the phrase is from a new york times headline planned by the radio corporation is to be dedicated within three years we are informed the rockefeller property between forty eighth and fifty first streets and fifth and sixth avenues is to become a citadel of radio housing broadcasting television and four great theatres a city sired by science mothered by art nursed by an economic foster mother and dedicated to a career of enlightenment and entertainment it will exist not only for its immediate trade territory but for all the world its voice will be multiplied a thousandfold this and other ecstatic prophecies issuing from the offices of the radio corporation are the more significant inasmuch as it is officially stated that the rockefeller interest will be simply that of landlord will the voice be the same sort of voice and the entertainment the same sort of entertainment that commercial broadcasting has hitherto sent over the much afflicted ether a ray of hope is perhaps to be discerned in the report that s l rothafel is to be the presiding genius of the institution it was roxy who startled the entertainment world a short while back by putting the ninth symphony of beethoven and strauss s heldenleben into his theatre programmes it is roxy who broadcasts the one weekly concert that is infallibly worth listening to but if roxy is the genuine enthusiast we take him for it is a safe prediction that he has a strenuous time coming to him for the conception of the public that necessarily arises from the commercialization of broadcasting is that of the mass and this conception so long as it is dominant is utterly fatal to cultural advance so long as it is dominant it would be too much to assert that there is no reality corresponding to this conception there is as pornography and war hysteria can always testify nor would one maintain that this mass is not entitled to its fair meed of distraction and entertainment if no more is done for it to that much at least it has a claim on its masters but where the thought of it and its demands dominates and colors all other activity civilization itself may ultimately be in peril the redemption of the mass cannot come except from minorities v there are two grounds of criticism which may be taken though the first is hardly relevant to american conditions it may be maintained it is maintained by some nations that the state has a tutelary responsibility toward its subjects that its duty extends beyond the mere safeguarding of the status quo to the positive encouragement of continually better standards of living that in short prosperity is not enough this is of course the idea behind religious establishment and to some extent the idea behind monarchy we see it carried to a dangerous extreme in the european dictatorships but perhaps the other extreme is no less dangerous perhaps the increasing demands that democracy makes not only upon the intelligence but upon the moral calibre of the citizen need for their accomplishment an increasing concern with his intellectual and cultural development but this is dangerous ground it is difficult to envisage an active concern with these matters on the part of government in america that should not involve a threat to freedom or an opening to venality it is not impossible however the brilliant work done by many departments of government in the field of applied science contrasts strongly with their neglect of the non economic values but a day may yet come when it will be realized that these latter are every whit as important to national life as the former how far off that day is may be gauged from the report of the wilbur committee the most definite step the committee felt it could advocate was that an effort be made to secure from interested persons or foundations an amount of money sufficient to bring to the microphone a high grade programme in certain formal school subjects and to check carefully the results obtained for the richest nation in the world there is something almost shameful in the spectacle of education thus going begging the second ground of criticism above referred to is likely to be the more fruitful in the circumstances it is simply that of the rights of minorities i make no complaint that the roads are increasingly occupied by the majority who prefer to travel in automobiles but if i am a member of the group that prefers to walk i claim that it should still be made possible for me to do so i may go so far as to suggest that walking is in itself sufficiently worth while for my group to receive a little more consideration than that which would be based solely on its numbers or its spending power in like manner i refuse to cavil at the quality of the radio programmes based on the mass standards of the advertisers and the broadcasting stations but i ask protection and service as a member of a group that desires something different this sounds unappreciative of such efforts as are now made by the broadcasters to serve minority interests it is far from being so intended the dilemma is that financial incentives which are in the long run necessarily final for commercial broadcasting do not permit of let alone encourage the kind or quantity of presentation that would be anything like fair to the group i claim to speak for the stock answer of the broadcasters is of course that they are in business like anyone else and must sell their service where there is a demand for it they have for years been fighting the idea of public utility status but in fact they are not in business like anyone else no less a person than mr hoover has repeatedly insisted that radio communication is not to be considered as merely a business carried on for private gain for public advertisement or for the entertainment of the curious it is a public concern impressed with the public trust the radio industry did not create and does not own the channels over which it operates it is merely licensed by government to use them their number is so limited as to constitute a natural monopoly and that monopoly is being fully exploited i maintain that mr hoover s public includes and has a place for me that of the advertisers has not in england this week in which i write i could obtain at least one full orchestral programme every night including whole evenings of bach beethoven wagner and modern work i could hear the mozart festival from salzburg and the vienna philharmonic under baumgartner i could listen to eugene o neill s ile to a first class debate on the international language question to various lecturers including dean mozley on christian theology and mr francis birrell on the cinema to two or three recitals of modern chamber music to a couple of revues complete to say nothing of dance music political addresses educational programmes news sports humorous features and the various local offerings a few years back orchestra in england was in a most critical impasse times being hard and the supply of millionaires inadequate broadcasting has not only set it on a firm and wide foundation it has given a better chance to young composers and young literati than they ever had before and all for a license payment of two dollars a year of which little over one half now suffices to support all broadcasting i do not have to be highbrow if i am not that sort of person though even if i am very lowbrow the chances are that curiosity will lead me to a growing interest in something a little better than claptrap but as a member of a not inconsiderable minority i can still get enjoyment from my radio set for some hours of every day and that is democracy where shall i find it in america there is no answer the state has abdicated there is no obvious reason why the advertisers that support broadcasting should also consider me the radio corporation has my money but does not need my vote i am tired of turning the dial
leo tolstoy was the fourth son of count nikolai tolstoy a russian nobleman whose family had been elevated and enriched during the reigns of peter i and catherine ii he knew little of his mother who died before he was two and not much more of his good natured but ineffectual father who died when leo was eight leo s golden age was spent with his three brothers dmitri sergei and nikolai on the huge family estate yasnaya polyana with its thousands of acres and hundreds of serfs but for the future novelist supersensitive vain foppish intensely passionate an indifferent student and a social misfit obsessed with an ideal of perfection that he could never approach the road to the palace of wisdom lay through the valley of excess he joined the army in time to command a battery in the heroic defense of sevastopol and in his spare lime during that action he began to write in a dugout the sketches that brought him immediate fame by ernest j simmons 28 on a december morning in 1855 the poet a a fet then an army officer on a furlough to petersburg called upon his good friend turgenev for a glass of tea and a chat in the hallway he noticed a short saber hanging on the wall and asked the dignified servant about it the man answered in a low voice that the saber belonged to count tolstoy a guest of his master for an hour fet and turgenev conversed in whispers in the latter s study for fear of waking the sleeping count in the next room he is like this all the time turgenev smilingly explained he has come from his battery at sevastopol is staying with me and has gone off on a tangent sprees gypsies and cards every night then he sleeps like the dead until two o clock in the day i tried to restrain him but i ve given it up now tolstoy finally sauntered in and was introduced fet remarked of the meeting from the first moment i noticed in young tolstoy an involuntary opposition to all commonly accepted opinion a hasty but shrewd judgment the petersburg literary group was curious about the mysterious l n t and eager to welcome him as one of them on the road to petersburg from sevastopol he had received a letter from turgenev who offered to go as far as tula to meet him and tolstoy accepted his generous invitation to stay at his apartment in the capital with such a sponsor as turgenev the leader of the capital s literary world he soon met all the important writers a harvard graduate trained in russian language and literature ernest j simmons is now head of the russian department at cornell he is also the author of the best biography of pushkin and a critical study of dostoyevsky five years ago on his hilltop in jaffrey new hampshire he began writing after extensive research in russia the biography of tolstoy a work which we believe is destined to be outstanding in its field in the 1850 s the petersburg literary set consisted of a group of self indulgent men whose concern for their own immortality did not prevent them from being interested in the vital social and political questions of the day it was a relatively small and provincial group and it moved in a masonic lodge atmosphere of half mystery and jealous devotion to literary ritual and comradeship their favorite publication was the contemporary and its editors n a nekrasov and i i panayev were the artful engineers of frequent literary gatherings in the interest of their magazine on such occasions the perennial hostess was panayev s wife the beautiful black eyed avdotya gossip had it that the co editors were also co husbands a form of george sandism common enough among russian liberals of the time nekrasov and panayev had been followers of belinski radical critic and leader of the westerners and they had turned the contemporary founded by pushkin and pletnyov into the most living literary review in russia and the rallying ground of all progressives with the accession of alexander ii the hope of reform filled the air and writers of the contemporary helped to spread liberal ideas there were however varying degrees of liberalism among them and sharp controversies had already broken out chernyshevski and dobrolyubov young radical contributors who had sprung from the people were beginning to attack the tired liberalism and non social literature of turgenev and the older aristocratic writers this was the group that the sublieutenant fresh from sevastopol took by storm at the end of 1855 tolstoy was perhaps too obviously conscious of the fact that he was the lion of the moment soon some of his admirers set him down as a cub and nearly all of them eventually felt his claws the day after his arrival he dined with nekrasov it was their first meeting although they had been corresponding for three years this hard living democratic poet clever gambler and astute publisher was much impressed by his young aristocratic author turgenev was delighted with his guest and wrote to the elegant critic p v annenkov who in a review of reminiscences of a billard marker had already included tolstoy among the immortals imagine for more than two weeks now tolstoy has been living with me and what i would not give to see you both together you cannot picture to yourself what a dear and remarkable man he is although i have nicknamed him the troglodyte because of his savage ardor and buffalo like obstinacy i have grown to love him with a strange feeling that is almost parental the troglodyte however would creep into the cave of his own mind and roar at the parental turgenev who although only ten years older insisted in watching over his guest like an old nurse as he expressed it at first tolstoy was pleased and flattered with all this attention at the hôtel napoléon he held an evening of his own for the contemporary set and introduced some gay gypsy entertainers to take the minds of these literary pundits off shop talk in his immaculate uniform he conducted himself with severe decorum at these gatherings it was as though he were acting according to a studied course of behavior with individuals he sometimes showed the temper of his mind but in large groups he remained mostly silent and observant he was coldly taking the measure of his admiring literary colleagues still in the army tolstoy had been detailed as an inspector in a petersburg munitions factory after a month in the city he obtained a brief leave to go to moscow for there another literary group was eager to honor him the stern moscow slavophils with their deeply rooted nationalist convictions detested the petersburg westerners and the progressive views of the contemporary set but their convictions a fashion word among intellectuals in russia then much as ideology has been in america irritated tolstoy so did the convictions of the petersburg literary group he thought that both sets were tilting at windmills the serious illness of his brother dmitri cut short tolstoy s pleasant visit in moscow he hurried to orël and found dmitri dying from consumption the appearance of his childhood playmate shocked him dmitri s enormous hands hung to the two bones of his arms and his wasted face seemed all eyes the same beautiful serious eyes as of old but now fixed on him with a continually questioning look pock marked masha the girl he had taken from a brothel tenderly watched over him tolstoy mentions in his diary that all the evil thoughts he used to have about dmitri crumbled into dust and he felt terribly depressed he stayed only two days and returned to petersburg by way of moscow there he learned that dmitri unloved member of the family had died on january 21 a naked reference to the fact is all that appears in the diary 29 back in the capital the lion began to show his claws by now he had a clear comprehension of the civil war that raged among the contemporary circle he saw that each side hailed his talent and hoped to get his allegiance but that both were afraid and jealous of him the aristocratic liberals were sure of him after all he was a count and they expected him to share their hate for chernyshevski and dobrolyubov the snake and rattlesnake turgenev dubbed them tolstoy called a plague on both their houses and did not hesitate to roar at either it came as a painful surprise that tolstoy should first direct his fire at the liberal aristocrats and most of all at their leader turgenev there has been much speculation over the quarrel of these two famous writers and not a little wonderment at their inability to form a firm friendship both were aristocrats and novelists who on the surface at least appeared to have a sincere appreciation of each other s ability but turgenev s conviction of disinterested love for utter truth annoyed tolstoy it was merely a phrase he believed coming from a flabby nature this giant of a man with his huge shoulders striking features and shock of prematurely graying hair strangely failed to impress discerning people like tolstoy who found in him a lack of spirituality he seemed capable of experiencing only physical feelings with persistent and deadly effect tolstoy began nagging turgenev on his political convictions men were really being hypocritical he declared when they flaunted their convictions convictions were simply invented by the intelligentsia in order to have something to talk about as for himself he would have asserted that he lived by instinct the rules that he compounded to guide his existence were suggested not by conviction but by moral instinct and moral instinct he could trust but only his own here was the quintessence of individualism tolstoy s involuntary opposition to all commonly accepted opinion was evident in literary as well as political and social questions he strove always for originality in discussion even shakespeare was sacrificed to this passion how sorry i am that you are late panayev declared to a friend who called on him just as tolstoy left what marvels you would have heard you would have learned that shakespeare is an ordinary writer and that our astonishment and delight over shakespeare are nothing more than a desire to keep up with others and the habit of repeating foreign opinion yes how curious the man simply does not wish to know any traditions either theoretical or historical the war was on tolstoy harried turgenev nor did he spare other members of the novelist s group he was invited to a dinner for the stall of the contemporary at nekrasov s when someone praised george sand s new novel he abruptly blurted out his hatred for this favorite french author and he shocked all present by declaring that if such women as george sand s heroines really existed then they ought to be bound to the hangman s cart and driven through the streets of petersburg for the general edification avdotya panayev the hostess whose worship of george sand was common knowledge preserved a pained silence in an instant the room was in an uproar but tolstoy maintained his point george sand s love of sheer animalism in man while disguising it with a cloak of poetry and aesthetic feeling disgusted him he considered her unable to distinguish good from evil turgenev appears once more to have borne the brunt of tolstoy s argumentative wrath for in his diary the next day tolstoy mentions that he has quarreled with turgenev turgenev struck back not very cleverly or successfully he was no match for tolstoy in an argument with an ironical expression on his face tolstoy would listen to his opponent piercing him with his penetrating glance his lips pressed together in an expression of concentration that suggested he was thinking up some devastating epigram or an answer that would perplex by its unexpectedness turgenev complained that his young rival never believed in people s sincerity and he confessed that tolstoy s inquisitorial look when accompanied by biting words goaded a man to fury the boiling over point was reached in a quarrel that the novelist and wit grigorovich humorously described to the poet fet again the unfortunate nekrasov s quarters were the locus you cannot imagine what a scene it was said grigorovich ach my god turgenev squeaked and squeaked holding his hand to his throat and with the eyes of a dying gazelle he whispered i can stand no more i have bronchitis and with huge strides he began pacing back and forth through three rooms we were all agitated and did not know what to say tolstoy in the middle room lay sulking on a morocco divan while turgenev spreading the tails of his short coat by placing his hands in his pockets continued to go back and forth through all three rooms to avert a catastrophe i went up to the divan and said my dear tolstoy do not agitate yourself you do not know how he esteems and loves you i will not permit him to do anything evil to me exclaimed tolstoy with dilated nostrils look how he keeps marching past me on purpose wagging his democratic haunches not only the democratic haunches of the contemporary s liberal aristocrats bothered tolstoy so did the radical haunches of chernyshevski and his followers he tolerated them for a brief time but he soon turned on them and their exiled oracle herzen who in distant london had highly praised childhood these liberals were preaching equality and reforms when he knew that many of them were devoted to swilling gambling and immorality the fact nauseated him his own private life was far from being exemplary but he was willing to admit the fact and he did not try to reform others 30 within a few months after his arrival in petersburg from sevastopol tolstoy had more or less deservedly won for himself in the contemporary circle the reputation of being a savage young man and he augmented this opinion by challenging m n longinov to a duel at a card party one evening a letter arrived for nekrasov from longinov a genial but not too reputable historian of literature and contributor to the contemporary busy with his hand nekrasov requested tolstoy to read the letter unfortunately it contained an aspersion on tolstoy s liberalism he read through to the end said nothing but went home and sent a challenge to longinov nekrasov learned of the matter and the next day pleaded with tolstoy to withdraw the challenge or he himself would have to shoot it out with longinov for the editor insisted on assuming full responsibility for the mess tolstoy remained adamant happily longinov settled the whole matter by the simple unorthodox procedure of not answering the challenge only three months later in the peaceful seclusion of yasnaya polyana did it suddenly occur to tolstoy how offensive his behavior had been and he at once wrote to nekrasov to ask his pardon and promised to do the same with longinov statements in the diaries and correspondence of the contemporary circle in 1856 indicate that their final judgment on tolstoy was a mixed one of bewilderment over his views and conduct and admiration for his talent they perceived in him an enormous literary and moral force and the several groups trying to influence opinion on the magazine were willing to overlook his prickly and independent nature if they could gain his support for a time he allowed himself to be swayed by the most conservative faction principally by druzhinin and somewhat by botkin and annenkov of the whole petersburg group at this time only the poet fet retained tolstoy s lasting friendship and perhaps it is significant that fet was the least literary of the circle and the most conservative years later in his confession tolstoy condemned these writers and their influence on him and yet admitted how proud he had been to be accepted by them his inability to get along was not merely a case of bad manners or of his irritating contradictory nature of which he was entirely conscious he tells in the diary how he disputed with the slavophil konstantin aksakov and the same day argued with a differently minded opponent from exactly the opposite point of view he was not being reactionary in turning his back on the contemporary s progressives for he really shared some of their advanced views but now as later his powerful individualism would not permit him to subordinate his views all must come from within himself it was both an aesthetic and an intellectual pride the thinker like the artist insisted upon originality the literary group did not monopolize tolstoy s time and his stay of six months in petersburg was a repetition of his feverish social life of some four years before he had acquired more poise and worldliness and his fame as an author had widened the circle of his acquaintances and made him a much desired guest in the homes of prominent families where he was occasionally persuaded to read his stories neither had his capacity for light entertainment diminished nor the stern conscience that censured his indulgence there are frequent clipped references to the city s grisettes particularly to an alexandra petrovna and alexandra zhukov who claimed a great deal of his attention apparently as a precaution for the future he sets himself the rule not to drink more than half a glass of vodka one glass of strong wine and one tumbler of light wine a few weeks later an entry relates how he and a friend went with two girls to an amusement park disgusting he writes girls stupid music girls an artificial nightingale girls heat cigarette smoke girls vodka cheese wild shrieks girls girls girls and the next day he underlines i make myself this rule forever never to enter a pub or a single brothel before the day was over another lapse obliged him that night to repeat in a postscript to this entry my foot will never never enter a public place except a concert or theatre among tolstoy s new friends at this time in the petersburg social world perhaps the one who remained closest to him and influenced him most in later life was his aunt actually a first cousin once removed countess alexandra andreyevna tolstoy eleven years his senior she was a maid of honor and governess in the family of grand duchess marie daughter of nicholas i a woman of remarkable tact and unusual gifts of heart and brain she occupied a position of consequence in the political and literary world of the capital their affection for each other deepened over the years and her strong intellect and love of truth inspired a trust and confidence in her judgment that tolstoy rarely accorded a reviewer had lyrically advised tolstoy in print not to write better but more he improved upon the advice and wrote both more and better during this brief period direct contact with literary admirers gave him a sense of great things expected of him with not a little pride he mentions in the diary and repeats in a letter to his brother sergei that the emperor read childhood to his wife and wept he had no doubts about his future career now and the praise of friends and rivals had banished uncertainty about his talents subjects for stories filled his mind and living material on the petersburg streets a constable settling an altercation or the character of a russian crowd listening to an orator he jotted down for future reference in december 1855 tolstoy finished sevastopol in august the first of his works to appear under his full name it was published in the january contemporary 1856 the inspired war correspondent of the two previous sevastopol sketches has disappeared in the third he is the storyteller transposing the stuff of life into art the didactic element and pathetic lyricism are absent living characters especially the kozeltsov brothers lend a touch of unity to a loosely constructed story in its leisurely panoramic method of narration in the manner in which plot is sacrificed to accumulating detail and in the studied objectivity one can detect the certain influence of thackeray whom tolstoy had been eagerly reading and deeply admiring over this period the three sevastopol pieces are clearly efforts in the direction of war and peace tolstoy s popularity with the reading public suggested the feasibility of publishing his collected works in book form even at this early stage in september 1856 his army tales appeared as a book and the next month childhood and boyhood they received very little notice and sold poorly the failure was perhaps partly due to the fact that the stories had already appeared in the contemporary something of the cool reception however must be attributed to the changing attitude of the liberal petersburg critics whom he had offended they were demanding works of political and social significance to meet the new progressive spirit of the age but tolstoy was not a writer to fall into an accepted groove he had to carve his own he wanted to try his hand at new forms and new subjects over this period he worked on at least four separate plans for dramas and in the diary he expressed his desire to strike out on new literary paths how i long to have done with magazines in order to write in the way i am now beginning to think about art awfully lofty and pure 31 as turgenev pointed out in a letter to druzhinin a landlord s morning conveys the unpleasant impression that all efforts of landowners to enlighten or improve the conditions of the peasantry lead to nothing the real moral of the work however is that so long as serfdom exists there is no possibility of the two sides drawing together despite the most disinterested endeavor to do so in march of this year the young alexander ii had made an historic address before the assembled nobles of moscow he warned them that the time would soon come when russia s serfs must be freed and he concluded with the famous statement that it would therefore be much better for it to come from above than from below while the government prepared its own program for abolishing serfdom the way was left open for individual owners to take action tolstoy decided to take such action he spared no effort to devise an acceptable scheme and when the project was drafted he went to yasnaya polyana to place it before the serfs yasnaya polyana seemed sad and out of harmony with his feelings a year of war had altered his opinions the man who had scorned the organized liberalism of the contemporary circle now observed in the diary in comparison with my former yasnaya recollections of myself i feel how much i have changed in the liberal sense even t a displeases me in 100 years you could not knock into her head the injustice of serfdom tolstoy had prepared his plan to free his serfs with care and business acumen the drafts notes and even the speech he wrote to introduce the project have been found among his papers and recently published all this material testifies to his excellent practical sense an attribute rarely ascribed to him a meeting of his 309 male serfs was called and he explained his plan of liberating them and at the same time selling them small parcels of land for a low fixed price to be paid over a long period of time tolstoy was well pleased with this first meeting and he felt that the peasants believed in him but he failed to take into consideration the innate hostility for the master that centuries of slavery had deeply rooted in the peasantry he kept a record the diary of a landowner of the meetings with his serfs and individual peasants this account clearly reveals their traditional fear of change and their inborn suspicion of a master bearing gifts finally they refused to agree to tolstoy s plan and they justified their refusal by seizing upon a wild rumor widely believed by the peasants that at the approaching coronation the young tsar would free the serfs and give them all the land and hence their master was scheming to forestall this blessing by obligating them to a prior contract the failure of his project was a keen disappointment at their request tolstoy tried to remedy the immediate condition of his serfs by releasing some of them from obligatory labor by substituting a fixed yearly payment not an unusual arrangement rather bitterly he told himself that the peasants did not want their freedom and in the diary he well summed up the relationship between him and his serfs two powerful men are joined with a sharp chain it hurts both of them and when one of them moves he involuntarily cuts the other and neither has room to work the behavior of the peasants in this whole matter alarmed tolstoy and he drafted an extraordinary letter of warning to his petersburg friend count d n bludov influential president of the department of laws he relates the outcome of his project and then goes on to add the despotism of the landowners has already engendered despotism in the peasants when they told me at the meeting that i should give them all the land outright and i said that i should be left without my shirt they laughed and it was impossible to blame them he concludes if within 6 months the serfs are not freed there will be a conflagration everything is ready for it treasonable hands are not lacking to light the fire of revolt and then the conflagration will spread everywhere tolstoy s prophecy of a revolution was right but his chronology was off by some sixty years the emancipation of the serfs took place five years after his letter and without any serious disturbances but the letter reveals tolstoy in a confused state of mind pulled this way and that by both liberal and conservative tendencies essentially his approach to the peasant question was a moral one he felt a moral not a political duty to give them their freedom and his lack of success at yasnaya polyana did not change his point of view in this respect yet at the time he could not aspire to the absolute moral position of his later years when he condemned all private property the letter to bludov shows him attempting to serve two ends to acquit himself of a moral duty by freeing the serfs and in a bourgeois fashion to protect himself economically by keeping his land without which the peasants would starve nor did he ever completely find his way out of this dilemma despite the moral absolutism of his later years flagrant village immorality intensified tolstoy s marked emotional instability at this time his debauched surroundings suggested a play free love that would involve he noted in the diary the perverted relations of a proprietress with her footman a brother with his sister and a father s natural son with the father s wife etc on his own part the petersburg grisettes that had tempted him were now displaced by willing village girls nor did the wives and daughters of his neighbors escape his attention in vain did he flagellate himself for his terrible lust and try desperately to control his sensual thoughts the remedy of marriage had already suggested itself to tolstoy his continual state of emotional excitation he felt was bad after all he was twentyeight and it was time to settle down from the age of fifteen he had clung to the idea of a happy family life with a wife whom he would love as no woman had ever been loved before he wanted to love and be loved while in petersburg he had written to aunt pelageya that he was thinking about marriage and would regard every eligible young lady he met from this point of view on november 28 he received his long awaited discharge from the army and he decided to gratify a wish that had been with him for some time to go abroad he left petersburg january 12 and after stops in moscow and warsaw he arrived in paris february 9 32 aristocratic russians like the english regarded a grand tour through the countries of western europe as a fitting climax to a young man s education tolstoy was a bit old for such a finishing touch he had come to paris not so much with the desire to learn from foreign travel as to escape to escape from the petersburg literary circle and from one of his periodic attacks of dissatisfaction with the lack of purpose in his life paris turned out to be more than an agreeable haven for the fugitive it was a veritable isle of the blest for a time at least all the charm and pleasures of the city were open to tolstoy without the foreigner s usual lonely introduction to them for here solicitous old nurse turgenev eagerly greeted his troglodyte and found suitable quarters where french sociability and conversation interspersed with jests and puns in a babel of languages cheered him at once at the typical pension table he found a philospher a spanish countess spangled with romantic adventures an opinionated american doctor an italian priest who declaimed the divine comedy a playwright with long hair and a female pianist who had composed the best polka in the world after dinner chairs and tables were pushed back for dancing on the dusty carpet and in the dark hallway furtive flirting went on aristocratic russian families in the city gladly opened their doors to tolstoy and touring cousins were happy to dine with him at the salon of his distant relatives the trubetskois he met a weird assortment of people from jesuits to unsuccessful revolutionists nor was he indifferent to the trubetskois daughter whose marriage soon took place and wrung from him a confession of sadness and envy he was also welcome at the lvovs until the jealous husband began to suspect his guest s attentions to his wife tolstoy was really interested in their niece the attractive princess ekaterina lvov interest blossomed into affection he noted in the diary that he was a fool not to marry her later when away from paris he even wrote to turgenev for his frank opinion of whether or not a proposal to the princess would be acceptable nothing came of the matter he was still unready to cross the threshold of love tolstoy was endlessly curious and tireless in his activities an italian and an english teacher were engaged to give him lessons he visited all the stock tourist places the museums the bourse fontainebleau and versailles he attended the theater diligently and enjoyed nearly all of it of the french dramatists he had harsh words only for one racine s drama and the like are europe s poetic wound thank god we have not got it and shall not have it the opera always a bastard art to tolstoy he enjoyed in paris almost against his will but the concerts threw him into ecstasies after a performance of beethoven s trio opus 70 he decided that the french play him like gods attending lectures of distinguished professors was more in fashion among tourists then than now and tolstoy went to the sorbonne and the college de france to hear talks on dramatic poetry the classics political economy and international law like byron with his women turgenev could not seem to live with tolstoy or live without him they saw each other frequently and tolstoy s opinion of his friend fluctuated from day to day at one moment he found him good but terribly weak then he was vain and shallow and a few days later he decided that turgenev does not believe in anything and does not love but wants to love upon saying farewell to him in paris however tolstoy confessed in the diary i wept i don t know why i am very fond of him he has made and is making a different man of me the period was a low one in the fortunes of turgenev he was ill and having difficulties with the great love of his life the famous singer pauline viardot garcia tolstoy thought that he exaggerated both complaints and was annoyed by his feminine querulousness and self pity after he had been in paris a short time he agreed to go with turgenev to dijon to help him get over his moral loneliness his illness and the feeling that his imaginative powers were failing in a letter to annenkov turgenev described the two of them at work in a little hotel room in dijon almost sitting on the hot coals to keep warm he looks on wistfully and laments that he has long since sucked his own lemon dry while tolstoy industriously scribbles page after page and with a sunset glow of artist s temperament he orders annenkov either to print the last manuscript he has sent him or consign it to a peaceful end in the watercloset they got along capitally together and tolstoy even admitted that he had misunderstood him in the past and generously granted his artistic superiority within five days this literary honeymoon ended tolstoy read the draft of a new tale to him and turgenev reacted coldly he decided categorically that turgenev has never loved anyone they quarreled once again and tolstoy left for paris in all their relations his esteem for turgenev as a great artist was patent in fact this feeling irritated him and he wished to free himself of it back in paris tolstoy once more applied himself wide eyed to monuments and cocottes he felt his lack of knowledge amid the culture and art of the french capital sergei arrived but tolstoy s sincere delight over the presence of his brother quickly vanished he now discovered that they had little in common nikolai with his artistic soul his charming hunting in the caucasus had just appeared in the contemporary understood him thoroughly sergei loved without understanding him somewhat to tolstoy s relief he soon left paris after almost two months of dizzy delightful playing tolstoy started a letter to botkin march 24 in which he enthusiastically declared that he could not foresee the time when this great city would lose interest for him he described the artistic pleasures he had enjoyed and the striking differences in french and russian life especially the social freedom of which i did not even have a comprehension in russia two months more at least he reported must be spent in this delectable place the next day tolstoy completed the letter but paris in the brief interval had taken on all the aspects of a sodom early that morning he had gone in the spirit of a tourist seeing the sights to witness the execution of a certain francis richeux who had killed and robbed two persons the scene shocked tolstoy s sensibilities the image of the guillotine haunted him a stout white robust neck and chest he jotted down in the diary he kissed the gospels and then death how senseless he had nightmares the glistening knife descended on him he awoke trembling and felt his neck for a cut the scene would not fade from his mind paris became hateful to tolstoy he did not stop to reason objectively that moscow or petersburg could present scenes of equal horror the fact is that his intensely impressionable nature revolted at any display of human cruelty his mind was keyed to the disharmony between absolute good and man made laws even to the extent that he was beginning to doubt the so called benefits of civilization now he could find no further charm in this city of refinement and culture and the day after the execution he notes in the diary suddenly a simple and sensible idea occurred to me to leave paris the following day he set out for geneva 33 tolstoy s reason for selecting geneva as a haven was the presence there of his cousin countess alexandra tolstoy she was traveling with the family of the grand duchess marie as an attendant upon her children the day after his arrival tolstoy called on his cousin at the luxurious villa bocage and vehemently poured out his disgust for paris he had almost gone out of his mind with the things he had seen nineteen of the thirty six couples in the apartment building where he had lived he charged were unmarried it had revolted him and then the execution had murdered his sleep so he had rushed headlong to his dear cousin feeling sure that she would save him happily granny so tolstoy humorously called the countess because he thought her too young for the usual russian appellation of aunt thoroughly understood her eccentric grandson his impressions she guessed were nearly always extreme but she was very fond of him and liked his modesty liveliness and kindly expressive eyes with her sharp intellect she had already recognized in him a kindred characteristic they were both terrible enthusiasts and analysers who loved goodness but did not know how to follow it properly soon they were on terms of intimate friendship and acted together like two youths off on a holiday frolic his visits were always welcome for both children and grownups unfailingly responded to his intense active personality tolstoy and the countess had long discussions with lancet in hand but always with mutual affection and respect for each other s views the subject was often religion in which they had no common ground for she was a serious and devoted believer and he was altogether uncertain of what he believed yet his sudden attendance at church and reading the bible at this time may have been somewhat inspired by her influence this woman who had remained unmarried by choice despite all her charm and high connections came close to fulfilling his idea of the wife whom he would love more than any woman had ever been loved i am so ready to fall in love that it is terrible he wrote in the diary if a were only ten years younger a fine nature she was young enough to be his granny but too old to be his wife tolstoy set out for turin on june 1 to join botkin and druzhinin they visited art galleries monasteries and roman ruins his literary friends accompanied him back to clarens walking part of the distance by way of st bernard alt hough he worried about consumption which ran in the family tolstoys energy seemed inexhaustible copious entries in the diary also indicate that little escaped his observing eye least of all pretty maids and waitresses whom he could not always forbear to pinch the good and bad impulses still waged their war within him and in the diary he repeatedly reminded himself that he must marry and find his own little corner and settle down a few days rest in clarens and tolstoy was off again at lucerne a curious incident occurred returning to the schweizerhof hotel at night he noticed a tiny man who stood outside and sang tyrolese songs to a guitar the balconies of the hotel were crowded with well to do tourists who enjoyed the singularly fine performance when the street singer begged for money however the guests turned away in silence he went off muttering to himself and the crowd ridiculed him tolstoy overtook the man and invited him back to this exclusive hotel for a drink the guests were shocked and the waiter and hall porter grew offensive over this breech of decorum tolstoy became furiously angry and scolded them all a few days later granny also arrived at lucerne she found tolstoy still excited and burning with indignation over the incident of the itinerant singer the affair made such a strong impression on him that it involuntarily communicated itself to others after he had told her of how he had ordered supper and champagne for the man she judiciously commented i scarcely think the guests or even the poor musician himself quite appreciated the irony of this action within a few days tolstoy called on granny and her party to read them lucerne the story of the humiliated singer had received the form of enduring art tolstoy remained in lucerne for a few more days spending much of his time with granny and amusing the grand duchess s children the youngsters were infinitely diverted by his antics and expressed wonderment at the number of cherries he could eat at a sitting so much had he endeared himself to them that they begged for his company when the grand duchess s party moved on by boat to küsnacht tolstoy was invited to go along and he pushed on further to zurich schaffhausen and friedrichshafen continuing to stuttgart and baden baden where he arrived july 12 34 a letter to auntie tatyana from lucerne had mentioned an extensive itinerary for the remainder of tolstoy s stay abroad holland london then back to paris rome naples and possibly a return to russia by way of constantinople and odessa this plan was gambled away at the roulette wheels of baden baden he ventured a few francs and lost the next morning he was back and played well into the night with indifferent success as in the caucasus and sevastopol the gambling fever gripped him the following day he lost everything borrowed two hundred francs and lost again he promised himself to play no more having already run through three thousand francs penniless tolstoy dispatched a telegram to nekrasov for money and wrote letters to sergei botkin turgenev and granny who at once sent him funds the good turgenev who was slaying at sinzig on the rhine at the time worried over his troglodyte and set out for baden baden the money that turgenev lent him however quickly went the way of the rest and tolstoy damned himself as a pig and goodfor nothing curiously enough it was also turgenev who lent dostoyevsky money at baden baden and like tolstoy dostoyevsky gambled the loan away this final loss convinced tolstoy of the necessity of leaving the city and returning to russia a letter from sergei strengthened his decision for he learned that their sister had finally broken with her husband because of his many infidelities marya declared that she did not care to be the chief sultana in his harem and left him tolstoy s first stop was at frankfurt where he met up again with granny distinguished guests were present when he visited she recalls the occasion i almost cried out in horror when the door opened and leo stood there in a more than incredible costume neither before nor after have i seen anything like it he was like a bandit not a gambler who had lost all his money obviously displeased that he did not find me alone he stayed a brief time and vanished when the guests learned that this singular personage was tolstoy they were disappointed at not being introduced and went into raptures over his literary talent tolstoy went on to dresden he visited the music and book shops and the art gallery where the sistine madonna moved him deeply at marienbad he met a group of russians among them the lvovs his interest in the pretty princess flared up again and it was with some reluctance that he left for berlin there he attended a concert but the street debauchery disgusted him the following day he took the boat at stettin and arrived in petersburg july 30 during this first tour abroad tolstoy worked on four pieces the cossacks far away field a projected novel on which he made only a beginning a short story albert and lucerne at the end of 1856 social and political questions had been much on his mind now he was concerned with the question of art art he felt must be based upon some moral truth that would go deeper than the convictions of the petersburg theorists and albert was designed to convey this belief the life of the talented but hopelessly drunken violinist kiesewetter whom he had met in moscow the previous winter provided the material for albert in a sense the story is a protest against society s inability to understand and protect real art and it was his first literary failure lucerne actually appeared before albert although written after and may be considered a variant of it tolstoy called it an article and packed into it all that the limitations of fiction prevented him from saying in albert the theme is the incident of the humiliated little singer before the schweizcrhof hotel and tolstoy wrote it in a few days in a white heat of indignation lucerne is his first moralistic tract here he develops ideas of the beauty of primitive art and its blending with nature and of the fixed opposition of nature morality and art to political laws organized government and civilization lucerne is a slight thing in the totality of tolstoy s vast literary creations but it is a highly important signpost because it points the direction of much of his future thought in truth these few months abroad coincide with an obvious step forward in the growth of tolstoy s historic mission his contact wit h the culture and civilization of western europe did not so much change as accelerate a consistent development in his thinking upon his arrival in paris he had prophetically observed in the diary that this trip must certainly mark an epoch in his life tremendous doubts about the meaning of life had only timidly knocked at the door of his mind now they boldly enter it and absorb his attention rebellious thoughts and feelings prompted by tolstoy s experiences in the caucasus and at sevastopol are affirmed in an uncompromising and dogmatic manner his experiences at sevastopol definitely marked the end of his career as a militarist and the beginning of that of pacifist not that he at once began preaching the beating of bayonets into plowshares even when he treated the subject of war in a more formal manner in war and peace he could not escape an attack of patriotism in writing about napoleon s invasion of russia at sevastopol his mind had been stored with a wealth of argument and his heart with a feeling of implacable hatred for war arguments and feeling emerged first in 1889 in a preface he was asked to contribute to a i ershov s recollections of sevastopol there in brief form he condemns the terrible bloodshed of the siege and points out its utter futility what is more frightful than the suffering mutilation and death of man s body he maintains is the mutilation and death that war brings to man s soul he went to the invalides to see the imposing sarcophagus of napoleon angrily he commented this deification of a malefactor is terrible soldiers are animals taught to bite everybody they ought to die of hunger legs torn off serves them right an entry in his notebook is less bitter is it worthwhile to dress a man in uniform separate him from his family and give him a drum to beat in order to make an animal of him there is much in the notebooks over this brief period abroad that shows a surprising advance in tolstoy s political social and moral views he condemns british imperialism and the shedding of blood for any political gain he hazards the guess that socialism is impossible and he asserts that the russian people are capable of living under a republican form of government the twenty nine year old thinker has already found the road that will lead him straight to this future epoch making revolt against the whole organization of modern civilization while he was abroad tolstoy s fresh reflections on art which were strikingly revealed in albert and lucerne had filled him with doubt concerning his future as a writer he realized that he had no sympathy with the current literary trend and at the same time he felt dissatisfied with his own efforts on february 4 1859 he was inducted into the moscow society of lovers of russian literature and he used the occasion to vent his wrath against contemporary literature the tendentiousness that had entered russian literature at about the time of gogol had by now swept all before it art was expected to indict political and social abuses or offer a progressive program of reform unfortunately the literary atmosphere became almost as muddled and disputatious as the political atmosphere in the nineteenth century but such a result was almost inevitable in a modern country still struggling with political feudalism and a nascent economic capitalism the time would come when tolstoy s own views on literature for the people would radically change but at the moment he had reached a point of despair and thought of giving up writing entirely stories such as lucerne and albert had fallen on barren soil at most he would sit in yasnaya polyana tend to the estate and write for himself not for publication to scribble stories is stupid and shameful he told fet in a burst of enthusiastic confidence when he learned that this poet was thinking of settling on an estate near him and making literature secondary to husbandry and to druzhinin he explained that if he were only tormented by ideas that aroused him by their boldness and audacity he would write but in the future he would not lift a finger to scribble pretty stories agreeable to read turgenev railed at tolstoy s new resolution what a man he wrote to a friend with perfect feet he is determined to walk on his head tolstoy however could not give up literature any more than he could cease his search for truth one was the essential medium for the expression of the other with assurance and insight granny wrote to him from abroad at this time when you have erred and sought for one thing and another without ever being satisfied you may perhaps attain truth your kind and unconsciously christian heart will steer you into harbors unknown to yourself i have no doubt of that before the end of 1859 he had already found a harbor a temporary but important one on his long voyage through life the idea that he had thought of abroad of starting a village school now took hold of him with peculiar force once before in that burst of youthful enthusiasm for bettering the lot of his peasants in 1847 he had unsuccessfully attempted to provide them with schooling now the idea took on new meaning since he saw in it a direct connection with his retreat from literature for whom did russian authors write for themselves and the cultured few for masses of illiterate russian peasants literature was useless if they could not read his writings then he would teach them this was the first and essential step towards the creation of a literature for the people here was a purpose that would satisfy his thirst for activity and moral influence 35 on a fine morning in early autumn 1859 a group of some twenty peasant children waited expectantly at the manor house door of yasnaya polyana the master had announced that a school would be opened and lessons given free all the youngsters were dressed for the occasion clean white shirts new bast shoes and unruly hair glistening and plastered down with oil suspicious parents stood around and talked in nervous subdued tones among themselves what was their strange unpredictable master up to now did he wish to teach their children and then hand them over to the tsar to be soldiers one cautious mother kept insisting that the lessons were free why ivan fokanov had been going to the sexton for lessons for three winters at two rubles a month and he had still not learned a thing it was said that the master would also lake grownups free and several parents signified their intention of attending the school suddenly a loud voice sounded from behind the door parents hurriedly admonished their children again to bow low and say i wish you health your excellency tolstoy appeared all bared heads and bowed to the ground good morning have you brought your children tolstoy asked turning to the parents just so your excellency they chorused with bows well i m very glad he said smiling and looking them all over his appearance did not accord with their notions of a teacher he was so plainly dressed his hair as long as theirs and his common face with its broad peasant nose was covered with a thick black beard like that of a gypsy with assurance he walked into the crowd of children and singled one out do you wish to learn yes what s your name danilka swiftly he questioned the others in similar fashion a smile on his lips and merriment in his eyes then he led them into the house up the stairway and through the huge living room scared wide eyed children noticed the lofty ceiling and the floor cleaner than the tables in their wretched little thatched huts numerous portraits on the walls at once caught their attention these figures looked so magnificent holy like the icons they saw in church several of the youngsters involuntarily started to cross themselves those are not gods but people my relatives and friends the teacher explained tolstoy shepherded them into a neighboring room that had been fitted up with benches and blackboards this was the schoolroom he announced regular lessons would begin on the morrow today he would just write a few letters of the alphabet on the board and they would try to learn them but first he questioned them a bit further about their work in the fields and their reasons for wanting to go to school he used humor kindliness and simplicity to banish timidity and win confidence soon they were repealing the letters ol the alphabet alter him their young voices rising to a fearless crescendo as he prompted louder louder in no time they were a happy excited group working together and following the teacher with rapt attention until the lesson ended now go home and god bless you tolstoy said come early tomorrow we ll have another lesson come i ll be waiting they left the school and said good bye to their dear teacher promising to come early on the morrow their rapture was boundless each told the other over and over again as though he had been the only one to notice it how the teacher appeared how he questioned them how he talked and how he had smiled work at the new school filled tolstoy with an energy that delighted some of his friends estate affairs became a bore pretty stories were scorned and even his precious diary was allowed to lapse in the excitement of proving in practice that all existing methods of education were necessarily wrong after six months of successful teaching tolstoy realized his lack of historical knowledge and decided to go abroad again to make a firsthand study of foreign pedagogical methods having placed his school in charge of a teacher who had been working under his direction he left petersburg and went first to berlin for nine months he visited schools in germany france and italy with side trips to geneva london and brussels he returned to russia with an immense amount of educational material which he was eager to digest and resumed his teaching tolstoy s retreat from literature and his hostile attitude towards contemporary radical reformers may have created psychological factors that insensibly helped to lead him into educational work but once fairly in it he embraced the enterprise with the same uncompromising spirit he had shown in his earlier attempts to serve the peasants his philosophy of education was based on freedom intellectual moral and physical on individualism and on experience with life education he declared was history and therefore had no final aim its only method was experience its only criterion freedom by september of 1862 however there were plenty of indications that tolstoy s zeal for his school was waning his absorbing experiment had fulfilled its purpose the school contributed as much to the historical development of tolstoy as it had to the education of peasant children it brought him back to his career of writing fiction it was as though a kind of catharsis had been effected that once again left his mind and spirit free for artistic work his literary stagnation had troubled tolstoy for he was first of all an artist in the full tide of enthusiasm for educational work he had complained of an acute dissatisfaction with himself his thoughts were in a chaos and he seemed to be getting nowhere the fundamental demand of his nature was the need to search to search for truth for the meaning of life for the ultimate aims of art for family happiness for god now at the age of thirty four he was about to achieve two of these goals family happiness and the very pinnacle of great art war and peace with this fourth installment we bring to a close our serialization of the first half of mr simmons s distinctive biography the latter half dealing with tolstoy s maturity will appear in the atlantic beginning in the summer of 1946 the editor
i according to our latest census there are one hundred and twenty two million inhabitants of the united states how many of this number are writers and would be writers it would be hard to say but they may be estimated thanks to mr r l duffus at about two hundred thousand two hundred thousand individuals engaged in trying to write books or fodder for the magazines poems plays or scenarios the ratio between what is written and what is published is generally speaking twenty to one twenty attempts to one acceptance i am glad to say that these odds neither deter writers from writing nor editors from reading what comes to them there is nothing melancholy in this ratio as mr duffus says in his quotable volume books their place in a democracy it would be a cause for rejoicing if a million americans were trying to write books first because people who try to write can be counted on to read second because out of a million manuscripts we could expect to sort out more good books than we do out of a fifth or a tenth or a twentieth of that number if florida real estate and wall street stocks remain at low ebb and if the talkies continue in the same raucous voice more people may be driven to write and to read american books the hope is certainly worth cherishing now the business of publishing in which for the sake of my argument i include the writing the submitting and the selecting of material to be printed is needlessly complicated the business is complicated first by a sense of mystery a manuscript is submitted and immediately there ensues a silence which grows the more mysterious as it is prolonged and which is seldom satisfactorily explained by the letters of decision that in nineteen cases out of twenty must be of polite rejection save for a few able and conscientious editors letter writing to day is a lost art and if publishers and writers must still trust their dearest hopes to the mail complications are bound to follow the business of publishing may be exposed to the vagaries of the post but it is even more dependent upon the question of taste and in this respect is more troublesome than any other business i can think of it is just as natural for a writer to believe in what he has written as it is for a publisher to rely upon the tests of his experience in their attitude toward an editor writers sometimes remind me of the american motorists and the traffic cop they are willing to acknowledge his authority so long as it does not apply to them personally when they are challenged the air becomes electric with antagonism editors like policemen are not unfailingly right walter page turned down david harum and chicago gunmen still do as they please but i do believe that editors are more right than wrong and that there are often reasons for their actions which if understood would make them more forgivable i am enough of a beginner to suffer the disappointments that come to an aspiring writer and i have been long enough in the publishing business to have no mere pontifical regard for editors so i should like if i am able to explain away some of the complications the mystery and the antagonism that surround a business in which the personal element is most important the sincerity of a writer is taken for granted that of a publisher is not infrequently questioned i know you editors never read all of your manuscripts a letter will say i am sending you my story even though i have been told you never accept unsolicited material writes another or more fantastic still i am submitting my article with faint hope since i am aware of your prejudice against catholic writers there was a woman who pasted together the latter pages of her manuscript in order to prove whether or not every word of her novel had been read there was a man who wrote me angrily declaring that his repeated rejections could only be explained by the fact that he was on the publishers black list and threatening to sue me if he was these are indications of a mistrust which turn an editor hot around the collar and which our association were certainly the better without now i should think it would be obvious that anyone engaged say in the potato business would have to make it his practice to weed out his assortment discarding the bad ones and caring not a whit whether the good were grown by greeks or nordics a publisher is in the self same fix and although his potatoes may not prove to be quite so small or tasty as the public wants you may be sure that their selection is as honorable and conscientious as he can make it with an optimism that is rewarded perhaps once in two hundred times a publisher steadfastly examines the chance manuscripts that come his way unsolicited material is generally disposed of rather more rapidly than that which has been solicited for the same reason that one does not have to eat the whole of an egg to know that it is bad but this is not to say that dogeared manuscripts which have evidently gone the rounds or handwritten papers which strain the eyesight are treated cynically don t think that there is a black list of rejected authors which circulates in editorial circles a publisher is an explorer by instinct and it gives him solid joy to discover merit in what he knows has been turned down by competitors uncle remus joel chandler harris s classic was rejected time and again because it was in dialect before it reached an editor with imagination enough to go against precedent trader horn was accepted after having been shown to at least three publishers i believe all quiet on the western front sold its half a million copies after its refusal by the first american publisher to whom it was offered and the press of which i am editor gave a five thousand dollar prize to a manuscript that had languished unrewarded for nine months in a rival house these are but conspicuous examples of what is happening daily in the business of publishing can it be said that editors are callous to the unknown or downtrodden writer and keen though the pleasure may be of scoring a success off an opponent there is i promise you a still greater satisfaction that comes occasionally to a publisher the satisfaction of detecting talent hid in a napkin and then by the exercise of the best of his ability of encouraging this talent to its fullest expression perhaps even to the point of genius remember page s excited trip to the south when mary johnston s first manuscript wandered into his hands remember kipling s dedication to f n doubleday who both personally and professionally had encouraged him from the first recall the great service of mr brownell in the developing art of mrs wharton read in their published correspondence how edward garnett a reader for a london publisher strengthened and helped to develop the inexperienced conrad between these authors and editors the business of publishing was no mere matter of contracts and royalty statements theirs was a friendship founded on mutual respect and strengthened by the give and take the criticism and appraisal which every writer needs this is publishing at its best ii i have given you my word that all manuscripts that come to a publishing house are examined and so they are it is i take it generally understood that they are first read not by the editor in chief but by the professional manuscript reader a person whose identity is usually concealed behind that cryptic signature the editors do not suppose however that this anonymity is a cloak for inexperience a trustworthy reader is as indispensable to a publishing house as the magnetism and executive ability of the editor george meredith the novelist was a manuscript reader for many years so was edward garnett the friend of conrad willa cather read fiction for s s mcclure in his heyday e v lucas read manuscripts for methuen frank swinnerton is a reader today because most of you have tried and will continue to try your cases before such judges as these it might be fitting for me to give you mr swinnerton s qualification of this superior court of letters the professional reader s task he writes is very different from that of a reviewer and much less simple the publisher s reader must have no vagaries his prejudices must all be sunk when he takes up a manuscript he must combine enthusiasm with calm caution with boldness he must be patient wary shrewd he must know something upon every subject he must be acquainted with all literatures and preferably with several languages he must understand the book trade must have a very easy familiarity with the work of all living authors he is expected to mark down a bestseller at sight and to distinguish between work that is immature through excess of genius and work that is crude through congenital incapacity taste experience and a subtle enjoyment of drudgery for the sake of its occasional rewards purely spiritual since he rarely experiences gratitude go to form the publisher s reader such readers have known the best when they saw it so much is easy to the real critic they have known or thought they knew a best seller when they saw it that is not so easy even to the born publisher and they have known and backed with their recommendation and encouragement every variety of literary promise and this is the greatest service which they could possibly render either to the publisher or to the cause of modern literature such service could only be given by minds trained patient and extraordinarily perceptive it calls for a special sort of courage possessed by few men mr swinnerton is obviously talking about the best in the business readers to give you further examples like the late ripley hitchcock of appleton s who accepted david harum and by cutting it one third shaped it into the fine book it was intended to be like ferris greenslet now editor of houghton mifflin who visited henry adams periodically for twelve years and in the end persuaded him to have published that famous volume the education of henry adams it is an editor s duty to cut when necessary to call forward and to inspire when a writer s initiative is low and in time of stress to suggest that very title which will give a fillip to the whole remember michael angelo s fine saying the more the marble wastes the more the statue grows remember the lady who complimented a bishop on his sermon but added that she thought it was a bit too long madam i did not have time to make it shorter we are all of us addicted to long windedness and it usually takes our wives or some other patient first reader to tell us so i have known of autobiographical notes which ran to nearly eight hundred thousand words but which were breathed on by a capable editor and came out a readable book of one eighth the size i have known where small omissions amounting in all to but three thousand words were a means of shifting sentimentality into true feeling have patience with the editor if he wants you to leave out things he is probably right or let us suppose that a good title is missing i can instance a popular novel published this summer for which the editor supplied the title before the book was a third written the phrase capped the situation admirably and so clarified the design that it was the easier to write i think of the titles in the atlantic monthly and in harper s as being happy choices how many of them have been supplied by the editors they would not allow me to say as for the stimulus mental and material which it is an editor s duty to supply i shall have much to say about that later iii it requires modesty or rather the lack of it to say that i have served an apprenticeship in the company i have just mentioned yet in eight years reading guided as i have been by two sage sets of initials e s and f c i have gathered some random and i hope practical suggestions which may be of use to you i shall begin with the magazine field i presume that you all have a general knowledge of the market to make this specific i have known writers who kept a loose leaf notebook in which on separate sheets they set down the requirements of the magazine which they might hope to fill the names of the editors with whom they have corresponded and the probable price they would receive for a paper of a given length then below these terms they would list the success or failure of their respective manuscripts if such a record infuriates you you can always burn it and begin a fresh one in studying a magazine s menu many writers are tempted to submit material on a subject which has lately been given space and discussion now unless the topic is red hot the editor will be disinclined to revert to it thus you will save yourselves time and energy by writing him not an article but a letter stating your immediate reactions to the subject in question touching of course on those aspects to which you believe the other writer has not done full justice if your letter has vigor and persuasion you may very well be commissioned to write a more formal reply for the magazine in other respects make your letters to the editor as brief as possible it may help if you tell why you think you are qualified to write the paper you are submitting but it won t help to say that you are offering it to him at the usual rates for obviously it is not to his advantage to skin you an editor must pay you fairly if he is to continue to receive your work if it is iiction or verse that you are contributing don t in heaven s name crowd your envelope two stories or three poems should be the limit at any one time and they should be selected if possible with a difference so as to serve as a foil to each other a man i know used to submit his sketches to life in series of threes one of them being a drudge which had been turned down before but which by its vaguely familiar contours seemed to sharpen the quality of the others in submitting book material which incidentally it is obligatory to have typed it is not necessary to fret yourself about the copyright which the publisher will arrange for in the event of acceptance state if you please that you would like to reserve the dramatic and motionpicture rights most publishers will be glad to let you handle them these eventualities will take care of themselves when the time comes more important at the outset is the physical well being of the manuscript itself a book manuscript will be convenient to read if it is packed in the box that contained the typewriting paper and if the chapters are separately clipped and then divided into either two or three sections each section bound in a paper cover pages are apt to be torn from loose leaf holders or from giant clasps above all abhor that springback contraption which only jack dempsey could hold open for ten minutes at a time a book publisher is entitled to six weeks for his consideration that time is short enough if several readings are necessary plan for this interval in specifying your return address and don t send follow up letters unless your nerves can t stand the strain finally and above all keep a carbon copy in case of accident a publisher cannot be held accountable if your material is lost en route your methods of work will be designed by yourself and primarily for speed and facility and anything i may have to offer should be subject to discard if it does not fit easily into your scheme speed is of utmost importance since a good mind in motion will always travel faster than a pencil or typewriter personally i prefer a soft pencil with a sharp point and in writing i keep open a wide margin to the left of my page so that when my mind begins to skip ahead i can jot down phrases which will give me the idea for the paragraph or the dialogue when my laboring pencil at last catches up with the procession some people can use the typewriter direct as they compose i envy their speed but not often their style which in most cases seems prolific and in need of hand picking on the other hand i would urge college graduates of composition courses to shun the wordsplitting and critical analysis which is apt to impede their action to shun these refinements until they have set down the bulk of their ideas not until then is the time to fuss pope who puts things neater than most capped this situation when he drew from his own experience the line compose with fury and correct with phlegm dean briggs used to advise that when you were on the track of a good subject it was well to run after it as long as you could keep your eyes alert this paradoxically enough applies most specifically to those waiters who have other things to do a writer at liberty will school himself to write for about the same span of time each day but for the many who are writing outside their other responsibilities it is expedient to force an expanding idea for all that it s worth even at the expense of a sleepless night sleep you can always make up but a good solid start is imperative in a short story essay or article so that as one reads it after an interval one irresistibly acquires the momentum to finish it writing is at its lowest point of attraction when one must go back to an unfinished manuscript which seems to have lost all possibility of motion finally i suppose there is no greater means of facility than that of keeping a notebook with you to stuff with those thoughts and observations and wise cracks which come from heaven knows where and which will disappear quickly if they are not jotted down this flotsam and jetsam of the mind is often of immense value once you can acquire the habit of salvaging it you will be the richer sinclair lewis i believe keeps voluminous notebooks the author of the cloister and the hearth put such store in the practice that he willed his collection of notes to the british museum for the guidance of future english authors read katherine mansfield s journals and samuel butler s notebooks if you want to see the close interplay of random ideas and creative art iv these are elementary concerns more subtle is the problem of revision now an editor would prefer to write a letter of frank criticism rather than of polite evasion were it not that the first course is apt to get him into trouble if a book has seriously interested a reader he will probably take notes about it and if there proves to be a disappointing conclusion these notes may show where and why the story has gone off the track should these be embodied in the letter of rejection an editor knows that in eight cases out of ten a book revised by the author at his suggestion is apt to be returned the worse for the effort still he remembers the exception when the improvement brought national success and there is a third factor the time and industry which are represented in the writer s work and out of respect for which something more than a noncommittal reply is due under these circumstances i think the rejection should be as specific as the interest warrants if the editor holds little hope for the manuscript he need only mention the main objections to it if on the other hand he believes that it might be successfully altered he should be specific even to chapter and page the writer must understand that he is undertaking a revision with no definite assurance of acceptance yet even so i think he will be glad for the counsel beginning writers especially it seems to me are hard put to it for impartial and experienced advice you may think i am implying a sense of infallibility on the part of the editor which i do not intend i have already cited instances of mistaken judgment such as you yourselves may have suffered but my point is that where one publisher misses the promise in a manuscript another will be almost sure to detect it in any case as between author s agents publisher s readers and enthusiastic friends i would take the publisher s word as the most impartial a good agent is as helpful as a good editor but a great deal rarer it should be his business to criticize your work to place it to the best advantage and to act as a friendly go between in the matter of payment he should also reserve the right to reject what he considers as your inferior writing a bad agent is apt to charge you a fee at the outset accept your manuscripts without discrimination relay them to editors in the same thoughtless fashion and so lead you on to false hopes i have been told of an agent who refused a new client on the grounds that she had on her list as many writers as she could properly attend to we need more of that sort for writers of magazine fiction and especially for those living at a distance from the publishing centres an agent is often desirable for writers of essays and articles for writers of books the need is not so evident in the case of established writers the agent may even prove to be obnoxious the practice of shopping around for the high price can become downright reprehensible when applied to books it threatens the loyalty between an author and his publisher and it introduces the unscrupulous element of bribery there is no doubt that publishers who would be classified as lily white by the carnegie foundation occasionally have dirty work done for them by agents let us suppose for instance that an author has been disappointed at the sale and reception of his latest book he distrusts the advertising appropriation he suspects that the sales force are asleep on their feet he is not likely to infer that the book is inferior to his best which of course is often the brutal truth in this melancholy he is approached by an agent who commiserates with him and so gradually turns the conversation in the direction of another publisher who he intimates will be glad to offer the writer a larger advance than he has ever received and a royalty as good or perhaps a shade better than his present rate provided of course that he gives them the option on his next three books unless the author is wary he may be seduced at this point forgetting that one of his next three books may so far exceed his others in its success as to entitle him to a royalty quite other than that which is offered it is no exaggeration to say that every author of prominence has heard the siren s call in some such fashion as this some of them change publishers for the sake of being attached to a more secure and dignified firm some are frankly attracted by the size of the bribe most of them i am glad to say communicate the terms of the offer to their publisher and stand pat barrie and galsworthy with scribners kipling and conrad with doubleday page that was mark twain with harpers anne douglas sedgwick and sabatini with houghton mifflin e phillips oppenheim and jeffery farnol with little brown a edward newton and mazo de la roche with the atlantic monthly press joseph lincoln with appleton hergesheimer with alfred knopf here are associations which have endured despite all temptations and with benefit i feel certain as much to the writer as to the publisher generally speaking to see an author leave a firm which has been identified with his early and middle years is to witness a breach of faith there is very little real occasion for divorce in publishing but a writer may protest granting that the association between an editor and myself is a personal one what is to happen when that member of the publishing house who has had most to do with my work leaves the organization to take a new post or to set up a firm of his own where does my loyalty begin and end to answer this query no single generalization will serve publishing houses are continually undergoing changes for instance the original firm of doubleday page and company had as its magnets f n doubleday and walter page not many years after ambassador page s death his heir in the business arthur page withdrew from publishing the doubledays father and son then acquired a new partner in the person of george doran who had already established a large firm of his own mr doran took with him into the new combination of doubleday doran his authors and his assistants among the latter john farrar and stanley rinehart two able young men who shortly resigned and began publishing under their own names farrar and rinehart rightly it seemed to me retained their hold on certain authors with whose work they had been closely identified and presently mr doran seeing the beckoning finger of william randolph hearst also resigned from the combination to devote himself to mr hearst s book interests now what is to be mr doran s attitude toward authors will he try to recapture the allegiance of his former authors will he go gunning for those affiliated with other publishers or will he devote himself wholly to new talent only the latter course will go unchallenged we all know that an author s first books may not be profitable conrad s early volumes were published at a loss and at the outset hardy s novels had a costly reception but a publisher worth his salt is not going to allow an author in whom he has confidence to remain static and his books a loss if he can possibly help it you may be sure that over a space of years a publisher will invest in an author in a better than even proportion to the response which his writing has invoked once a writer begins to make headway more sail and still more sail will be crowded on certain it is that a publisher will build more steadily for a loyal writer than for one who is ever in the market for the highest bidder by loyalty of course i do not mean obeisance he who waits to be appreciated may end by receiving charity most of us must impose our own valuation in this life and in publishing as in any other business there are occasions when one is justified in asking for a raise should other offers come your way quote them candidly to your publisher for they will tend to increase your value in his eyes and if other circumstances are favorable up may go your royalty rate i shall go into this matter in more detail for the present i want to convince you that if you will allow yourselves the loyalty candor and forbearance that are indispensable in any intimacy you will in the long run receive from your publisher more favorable treatment and a better royalty return than could be got by any amount of contract jumping and poker playing as witness let me give you one sorry illustration let us say that it is a poor season and that i a publisher have had a disappointing list now i learn that i can secure the next book by the famous author of thundering mudpuddles if i will pay a preposterous advance and the maximum royalty i need a feature and i do so the author receives my guaranteed advance it is true but so much has this cost me that unless the book responds to its first advertising i am tempted to stop the campaign short rather than throw good money after what is already lost in which case the sales will be short i shall be out of pocket and the author of thundering mudpuddles will be looking for some other fish to hook v we have you may observe moved definitely into the field of the accepted writer to press home some of the points of my charge let me quote the ten commandments for authors compiled by a philadelphia publisher mr gordon dorrance they are irrespective of sex 1 don t starve to death if you can t write work read martin eden 2 don t show your work to friends show it to enemies they ll criticize it 3 don t tell everyone you re writing a book get it accepted 4 don t write long handwritten letters about your ms use a typewriter be brief 5 don t send an arabian nights to a bible publisher know your market 6 don t submit your fall novel november 15 and expect the publisher to have it in the stores by christmas he won t 7 don t use a pen name your publisher does n t 8 don t criticize first and inquire afterwards information is understanding 9 don t bother the bookseller he has one show window and 10 000 new books every year to put in it 10 don t change publishers old friends are best but it is not my purpose to leave you with a mouthful of don ts anyone who writes anyone who tries to support himself on the perilous crutch of literature will know that what american writers need most is encouragement not prohibitions the lot of a writer in america to day wants protesting as a people we are fairly literate fairly generous and exceedingly prosperous this being so it is the more to be resented that the bonuses of our civilization should go to movie actors real estate promoters and automobile manufacturers to people who sit in trees croon songs or win a dance marathon but seldom or never to one who writes a good book the membership of the authors league is about two thousand and of course not all of them are authors of books at most says mr duffus there are probably not more than five thousand professional authors in the country of whom a great many are not making a living out of their writing and of whom only a handful are making a living out of books alone if an author can make a place for himself in the magazines if he has the voice and temerity for the lecture platform if he can be persuaded to give radio talks or if he can make a lucky strike with the movies or the stage then and then only can he afford to write books if he has given those hostages to fortune which bacon never gave a wife and children he simply must diversify his talent in order to make up his budget save for a few exceptional cases the writing of books alone would not be enough to pay his bills on this score figures speak louder than words let us start with a new writer i should say that twenty five hundred copies is a slightly better than average sale for a first novel on such a sale the publisher is lucky if he breaks even the beginning author conventionally receives a 10 per cent royalty thus if his first novel priced at 2 00 is slightly better than average he stands to make 500 if that is the result of a year s work he will not trouble the income tax collector i fancy however that most first novels are written by people who have contrived to spare the time from some other form of occupation next we have the established writer his early books have created a moderate reputation and a certain public we will say that his book achieves a sale of 15 000 copies and that he rates a 15 per cent royalty if his volume is priced at 2 50 he will receive a royalty of 37½ cents a copy or a total of 5625 gross income for his book year if his hostages to fortune and his bread and butter cost him no more than this he will not be in debt finally there is the best seller whose books usually fiction mount to 50 000 or 100 000 copies his royalty will probably begin at 15 per cent and move up a peg or two in proportion to the sales for such a writer 20 000 would be a generous book income last year 8927 new titles were issued in the united states of that total it has been estimated that not more than thirtytwo reached a 50 000 sale thirty two prosperous volumes out of a total of nearly 9000 and we all know that a best selling author is now in now out of favor all of this simply means that your experienced writer will try to keep several pots boiling the talkies are said to be the reason why movie producers are no longer paying large sums for the life of christ papini you remember was supposed to have received 50 000 for his or for an american tragedy of our day while to dramatize a novel requires a very skilled hand indeed the fiction magazines and the newspaper syndicates the first and second serial rights as you might say are however temptingly attractive the high price fiction magazines pay very handsomely 10 000 is by no means their top figure for a full length serial i doubt for instance if it would buy more than six chapters of temple bailey what is more the magazines would seem to illuminate a writer s name almost as brightly as the electric signs of broadway so they do but as a magazine writer not as a book writer those fat checks which one has to write for occasionally between books when the bank balance is low have a way of becoming the sole objective and when that happens they must usually take the place of book royalties for only the few and best contributors to the big fiction periodicals command respect and success in the book trade what you gain from the magazines you are apt to sacrifice from your books in short i believe that the american fiction magazines have injured rather than improved the standing of our books they have cultivated the habit of short rather than long reading they have so appropriated the short story to themselves that a serious volume of such fiction can hardly be sold across the counter they have helped to create a prejudice against collected papers which has really hit the essayist and what is worst it seems to me they have lured authors on to the writing of bright happy facile fiction as brittle as it is sentimental there are perhaps fifteen writers in this country who earn from all sources though seldom the major share from their books an income of 50 000 a year or more several of them must be known to you and i hope i imply no snobbishness when i say that their work is more often respected for its craftsmanship than for its literary genius this is not meant for a blanket indictment i know that there are discriminating authors who contribute intelligently to the magazines and who retain their independence to the point of writing honest and ambitious books i believe that the best and most conscientious writers are justified in receiving as handsome sums as can be obtained from such sources i wish some of it came my way but i am also aware of a good many names which flashed brilliantly at the outset and then faded into a kind of dull adornment to those vapid girls whose faces cover our news stands we have more than our share of roadside casualties in american letters vi of course the truth is that some kind of compromise has got to be made by writers though these are days of material prosperity one still must make an oblique approach to the profession of letters and can only afford to write books when as virginia woolf says one has a little money and a room of one s own only young men can afford to retire and they are usually so young that they have little to write about meantime the rest of us plod on working at any one of a hundred jobs and on the side scrimping from week ends holidays and our night s sleep the precious time for our writing sinclair lewis tapping out his first novels by night after spending his day as publicity man for a new york publisher christopher morley as a literary advisor

scribendi the scribbling mania one thinks writes james norman hall of men some of them rich in worldly possessions and therefore under no compulsion to write others wretchedly poor some of remarkable and varied gifts some with talents pathetically meagre but all of them having this in common that they spent their lives in obscure and solitary literary toil without once hearing a heartening shout of public acclaim there are other ways of course of getting over a stone wall than by merely butting it with your head if your fiction does not come off well enough even to satisfy your wife who is generally tolerant in such matters it might be worth while to try your hand at some other medium children s stories perhaps or the essay i would urge every beginning writer to read that anonymous essay in harper s magazine entitled the fight for glory in which a successful writer whom i presume to be gamaliel bradford recounts the failures which he suffered before finding his feet at last i wish to quote from this tale of woe my first efforts and for some years my only efforts were in poetry i wrote long poems and short poems light poems and heavy poems grave poems and gay the odd thing was that i wrote for myself and made little attempt at publication when i did timidly begin to send out one or two the receipt of the deadly printed slip of rejection froze my courage so entirely that i put my verses back in my drawer and abandoned the attempt even to day those printed slips which still come give me the same feeling of numbing paralyzing irritation which they gave me then carry with them the desolating inference that i had better be selling patent medicines than dabbling in literature i shortly turned from poetry to novels poured all my passionate aspiration literary and other into an autobiographical romance no publisher would look at it probably it was as well for me that they did not but the total and blighting rejection was just as disheartening for all that i wrote a novel dealing with a young and earnest minister s loss of belief for in those days religion was still a power in the world just as i finished it mrs ward s robert elsmere appeared and though i had never heard of it it made my book seem a palpable and futile imitation i then wrote three other novels which got published somehow the first paid its way and had a little notice the others died before they were born and after that the publishers would pay no attention to me my unconquerable obstinacy refused to yield even so and i tried more novels i still try to dispose of one occasionally to some innocent publisher who asks me for some of my productions i was even foolish enough to waste my energy for years in the most hopeless and gigantic undertaking that can delude any author the one that fooled henry james out of some of the best hours of his life the theatre i have in my drawer some fifteen plays only one of which ever struggled into print at my own expense while not one of them has ever come within speaking distance of the stage for to me the fascination of such work is simply irresistible and at last though in a field different from any of these there came encouragement acceptance and demand literature is a hard road with many turnings any one of which if patiently pursued may bring you to a wellspring of your own the toil and tribulation of making your solitary way has never been better described than by arthur machen to whom as to many another recognition came bitterly late in his reminiscences far off things he said no the only course is to go on stumbling and struggling and blundering like a man lost in a dense thicket on a dark night a thicket i say of rebounding boughs that punish with the sting of a whiplash of thorns that savagely lacerate the flesh it is the flesh of the heart alas that they tear of sharp rocks of agony and black pools of despair such is the obscure wood of the literary life such at least it was to me you struggle to find your way but again and again you ask yourself whether for you there is any way you think you have hit upon the lucky track at last and lo before your feet is the black pit and such is not alone the adventure of little ineffectual struggling men how old was glorious cervantes now serene forever amongst the immortals when he found his way to that village of la mancha fifty i think or almost fifty and he had been striving for years to write plays and poetry and short stories of passion and sentiment and it was only the roar of applause that thundered up from the world when the knight and the squire were seen riding over the hill that convinced cervantes that at last he had discovered his true path if indeed he were ever convinced of the magnitude and majesty of the achievement of don quixote and if these things are done with the great what will be done with the little if the clear voiced leaders of the everlasting choir are to suffer so and agonize what of miserable little welshmen stammering and stuttering by the wandle in the obscure rectory among the hills in waste places by shepherd s bush in gloomy great russell street where the ghosts of dead disappointed authors go sighing to and fro for the fate of the little literary man there is no articulate speech that is sufficient one must fall back upon aoi or oimoi or alas or some such vague lament of unutterable woe this is bad enough in a country as literate and as devoted to its literature as england in the united states the writer s lot is further complicated by an indifference on the part of the public who are too intent upon their golf radios movies and beauty contests to care much what is in a book by a commercial prosperity which holds out enticing rewards if only the writer will compromise himself utterly in advertising in the fiction magazines or in hollywood and worse by a prevailing opinion even among the writer s acquaintances that any man who walks by himself and who obviously makes no money by it must be a little cracked some of you will perhaps receive no greater reward than what i can only describe as the thrill that comes to you immediately a piece of writing has been finished to your satisfaction a few of you driven forward by a spirit strengthened by adversity and oblivious of the fleshpots of egypt may see the promised land and make your voices heard above the syncopated clamor come what may be true to yourselves
i russia is an odd country to visit odd from the very moment when the traveler decides to visit it for russians are quite as suspicious of outsiders as outsiders are of them and if the traveler wishes to enter the country as a normal visitor he will find that the filling up of an application for a normal passport involves a revelation of his past which may or may not bear revealing and that he is at once on the defensive and regarded as an international spy or at best as an over inquisitive and unwelcome nosey parker but a tourist visa is a far simpler matter since for reasons connected with economics and remote from politics russian policy to day is to encourage tourists only says the soviet no tourist visa unless you take our tourist excursions it is maybe polite blackmail there is no private enterprise in russia and the soviet manages its own tourist trade and makes state revenue out of tourists but there is no alternative and i was one among four hundred other inquisitives on a baltic cruise who accepted the soviet terms all of us got in save three unfortunate parsons who were described on their passports as ministers of religion ministers are highly political in russia and religion is taboo three other clerics were wiser in their generation clerks work in offices what holy orders conveys to a russian goodness only knows anyhow the three clerks in holy orders sailed in and i with them once ashore i might have been back in a war time atmosphere of red tape and regulations at the same time i might have been back at school but it was a bolshevist dames school for the official guides in russia are all women girls of the university type with a leavening of matrons and their guide curriculum for the education of tourists follows with tense concentration the school syllabus laid down by the soviet government in leningrad i came under the wing of a pleasant plump middle aged lady who had had a pre war education in england and whose family had been rich under the old régime in her altered circumstances she was first of all a housewife and secondly a politician but in moscow my guide was too young to have clear memories of tsarism and had grown up entirely as a bolshevik of the new régime both were extremely pleasant extremely forthcoming and extremely efficient both spoke english fluently and their different outlooks gave me a wider view for in leningrad i listened to lowbrow domestic details in moscow conversation was on a highbrow political level it was a good combination mrs leningrad had a husband two children and one servant they all lived in four rooms in a house which had once belonged to a court chamberlain they had not chosen it she told us and their quarters were most inconvenient but in russia man proposes and the state disposes the house hunter applies to the local commissar with details of his salary and of his family and the state must produce something but he must accept what is produced the rent is according to his salary and the number of rooms according to the number and the ages of his family mrs leningrad asked us whether foreigners like ourselves could still move easily here she said it is terribly difficult in fact if a family is not comfortable the only way to secure a change is to have another baby after which one can return to the commissar to fill up a new form her husband worked as a state doctor and she as an official tourist guide and dressmaker and they could just afford a servant at twelve dollars a month with an extra dollar paid by mrs leningrad for health and unemployment insurance domestics surprisingly can go on pension at the age of forty five but when we hinted at sympathy with her altered circumstances mrs leningrad was not at all sorry for herself oh no she said even if there were luxuries none of us would want them we get all we need from the state and everybody works except the ill and the superannuated and as for money according to the way we live now we need next to none as the little we want to buy can be bought with next to none nor has anyone to save indeed it is illegal to hoard there are state pensions for everyone and after all savings are only for one s old age money indeed can be dangerous in russia one of my tourist companions had been asked to bring a hundred and fifty dollars to a russian living in leningrad but the man instead of being pleased was terrified for goodness sake put it away he said what use is it to me luxuries it s a crime to hoard and i should be caught at once if i suddenly appeared with unaccountable money to spend but i should not be the only one to be punished you smuggled the money in and if you were caught you would quite likely be an unwilling guest in russia for a very considerable period from the moment we arrived we had been aware of this soviet control of foreigner s money there are no state banks in russia but a soviet exchange bureau was established on board ship before we landed our money was changed at the rate of two rubles to the dollar and we were given certificates which we had to sign containing particulars of the transaction and whenever we bought anything this certificate had to be produced before we were given possession of our purchases and on it had to be endorsed the amounts we had spent mrs leningrad told us we had no cause to complain it is only self protection she said you capitalists refuse to recognize our ruble or to quote it on your foreign exchanges and as a result outside russia our money can be bought at very low rates we watch every visitor to see that he does n t import cheap rubles to spend here you will see the scheme working if you want to change your surviving rubles back into dollars when you leave the exchange bureau will only pay you after they have verified from an addition of the shop endorsements on your certificate that you have not spent more rubles in russia than you originally received when you exchanged your dollars on arrival i suppose she went on all this sounds very queer to you but as a matter of fact our life is far easier than yours in its routine our state is responsible for every russian in russia during the whole of his life as a child he gets education and rations as a worker he gets pay and rations and there is always work we have no unemployment as a pensioner he gets pension and rations and there is always cheap and good food for everybody into the bargain housekeeping is easy although i expect you would find it dull every householder has a series of ration books covering both the essentials of life and luxuries and only vegetables are an open market the only shops belong to the state coöperatives and nothing can be bought without the production of the necessary ration book we are only served if our books show that we have not already bought more than we are entitled to buy according to state rationing regulations i know exactly what i can have and cater accordingly but my family only get the second scale of rations we are sedentary workers manual workers get twice as much as we do you see it is not so complicated after all and we understand rationing now and accept it because it suits us and it applies to everything not only food but clothes boots soap candles oil everything mrs leningrad was possibly speaking for many of her compatriots but not for all another of my fellow travelers had an introduction to a professional russian in leningrad and went to see him his clothes were illfitting and worn and in apologizing for them he explained that three years ago he had had quite a good wardrobe but that in 1927 the state had made an inventory of all the clothes in russia and had laid down by law what each person might possess he had been left with only two suits and according to ration regulations he was not entitled to another for twelve months we told the story to mrs leningrad who shrugged her shoulders he is not used to it yet she said and probably does n t see what value this rationing has for the state we buy what we need at cheap state prices and the state provides without foreign imports and as no one can buy more than his ration money loses its point and the state can keep wages and pensions low the scheme only hits me in one way i should like to travel again as i did as a child of course i can have a passport for abroad provided i promise to return but what should i do in paris or in london or in new york i could not buy my cheap russian rations in the rue de la paix or in piccadilly or on broadway and i certainly know that the little money i have would not last me one meal according to your restaurant prices ii mrs leningrad was timid in her comments on the state and church issue she had certainly been devout before devotion went out of fashion in russia but the more politicallyminded miss moscow was bluntly expansive on the topic it was raised fortuitously sight seeing over three weeks destroys all contact with time and in moscow one of us surprised after the emptiness of the leningrad streets to see crowds thronging the pavements assumed that they were sunday crowds enjoying their day off the suggestion greatly entertained miss moscow those people are enjoying their day of rest but it s not sunday she said we don t go in for sundays or mondays or for the matter of that for weeks we work on a fiveday cycle four days work one day s rest thus the factories never stop and the shops never close sunday with everybody off together is out of date it would interrupt our progress but what about church we asked of course the priests keep sunday she answered and everybody can go to church who wants to but very few do we carried the war into the enemy s camp that is if they can find a church open we countered have n t you closed most of them not a bit of it her voice was very metallic we don t close churches they close themselves it is only when the priests and their congregations fail to keep them in good repair that the state intervenes churches with special claims to interest then become museums otherwise they are converted into warehouses and factories of which russia has far more need the state has no objection to religion and tolerates every religion but only so long as religion does not clog the machinery of our social and economic development under the old régime our church as a malevolent agency in russia was second only to tsarism and the two worked hand in glove the scene of our discussion moved to the church of the redeemer which celebrates the french defeat in 1812 miss moscow brought us to a small dais on which were two thrones while the common herd stood at worship she said the tsars alone sat and this dais was to raise them above their subjects and nearer the almighty whom they claimed to represent on earth as such they could do and did what they liked without control or criticism and the church fostered the fiction now we have disestablished and disendowed it it must never again have temporal power in leningrad we had had a foretaste of how the soviet is teaching the proletariat to regard religion we had stopped opposite the blue mosque by the peter paul fortress it said mrs leningrad was built by the last tsar to conciliate his moslem subjects in the mornings it is still open for mohammedan prayers but in the afternoons there are daily antireligious meetings for all and sundry but moscow is the headquarters of the movement and there we were shown the soviet antireligious institute where students qualify as antireligious teachers in the government schools the next generation said miss moscow will have been trained to regard religion purely as a spiritual force and this knowledge will make it impossible for all time that the church in russia should again thwart the rights of the people the soviet has already in twelve years made great headway on our peregrinations we overtook a tawdry white painted trolley clattering briskly over the cobbles on it was a coffin it was unattended and from the pace at which it was being carried i assumed it was empty oh no said miss moscow it is going to the cemetery the family has paid the driver to fetch the corpse from the house and someone else has been paid to dig a grave the two between them will bury the body and that will be all but i said won t there be any religious service maybe yes maybe no but most likely no and there was a sequel later in the day the same trolley passed us clattering in the opposite direction the coffin was still on it corpses said miss moscow are no longer buried in coffins coffins are far too expensive iii there were repeated indications that the soviet wished us to take a good impression of russia away with us and it positively pandered to our physical needs our meals were gargantuan but strongly à la russe i met one elderly north of england merchant who expressed himself forcibly sturgeon he said never want to see the stuff again i thought i was eating horse personally i enjoyed my meals extremely i contrived always to seat myself at table opposite the caviare and in three days ate at least ten dollars worth only the soviet waiting was poor buttling as a profession is out of date for new russia lives on state rations and waits on itself and soviet attentions could also be delicate in our train from moscow we were brought free early morning tea in glasses and free rusks and just before journey s end the doyen of the lady guides a lovely creature just like pavlova toured the whole train like a hospital matron on her morning round speaking particularly for the men among us we were charmed when with a sweet smile she asked us individually whether everything had been all right and whether we had had a really nice sleep but the soviet government despite its solicitude for tourists ostentatiously and at times pretentiously parades its belief in the maxim that charity should start at home there are scores of canteens in the industrial quarters where workers can queue up for their meat and bread rations and eat on the job instead of having to go back to their homes for meals or bring food with them there are crèches for workers children and on the neva and moskva rivers there are workers lidos with swimming pools and water chutes and punts and skiffs and sun bathing after we had seen the moskva lido miss moscow showed us a full blown fun city with a fine helter skelter swing boats roundabouts and an ornamental lake it was a pleasant and harmless if slightly vulgar resort but miss moscow whom we were coming to consider as being something of a prig did not call a spade a spade we have christened this place the people s home of culture and rest she said pompously the idea was really comic and it was not the only incident which betrayed a soviet lack of humor in moscow and leningrad we were shown old music halls riding schools closed churches and the like only to be told that they now pass under the most wonderful high sounding titles as institutes of this seminaries of that and symposiums of something else and even in the cinemas nearly all the films are improving in tone or propagandist hardly any are even vaguely amusing there is a similarity between this bolshevist pretentiousness and that of suburban commuters who will call their semi detached villas sans souci quirinal versailles and even the white house in pleasant contrast the workers rest home which we visited on the neva islands had the spontaneity and unassuming simplicity of a mixed summer camp these homes are all through russia and are established in the suburban and country houses of the ci devants workers are entitled to a fortnight s free holiday a year and they run the homes themselves with one soviet restriction only prohibition the home we saw had belonged to an imperial general and the grounds had been lovely in ten years they have been allowed to fall into unlovely decay but near the mansion there were badminton courts and gymnasium apparatus and we met party after party of holiday makers returning from boating and swimming in the neva mrs leningrad gave us her set piece standing beneath a huge picture of lenin crudely frescoed on the wall of what had been the general s hall formerly she said the house was open for at most three months in the summer and then only for the benefit of the general his wife and his son to day it accommodates 270 workers and is open all the year round under tsarism there was nothing but work work day in day out for the workers and now i will show you how jolly this place has become in the kitchen duty men were cutting bread and chopping meat for rissoles in the four dining rooms dutywomen were laying the tables the dormitories where they slept by sexes were tidy and well if simply furnished in the recreation rooms the old drawing room library and boudoir groups were talking and reading finally in the music room a large party was listening to a long haired impresario who only broke into bourgeois jazz when we appeared but lenin was everywhere the fairy godfather as it were of the holiday makers the soviets are past masters of propaganda we as tourists expected to be propagandized but to all of us it was a surprise to realize the intensity of soviet propaganda among their own people wherever we visited in churches in museums and in palaces we met scores of other touring parties russian parties of soldiers sailors and workers each in charge of an official guide of the soviet educational corps in the hermitage i saw mongols from turkestan gaping at a rembrandt a spectacled girl of eighteen was explaining velasquez to a group of bucolic soldiers a class of children tittered over an overdeveloped nude by rubens to watch them was to be moved to mirth but in tsarskoye selo the last leningrad home of the last tsar i was moved to inarticulate wrath in the imperial bedroom we overtook a group of sailors standing round a blackboard on which was pinned a photograph of rasputin it had been placed opposite the tsarina s bed by the soviet and the sailors guide was tense and fanatic in her explanations what she said i could only guess but i saw the sailors grinning and nudging each other the presence of that photograph in that room was an outrage to common decency and on two occasions i had cause to marvel over the thoroughness of soviet psychology these propaganda visits are wearying and promote hunger in the hermitage i came across a peasant workers group enjoying a ration lunch of garlic and black bread on a silkcovered empire sofa placed specially for their repose and in the hall of the winter palace where formerly the imperial guard watched imperial departures a long snack counter now provides workers who have completed their educational tours with fish and onions at a dime a plate iv there was no suggestion in our guides explanations of monuments of any tinge of apology for the past we were bourgeois as likely as not we were imperialists some of us might even be aristocrats offense is the best form of defense so in st isaac s cathedral in leningrad we were told that the building was crying evidence of the callousness of imperial squandermania it cost mints and thousands of serfs died in the digging of its foundations in the fever stricken neva mud in the hermitage british royalty was ridiculed mrs leningrad halted us before a van dyck portrait of queen henrietta maria in life she was ugly and squat here she is lovely and graceful queens always insisted upon being passed down to posterity as fair as venus but she was crudely gruesome in her belittlement of the beauty of the church of the resurrection where alexander ii was murdered by nihilists all this grandeur is bourgeois vulgarity she said and it was only to hoodwink the world that we russians mourned the murdered man as a matter of fact we were delighted when he was killed finally in the libraries at tsarskoye selo she stressed the maps and the long rows of military books on the shelves tsars after napoleon s time she said thought only of wars and empire aggrandizement russia and its needs education hygiene industry were nothing to them so long as they were the most magnificent monarchs in the world as sight seers we were absolutely under the thumb of our fair guides but as visitors we became more independent and my party of four wanted to shop there was no objection and with miss moscow we learned how shopping is done in government loot shops they are stocked with the débris commandeered by the state after the revolution from the houses of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie but the one we visited might have been a jumble sale we were at least two hundred tourist clients and there were at most six saleswomen and they spoke english indifferently we snatched and grabbed like bargain fans at a summer sale but eventually i succeeded in earmarking six imperially crested wedgwood plates and then the queues began first i had to queue up for my bill then in a different place for another official to check the bill next farther down the shop to settle the account finally with my receipt i started again at the bottom of my first queue to get possession of my plates four officials were doing the work of one efficient salesman that experience taught us all we wanted to know of loot shops but we had not yet sampled queue shops we had seen scores of them but in discussing them our guides had betrayed no irritation with the system the people can only go in one by one they explained as each ration book has to be checked individually before anyone can buy anything miss moscow however was less calm when we suggested joining a long queue outside a candy store it is impossible why it is impossible we don t see why five minutes poste and riposte before she capitulated ten minutes later we had our invitation from the soviet shop manager to make some purchases privately privately in russian does not mean privately in english with us in her wake miss moscow bullocked straight through the queue thank goodness russians are stolid a low town pit queue would have murdered us but once inside we might have been buying candy at home save that my two ounces of chocolate creams were filthy and cost half a dollar but while we bought bourgeois fashion the queue carried on bolshevist fashion candy it turned out does not need ration books and in turn the shoppers demanded at the cash desk whether the candy they wanted was in stock and at what price if both answers were satisfactory they passed what they wanted to spend over to the cashier who gave them a coupon with this token they bought their candy at another counter it all seemed a futile much ado about nothing but in answer to our torrent of questions miss moscow s replies were masterpieces of feminine evasiveness we have got used to them she said to these people candy queues are no more irksome than theatre queues to you in fact many workers pass all their rest days queue ing up they only buy enough at one time to last them to the top of another queue then they buy again and go back to the bottom of the next one and so on and so on after all queues are grand places for gossip some of course buy to resell at a small profit and others on commission for those who are too lazy to go for themselves i personally never stand in a queue i felt exactly like alice talking to the white queen and although i have seen a russian queue in action all i can say about its working is that it is a good thing that the new russian has such a strong queue complex during our three days the soviet fed us well and guided us brilliantly but transport was not so uniformly satisfactory we started well in leningrad in a well sprung government car there are neither private cars nor taxis in leningrad and presumably while we toured some commissar who normally rode was to his deep disgust walking to his office but in moscow our cruel fate was one of the few private taxis in russia it had no springs the windows would not open and the engine functioned on the principle of dot and carry one miss moscow gave us no sympathy you are spoiled she said with your money and your luxury here taxis are utter luxury we russians never use them we either walk or ride in trams which are run by a department of state with very low fares and further shocks awaited us on our last day in leningrad it was pouring with rain and presumably the weather had given the commissars an excuse to demand the return of their cars anyhow our last excursions in russia were made in a hard sprung bus which was not only an agony but a peril but our railway experiences were happier the whole two hundred of us for moscow had clean and roomy sleepers the linen was fresh and all the stories of things walking and crawling in our mattresses proved to be moonshine but one lady had believed them disastrously at hels ngfors she had bought a kill me quick insecticide the whole of which she at once broadcasted over her cushions the liquid was a virulent form of tear gas and she and her very indignant daughter wept all the way to moscow v while i was in russia i found myself listening rather than looking what i saw was of less interest to me than what i heard leningrad was the more depressing of the two towns we visited the streets mainly empty were in shocking condition with potholes as large as shell holes and mud inches deep but they were in keeping with their surroundings slums succeeded squalor genteel poverty succeeded slums and over all brooded melancholy and despair it was a tenement town plaster was peeling from dingy walls drainpipes were rusted and broken the glass in the windows was cracked and dirty nothing had known the feel of paint for years shops were boarded up caverns gaping on to the road and in street after street those queues propped themselves patiently against the walls ichabod was written black over leningrad the centre of the town was less dead there were trams there were policemen and policewomen both smoking there was some horse drawn traffic and there was movement on the pavements but though the people looked sturdy and well fed my depression deepened their clothes though possibly warm were subfuse and ill fitting and i longed for a splash of color to relieve the general drabness and there were no advertisements here gaudy or crude they would have been actually welcome and it rained continuously and the street walkers had no umbrellas leningrad was ghastly moscow after leningrad seemed alive almost impudently alive the streets were as bad if not worse and the houses cried as loudly for paint and plaster but the pavements were crowded and so were the trams the shops made some show of window display and there were signs of building activity above all the people seemed less drab and more virile many were in summer whites and their linen was well laundered and the inevitable crowd outside our hotel seemed somehow to convey almost a sense of superiority in their looks you may have fine clothes and any amount of money but now we can get on quite well without you thank you in one respect only did leningrad take the palm from moscow the oktober prospekt is the only modernly paved russian street we saw our first view of it was at night as we were going to our moscow train it was brilliantly lit all down its three miles of straightness it was crowded and the shops being closed did not betray their nakedness only at night said mrs leningrad when the lights are on can i remember that this prospekt used to be the nevsky prospekt of my girlhood i had been told for years what a terrible place russia was and having seen it i do not at all want to live there but when i am now asked how russians behaved toward us well you might as well try to analyze the feelings of one cow toward another cow we were incidentals not features in the russian landscape only once was there an incident of articulate hostility we were standing harmlessly round mrs leningrad listening to some explanation of a monument when a country cart rumbled past no sooner did the carter spot us than in uncontrollable fury he began to shout himself black in the face and the air became so thick with invective that our chauffeur leapt from his seat and tore after the cart and took its number and the carter s name what the sequel was goodness knows mrs leningrad confined her comment to the statement that such incidents gave tourists a bad and a wrong impression of russia but another incident in which i was the hero completely blotted out all bad impressions of the carter and his oaths when i got up to dress in the train from moscow it was streaming with rain and the carriage was cold drowsily i seized what i thought was the lever of the heating apparatus instead i pulled the communication cord and with a hiss from the westinghouse brake the train stopped i was horror struck what would be the russian penalty for improper use archangel but in the end i thanked my lucky stars that i was in russia and that the guard looked and was as paternal as hindenburg and had a sense of humor although our only language was by signs my pantomime as i reconstructed the crime in my flannel pyjamas was so ludicrous that the hindenburgian traits relaxed and suddenly to my great relief the old field marshal was roaring with laughter he whistled the train on and went to tell some colleagues the joke when i was safely back on board our good ship i wondered to myself what would have happened to me had i pulled one of mr mussolini s communication cords
the houston ship channel is a rubbish home for a fish it s one of the busiest ports in the world and all that traffic has made the water slick with toxic chemicals yet the gulf killifish has found a way it has evolved pollution resistance by cross breeding with a different species the atlantic killifish which happened to have a handy mutation cross breeding or hybridisation is more common in nature than we used to think and as global heating makes animals move to areas with lower temperatures more species may get thrown together in alaska and canada people have already spotted grolar bears the result of grizzlies moving up into polar bear territory to escape the heat recently conservationists have proposed that we could cross breed animals for their own good they think that like the gulf killifish s new pollution defence hybridisation could give vulnerable animals an evolutionary head start in the race to genetically adapt to global heating their tolerance of higher temperatures and acidic oceans could improve others are wary of losing millennia old species as they are mixed with different animals this debate reveals a chasm within conservation revolving around the question can we protect animals while forcing them to change view image in fullscreen a captive bred grolar bear or pizzly photograph reddit lots of things hybridise all the time says michelle marvier a conservation biologist at santa clara university in california it happens in plants fish amphibians and even some mammals in fact many of us carry traces of neanderthals and denisovans in our dna proof that we mixed with other human species it can be something that leads to an evolutionary dead end because the offspring are sterile or it could be halfway to evolutionary adaptation she says it s the second aspect that is garnering interest for species that have a long time between generations there are fewer opportunities for potentially useful mutations to arise so if the environment is rapidly changing normal evolution will probably be too slow for those animals to adapt and survive hybridisation could provide a shortcut by quickly bringing in genes from outside the normal gene pool when you cross breed different species the motivation really is to create new gene combinations and increase genetic diversity says madeleine van oppen an ecological geneticist at the university of melbourne that diversity increases the potential for new adaptations that could save species from extinction caused by global warming just like the gulf killifish was saved from pollution by the atlantic killifish s mutation as it stands jura wildcats will become genetically indistinguishable from domestic cats within a century van oppen works on corals half of which have disappeared over the last 30 years in large part due to global heating by crossing corals in the lab she creates new hybrid offspring and tests them to see how they hold up under warmer conditions she and her colleagues recently showed that some coral hybrids survived up to 34 better at higher temperature and co 2 pressure than their parents but not all species can be bred and tested in the lab instead conservationists could move one species into the habitat of another and hope they breed while no one has yet tried to make climate resistant hybrids this way the approach has been used to combat inbreeding in species with only a few individuals left view image in fullscreen a european wildcat in glen feshie in the scottish highlands photograph mark hicken alamy the florida panther is a key example in the mid 1990s only about 25 remained and scientists thought they would become extinct within two decades as a last ditch attempt to save them conservationists moved eight texan panthers into their habitat to boost the genetic diversity but not without a lot of debate and angst over what that would mean says marvier thirty years later there are still panthers in florida but is it still the florida panther if you brought in panthers from texas to interbreed with them the worry with forcing a threatened species to hybridise is that rather than saving it you do the opposite make it go extinct its genome no longer survives in its original form the genes of the newcomers eventually swamp those of the original inhabitants leaving no trace of what once made them unique this is what faces some of europe s wildcats in scotland only a few hundred remain and a 2019 report by the international union for conservation of nature found that the main threat to them is cross breeding with domestic cats what is now roaming the scottish highlands the report says is primarily a hybrid swarm of wild cats with different degrees of domestic hybridisation the situation looks increasingly similar in the swiss jura mountains says conservation biologist juan montoya burgos of the university of geneva wildcats having a few domestic genes is not a big problem if they are able to survive and interact and play their ecological role he says but he and his colleague mathias currat have shown through modelling that as it stands jura wildcats will become genetically indistinguishable from domestic cats within a century how they will fare then is anyone s guess but we do know that extensive hybridisation can result in loss of adaptation to the local environment in the rocky mountains of north america this appears to be happening to the cutthroat trout an animal so symbolic it is the state fish of seven us states native trout have adapted to persist in the face of extreme environmental change over time you know flooding wildfires glaciation says aquatic ecologist clint muhlfeld from the us geological survey but as they breed with the invasive rainbow trout released by the millions for fishing stocks during the 20th century the collection of genes that together are responsible for those adaptations are broken up view image in fullscreen the cutthroat trout of the american pacific north west photograph alamy this potentially along with bad new gene combinations has detrimental effects further down the generational line in cutthroat trout hybrids produce fewer and fewer offspring the more rainbow trout ancestry they have with as little as 20 hybridisation you see at least a 50 decline in fitness and we ve seen this pattern in different populations muhlfeld says being wary of human facilitated hybridisation then is understandable but marvier argues that such dire scenarios are rare most introduced species are perfectly benign she says in a recent review she and her colleagues found that while many studies highlight invader hybridisation as a threat to native species few produced actual evidence of harmful effects such as poor growth or fertility the paper argues that if a native species is changed but in an adaptive way that works within its ecosystem it should not necessarily be seen as a loss not everyone agrees in the field i marvel at the peculiar and highly idiosyncratic adaptations that have evolved says ecologist daniel simberloff at the university of tennessee i just cannot be cheered by the sort of thing that are talking about as a replacement he is not alone the last thing we want is to have so much gene flow that we lose that distinctiveness of the species we are trying to protect says karin pfennig an evolutionary biologist at the university of north carolina from van oppen s perspective ideally we would maintain all species exactly as they are but we don t have that luxury any more because the environment is changing so rapidly and biodiversity loss is just so fast in other words if we can t save the ones we have maybe we can help nature make new ones that are more likely to survive i think we re fools to believe that we can genetically engineer a future proof creature andrew whitehead university of california davis such trade offs do occur in nature for example female plains spadefoot toads living in the new mexico desert prefer to mate with a mexican spadefoot over their own kind but only if their pond is drying out hybrid tadpoles develop faster and have a higher chance of reaching adulthood before the water disappears it s a hard choice though because only the hybrid daughters are fertile pfennig who studies spadefoots suspects hybridisation played a large part in why the plains spadefoots moved from their ancestral grasslands to the desert because it can allow species to move into new habitats that they otherwise wouldn t be able to live in it is not a big leap to think it could do the same for species finding themselves in new or drastically altered environments due to global warming yet adapting genomes using hybridisation is a really blunt tool says simberloff it s like using a sledgehammer in surgery he says whereas genetic editing would give us much finer control he highlights a plant case that of the american chestnut which was widespread until an accidentally imported blight causing fungus infected them people have tried for a while to hybridise the american chestnut with the resistant chinese chestnut they grow up to be about this high he says with a hand held next to his chest and then the blight gets them but scientists have now managed to fit the american chestnut with a wheat gene that gives them resistance this in simberloff s surgery analogy is the scalpel view image in fullscreen a female plains spadefoot toad mating with a male mexican spadefoot toad photograph catherine chen davidpfenniglab com but evolutionary biologist andrew whitehead from the university of california davis who studies the gulf killifish does not see this as a viable option for most species he says we know too little about how changing or inserting genes will affect animals once they are out in nature i think we re fools to think that we can genetically engineer a future proof creature yet evolution will also not do the job for us unaided he says people take the story about the gulf killifish to mean that evolution will provide solutions to pollution and global warming but that s the exact wrong take because it is such an exception his own solution is both simpler and as the un climate change conferences show more complicated how about burning less fossil fuel we know that s gonna work it s hard to disagree protecting all but the most charismatic and important species one by one is impossible says montoya burgos regardless of the tools we use we need to act at the source of the problem which is climate change while that is undoubtedly true some damage has already been done and will be hard to reverse just take florida its panther population originally plummeted due to road accidents and disappearing prey but fixing that might not even matter in the long term they re still not going to make it probably simberloff says because florida is sinking this takes us right back to that difficult question if we cannot save them as they are should we try saving them as something else
a friend who has just returned from san francisco brings astounding news of rail travel in the west such findings as excellent meals and plenty of pleasant service are hardly imaginable to a new englander yet the traveler as if from the other side of the moon went on to tell of vista domes dining car seats at an hour of his own selection and without standing in line and lounge cars in the plural most impressive of all he reported was the conductor a watch in hand type who was deeply interested in whether the train was on time the carrier in this case a round trip between san francisco and denver was the denver and rio grande and western pacific its only dereliction was its insistence on calling its comely stewardess a zephyrette i m sorry about that said my friend she was really very attractive no such fine points need be made about rail travel in new england where passengers and train crew alike are long accustomed to roughing it with the prospect of worse to come the bostonian bound for new york is grateful if his train even departs on time let alone gets anywhere meeting one of these trains at either end is a gamble against long odds and it s bad form to ask for an arrival hour since the attendant won t know the answer anyhow a conductor looking at his watch in this neighborhood would be checking the interval before his next dyspepsia tablet the cafeteria car of one of the boston new york trains is memorable for the odor of the much used and fiercely overheated grease in its galley the air conditioning system has broken down temporarily of course and the robust prices on its menu prices sufficient to deceive the stranger into expecting a correspondingly substantial meal the entire staff are new not only to their tasks but to each other they are usually preoccupied in getting acquainted by conversation among themselves here as in the terminals and wherever railroad employees are conversing one gets the impression of pessimistic conjecture will the service shut down tomorrow maybe tonight is the cook capable of putting together an egg sandwich how come we re on time the best meal we had anywhere in italy last summer was a luncheon in the dining car of the rapido from rome to florence a vast offering yet moderately priced it seemed a cut above what one found at hotels and restaurants and three of the courses the pasta the sliced beef tenderloin and a huge flavorsome fresh peach at the instant of perfect ripeness were the finest in my experience the diner was a large car handsomely appointed and although every place was occupied the whole meal was served in great style by only two waiters it would be hard to overstate the speed and dexterity with which the two waiters went about their work they seemed determined to show that they were the most excellent of all dining car waiters in the world and it is reasonable to believe that they were in fact just that british trains are notable for the antiquity of their battered rolling stock and the impeccable manners of all personnel the conductor making his rounds in a third class carriage of a suburban train from london exemplified both characteristics he was elderly and his livery or uniform of a faded maroon as i recall it was distinctly shabby but he entered the compartment with a great air of mission assurance and professionalism good afternoon he said there were polite murmurs from the half dozen passengers please said the conductor may i see your tickets he examined the tickets and as he returned the last to its owner he said with a bow that included all of us thank you so much the conductor turned and opened the compartment door to the corridor then faced us once again good afternoon he said charles w morton
two years ago few would have dreamed that the belgian congo would be granted independence in 1960 indeed even last year when the proafrican minister for the congo van hemelrijk resigned it seemed that the congo would remain belgian until 1964 then at the beginning of the year came the promise of complete independence on june 30 enabling the congo like nigeria the french cameroons mali and the italian somaliland also to shake off foreign rule in this momentous year for africa three quarters of a century of belgian rule came to a sudden end it was king leopold ii the german king of belgium who secured the congo for belgium through his agent stanley the king never set foot in the congo and he proved a ruthless absentee landlord the conference of berlin 18841885 gave him the entire country belgians do not like to be reminded of the early despotic years of their rule since 1908 the congo has been a belgian colony and a policy unique in the annals of colonization was evolved the keynote of the policy has been paternalism emphasis has been placed on economic development and social services so that africans would live in such a material paradise by african standards that they would have no interest in the abstractions of politics the policy was dominer pour servir and a remarkable success the belgian government the companies and the church made of it until very recently the policy of paternalism reached its peak in the 1950 ten year plan on which one billion dollars was spent more than a quarter going to congolese housing education and health workers have a guaranteed minimum salary an eighthour day annual holidays free rations and board family allowances medical services pensions and disability compensation there are broad provisions for primary education this policy might very well have made it possible for the belgians to retain their hold over the congo for decades to come had it not been for events in the rest of africa it became impossible to isolate the congo once black african states like the sudan and ghana got their independence when de gaulle made his offer of independence to the french congolese in 1958 at brazzaville no amount of paternalism could thwart political aspirations in the belgian congo moving toward independence since world war ii a new social group had appeared in the congo the evolues these were natives who formed a westernized frenchspeaking middle class they campaigned for equal wages for equal work for higher education and against the color bar in this way the seeds of political consciousness were sown in 1956 the magazine conscience ajricaine published a manifesto agreeing to a thirty year plan for political emancipation at the end of 1957 there were local elections in leopoldville elisabethville and jadotville when the victorious m kasavubu openly criticized the belgian regime a study group was sent to examine the political situation congolese intellectuals submitted a petition demanding a program leading to independence and most of the signatories later formed the mouvement national congolais m n c of which m lumumba became the president after a political meeting in leopoldville in january 1959 serious rioting occurred social as well as political grievances were the cause paternalism having apparently overlooked the hardships suffered by many in the overcrowded city ten days later came the brussels declaration on the future of the congo king baudouin said in a broadcast our firm resolution is to lead the congolese populations without harmful procrastination but also without undue haste toward independence events were moving fast when the change of the minister for the congo came in september it was thought that there would be a slowing down in the advance toward independence but the new minister de schryver after some initial strong moves to suppress rioting showed that he did not intend to ignore the warning of the outgoing van hemlrijk we have before our eyes the failure of the i dutch policy in indonesia which eventually caused a complete break between the two countries the brussels round table conference in january and february of this year named the day for independence and the fears of delay proved unfounded party realignment new parties have been formed and old parties have been split the chief subject for debate is regionalism and the chief protagonists are now m kasavubu king kasa of l association dcs bakongo j abako who wants a federation and a virtually independent republic of the lower congo m lumumba of the m n c a national unity party favoring strong government and m bolikango of the interfederale an upper congo grouping following the elections these and the many other parties will enjoy the benefits of a constitution drawn up in brussels at the beginning of 1960 the first congolese government will consist of at least one member from each of the six provinces with the leader chosen by king baudouin a cabinet will then be formed which will need the confidence of parliament there are two legislative assemblies the house of representatives elected on may 16 and the senate elected on june 15 for every 100 000 of the population there is one representative a total of 137 for the present the senate consists of members nominated by the provincial assemblies fourteen for each province including at least three tribal leaders parliaments will last three to four years the provincial assemblies will be responsible for all local matters in accordance with the consensus of both congolese and belgian opinion which favor a large degree of autonomy for the provinces with defined frontiers and laws adapted to their regional characteristics only congolese men over twenty one will be allowed to vote belgium is thus leaving behind it a system of government suited to the west but not so far successful in any emergent nations except india and israel which are very special cases the threats to independence some conflict between tribalism and modernism seems inevitable the communal elections of three years ago reflected tribal loyalties rather than a real interest in policy tribal loyalties would tend to obscure loyalty to the national state and might even result in the balkanization of the country the present frontiers of the congo did not after all exist before the coming of europeans and only the politicians who realize the advantages of a united country will seek to maintain the status quo m lumumba said at accra in 1958 down with colonialism down with tribalism but not all politicians realize the dangers of tribalism there are other indications that the present frontiers of the congo will be called into question in march a considerable stir was created when sir roy welensky stated in a press interview that there was some possibility that katanga province the southernmost province of the congo will be associated with if not included in the rhodesian federation m tshombe president of conakat katanga s strongest party at once declared that the province would never enter any union or federation other than that with the provinces of the congo or belgium riots and killings ensued at about the same time there was another threat to the independence of the congo the french government claimed that it had a preferential right to the congo dating back to 1884 when m strauch president of the international congo association told french foreign minister ferry that france would have the first right to purchase if the association had to sell out belgian foreign minister de wigny has protested strongly against both suggestions on the grounds that belgium is not disposing of a piece of property and that after working for three quarters of a century for the unity of the congo it is not now willing to make way for foreign domination the economic potential intact the congo has boundless economic possibilities an immense country seventy seven times the area of belgium a quarter that of europe with a population of over thirteen million of whom 100 000 are white its economic potential is the envy of nearly every other developing country yet at present the per capita income is 2100 francs compared with 44 000 francs in belgium and 91 000 francs in the united states one third of the palm oil of the world comes from the congo it is the leading world producer of cobalt and industrial diamonds the fourth producer of copper and tin the sixth of zinc in 1958 and 1959 there was some financial weakening due to the world economic recession and local political turmoil but the economic tide has now turned in 1960 belgium is spending 2 5 billion francs on a subsidy 6 or 7 billion francs from belgian and international stock markets are to be plowed into the congolese economy this year a congolese government can hardly afford not to cooperate with belgium in view of the fact that there are ten million dollars of belgian money invested in the congo rapid development is essential not only because of the underdevelopment but because the population is expected to double in the next thirty years in a vast underdeveloped country the expansion of the transport system is of the utmost importance in the last ten year plan 20 billion francs was spent on transport and this figure is increased in the current plan there are only 5000 kilometers of railways in the country not bad by african standards but far below what is required foreign capital needed economically the congo will be dependent upon investment from abroad having had very little political training it will doubtless find tlie first few years of democracy very difficult belgium s policy did not provide for the training of an elite before 1958 very few congolese were allowed to visit europe because the belgian government feared they might bring back with them ideas which would cause political unrest it was not until 1956 that the first congolese student graduated from belgium s louvain university and the first congolese university louvanium was opened in elisabethville every possible form of foreign en couragement and assistance will be needed there will be a treaty of friendship and cooperation with belgium and some belgian officials will remain as british officials have in ghana the civil service will have to be africanized gradually in 1959 there were only 500 congolese civil servants and these were nearly all clerks as most congolese leaders owe their education to christian schools the question of the future of the church is an interesting one in the congo many africans feel that native priests have not been given preferment when they deserved it the church has also been accused of being patronizing and it certainly is closely connected in the minds of many people with paternalism on die other hand being closer to the natives than is any other foreign group the belgian missionaries have tended to be fairly progressive in their outlook and have often come in for criticism from other whites africanization of the clergy especially the higher offices will have to be speeded up in an independent congo with four million black catholics the working of the political system will depend on the congolese themselves the big mistake made by prejudiced observers of young countries is to think that the systems of government which have been evolved in the west over a long period of trial and error can be immediate and unqualified successes in countries which have for so long been denied self expression by both colonial domination and the misfortunes of environment there will inevitably be a period of adaptation and this may be both long and painful

fayez sarofim with wife susan 2018 getty images for unicef fayez sarofim the billionaire money manager died saturday at his home in houston at age 93 i ve always claimed it took someone from abroad to recognize the true potential in this country said fayez shalaby sarofim in his first interview with forbes magazine in 1969 back then sarofim 41 at the time was a money man on the rise the native born egyptian was known as the sphinx for his inscrutable demeanor and his calm unshakable faith in american exceptionalism he bought blue chip stocks like p g coca cola ko philip morris was an early investor in intel intc and teledyne and he believed wholeheartedly in the economic power of the united states not just to make money but to compound it the u s is still a relatively young nation among industrialized nations it can still mount the effort to become more competitive through technology he said at the time it s blessed with natural resources and equally important the brainpower and the u s political system is still the most stable of all his coptic christian family had left their native egypt after the government ordered sarofim s wealthy father to sell his land or have it seized by the state he arrived in the u s in 1946 and after school at uc berkeley and harvard owlish fayez entered finance and developed a knack for stockpicking with 100 000 from dad he launched fayez sarofim co in 1958 along with startup capital his father gave him advice he told me not to draw a salary but to pour any profits back into the business so as to give the clients the best possible service the profits would come later this fish out of water s conviction of american exceptionalism played well among the oil tycoons in his adopted hometown of houston where despite the heat and humidity he stuck to his london tailored three piece suits but it was his first wife louisa stude a grace kelly lookalike and niece of george brown one of the founders of oilfield services firm of brown root now a subsidiary of halliburton hal who really opened doors for sarofim an early coup was landing management of the 65 million endowment of rice university by 1969 he had more than 400 clients and 1 2 billion under management during the mid 1970s he bravely bought stocks at deep discounts by 1980 assets had grown to 7 billion he held on to oil stocks too long in the early 1980s when they crashed but he kept the faith and in a forbes cover story in 1980 lamented that the market was weighed down with too much pessimism he was right of course to have faith in america and in entrepreneurial capitalism betting on people is the most important thing he once said entrepreneurs simply seem to produce better investment results when they have their money and their egos on the line his average stock holding period of 5 years was eons longer than flakey peers in 1987 he was running 15 billion and appeared for the first time on the forbes 400 with a net worth of 300 million his worst day was marlboro friday in 1992 when phillip morris slashed prices for smokes and sarofim s fund lost 475 million he made up for it later by steering clients away from enron today assets under management top 30 billion and son christopher sarofim runs the company sarofim spent a lot of money on divorces in 1989 louisa who bore him two children filed for divorce after reportedly being the last person in houston s tony river oaks neighborhood to know that fayez had been having an affair with one of his employees linda hicks with whom sarofim had another three kids he settled with louisa for more than 100 million in 1990 sarofim 2009 associated press though he bought linda a 22 000 square foot mansion on river oaks boulevard their subsequent marriage ended in 1996 and cost at least 60 million ever the ladies man sarofim raised eyebrows around town when he married again in 2015 to susan krohn the mother of his son phillip s now ex wife lori herself the ex wife of houston oil tycoon tracy krohn his passion other than spending afternoons in a haze of cigar smoke at the coronado club in downtown houston was art he started buying in the 1960s and built a collection including masterpieces by john singer sargent winslow homer mary cassat edward hopper willem de koonig in his office he kept el greco s painting of christ s cruxifiction on the wall near a picasso and rothko sarofim s last big philanthropic gift was 75 million to the just completed expansion of houston s museum of fine art it s fitting that sarofim s favorite tv show was said to be wheel of fortune which he enjoyed watching at home with his kids still wearing the day s three piece suit having grown up in timeless egypt experienced being a christian in a muslim country seeing his family forced to sell their ancestral lands sarofim had a deep enough perspective to know that america had been truly blessed by fortune but didn t always appreciate it for that first 1969 story forbes reporters asked sarofim how did you come so far so fast his reply remains relevant more than half a century later because he was a foreigner he said he simply didn t worry about some of the problems that distress so many american money managers at every turn during my ten years in business he said there have been hordes of doubters worried men preoccupied with fears of lurking disaster but look at what has really happened and promises to keep on happening indeed america has survived and thrived after every bear market so far and will again more from forbes get ready for 8 a gallon gas

the world s richest man isn t above trying to get a discount apparently in a new lawsuit twitter shareholders are suing elon musk alleging that he manipulated the price of the company s stock for his own benefit in the course of agreeing to buy the company the lawsuit represents a group of twitter investors but would allow any shareholders to receive financial compensation the suit was filed wednesday in federal district court for northern california and argues that musk intentionally drove down the company s stock to secure a better deal the fair market value of twitter securities has been adversely affected by musk s false statements and wrongful conduct the complaint states the lawsuit cites musk s decision to waive due diligence as a condition of the acquisition and his subsequent suspiciously timed claim that twitter had misrepresented the number of bots on its platform at the time musk was well aware that twitter had a certain amount of fake accounts and accounts controlled by bots and had in fact settled a lawsuit based on the fake accounts for millions of dollars the complaint states musk had tweeted about that issue at twitter several times in the past prior to making his offer to acquire twitter with full knowledge of the bots twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 of users elon musk elonmusk may 13 2022 the suit alleges as many people observed at the time that musk was likely trying to secure a discount by casting doubt on his commitment and disparaging the company since musk s initial commitment to purchase the company was announced tech stocks including tesla which accounts for the vast majority of musk s wealth took a dive following musk s comments twitter shares also dipped significantly a phenomenon that the suit alleges is highly unusual given the company s agreed upon buyout price while musk claimed the deal was on hold there was no formal mechanism in place that would back up that claim even within twitter company leaders encouraged employees to proceed as though nothing had changed noting that there was no such thing as casually pausing a binding agreement to buy the company the suit also alleges that musk deliberately delayed filing a disclosure form when his stake in the company exceeded 5 allowing him to continue to buy shares at a discount after the form was filed and musk s purchases became public knowledge twitter stock soared by nearly a third musk s disregard for securities laws demonstrates how one can flaunt the law and the tax code to build their wealth at the expense of the other americans the complaint states
is the world becoming more fragile the simple answer is no because the world has always been fragile we have recently experienced improbable events often referred to as black swans they occur more often than expected and show just how vulnerable our systems are the latest global crises in the still young 21st century and millennium like the coronavirus pandemic and the war in ukraine kick start a sea change with an enormous impact for years to come a radically different world is emerging and the rules of our global economy are being rewritten as we speak all this makes us more aware that something is wrong with our way of assessing risks as in modern times many think to have the ideal tools of futurology with its probability mathematics to help us predict the future but probabilities are just that probabilities and they may or may not come true we think we understand what is going on in the world but we ignore the complexity of dynamics the free will of everyone and the random we do not understand the world we value facts too highly and let ourselves be guided by experts not even the closing prices of the stock markets on the same day and indeed no crises or economic cycles are predictable the familiar world is no more many of the long standing trends that had made life so pleasant for decision makers in business and politics during the second half of the last century have broken decisively we face the most profound economic contraction since world war ii such challenges including climate change 9 11 the financial crisis of 2008 disruptive technologies supply chain disruptions the period of negative interest rates and high inflation show us that we do not know cannot know what further possibly immense tests await us it also teaches us that putting economic interests above those of human rights sustainability and defensible democracy primarily focusing on the idol of cheap sourcing and production due to short term profit maximisation and growth comes with a heavy bill for us all instead of putting resilience on top of our strategy for our economies businesses and environment and working with reliable sources and markets we manoeuvred ourselves into high avoidable dependencies of unreliable and unpredictable autocracies that do not share our hard earned values the consequences will be less globalisation and for a more extended period also less prosperity the corrective measures will cost vast sums of money and will likely drive up the inflation rate for many years to come however the issue of resilience will be of paramount importance overall for the economy and all businesses therefore entrepreneurs and managers alike should deal with it to secure success the upheavals of the 21st century will challenge businesses and entrepreneurs to leave their comfort zone and become more resilient resilience is the ability to recover after a drastic dramatic even upsetting event or experience a severe crisis a trauma to get one s head out of the mess again to catch oneself get back on one s feet and return to a healthier more healed better or more comfortable state to contentment and well being it s about the recuperative regenerative or self healing capacity in medicine and psychology the non resilient person remains for example broken or disturbed or destroyed or remains in the eternal role of victim or remains in permanent rage and revenge so they don t come back to a state of satisfaction and well being apart from humans including entrepreneurs and managers the same applies in the broadest sense to the company s resilience and economies i e which structures ensure the survival of any setbacks or crises or downturns without harming or even destroying its existence would entrepreneurial and organisational resilience meaning resistance to existence threatening influences be sufficient or shall we to even prevent such impacts go beyond resilience to anti fragility as the world renowned bestselling author and radical lebanese american philosopher nassim nicholas taleb the black swan antifragile suggests what is the difference we know the term fragile as an imprint on postal packages when fragile things are to be transported what is the opposite of fragile robust one would think as a robust package would survive a transport undamaged but this does not describe the exact opposite of fragile the opposite would be a package with the imprint please handle carelessly in other words a package that could withstand bumps and shocks and would even benefit from them the entrepreneur or boss needs to know that their employees are not just numbers but real people photo shutterstock com anything that benefits more than it suffers from random events or shocks is anti fragile and vice versa marvellously evolution is anti fragile continuous disturbances have led to the genera becoming better and better or extinct anti fragile systems can cope with mistakes and errors many minor troubles even increase the system s stability micro and small entrepreneurs like taxi drivers artisans or retailers are more anti fragile than employees their professions are much more robust as their income is subject to fluctuations and business disruption they are used to constantly adapting and improving their business models they have learned to live with uncertainty and know their risks whereas these are widely hidden from employees once you master resilience you can go to the next level to anti fragility for example i would definitely categorise steve jobs and elon musk as anti fragile entrepreneurs when we have numerical forecasts people tend to drastically increase their risk taking even when they know the numbers are random systems based on the illusory assumption that you can calculate probabilities exactly tend to take more risk and head straight for disaster so our world becomes more fragile because we think we have things under control we lull ourselves into a false sense of security and fail to prepare for the worst risk researchers have found that simple rules of thumb work better than complicated procedures this is a wake up call to use our common sense because you usually can never misjudge like miscalculate heuristics based on experiential knowledge give surprisingly good results not despite being intellectually modest but precisely because they are they are easy to understand and apply and have another invaluable advantage over modern forecasting methods their users know they are adequate for making decisions but not perfect another strategy of anti fragility is the via negativa it is easier to know what is wrong than to find out what is right a single small observation can disprove a claim falsification but conversely millions of observations cannot prove a claim with absolute certainty negative knowledge is therefore more robust so what does this teach us if you are not a gambler but still very ambitious venturesome dream big and think positive it is better to move forward with smaller steps and tolerable speed rather than giant steps and high speed asians for example prefer to take small but quick steps because one can quickly recognise wrong or harmful developments and correct them without too much damage the resilience capability of a company is a very individual thing but there is still a general guideline one should follow in my opinion don t try to predict the future but prepare for a wide facet of contingencies and alternatives even unpleasant ones always have a plan b do not put yourself in distress instead maximise your options first as a matter of principle a company should not be built on we do everything as quickly as possible as big as possible with as much success as possible we push as hard as we can we squeeze the lemon ruthlessly and as fast as possible instead think about it and aim at we can not only be successful but also want to maintain success a robust and sustainable success second let s think about how we deal with a constantly changing market but a market that we still want to serve look for long term products multiple branches markets or pillars and networks so that if one doesn t work the other works if you stand on only one leg from the beginning and it breaks down your resilience to get back on your feet becomes terribly hard third another critical point is to ensure a good and healthy mix of your team diversity and above all long serving loyal employees the young are encouraged to think about changes in moderation bring changes to the table and possibly even implement changes but only in a way that does not endanger the company s stability thanks to the wisdom and experience of the older generation fourth success is one thing holding on to it enduring it and persevering is another thing the first needs motivation enthusiasm rolling up one s sleeves and getting started courage daring and activity but the other needs above all seriousness sustainability discipline calm reason patience a long term mindset and people who function humbly fifth it needs a kind of a family idea to run a business for a long time not necessarily a bloodline idea sixth the entrepreneur or boss needs to know that their employees are not just numbers but real people they are valuable humans everyone is irreplaceable in their way and they all have a life outside of business and their job they are all a company s greatest asset dealing with them and our planet in a dignified respectful manner with a corresponding business policy and leadership creates corporate loyalty there needs to be a way to guarantee the proximity between top and bottom the permeability the greater the bonding the more resilient the company becomes seventh if a company is to last 50 or 100 years what does it need first it requires several products that will last long because a business can only survive for generations if it provides products or services adapted to the subject of demand and the zeitgeist today s specialisation is not suitable for this it always makes sense to broaden a company observe sustainable trends not hypes adopt possibly buy up or integrate other companies you operate in several markets and countries with a low cost product division and a premier division offer them in the online shop for the end consumer and have them for the bulk consumer at other prices then the chances are in favour that at least one of them will likely last 100 years reinhold m karner is an entrepreneurship and start up evangelist chairperson entrepreneur

from a distance a seal appears to be napping on the rust coloured rocks members of its small colony grunt at one another as sea spray brings some respite from the searing midsummer heat but on closer inspection one of the seal s eyes is open and pointing vacantly at the sky tess gridley bends over the dead animal and instructs her university students and volunteers to check for parasites fewer bugs means a fresher carcass which is what these researchers are looking for binoculars pressed to her face gridley scans the rocky outcrop and finds five more bodies which the students line up on the rocks in a funereal procession a colony of this size you wouldn t expect to see so many freshly dead she says a young cape fur seal lies dead on the rocky coast of south africa s western cape the species has suffered a wave of mysterious deaths since september last year with scientists struggling to discover the causes image barry christianson china dialogue ocean gridley and her team have travelled to this stretch of western cape province to investigate why thousands of cape fur seals have been washing up along south africa s shores when a wave of deaths started in september 2021 gridley a behavioural biologist and director of research organisation seasearch paused her work on whale and dolphin acoustics to help deal with the unfolding crisis for months she has walked miles of coastline picking through seal bodies searching for clues now with jars of formalin at the ready and gloved up to the elbows she and her team prepare to add six more seals to their evidence base slicing into the first animal they peel back the blubber and muscle in the stench and heat they take samples of lungs liver stomach heart a bright crimson stream makes its way from the body back to the sea gridley meanwhile is focused on an especially grim task extracting the brain where s that axe she asks somebody hands it to her gripping the handle she steadies herself then severs the seal s head a member of marine biologist tess gridley s team drags a deceased seal to the shore one of six found in a single location image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the team collect a liver sample of one of the dead seals adding to a collection from about 60 seals being used to investigate the cause of their deaths image barry christianson china dialogue ocean an ecosystem under stress south africa is renowned for its sea life thousands of visitors come every year to watch whales dive with great whites and even swim with seals in the country s rich kelp forests but when scores of seal foetuses juveniles and adults began washing up last year on western cape beaches it seemed an ominous sign of a marine ecosystem under stress with potentially far reaching consequences for the lucrative tourism economy on which many depend seal die offs aren t new the 2 million strong cape fur population experiences natural cycles of boom and bust and seal pups are often swept out to sea during the windy breeding season pregnant females also occasionally abort foetuses which wash up on the shore but this time the proportion of dead adults was striking while it s normal for a portion of the population to die during the breeding period this was affecting other age groups that aren t usually affected i think that s what sounded the alarm bells says mduduzi seakamela a marine scientist at the south african department of forestry fisheries and environment dffe who monitors populations of sea animals including seals a rescued baby seal at the hout bay seal rescue centre near cape town image barry christianson china dialogue ocean a seal with a red tag on its flipper indicating it has been rescued and later returned to the wild swims in the waters next to the centre image barry christianson china dialogue ocean keeper amos lepenga takes a break to watch the wild seals swim image barry christianson china dialogue ocean across all age groups most beached seals also appeared to be undernourished i can honestly say last year was the worst thing i have ever seen says kim krynauw operational director of the hout bay seal rescue centre based 20km from cape town the centre has for months been rehabilitating beached animals nursing hungry seals back from the brink with a formula rich in electrolytes many rescued animals haven t been so lucky what came back in our necropsies was low body fat no food at all in their bodies starvation krynauw says there is also evidence that some animals are having seizures before they die suggesting disease rather than lack of prey might underpin the die off and in the context of a marine ecosystem that s already showing signs of stress from climate change overfishing and pollution researchers are starting to wonder whether the seal deaths are the latest symptom of a larger decline meal time for the baby seals starts with fish in a blender many of the rescued animals arrive at the centre badly undernourished image barry christianson china dialogue ocean amos lepenga pours the blended mixture enriched with electrolytes into a feeding bottle image barry christianson china dialogue ocean keeper abel banda feeds the baby seals using a funnel and tube image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the acid poisoning theory gridley remembers the week in early september 2021 when this unusual pattern of deaths began sea search s namibian arm started reporting mass deaths and gridley swiftly headed to the cape s west coast a region characterised by white sand beaches fishing villages and seal colonies on the high tide we had tens of aborted pups coming in gridley recalls by october the numbers had risen the dffe seasearch and other ngos including the spca and hout bay seal rescue centre began working together to document the dead but there was limited capacity to analyse carcasses gridley decided to leverage sea search s resources to investigate more systematically the only reason we ve really taken a lead on this is that nobody else has since then under the instruction of two veterinary scientists gridley and team have learned how to tweeze out seal whiskers handy for detecting pollutants in the water clip out segments of seal fin to decipher genetics and extract brains which may have lesions indicating disease late morning on that hot january day gridley finally opens the seal s skull with a nauseating crack and prises out the brain this body will add to about 60 sample sets gathered so far for testing various theories on what is causing the wave of deaths gridley and her team extract a whisker from a dead seal useful for detecting pollutants image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the brain one of the hardest parts to extract can indicate if the animal suffered from any diseases image barry christianson china dialogue ocean one theory is uppermost in researchers minds preliminary analysis shows many animals have oedema on the lungs a type of swelling suggesting they drowned this hints at seizures says luca mendes a veterinarian from the two oceans aquarium in cape town who has been assisting gridley which may indicate poisoning by a neurotoxin called domoic acid a by product of algal blooms domoic acid binds to neurons in the brain and it causes to have seizures and die says frances gulland a veterinary scientist at the wildlife health center university of california davis she was part of a team that first identified domoic acid poisoning in california in 1998 where thousands of sea lions died over the course of just a few weeks it was a mystery at the time she says since then outbreaks have been identified every few years in the state and become a major health concern because the acid also accumulates in commonly consumed fish and shellfish gridley is curious about whether the phenomenon has come to south africa and what it could mean for wildlife as well as people alongside causing seizures vomiting and behavioural change in seals domoic acid can also cross the placental barrier which might explain the high volume of aborted foetuses it could also account for sudden deaths of seemingly healthy animals such as the recent die off of roughly 1 000 cape fur seals in namibia most of which were well nourished cormorants fly across the glassy waters of steenberg s cove in st helena bay 130km north of cape town one possible cause of the seal die off is toxins from algal blooms which are more frequent along this coast image barry christianson china dialogue ocean to find out gridley is working with algae specialist grant pitcher from the dffe he s on the trail of the toxic algae family that produces domoic acid pseudo nitzschia the west coast is subject to a higher frequency of harmful algae pitcher notes because of the regional benguela current that fuels its nutrient rich upwellings the same system that supports the abundant fish which the seals consume so far he s identified two types of pseudo nitzschia that make domoic acid although in much smaller concentrations than the outbreak that drove the california sea lion die off the ultimate proof will be in the seals bodies domoic acid presents in stomach juices faeces and urine but it also leaves the system rapidly which is why finding freshly dead animals is such a boon a case in point is when a few animals were submitted to the south african state vet for domoic acid testing in late 2021 the results were negative but they were treated as inconclusive because the animals had reached the vet a while after death possibly compromising the samples seakamela explains gridley hopes to soon carry out a more comprehensive analysis on the samples she s gathered but tests to identify the acid are very expensive which has stalled her progress for now the samples lie in wait split between her office freezer and the two oceans aquarium for gridley pinning down domoic acid as an acute cause of these deaths would at least explain the carnage of recent months nobody s tested for it properly and therefore nobody s found it so i m hoping that we can be the first people to do so gridley and a team member examine the stomach of a dead seal which may have died from a lack of food image barry christianson china dialogue ocean gridley and her team pack their samples in an ice box for transportation back to cape town where they will await testing for domoic acid poisoning in her office freezer image barry christianson china dialogue ocean unpredictable prey at the same time it s been impossible to ignore the deprived condition of so many of the sampled seals mendes says i don t think i saw one animal that had a healthy level of fat you don t just go from two centimetres of fat to two millimetres overnight that s a gradual process that might suggest a chronic issue at sea the hunger factor is significant because it s evident in other marine species too in late january at the southern african foundation for the conservation of coastal birds sanccob in cape town 130 african penguin eggs were lined up neatly in an orange lit incubation room they had all been abandoned by their parents sanccob researchers think it might come down to availability of prey a volunteer at sanccob prepares to feed a young cape gannet one of several endangered species being looked after by the foundation image barry christianson china dialogue ocean a baby gull sits under the warmth of a heat lamp with the availability of food increasingly unpredictable many chicks end up being abandoned by their parents image barry christianson china dialogue ocean an african penguin chick waits patiently to be hand fed by a sanccob volunteer image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the females were not supposed to lay until march but for the past few years the endangered species hasn t been sticking to the schedule researchers think that when stocks of sardines and anchovy the birds primary prey are unpredictable or scarce penguins breed opportunistically it seems penguins think oh there s fish let s quickly lay an egg and then they lay at random times of the year explains katta ludynia research manager at sanccob recently this means birds breed during high summer when they re more likely to get heat stressed and have to abandon their offspring it s a trend repeated by other endangered birds including cape cormorants and cape gannets in january 2021 sanccob rescued 2 000 cormorant chicks whose parents had taken flight probably due to heat and mostly likely linked to lack of fish says ludynia it s thought that declining fish stocks are behind this combined with climate change shifting where and when fish are available anecdotally some fishers have noticed certain fish species arriving at unusual times in the season and in areas they d not been caught before says christian adams a small scale fisher based in the west coast town of st helena bay that was very unnatural for us he says compounding the stress research shows that seabirds are also having to compete with commercial fishing boats for the unpredictable stock which in the case of african penguins influences their breeding success and survival small scale fisher christian adams centre sets off on a fishing trip from st helena bay accompanied by his friend anthony stofberg and a boy from the neighbourhood image barry christianson china dialogue ocean adams says he s been finding species of fish in areas he s never seen them before during the summer months image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the small catch of cape bream adams brought home the species is not unusual for the season but adams was surprised to also be catching large numbers in november and december last year image barry christianson china dialogue ocean the birds that come to the rescue centre are also increasingly underweight says sanccob veterinarian david roberts we get skinny penguins and other seabirds or we get birds that were unable to go through their normal moult he says roberts explains that skipping a moult suggests a bird hadn t eaten enough to run the risk of waiting weeks onshore while their new waterproof feathers come in i can easily say that s a trend and it s definitely unnatural a multi stranded crisis there may be other food related explanations for the die off that hint at a wider ecosystem in flux emaciated dead seals might be explained by overpopulated colonies possibly enabled by the decline of predatory great white sharks another mystery that researchers are still trying to unpick with growing numbers and limited colony space it s possible that yearlings and juveniles are being turfed off the rocks into the water where unable to fend for themselves they starve another reason for the seal deaths may be overcrowded colonies perhaps caused by the also unexplained decline of the great white shark in south african waters but two oceans aquarium veterinarian luca mendes thinks a compound of different factors are most likely to blame image barry christianson china dialogue ocean there may be further clues from california where in 1998 changes to the eastern boundary upwelling system a current similar to south africa s benguela dramatically shifted the prey base and caused food shortages for sea lions a suite of other factors such as chemical pollution and agricultural run off could also be interacting with prey or changing how seals feed potentially all of those factors combined open a door meaning something like a harmful algal bloom can flourish and affect marine organisms says gridley five months on and several thousand corpses later huge questions remain over the deaths of one of south africa s most charismatic marine species the instinct when a crisis hits is to search for one answer says mendes but he believes that ultimately finding the causes behind the seal die offs will require a multidisciplinary ecosystem level approach that considers toxins pollution climate change and fishing all together as potential drivers of species decline if anything this whole highlights just how little we truly understand about the ocean or the dynamics under the water he says gridley after a long day collecting samples since february seal deaths have started to taper off but she continues her work to decipher the cause and hopes her findings will help if there are future die offs image barry christianson china dialogue ocean after a long day up the west coast and with another necropsy under her belt gridley hopes she s getting closer to understanding the seals plight seal blood cleansed from her arms and face she opens up the freezer in her office and takes in the accumulated work of the previous months each frozen sample representing a lost seal each one an environmental puzzle that she hopes to solve barry christianson contributed reporting to this article

there was lately tried in bennington county court a very interesting case involving the alleged embezzlement by one citizeness of a six quart pail of blueberries harvested by another the case attracted spectators and excited comment in the press of southern vermont and well it might do so though unlikely to be carried to the supreme court the blueberry case may very well go down in history as the triumph of a principle and the end of an era in vermont time was when the courts would have had no jurisdiction over such a matter in any section of the green mountains when the beech seal was affixed not to the deeds but to the backs of interlopers on the farms granted by new hampshire when ethan allen took ticonderoga in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress though holding as one historian very justly remarks no commission from either when in short vermont was still the outlaw state that held her own in single handed fight against the british on the left the yorkers on the right then indeed the mountain where these blueberries were picked would have been the scene of their last reckoning and neither of the stalwart housewives would have troubled judge or jury in the matter she should take who had the power turbulent indeed were the green mountains of the early days ethan allen was i think the only great swashbuckler of the revolution his swaggering feats are commemorated by at least three monuments in his native state whereas the finer genius of seth warner is unmemorialized save by that graceful shaft in the mountain township of peru vermont sent to congress in her adopted son the irishman matthew lyon a swashbuckling legislator if ever there was one his resort to the arbitration of fists with his colleague griswold is not to be sure unparalleled in congressional history but there was a unique element of swagger in his solitary session in the house when every other member of house and senate marched away in state to pay their customary devoirs to the president lyon justly represented on that occasion his almost jacobin constituency vermont used then to cast her tiny vote with herculean energy for thomas jefferson which of our forbears in these rocky valleys could have foreseen what a phalanx we were later to present on the conservative and whiggish side republican vermont to day seems to require breaking up more urgently than the most solid regions of the south our early democracy is departed along with our wild west airs of a century ago but there survives in vermont a very sturdy democracy of the uncapitalized description we may i think be fairly called democratic republicans who ever heard of sumptuary laws in vermont the very names of our villages are a lesson in democracy pumpkin hollow alternates with the proud names of danby shaftesbury and arlington our southwestern counties abound in the names of famous english noblemen of the seventeenth century a certain page of green s history is like a roll call of townships in bennington rutland and windham counties yet intermixed with these sounding and splendid titles on the leveling map of vermont are bald mountain owl s head mother

van buren the crawford county recount for the republican primary for state house district 25 between jody harris and chad puryear has been put on hold until wednesday at the request of harris district 25 is in crawford franklin and washington counties crawford county started the recount saturday morning with washington county s recount to start tuesday after the memorial day holiday election officials for the counties confirmed franklin county s election commission was set to meet late thursday afternoon to decide when it will do a recount according to a spokeswoman at the county clerk s office we stopped the recount today because i had requested to see the original absentee ballots and when i asked for those i was told by the election commissioner bill coleman that they weren t there at the election commission office and when i said where are they he said they were at his home that was when i formally said we need to shut this down harris explained that is not right there is no reason for ballots to be at the home of the election commissioner harris who lives near fayetteville trailed puryear by six votes out of 4 412 cast puryear lives near hindsville final though unofficial results in the race as of thursday morning showed puryear with 2 209 votes to harris 2 203 harris led by 29 votes in washington county 1 360 to 1 331 puryear led by 28 votes in crawford county 740 to 712 franklin county s 269 votes in this race favored puryear 138 to 131 coleman claims the issue was caused by having incorrect programming for the primary elections as a result of recent redistricting he said the county clerk s office worked to verify voters had the correct information on the primary ballots but by then the absentee ballots had already been sent when the clerk s office went back and looked at those ballot applications that they had mailed out there was only one person who had received a ballot that was incorrect as far as the contents that they were supposed to vote in coleman said the county clerk contacted that voter and they made the exchange to get them the correct ballot to be able to cast their ballot all of the rest of them had the correct information on there on who to vote for the problem was that when those ballots came back in they were programmed and barcoded with the original programming on the election he explained when we went back and reprogrammed it it changed the code to the barcodes to be able to read so the tabulating machines would not read those ballots so we processed all of the ballots on election day coleman added crawford county s election commission is working out of two offices as they move equipment into a new building he said the old office is adjacent to the county courthouse which made it easier for people to observe and count ballots on election night since we have those two offices and everything though what i did yesterday was transferring those canceled ballots that we had transferred the votes from to the new ballot stock i was transporting them from one location to the other as well as a bunch of other stuff and i ended up leaving those in my truck and they ended up coming home with me he explained coleman reiterated the votes were properly transferred to the new ballots calling the ones he had in his truck trash by that point in time he said he has been in contact with the state board of election commissioners and the head of elections at the secretary of state s office to explain the issue if miss harris had not left this morning based on my conversations with the state board and the secretary of state s office we could ve resumed recount today and finished it coleman said but she left before i got back in there so we did not want to resume the recount without her being present in addition to that what i asked the state board and the secretary of state s office is if they wanted to send observers up that might cool the situation a little bit and they can be there and see the process as we go through it coleman said the recount for crawford county has been rescheduled to 9 a m wednesday with results likely to be announced by the end of the day my hope is that truth and transparency will prevail and we ll have a good outcome for the election for either candidate harris said i think anybody who works hard and runs for office what we want at the end of the day is a fair and truthful outcome so we want to make sure all ballots are accounted for and we have an opportunity for transparency
the washington newspapers recently reported the news that a senator s wife had been the victim of a theft of a 2500 diamond and platinum bracelet it was added that the bracelet was the gift of a shipbuilding company in token of the lady s service in christening one of its boats the news occurred at a time when congress was busy with the consideration of ethics in government yet no commentator saw the tie connecting the little with the big news the silence could not illustrate better what is wrong with the contemporary scene in the capital the borderline between right and wrong has been gradually whittled away and increasingly it is not what is right that counts but as the president puts it what is legal the problem of accepting tokens of the above description comes up very frequently in a capital society which is divided between givers and recipients of favors a supreme court justice makes it a practice to return everything charles evans hughes when secretary of state limited his acceptance to petty consumables and later added handkerchiefs others will take only packages of the specialties of a country which has been a beneficiary of favors or is an expectant beneficiary you have a low opinion of yourself said one man dealing in foreign aid if you are so rigid as to be rude when some sort of anniversary comes around but all this is beside the point of the obviously bad practices which are complained of in regard to congress the issue of the kickback or the pocketing of part of the salaries paid to legislators staffs has led to some convictions it is as illegal as payroll padding if there is any cure here it lies in insistence on publicizing congressional staffs and their salaries but you can never get such information except by grace of the official clerks self correction is not a habit of the houses of congress nor is condemnation of errant colleagues his is shown in the extraordinary sympathy for colleagues who get caught in misdemeanors even after representative andrew j may was sent to jail for his liaison with war contractors the majority leader representative john w mccormack told an applauding house that he had represented his constituents with loyalty this lack of selfdiscipline is recounted with copious examples in a new book by h h wilson called congress corruption and compromise the book sums up the history of the last few decades and it does not make pretty reading the ethics of washington senator paul h douglas and his subcommittee on ethics arc scrutinizing the behavior of officials in the executive branch of our government this investigation came as a result of the rfc inquiry at that time the whisper was that dubious practices in the rfc amounted to chicken feed compared with what was going on elsewhere the comptroller general whetted the investigators he traced the shockingly low moral standard in the capital to both big government and war government in wartime the lid was off high federal officials accepted cocktail parties hotel accommodation and transportation from contractors while drawing expenses and allowances from the government some found cushy jobs awaiting them from firms whose claims they had settled sheer size said the comptroller general leaves knavery obscured and undetected the false card is lost in the shuffle in this correspondent s opinion the absence of standards is still the exception but there are enough examples of lack of virtue to make the citizen worry the trouble arises in the quest for a remedy in the executive branch which is not elective several cures are suggested senator douglas has a bill for a code of fair practices in the regulatory commissions he would have the commissioners bound by the same written and unwritten practices that are supposed to govern the judiciary for instance a judge will not take counsel for one of the parties into private consultation the other counsel has to be present the comptroller general would have congress restore an act of 1872 which made government employees leaving the service ineligible for a period of two years to serve as counsel or agent in pressing any claim against the united states that may have been pending in their department before they left senator douglas has hardened this proposal by suggesting a two year prohibition on private employment of anybody who has dealt with the claims of the employing concern while in government service care of course has to be taken in airing these matters not to vilify the government service as such of late years more than one department has had its prestige undermined by indiscriminate blackening the prime example is the state department now the butt of the same kind of jokes as the banking profession was in the twenties yet no finer or more patriotic men can be found in the capital than some of the officials in the stale department divided responsibility administration of foreign aid is now distributed among various government agencies for instance point four is in the state department but technical assistance is in eca military aid seems to be divided between the state department and eca a movement in which most of the private study groups have joined would set up an entirely new agency for the handling of the 8 5 billion dollar foreign aid program for the current fiscal year the object is not so much efficiency as to leave the state department stranded however this is almost like burning down the house to roast a pig after all the state department is the instrument of our foreign affairs if it is denied the administration of foreign aid there will be two consequences first our foreign policy will be impeded for the defense of the national interest and the achievement of national objectives are dependent upon bargaining foreign aid thus needs to be regarded in some cases as a weapon however if the aid is divorced from diplomacy it will degenerate into a giveaway proposition as some of it has degenerated already secondly what appears to be coordination will in fact turn out to be the opposite there will be as in wartime two arms of government in foreign capitals and those capitals in consequence will find themselves in a fog in dealing with uncle sam the lesson should have been learned from the experience of eca and the state department when eca was sel up secretary of state marshall fought against a separate establishment because he felt that in such a situation the country would have two secretaries of state but his plea was drowned by the general antipathy to the state department which was spearheaded in this instance by senator vandenberg the result was as marshall had forecast in europe paul hoffman was regarded as secretary of state and though he was far more active than secretary acheson and far more animated with a bold concept of leadership the result nonetheless was rivalry and confusion this confusion and this rivalry were duplicated at the operating level sometimes there was harmony between ambassador and eca mission chief often not the same rivalry exists in the present eca administration under william c foster running the propaganda war at last the president has set up a psychological strategy board and gordon gray is back in washington to head it mr gray had a welldeserved reputation as an administrator when he left the army department to become president of the universiiy of north carolina the mandate he has been given is purposely vague but the gray board may turn out to be the planning group at the elbow of the national security council which general albert c wedomeyer advocated at the macarthur hearings the general s idea was that only through such a unit could we regain the initiative and keep it at any rate the gray board will have prestige and that is vital it will devote its brains and energies to the mapping out of cold war policies which when passed by the security council will be rigidly adhered to nothing is more important diplomatic policy or the strategy of the cold war changes from week to week palestine was a good example china is the current example when assistant secretary of state dean busk came out with a brand new policy secretary acheson put on a dead pan face in his conference with the newsmen and insisted that there had been no change in united states policy on china general ridgway has said that our national destiny is dependent upon our driving a wedge between peking and moscow by all the means at our disposal suppose that this becomes policy as the result of studies pro and eon of ihe gray board then presumably the word would go down the line and to all our representatives abroad and all actions would have to fall within the framework of this policy hitherto the national security council has not been able to undertake this thinking task for the good and sufficient reason that all the members of the council are working heads of departments truman in 1952 mr truman has recovered enough stock out of the cease fire to be spoken about here and there as a contender in 1952 six months ago nobody in the capital would have offered to wager on any such prospect but bis latest speeches and actions certainly reflect a recapture both of self confidence and standing he is not as ready now to step aside for general eisenhower as he was in 1948 it was only by a fluke it can now be revealed that general ike did not stand in truman s place three years ago the movement to draft ike had truman s initial backing but it was george allen who spiked it allen was court jester for f d r then for truman and seems to be in the same role in the eisenhower train he advised ike against running however it is still hard to believe that truman would do any stepping aside for anybody in the event that his stock continucs to improve politicians who make the crossing to paris seem to be as thick as arms shipments they report variously on their return and one gets most of one s impressions so tight lipped are they at second hand some are certain that eisenhower would not take a democratic nomination others explain that while he is 100 per cent back of truman s foreign policy he is a congenital republican in domestic affairs be this as it may the tight hold that taft has on the party machine makes the admittance of eisenhower difficult despite the clear fact that he is the people s choice tn that event what the time to declare himself cannot be far off everything for everybody it is proving to be a vain task to persuade both congress and people that korea is not a war itself but only an episode in a continuing war something of a letdown seems to have arrived it remains to be seen whether the military will share it the demonstration of military letdown is still to come but the town is full of reports that the military will take advantage of the breathing spell by keeping some items such as tanks and aircraft a little longer on the drafting board so as to get the advantage of yet another design if some degree of rescheduling does take place then the disbursement of orders and the output of defense money will be a longer process the result will be felt on the fisc though not till after the year end in other words though we are now spending half a billion dollars a week in military expenditures there might not be a deficit next june after all even assuming a 6 billion dollar tax program instead of the 10 billion dollars the administration wants don t forget that the anticipated deficit this past june turned into a surplus a reminder of the habit of bad estimating on the pessimistic side in this emergency the administration has acted on the theory that it is possible to have guns and butter together as some writer has put it the administration also is providing the cow meaning full investment in civilian plant as well as full civilian production and military investment ideally investment in non munitions capacity should be firmly curbed and most of the military production should come out of existing facilities even if this involved a curb on civilian production the compensation would be substantial there would not have been the disgraceful postkorean scramble among the allies for raw materials america s part in the scramble was due to the anxiety to fill both civilian and military demands nor would there be the danger of overdoing development of marginal mines here and abroad this brings in its train a problem in readjustment as indeed does overexpansion in factory space at home finally by way of example you could get more radar development if the electronics industry produced less for civilian purposes the argument for guns and butter is that our fabulous economy can afford both but there is a better argument 1t is that if the civilian gives way to the military too much you might bring on a garrison state and that this would make hostilities inevitable there was good sense in john l lewis s warning against getting all dressed up no slate in history has been able to avoid a shooting war in such a posture but if you can provide the butter as well as the guns then readjustment from emergency is that much less difficult as to the cow the animal might be restrained by a wise use of the tax weapon tax concessions have been given to the producers of strategic materials why shouldn t tax handicaps be devised as a deterrent against plant investment which is unwarranted mood of the capital the mood of the capital is oscillating between preparedness and letdown in some discerning minds the notion is arising that settlement over korea might be taken to develop a policy of national objectives since korea the country has been operating not upon a plan but at the behest of constantly changing military requirements ad hoc preparedness has been the rule side by side with ad hoc diplomacy the spur has been provided by economic mobilizer wilson he has used the carrot and the stick approach the stick is the fear of inflation and the carrot is a date when the emergency will be over as to inflation when the present price recession is over opinions of course vary though the confusion has never been more profound the economists are st niggling to figure out spending ideas of businessmen and consumers if military requirements are spread out then inflation is not the bogey that is now conjured up but there is no uncertainty in the administration the administration still holds up the bogey of inflation for purposes of trying to perpetuate price controls as well as lax and credit and allocation controls the great need is to get over our episodic ideas and get used to a crisis economy for an indefinite future

welcomed by investors bank of russia rejects ruble gold peg idea differs with kremlin this article from bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers here it is in full bank of russia governor elvira nabiullina dismissed the idea of pegging the ruble to gold after the kremlin said it was a proposal under consideration it is not being discussed in any way nabiullina told reporters at a briefing friday after the central bank cut the key interest rate by 300 basis points the ruble must continue to have a floating exchange rate she said though volatility of the currency will be higher amid capital controls imposed after russia began its invasion of ukraine her comment appeared to contradict president vladimir putin s spokesman dmitry peskov who said earlier friday that this question is now being discussed peskov pointed to comments by security council secretary nikolai patrushev on linking the currency to gold and other commodities in an interview with a state run newspaper this week while offering no further details unprecedented sanctions on russia s central bank over the invasion of ukraine deprived it of access to about half of its holdings leaving it in possession of only gold and yuan before the war putin repeatedly argued that russia needs to cut dependence on the dollar as a global reserve currency speculation has been rife that sanctions on russia may herald a far reaching shift that could bolster bullion analysts like credit suisse group ag nyse cs s zoltan pozsar predict that the seizure of the central bank s foreign exchange reserves will result in a new monetary paradigm where gold plays a greater role speaking with rossiyskaya gazeta patrushev said experts are examining proposals to back the ruble s value with gold and other goods as part of an alternative system of finance that guarantees a measure of sovereignty and reduces the link to the dollar continuing a multi year effort to reduce exposure to the u s currency the russian central bank cut the share of dollars in reserves to 10 9 as of jan 1 from from 21 2 a year earlier gold was down slightly at 21 5 until the invasion of ukraine forced nabiullina to enact capital controls the ruble was allowed to trade freely since 2014 its value determined by the market my view demanding payment for commodity exports in rubles is a major escalation of the stress russia is imposing on the

van buren the crawford county recount for the republican primary for state house district 25 between jody harris and chad puryear has been put on hold until wednesday at the request of harris district 25 is in crawford franklin and washington counties crawford county started the recount saturday morning with washington county s recount to start tuesday after the memorial day holiday election officials for that counties confirmed franklin county s election commission was set to meet late thursday afternoon to decide when it will do a recount according to a spokeswoman at the county clerk s office we stopped the recount today because i had requested to see the original absentee ballots and when i asked for those i was told by the election commissioner bill coleman that they weren t there at the election commission office and when i said where are they he said they were at his home that was when i formally said we need to shut this down harris explained that is not right there is no reason for ballots to be at the home of the election commissioner harris who lives near fayetteville trailed puryear by six votes out of 4 412 cast puryear lives near hindsville final though unofficial results in the race as of thursday morning showed puryear with 2 209 votes to harris 2 203 harris led by 29 votes in washington county 1 360 to 1 331 puryear led by 28 votes in crawford county 740 to 712 franklin county s 269 votes in this race favored puryear 138 to 131 coleman claims the issue was caused by having incorrect programming for the primary elections due to the recent redistricting he said the county clerk s office worked to verify voters had the correct information on the primary ballots but by then the absentee ballots had already been sent when the clerk s office went back and looked at those ballot applications that they had mailed out there was only one person who had received a ballot that was incorrect as far as the contents that they were supposed to vote in coleman said the county clerk contacted that voter and they made the exchange to get them the correct ballot to be able to cast their ballot all of the rest of them had the correct information on there on who to vote for the problem was that when those ballots came back in they were programmed and barcoded with the original programming on the election he explained when we went back and reprogrammed it it changed the code to the barcodes to be able to read so the tabulating machines would not read those ballots so we processed all of the ballots on election day coleman added crawford county s election commission is working out of two offices as they move equipment into a new building he said the old office is adjacent to the county courthouse which made it easier for people to observe and count ballots on election night since we have those two offices and everything though what i did yesterday was transferring those canceled ballots that we had transferred the votes from to the new ballot stock i was transporting them from one location to the other as well as a bunch of other stuff and i ended up leaving those in my truck and they ended up coming home with me he explained coleman reiterated the votes were properly transferred to the new ballots calling the ones he had in his truck trash by that point in time he said he has been in contact with the state board of election commissioners and the head of elections at the secretary of state s office to explain the issue if miss harris had not left this morning based on my conversations with the state board and the secretary of state s office we could ve resumed recount today and finished it coleman said but she left before i got back in there so we did not want to resume the recount without her being present in addition to that what i asked the state board and the secretary of state s office is if they wanted to send observers up that might cool the situation a little bit and they can be there and see the process as we go through it coleman said the recount for crawford county has been rescheduled to 9 a m wednesday with results likely to be announced by the end of the day my hope is that truth and transparency will prevail and we ll have a good outcome for the election for either candidate harris said i think anybody who works hard and runs for office what we want at the end of the day is a fair and truthful outcome so we want to make sure all ballots are accounted for and we have an opportunity for transparency
the white supremacist theory blames the nation s natural demographic shift on jews there is an overlap between rhetoric on replacement theory and immigration those who have repeated the theory include four sitting members of congress congressional candidate joe kent took to twitter last summer to repeat a racist theme that has become commonplace in the country s immigration debate and upcoming elections the left is supporting an invasion of illegal immigrants to replace american voters and undercut working class jobs kent wrote then in the spring in an interview with a white nationalist group he nodded along as the host said democrats don t care about the anglos or the founding stock of america you believe they re trying to replace white americans the host asked yes kent responded yeah and they ll say if you even mention that you re some sort of a neo nazi white nationalist that s the replacement theories well no you re literally trying to replace an american prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide

given time these innovative companies can put investors on a path to complete financial freedom regardless of how long you ve been putting your money to work on wall street the first five months of 2022 have been a challenge since hitting their all time highs in early january the 126 year old dow jones industrial average and widely followed s p 500 have tumbled 13 and 18 respectively meanwhile the growth stock focused nasdaq composite is off 30 from its november record closing high while there s no question that big one day moves lower in the market can be unsettling and tug at investors emotions it s far more important to recognize the history behind these moves namely that crashes corrections and bear markets are an inevitable part of the investing cycle and that over time they ve always eventually been wiped away by a bull market rally going shopping during steep corrections and bear markets offers investors the opportunity to buy innovative growth stocks that can deliver transformational wealth with some patience of course what follows are five examples of growth stocks with supercharged return potential that can over many years or decades put investors on a path to complete financial independence okta the first innovative growth stock that s been clobbered during the downturn is identity verification solutions company okta okta 4 10 okta has been punished for its near term forecast which calls for more losses as well as the nosebleed premium to sales that the company s shares were once valued at but that s all history as of now what makes okta such a no brainer buy is the evolution of cybersecurity software from optional to a basic necessity with businesses accelerating the shift of data online and into the cloud in the wake of the pandemic third party providers like okta are being leaned on more than ever to recognize and respond to potential threats since okta operates a cloud native platform and leans on artificial intelligence ai it should be able to thwart attacks more effectively than on premises solutions this efficacy is what can sustain a 20 or higher annual growth rate as well as desensitize the company to recessions and economic pullbacks additionally investors should be excited about the auth0 acquisition which closed last year aside from gobbling up a competitor okta s purchase of auth0 opens the door for okta to spread its wings internationally this overseas growth should come in handy in the latter half of the decade which is when europe should be well past the inflationary supply chain and geopolitical issues currently haunting the region pubmatic another company that offers transformational wealth to long term investors is cloud based small cap adtech stock pubmatic pubm 5 21 advertising revenue is often the first thing to get hit when a recession strikes which is why pubmatic has taken it on the chin recently but this short term pain is investors opportunity to pounce on a truly innovative provider of programmatic ad solutions in simple terms pubmatic is what s known as a sell side provider it acts on behalf of publishers to automate and optimize the sale of their digital ad display space interestingly this doesn t mean the highest priced ad always gets placed in an available space rather pubmatic leans on ai and machine learning algorithms to place relevant content in front of users this way advertisers stay happy and publishers can command more pricing power over time pubmatic is at the center of the digital ad revolution it s no secret that ad dollars are shifting away from print and toward mobile video and connected tv whereas the digital ad industry is slated to grow by a little more than 10 annually pubmatic has been more than doubling up the industry s growth rate as one final note keep in mind that the company built its cloud infrastructure not having to rely on third parties can allow for scaling efficiencies to push its operating margins higher than its peers teladoc health a third innovative growth stock with transformational wealth ambitions is telemedicine kingpin teladoc health tdoc 4 64 the reason shares of teladoc are down 90 from their pandemic high is simple the company continues to lose more money than expected and it grossly overpaid for its acquisition of livongo health a leader in applied health signals that overpriced acquisition led to a mammoth first quarter write down that equates to more than the company s current share price while management deserves a kick in the pants following the livongo deal there s no denying teladoc s pole position in today s changing personalized care landscape the beauty of telemedicine is that the entire healthcare treatment chain wins although virtual visits can t replace all doctor patient interactions it s ultimately more convenient for patients and can allow physicians to keep closer tabs on chronically ill patients the latter should lead to improved patient outcomes and less money out of the pockets of health insurers and anything that results in lower expenses for insurers is something they re bound to promote prior to the pandemic teladoc s sales grew by an annual average of 74 over a six year stretch which demonstrates that telemedicine isn t a fad what s more the livongo deal should pay long term dividends as both companies use their customer bases for cross selling purposes once teladoc can put a number of acquisition related expenses in the rearview mirror wall street is likely to recognize the value in this fast growing platform once again planet 13 holdings a fourth innovative growth stock with transformational wealth building potential over the long run is multi state cannabis operator planet 13 holdings plnh f 2 94 yes a small cap marijuana stock pot stocks have been a buzzkill for 15 months and counting largely because the democrat led congress has failed to pass legalization or cannabis banking reforms as anticipated by wall street however with about three quarters of the country legalizing weed in some capacity 19 states of which allow adult recreational consumption and or sale plenty of organic opportunity awaits planet 13 no matter what happens on capitol hill what makes planet 13 so special is the company s operating model instead of planting its proverbial flag in as many legalized states as possible planet 13 has only two operating dispensaries but they re massive the flagship las vegas superstore spans 112 000 square feet that s bigger than the average walmart while the orange county superstore in santa ana calif is 55 000 square feet in size with 30 devoted to sales space in other words the company is focused as much on the nostalgia of the buying experience as it is on making a sale although planet 13 s superstore blueprint hasn t been duplicated and should be a long term moneymaker the company is also expanding into new markets with a more traditional community based retail setup it has already signed two leases in florida with these stores expected to contribute to the company s results in 2023 nio a fifth innovative growth stock that can deliver transformational wealth with some patience is china based electric vehicle ev manufacturer nio nio 5 35 auto stocks of all sizes are contending with historic headwinds at the moment semiconductor shortages high inflation and supply chain disruptions caused by covid 19 and or the russian invasion of ukraine have caused nio and many of its peers to significantly scale back production but the long term opportunity for evs is plain as day what s intriguing about nio is that it s operating in the largest auto market in the world china and is already going head to head with tesla for example the recently introduced et7 and et5 sedans offer a top tier battery upgrade that allows 621 miles on a single charge that provides substantially better range than either of tesla s flagship sedans the model 3 and model s aside from new vehicle innovation nio is also being smart with its high margin service potential in august 2020 the company initiated its battery as a service subscription which allows buyers to charge swap and upgrade their batteries as well as net a discount on the purchase price of their nio ev in return nio collects a monthly subscription fee and more importantly locks in the brand loyalty of new buyers look for nio to deliver exceptional sales growth for the next decade if not well beyond

policy you can opt out at any time advertisement new york is facing a crippling housing shortage but there are thousands of vacant homes across the state that could help ease its affordability crisis one group has a solution to turn these so called zombie homes into affordable housing by forcing banks to complete the foreclosure process and return the housing to livable conditions zombie homes are everything they sound like decrepit dangerous and abandoned properties but they are also a relic of the subprime loan gold rush of the mid 2000s a time when many communities of color fell victim to predatory lending practices that often ended in foreclosure the local initiatives support corporation a national nonprofit organization has funded and provided guidance to the department of housing preservation and development which is responsible for developing and maintaining new york city s stock of affordable housing to ensure banks follow the state s zombie law to restore vacant homes into affordable units advertisement there are an estimated 1 3 million zombie homes across the us and new york state has the highest share as of 2022 thousands of these vacant homes are sprinkled throughout the state especially in communities of color they are not only dampening property values and fostering local crime the wasted housing stock is also contributing to the state s worsening housing shortage but there s a solution in the works said jenny weyel the director of neighborhood stabilization at new york city s hpd we ve brought successful lawsuits against banks who have let vacant homes deteriorate and now we are finding ways to renovate and resell them to low income families she said new york is overrun with zombies hpd estimates that more than 2 000 zombie homes stand vacant in nyc alone related stories as new york s housing crisis escalates prices are spiking and in an eerie similarity to the great recession people are losing their homes through evictions and foreclosures advertisement in 2013 a wave of foreclosures hit new york resulting in a surplus of vacant houses and homes hanging in the foreclosure process when the state became home to the second largest housing foreclosure inventory in the nation the state attorney general s office introduced the abandoned property neighborhood relief act which became known as the zombie law with the local initiatives support corporation s financial help hpd has used the law to force banks to make good on their promises of maintaining new york s vacant homes the law the first of its kind could serve as a model for other states hoping to tackle backlogs of vacant and distressed houses with bank liens it requires financial institutions to maintain the outside of vacant homes that hold delinquent mortgages fixing windows trimming grass and patching roofs until a foreclosure process is completed if banks disregard the law they are fined a noncompliance fee of 500 a day for each house and so far it s worked on more than 11 000 homes advertisement through the vacants initiative lisc and hpd have ensured banks comply with the law by tracking and studying properties thus certifying that vacant homes are maintained properly and do not present a threat to the communities they plague their efforts have also led to new pathways for restoring these properties to affordable housing every vacant house restored means a safe affordable home for a family a boost to the tax rolls and an infusion of vitality and care for the block and the neighborhood helene caloir the senior director of the new york state housing stabilization fund told insider it has a positive multiplier effect on the life of the community that you can see just by walking around success in brownsville a home located in the neighborhood of brownsville brooklyn is one of the city s biggest success stories in 2017 wells fargo owned the vacant home but had failed to maintain the property hpd filed a complaint advertisement when it didn t receive a sufficient response from wells fargo the city demolished the property leaving the bank on the hook for the demolition fee seeking forgiveness for that debt wells fargo transferred ownership of the property to the city of new york by 2024 the property will be included in a habitat for humanity homeownership project that plans to transform it into affordable multifamily housing with new york city s housing crisis we can t let homes sit vacant for years weyel said zombie homes are a potentially untapped source of affordable housing families could be living in these homes and they could provide a homeownership opportunity for someone who might not be able to afford it
with shoppers tastes quickly shifting many retailers now find themselves with a surplus of merchandise driving up costs new york reuters major united states retailers that recently scrambled to restock shelves amid product shortages disclosed this week that their stores are now packed with too much merchandise and some are even doing what was unthinkable a few months ago discounting unsold goods it is a sign of possible more trouble to come for retailers amid soaring inflation and higher gas prices with shoppers tastes quickly shifting many retailers now find themselves with a surplus of merchandise driving up costs costco wholesale said its inventories ballooned 26 per cent in its fiscal third quarter ended on may 8 that included a few hundred million dollars of extra holiday merchandise and being a little heavy on small appliances and household items at gap a 34 per cent spike in inventories was caused by poor sales at old navy and longer transit times for goods chief financial officer katrina o connell said on thursday may 26 similarly macy s chief executive jeff gennette this week cited an imbalance in inventory supply chain constraints relaxed resulting in it receiving goods from overseas earlier than we expected he said meanwhile shoppers changed buying patterns buying fewer home items while snapping up occasion based clothing and other merchandise average retail inventories in the us are rising at a faster pace than sales growth according to citi research on 18 retailers first quarter results as at may 22 at 11 of the 18 inventories rose by 10 percentage points more than sales did according to citi analyst paul lejuez that is the widest gap since before the coronavirus pandemic began illustrating a trend that began in march 2022 during the supply chain crisis major retailers went on buying sprees loading up on a range of merchandise and bulking up investments in merchandise so they would have enough goods in stock for shoppers flush with cash due to stimulus checks but the retailers moves backfired according to executives and analysts with inflation soaring and fuel prices jumping shoppers retrenched quite rapidly buying less clothing tvs and high margin appliances that scenario is prompting retailers like walmart and macy s to clear out excess inventories by discounting more items and offering deeper promotions a move that could erode margins walmart ceo doug mcmillon said on its earnings call that it had started aggressive price rollbacks to boost sales of some higher margin goods including apparel as inflation lifted prices of everything from tvs to toothpaste some lower income consumers have curbed their spending according to walmart and target higher income shoppers have shown resiliency snapping up suits gowns and footwear and spending more on services economic data and results from retailers that cater to more affluent households showed holding excess merchandise proves expensive as warehousing costs rise walmart store and distribution centres had 32 per cent more merchandise target had 43 per cent more goods compared with a year earlier and best buy had 9 per cent more merchandise in the first quarter the retailers said
the combatants by t h thomas i a foreign correspondent following on the heels of the russian advance into poland described enthusiastically the long columns of marching men with horse drawn transport motorized units tanks tractors and the general array of mechanical equipment his allusions to the vast number of broken down motor vehicles by the roadside seemed a little ominous what was left unsaid brought clearly to mind the obvious fact that no army of occupation in this region could be kept going by motor transport in no part of poland are the roads so few and bad as in this eastern and northern sector in the whole region east of brestlitovsk in no part is there so little road material for making a proper highway for this first advance the dependence on transport by road was a necessary expedient as the break of gauge at the frontier made it impossible for the russian railways to send trains forward with their advancing armies when the germans swept forward over southern russia in the bread offensive of 1918 they took over the russian locomotives and rolling stock as well as the railway personnel and with all this operated a russian railway system under german control this involved transshipment at the frontier on account of the change of gauge but this delay was less serious than that involved in relaying some thousands of miles of russian track and the painful shortage of rolling stock at home made it out of the question to provide german trains for southern russia so desperate was the need of grain that the outstanding railway specialist at the general staff general gröner was sent out to take charge there while a special mission was sent to moscow to give expert aid in gathering raw materials despite all groner s efforts the bread offensive ended in bitter disappointment while at moscow after four months hard work the mission reported not a single practical result accomplished this was the first of many ventures in quest of the golden fleece and since that time american and european technical experts have been constantly employed at moscow in the effort to stimulate the flow of russian raw materials as long ago as 1925 germany joined in the effort with a generous advance of long term credits england and france in turn sowed this same grain all three failed to reap a harvest on each occasion moreover the russians themselves were anxious to achieve success not to rescue a political ally but to meet the desperate needs of their own industries they were striving to increase their export trade whatever the causes the results were the same neither financial aid nor foreign technical guidance has ever been able to speed up production or to change the queer workings of the russian industrial machine the problems involved in a change of gauge now arise again on the polish frontier instead of operating the polish railways on the existing gauge as an emergency measure the russians promptly decided to relay all track on the russian gauge and this work has already begun this means also that all the polish locomotives and rolling stock become useless until they too can be rebuilt to fit the new gauge it will not be accomplished soon the russian share of poland is larger by some ten thousand square miles than all the new england states together and has apparently a good deal larger population a railway friend to whom one turned for guidance pointed out the peculiar complications and dangers involved in shifting an existing network of track to a broader gauge he summed up the matter curtly take all new england relay all the track reset every switch and switch lever and all the crossings uproot and plant over again all the train yards and station yards and every roundhouse how many cranes have you ready for the job how many cars with engineering equipment how many track superintendents and foremen are you going to work on through the winter on hard frozen ground in the meantime he added while the work goes on along this 400 mile stretch of frontier you will have to put up the standard signs no passing road under construction detour this prospect suggests a fairly effective traffic barrier for some time to come however the volume of traffic between russia and germany will not be great although each state has been desperately anxious to increase its foreign trade the planned economy of these two governments has had the curious effect of shrinking the trade between the two to insignificant figures in a special article on the new soviet nazi trade agreement the frankfurter zeitung of october 1 pointed out the decline in striking fashion german exports to russia in reichsmarks 1931 762 700 000 1938 31 800 000 german imports from russia 1930 486 300 000 1938 47 400 000 russia s total foreign trade in this period has declined to something less than half her trade with germany has dropped to about one fifteenth among the exports to russia the most important declines came in machinery and other manufactures of iron and steel the things russia now particularly needs these items germany has consistently been unable to deliver under the barter agreements made with other countries during the last few years the frankfurter zeitung in surveying the field of what germany might be able to furnish suggested textiles which russia does not import also bicycles radio apparatus pianos musical instruments and chinaware in other words a mixed bag of surplus stocks left unsold in germany and still less salable in russia this offers scant prospect of much increase in germany s exports and by the same token russia s shipments will have to come from such produce as she is willing to send out without a return ii the russian advance in the west involves also the building up of a new military frontier the best part of the russian army has long been established in the regions adjoining the western frontier the barracks and all the housekeeping mechanism necessary for large forces in permanent stations have gradually been set up while the railway network has been filled out in accord with strategical necessities the frontier lenin offered the poles in 1920 cut at random across the pre war network like a tear across a printed page since then these jagged edges have been patched and mended by new construction new approach lines and concrete highways have been built and a main line parallel to the frontier has been double tracked by means of all this the red army could plan an effective defense and on this alone rested any real military security all this is left derelict by shifting the frontier a hundred or two hundred miles to the west at the outset of winter the russian divisions will have to establish themselves along a relatively bare and naked frontier with bad roads and without concrete highways and with a railway network left as jagged and broken as in 1920 this wide unorganized zone is necessarily far weaker than the old frontier and for a long while to come the military position of russia in the west will be less secure than before whatever hitler s distrust of stalin military safety alone at present will not require leaving any great number of german combat divisions on guard in poland for russia meanwhile the displacement of garrisons the equipping of the new frontier and above all the reconstruction of the polish railways will amount to a major operation one requiring not only a vast effort but also a farreaching diversion of matériel and of railway transport it comes at a time when the russian railways are badly short of good rolling stock for their work at home when the railway services are in such a condition that even a washed out bridge causes interminable confusion and delay when in fact not only the railways but the whole administrative machine carry along in a state of tension comparable to that of a nation at war this last partition of poland leaves russia far less effective as an ally of germany than she was before while the war itself vastly increases the tension of her industrial and economic régime the closing of the baltic and the overland routes to the west cuts off direct access to her best markets while the freezing of vladivostok will close throughout the winter her outlets via the pacific her essential imports are no less threatened her industrial economy depends largely upon imports of machinery and tools from the west germany can now supply little or none in england and france she will not be on the priority list while the united states suddenly becomes remote and far away the paradox of an immensely powerful nation and a pitifully feeble machinery of state is so to speak an established tradition of russian history under whatever regime and whatever changing set of circumstances there recurs always the curious disparity between the potential energy and effective horsepower at all times too the solution adopted has been to change the engineer the minister long in favor is disgraced and each successor in turn is expected to achieve instantly the miracle of making the same old machine work from the standpoint of practical administration the successive five year plans or the system of purges in favor under stalin express the same instinct to deal with shortcomings of administration by sudden and drastic expedients the expedients change but the personal solution continues to be the patent medicine relied on and the general governmental habit represents a continuation rather than a change the violent contrast between the tsardom and the new régime has tended to obscure the departmental continuity between the two it has come to be fairly well recognized that the framework of the red army through the first years after 1917 was made up largely of a personnel of officers and soldiers trained and formed in the old imperial army some 22 000 officers continued in the service and of course an infinitely greater number of soldiers from the old ranks the railway service in an even greater degree must then have constituted the same old machine unless the bulk of its personnel had held over the railways would never have continued operating throughout the chaotic period beginning in 1918 and could never have picked up so quickly at the end of the civil war a new race of firemen engineers and traffic officials did not suddenly spring out of the soil the old personnel continued at work with the old much too old matériel locomotives that were judged far out of date in 1914 still have to do duty today and despite the golden horizons of the five year plan four fifths or so of the rolling stock is without automatic brakes while the coupling pin of our boyhood days is still the thing in common use one essential change however is that after bitter experience the old régime had learned that a workable railway service was necessary to a modern state and that only by a heavy outlay of capital year by year could such a thing be built up the old railway system had conspicuous shortcomings but it had not been consistently skimped and starved ever since 1918 on the other hand the soviet railway services have had to carry on under a government interested primarily in other things in hitler s germany it may be noted the same thing is true the difference is that during the post war years the feeble german republic rebuilt from top to bottom a plant left derelict by the war the establishment hitler has been steadily skimping and starving was in first rate condition in 1933 the russian railway administration throughout twenty years on the other hand has had to keep on living in a ruined house all the vast projects undertaken have ended in mere patchwork repairs and the huge sums spent or planned for the railways have been swallowed up in the continuing deficit of a worn out and inadequate establishment continually breaking under the burden imposed upon it in the lines constructed since 1920 according to the judgment of a german railway expert the general standard of construction recalls that of field railways laid down during the war in addition there is the overwhelming handicap of having an essentially professional service constantly shattered by political conflicts within the régime although for a different motive the heads of technical and administrative services have been overlaid by political appointees in a way comparable to the tammany régime of two generations ago stalin s violent efforts against this evil have apparently made the situation not better but worse demanding administrative efficiency without himself having a touch of administrative experience and without the patience to listen or learn or understand stalin through his merciless remedy of administration by punishment has broken the backbone of any proper professional administration his war to the knife against bureaucracy has fostered as an inevitable protective reaction the vices of bureaucracy in their most extreme form the avoidance of all responsibility fear of initiative and prompt action and the safeguard of paperasse and shockabsorbing devices of every form as a result a professional personnel such as could have developed during the past twenty years has never been allowed to build itself up the brains and technical capacity inherited or available after 1918 have never been put to proper use and throughout the kaleidoscopic shifts of courses and policies the railway service has remained the cinderella of the soviet governmental household as a test let us make a single comparison remembering that russia is almost ninety times larger than great britain and over eleven times the area of the united states locomotives freight cars russia 1934 19 400 542 000 germany 21 000 594 000 great britain 20 500 636 000 united states 51 000 1 973 000 in one respect above all however the tradition of the old régime has carried over into the new far reaching directions of national policy are laid down by men who take railways for granted with little sense of the limits they impose in 1904 the precarious line of single track to the far east had hardly been completed when a mood of ambitious adventure swept russia into the japanese war the spectre of russia s overwhelming military power was as formidable as it is today and the possibility of making a stand against it seemed no less out of the question this buoyant spirit was of course indifferent to the detail that the siberian railway was of a different gauge from the russian from this aspect russia suddenly became two countries only one of which could actually function in the theatre of war next in the effort to remedy this contretemps and to gather the resources of the country for use in a distant theatre of war it was forgotten that all the rolling stock of the country was barely enough to supply the needs of european russia in peacetime in many provinces every station yard was soon piled high with grain or produce awaiting shipment waiting often for months on end in the open and ruined by the time it could be cleared away this general paralysis of economic life was the first phase of the revolution of 1905 no plot no conspiracy no underground opposition brought the thing about and none of these things we may assume face stalin today revolutionary elements properly speaking played only a lesser part in the upheaval of 1905 in siberia and various other provinces oddly enough the suppression of revolt took the curious form of a systematic reconquest of the main lines of railway communication a straight cut military undertaking with troops and guns this fiasco was not repeated in 1914 with energetic determination the military and railway authorities together recast their arrangements so thoroughly that the railways achieved the vast mobilization of 1914 without confusion and far more rapidly than the rest of the world expected but for the railways once again it was an excessive burden to maintain an army at war and at the same time to serve the needs of the huge country behind the front this overload told more and more severely as the war dragged on other countries at war had the same experience the united states by no means least but in russia the government could neither see nor cope with the necessity of diverting men and materials to the task of repairing the steady wastage the munitions shortage of 1915 was overcome but by the following year the railways had become the weak link in the chain by may 1916 half the blast furnaces in russia were shut down for want of coal and ore all the metallurgical industries were being slowed down and vast stores of badly needed munitions and supplies were piling up at russian ports for lack of trains to carry them away by 1914 the russian steel industry had developed to such a scale that it was exporting steel rails to england in 1916 it was unable to provide rails enough to meet the wear and tear at home yet the country at large in 1916 had the same abundant sources of coal and iron as before the war the vast exports of grain had stopped and the whole harvest remained for use at home iii no one will ever be able to undo the accepted conclusion that a process of gradual exhaustion forced russia to withdraw from the war that at the end she was running hopelessly short of men munitions and the general sinews of war general alfred knox who was perhaps the best and most understanding observer of the russian effort from first to last left a record of a very different state of things at the beginning of 1917 by almost every test in his judgment the army was stronger better armed and better supplied than at any time before at the outset of the war 115 infantry divisions had been put into the field there were 240 divisions under the colors on march 1 1917 plus 1 900 000 soldiers in depots and 600 000 men of the new drafts then coming in by the russian staff estimate there were then 2343 infantry battalions in the european theatre of war as against 2198 battalions in the german army the fire power of the army in the field had increased immensely in the last year to take the expenditure of three inch shell in three successive summer campaigns in 1914 464 000 in 1915 811 000 in 1916 2 229 000 in january 1917 there were on hand over 6000 75 s with over 15 million shells and over 15 000 machine guns with a far larger stock of ammunition than ever before the leading was improving every day the army was sound at heart there can be no doubt that if the national fabric in the rear had held together the russian army would have gained fresh laurels in the campaign of 1917 and in all human probability would have exercised a pressure which would have made possible an allied victory by the end of the year unorthodox as it sounds now this judgment fits exactly with the conclusion then reached by ludendorff the most experienced authority of the eastern front no one could then have foretold the breakdown of russia he wrote and no one calculated upon it after working for two years to bring the thing about at the end of 1916 ludendorff gave up all hope of forcing russia out of the war abandoned all offensives on his favorite front and turned to submarine warfare to stave off defeat in 1917 the slightest prospect of a russian collapse would have made this desperate expedient unnecessary the whole decision was based on the conviction and on the most obvious evidence that the russian army was not only sound but strong the national fabric in the rear in turn was torn apart by no civil population in revolt against the war but by a physical breakdown in the machinery of railway transport and supply there was no stab in the back at the hands of an organized revolution even when the revolution came it came as a planless and random spreading out of a spontaneous bread riot its outbreak in march 1917 was not brought about by a planned and concerted effort its leaders arose only after the revolution had taken place in the last resort it came about for much the same reason as the revolution of 1789 because of a rush of consciousness that the machine of government was ceasing to do its work the prospect of a similar situation has been the real danger facing the successors of the old régime the ruthless vindictiveness of stalin is maintained by no danger from political rivals against these there is an easy weapon ever at hand the danger stalin rightly discerns is not from without but from within the ever recurrent threat of what happened in 1917 no overthrow by his enemies but a gradual or sudden failure of the machine of government he grips ever more closely within his own hand foreseeing as a possibility exactly what finally happened general knox in 1916 finished an entry in his diary with the comment there are limits to the patience of even the russian people the breakdown of 1917 had a clear and specific point of origin a transport crisis which occurred year by year in varying degree central and northern russia are to a large extent kept alive by the wheat and grain of the southern provinces and each summer s harvest the railways have to collect and carry north before the winter sets in the great bulk of the coal used throughout central russia likewise comes up from the south and this too as it happens involves a heavy seasonal movement of traffic for the railways st petersburg and the baltic provinces however had always relied chiefly on british coal which came by way of the baltic even in normal times these two traffic peaks in quick succession were often a serious problem for the railways the coming of war closed the baltic and all the northern provinces at once became dependent on the south for coal the war simultaneously drew off for its own needs once for all a large part of the rolling stock which had barely sufficed for the heavy annual transports of grain and coal from this followed an endless chain of cause and effect each effect bringing a new cause of trouble all russia grew short of coal when the transport of coal was wearing down the railways all the towns went without the food which the country districts were unable to send to market locomotives and cars broke down with the excessive burden of transport the overworked repair shops could not keep up with their work and the waiting lines of unusable engines and cars grew ever longer mismanagement of every sort increased the general deficit on march 8 general knox noted the disorganization of transport is dealing the russian cause a worse blow than any disaster in the war on february 7 it had been suddenly discovered that many railways had only two to five days supply of coal the railways were ordered to carry nothing but coal for a week the week was extended to march 14 this blood transfusion in respect to coal stopped short the transport of grain to the larger cities three days before march 14 comes the note in the diary there is practically no wheat flour in petrograd shooting commenced on the nevski opposite the anichkov palace casualties are estimated at fifty the casualty list has increased a good deal since then not to speak of recent additions it would have to include the 3 000 000 or more deaths from the famine of 1933 this in a way is one of the best tests of the degree to which the administrative machinery of russia has recovered from the breakdown of 1917 it might be classed as a negative test the spreading of the railway network over europe made it possible once for all to do away with the age long spectre of famine and the old régime in spite of its many failings took full advantage of this possibility in russia a total crop failure throughout the southern provinces is a periodic phenomenon but never after the railways came was this peasantry allowed to die of famine stalin s apparatus of state can claim at least the record for the largest famine death list in all europe for the past three generations is it a cause for surprise that today he has chosen not to submit this rickety apparatus to the test of war the world outside indulging itself in the glamour of communism and the singular cloud castles it drew forth has willingly ignored the substance behind and accepted the immense façade exhibited to an admiring generation stalin knows only too well the contrast between substance and shadow ever since 1815 the rulers of russia have imposed intermittently this formidable shadow upon western europe after the congress of vienna the tsar alexander set up a peacetime army larger than the french army of 1812 it proved an army largely on paper and with the faded remains of this illusion nicholas i ventured forth upon the crimean war unchallenged the spectre of russia remains successfully formidable but when brought to the test there reappears each time the singular contrast between bulk and effective reality in 1914 nicholas ii had 70 regular infantry divisions in his peacetime establishment stalin today has 30 is it strange that he avoids bringing these to the present test to join hitler offers at least the chance of avoiding it to have supported poland would have meant the certainty of having to let fall the façade and come forth with the naked realities of present day russia will the course he now follows be based on the 30 divisions he actually has or will he sally forth like genghis khan at the head of the immense ballyhoo horde of countless followers which has been so triumphant a press agent achievement some of us still remember the russian steam roller the russian steam roller rumbles forth again today not as an armed host but as a vision of immense stores of raw materials pouring over the german frontier in reality as has often been pointed out most of these are badly needed at home including many which appear as a surplus for export people and industries alike have been so drastically rationed down that even the things whose production is now being vastly increased still prove inadequate to satisfy the newly revealed demand this is notably the case with oil russian exports amounted to 145 000 000 in 1930 in 1937 when far more was produced they had dropped to 30 000 000 but in the meantime russian consumption of oil had so increased that last year 5 000 000 barrels had to be imported from the united states the total output of the newly won fields in galicia is far less than this on the present footing there will be none to spare for hitler and in russia the highest grades of gasoline are not produced in iron also the increased production leaves no great surplus for export it amounted to less than 9 000 000 in 1937 this may be increased considerably in the current year the exports of grain depend on the harvest year by year 31 000 000 bushels of wheat went out in 1937 2 000 000 in 1936 if hitler could change the main sinews of war from iron to wood his ally could really help wood and lumber are by far the leading articles of export from russia take from the list all grain and fodder meat butter and foodstuffs of every description including caviar and sausage casings tea and tobacco furs coal oil iron and steel and manganese and all other metals as well as licorice root glycerine and precious stones add all these up together and the total will not reach the value of i he exports of wood and lumber 144 000 000 out of a total export trade of 345 000 000 in 1937 in a world at war who will buy russia s 145 000 000 export of lumber by what route will it be delivered where now will stalin procure the special imports so essential to russia s economic and industrial effort his exports hitherto have in large part not represented a true surplus such as mr wallace s unsold cotton they are rather a deliberate slicing off of things russia needs herself in order to get from abroad other things she needs still more badly will this slicing off be heavily increased for hitler in return for nothing the russian people have long since been schooled to accept as the normal way of life the food shortages and the deprivations of all things which general knox found so alarming in the last year of the war their patience is now extended far beyond the limits of 1917 yet this patience is a poor index of the working effectiveness of the russian state as one test we may note that throughout most of northern russia the railways have reverted to burning wood it has never been possible to pay for english coal since the new régime came in it has not been possible for the soviet railways to supply the north with coal from the south in spite of most earnest efforts it has not been possible to bring the railways to a condition substantially different from that they reached during the war their burden of work is far heavier their means hardly greater than before in 1935 the tonnage they moved was much more than twice that of 1913 the number of locomotives about the same in 1930 a byplay of a fiveyear plan led to a policy of intensive exploitation of the railways there were 62 000 accidents within a single year 7000 locomotives over a third of the whole number and 64 500 freight cars were wrecked or broken down howmany accidents would there be if russia were drawn into war with tools such as these in his hands is stalin about to sweep forward over the ruins of

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

it hadn t rained for three months not a single drop had fallen on the nine hectares of parched fields where carmen portela and her family raise cattle near cuchilla del fuego the town in the northwestern department of paysandú was one of the worst hit areas in uruguay during the drought of spring 2021 the water deficit caused by the second consecutive year of the la niña weather pattern was cause for concern in almost every corner of the country and wider south america but it was the biggest fires in uruguay s history which burned through 37 000 hectares of forest in río negro and paysandú that generated widespread public alarm and saw a state of emergency formally declared in the last days of december the parching of the country s pastures has particularly affected cows and the suckling of calves born during last year s winter before the forests burned thousands of cattle grazed within them in agricultural systems integrated with forestry some calves died some suffered burns others were left scattered and stranded at the edges of burning land a young calf with a leg injury recovers at the liga del trabajo de guichón s cow hotel fires and drought in uruguay in 2021 caused injuries and burns scattered herds and affected animals ability to feed image pablo bielli diálogo chino following the fires the liga del trabajo a social organisation in the paysandú town of guichón moved to lend a helping hand to small farmers and their calves affected by the devastation on land near the town they turned grounds that usually host fairs auctions and other livestock services over to housing and rehabilitating the young animals it s not the first time they ve done so during the 1999 00 and 2007 08 seasons two other periods of extreme drought the liga had opened its gates to vulnerable and injured calves when the possibility of coming here arose we decided to go for it to look out for the future of our production carmen tells us as she tries to pick out some of her 60 braford and red angus calves among the hundreds grazing in the paddock of this cow hotel a hotel for cows the liga s vast premises are equipped to house and handle large numbers of cattle with several paddocks pens vaccination corrals traps animal baths and sheds at the centre of the complex is a large arena for horse riding and a smaller one for auctions it s somewhat reminiscent of the rural architecture of a century ago the main paddock at the guichón cow hotel though not normally a recovery facility the liga del trabajo s grounds are used for various livestock services and were opened up to cattle from small farms affected by 2021 s weather image pablo bielli diálogo chino to set up the hotel it was necessary to install three different feeders to carry up to 400 kg of feed as well as adding new water troughs and guaranteeing the water supply canopies were needed to provide shade for the animals and personnel had to be recruited to staff the facility financial assistance was also a necessity nelson moncalvo and héctor daniel martini president and secretary of the liga approached fernando mattos uruguay s minister of livestock agriculture and fisheries mgap about the project and were asked to devise a budget for rehabilitating 1 000 calves the minister who already knew the liga facilities first hand was immediately supportive of the project the liga del trabajo de guichón s president nelson moncalvo he spoke of the agriculture ministry s support for the cow hotel after its successful operation during two previous periods of drought image pablo bielli diálogo chino the mgap s emergency agricultural fund allocated us 59 per cattle head to keep them for 100 days at the end of which by 30 may they should have gained about 70 kg each producers who send their animals contribute a further us 25 per head on 23 february carmen portela shipped her 60 calves over 70 km to the hotel twenty other small family operations cattle farmers on less than 500 hectares who owe no debts to the mgap and whose papers are all up to date did the same some sent 100 animals others only five 1 065 calves are currently registered at the facility 862 of which entered following the drought including herefords black and red angus brafords and cross breeds some animals were not permitted to enter as they tested positive for brucellosis a contagious disease that impacts fertility others did not need to go some owners saw their pastures recover ahead of their animals planned stays and were able to keep them in their fields with as much as 600 mm of rain falling in two months after the prolonged drought many calves arrive undernourished having been separated from their mothers or due to weakened cows inability to sufficiently feed them calves are prematurely weaned and moved onto a grain diet that helps them recover body mass image pablo bielli diálogo chino on arrival calves are first taught to eat and use the water troughs moncalvo explains casually leaning against a wooden fence separated from their mothers when they drink only milk at less than two months old and weighing 60 70kg they have to adjust to eating grain rations a mixture of corn sorghum barley wheat and mineral supplements a diet of 21 protein as well as alfalfa in bales early weaning the premature separation of calves from their mothers is a practice used in emergency situations such as the drought in uruguay it can speed up the recovery of young cows bodies and encourages earlier breeding to keep pregnancy rates up but it is seen as a last resort because of the health risks and logistical complications involved alejandro saravia from plan agropecuario a uruguayan agricultural support institute told the newspaper el telégrafo how in 1999 a group of technicians including himself went to argentina to see how they applied the weaning technique and brought back guidelines for handling underweight calves at that time there was not much experience he recalls that year six calf hotels operated in uruguay but the approach was only recreated in guichón seven years later weaning calves helps restore the mother s health and help pregnancies which thank god we have achieved minister mattos is clear that in a crisis situation the weaning approach provides quality feed to the calf ensuring its development and relieving the nursing mother it helps her to conceive again and increases the reproduction rate which is the most important objective we set ourselves weaning calves helps restore the mother s body condition and allows pregnancies to happen again which is what thank god we have achieved carmen tells us with relief she describes it as useless to keep a calf at its mother s feet for a further six or seven months when it is in a delicate condition explaining that the animal loses a year of productivity carmen portela who sent 60 calves from her farm inspects the grounds of the liga del trabajo de guichón s cow hotel it has been very good for us image pablo bielli diálogo chino other owners and animals were less fortunate at the facility in the first few days six or seven calves died because they arrived malnourished and did not adapt to the ration moncalvo says once calves have gained weight they are moved to another paddock where they receive feed with less fibre a diet of 18 protein and natural grass the liga facility requires over 3 000 kg of feed per week which is donated by barns and veterinaries from all over the country four students from a local agricultural school are in charge of filling the troughs twice a day john cáceres segundo pereyra lorenzo panizza and joaquín henderson all signed up for an internship at the hotel to prepare their thesis on calf management and early weaning john cáceres segundo pereyra lorenzo panizza and joaquin henderson students from a local agricultural college load grain into troughs the facility gets through as much as 3 000 kg of feed a week image pablo bielli diálogo chino the students load feed into a pick up truck hitched to a tractor and drive slowly from paddock to paddock they use the holsters on their belts to cut the nylon from the 40 kg bags before dumping them into the troughs from which a dozen calves can eat each consuming up to 4 kg a day in surveys conducted after the first hotel experiences more than 20 years ago nine out of ten beneficiaries said they were happy with the treatment 82 would have left the animals longer but only 38 said they would send calves back to the hotel livestock s importance to uruguay 2021 was in a number of different ways a year to remember for those working in the uruguayan meat industry historic records were set for slaughter 2 638 252 cattle 630 000 more than in 2020 meat exports and the price per tonne exported close to us 5 000 the chinese market was the driving force behind these increases with the asian nation now importing 61 of the meat produced by uruguay 500 000 the impact of extreme weather on reproduction could see uruguay s cattle stock reduced by as many as half a million head this year the country will struggle to match its historic slaughter of 2 6 million in 2021 the price of cattle is also at unprecedented levels calves have never exceeded us 3 per kg but did so for the first time at the end of march and are worth 50 more than a year ago however any chance of sustaining these highs is likely to be compromised by this year s stock which is expected to be reduced by 400 000 to 500 000 head if breeding does not pick up pace this requires as many cows and heifers as possible to be in a condition to successfully conceive and sustain pregnancy it also means efforts must be made to guarantee the healthy development of calves born under risky conditions underlining the importance of facilities such as that of the liga s facility in guichón as the day draws to a close on our visit the students share a bit of banter as they divide up the final tasks they calculate which way the wind is coming from before tipping the last bag into the trough so that the dust from the ration dry and sawdust like doesn t get into their eyes a day s work at the liga del trabajo de guichón s cow hotel draws to a close the facility is scheduled to operate until the end of may with weather conditions determining whether it will need to operate again in the near future image pablo bielli diálogo chino based on the signs she detects in the behaviour of the bees and hives already in early autumn carmen says another dry spring may occur this year while a third straight year of la niña would be unusual meteorologist mario bidegain recently tweeted that models are indicating that it could happen if the liga opens the calf hotel again next year many people who did not yet try it will do so it has been very good for us says carmen before returning to her gaze to the field moncalvo hears this and gives a nod that seems to say let s see
is the ipo window on wall street open or does the present situation on the markets preclude the possibility of israeli companies reaching the public market in the us it appears that the answer to that question is not clear cut on the one hand there are no big number offerings such as we saw last year and none seems to be in the offing on the other hand small offerings continue to take place including of israeli companies in 2021 the ipos coming out of israel were at valuations of at least 1 billion such as those of sentinelone monday com global e and others today it is mostly a matter of ipos at valuations in the tens of millions of dollars raising just a few millions according to us research firm renaissance capital over 60 of the ipos that have taken place so far in 2022 raised up to 50 million historically offerings of this size have been less than a quarter of the total as for the israeli angle telecommunications equipment company actelis recently raised 17 million at a valuation of 70 million video transmission technology company maris tech raised 18 million at a valuation of 33 million rail vision a developer of cognitive vision sensor technology and safety systems for the railway industry raised 16 million at a valuation of 24 million all of the above are now traded at market caps below their ipo valuations and last week renewable energy and energy storage company brenmiller which was already listed on the tel aviv stock exchange was listed for trading on nasdaq as well other small companies that have recently filed prospectuses are wearable computer interface technology company wearable devices e commerce company jeffs brand drones company parazero and drone cybersecurity company mobilicom which is traded on the australian securities exchange at a valuation of some nis 32 million saverone a company that has developed a solution for preventing drivers from becoming distracted by their telephones and that is traded on the tel aviv stock exchange is also on its way to wall street and should already be traded on nasdaq but it deferred its pricing because of the state of the markets and is expected to complete it shortly there s no doubt that this is a trend and we see in our backlog of deals that there will be more like these says adv ofer ben yehuda head of the high tech practice at tel aviv law firm shibolet co the head of the capital market practice at shibolet adv adi zaltzman adds that every small company that comes to wall street has a slightly different story he relates a case on which he advised in which an israeli company filed a prospectus for an offering in tel aviv last summer without success the idea arose of an offering on nasdaq he says to me it sounded like a joke but they went to nasdaq and it turned out that it s possible to raise modest amounts at lower valuations than here it s just hard to believe people have always been afraid of the expenses that nasdaq listed companies have the expenses are indeed high but the difference isn t huge and solutions are found and if it s possible to make an offering on nasdaq companies prefer it ben yehuda describes the alternatives at present there are no ipos in tel aviv in the technology sector that could change but at the moment there s nothing private placements are highly stressful all the funds exert pressure term sheets are taken off the table suddenly the option of being traded on the biggest market in the world even if at lower valuations than were previously on the table seems like a good fit companies even prefer a spac merger that won t manage to raise a normal pipe a private investment in public equity deal associated with a spac merger s h w the reason is that a public company can raise at some valuation sometime in the future the market is available and cheaper and represents a convenient alternative to private offerings zaltzman adds let s not forget that tackling a 10 15 million round on nasdaq is easier than tackling a similar round in tel aviv ben yehuda to that you have to add the fact that eighteen months ago us firms specializing in stock market offerings didn t want to work with israeli companies unless it was at full price now the numbers are different and the prices are different but there s a risk that a company will start to be traded at a low valuation and will never appear on the radar of the more serious investors ben yehuda there s also the risk of becoming a penny stock but some of the small companies contrary to the negative market indices have performed well the companies believe that they will be able to demonstrate significant revenue growth and improvement in the loss or profit line and there s hope that the market won t be always in the state that it s in today and they ll be able to raise money even if at a low valuation the expectation is that with the public platform and the recognition if you do well you ll be able to obtain money will that be proved right we ll see who are the investors in these small offerings zaltzman generally they re led by american underwriters who aren t tier one or two i presume that the investors are institutions that are connected to them there s no doubt that there are also israeli investors or former israelis and small us institutions ben yehuda there are financial investors with instruments such as structured products or a combination of debt with a discount they re not all that interested in the company s technology the more the companies can present performance and today unlike in the past year or two not at overblown valuations then there s a chance that when the market revives the companies will be able to raise money from investors who look at what the company does what does this mean for the tel aviv stock exchange if a valuation that in the past suited the local stock market is now suitable for wall street that will have an adverse effect on the exchange zaltzman the significance is marginal some of the companies reach a listing in the us via tel aviv in a dual listing others will at some stage want to list in tel aviv as well we have a client who came via a third stock exchange and listed for trading in the us and now he wants to list for trading in tel aviv because it s convenient for investment institutions when a company is dual listed in my view most of these companies if they don t become penny stocks or stock market shells will at some stage become dual listed they don t have the privilege like check point not to be listed what about the other exchanges that in recent years have been wooing israeli companies such as in canada and australia in canada the experience has mostly been with cannabis companies in australia out of a double digit number of israeli companies one or two have posted positive returns in any event companies will certainly prefer nasdaq to australia because of the time difference and the distance and the stock exchange in canada isn t nasdaq either with all due respect published by globes israel business news en globes co il on may 29 2022 copyright of globes publisher itonut 1983 ltd 2022

i from the time when the terms north and south were first used to designate two phases of civilization the two divisions of culture into which american development branched the peculiar genius of the north has been accepted as being fundamentally commercial that of the south agricultural in the first is found a people with a taste in the early days for barter and for trade progressing to the higher realms of commerce and of manufacturing in the latter is found a people following agriculture on a scale of constantly increasing magnitude until at length slavery becomes commercially profitable to the ruling classes and therefore acceptable to the public conscience in the north owing to the growth of large commercial enterprises and involved manufacturing processes the people soon became interdependent and the rights of the individual became in a certain degree subordinate to the common good in the south the vaster the scale of agricultural development the larger became the personal unit of enterprise the wider the sphere of individual authority and thus was created a distinct type individualistic aristocratic ill fitted for that coöperation necessary in the conduct of large manufacturing enterprises requiring obedience to authority and management probably the most typical example of what one might term the northern type is new england here the activitics of the very first settlers were as is the case in all newly settled regions directed toward farming however because of the short growing season and the harsh nature of much of the soil agriculture did not long engage the deepest interest but it was found more profitable to enter into fishing commerce and manufacturing the products of the soil were more profitably obtained from other sections more favored as to soil and climate an equally good example of the southern type of culture is found in the carolinas here as throughout the colonial south the extensive coastal plains and the frequent river valleys extending far inland were early occupied by englishmen who promptly began the cultivation of the soil here they did not stop content with the mere production of sufficient food for their own necessities turning when that point was attained to seek other avenues of wealth producing activity but they sought diligently and successfully crops which could be sold to other sections and distant lands and so become the basis of prosperity and civilization in virginia and north carolina tobacco became the wealth producing crop in georgia and south carolina indigo and rice were shipped across the seas in exchange for england s gold and goods the wealth of the great planters attracted settlers of agricultural inclination from far and wide agriculture became the honored pursuit the gentleman s vocation for the gentleman s son there were offered only the law the church and the plantation the youth from charleston or savannah who may have had a taste for commercial or mechanical life frequently moved to more congenial sections feeling that there was no field at home for the exercise of such talents likewise the new england youth feeling the call of the soil began the long trek which carried him to an empire of fertile prairie lands and ended only when he saw the sun set beyond the golden gate thus by a process of elimination were the tendencies of the two sections accentuated with the introduction of cotton into america the two industries based upon cotton the growing of the plant and the manufacture of the fibre into cloth divided naturally as the conditions which i have mentioned had previously shaped the tastes of the people for climatic reasons cotton growing was necessarily confined to the south but it was eagerly seized upon as being ideally in harmony with the inclination of the people as i have shown in a previous article it was a crop above all others which could be produced by the lowest type of labor and with a minimum of expert supervision so nothing could have better suited an aristocratic leisure loving civilization with countless slaves to shoulder the rough burdens the invention of the cotton gin by whitney in 1792 gave enormous impetus to cotton growing in the south yet it seems to have created almost no ambition on the part of the southern people to become the manufacturers of their own product here however was an activity which suited the new englander and the men of affairs who had amassed fortunes upon the sea found profitable investment for their capital in the building of cottonmills the falls and rapids of the short rivers furnished ample power the large families from the hillside farms found easy profitable employment in the mills and a welcome shelter from a bitter rural struggle through long bleak winters so the south land of men who gloried in the cultivation of the soil as the noblest calling land of patient toiling slaves of fertile fields sluggish streams and mild climate produced the cotton new england land of commerce industry keen bracing air rapid streams and prolific hardy native stock from the hills made the cotton into cloth and from her convenient ports her ships carried the finished product to the far corners of the earth on account of lack of land transport such an industry could have existed then only in close proximity to seaports as early as 1793 a cotton mill was in operation in rhode island by 1811 one hundred and two mills were in operation in the several new england states with a total of more than 80 000 spindles in the light of recent events it is interesting to review in some detail the growth of the industry in america at the close of the civil war new england had 6 500 000 spindles while in all the southern states at that time there were only 200 000 by 1875 new england had increased to 10 000 000 spindles while the south had not quite half a million it was said to be unprofitable and impractical to bring the mills to the cotton country where it would have seemed the logical thing to locate them about 1890 the southern textile industry began to indicate by a sudden growth that some hitherto overlooked factor had entered in in the year 1900 the new england spindles numbered 15 000 000 while the south had reached the noticeable figure of 4 500 000 but soon after this we meet an amazing statement figures which seem to belie our entire reasoning up to this point for at the present time 1922 we find new england with 20 000 000 spindles and the southern states with 15 000 000 and in the month of may of this year 65 per cent of all the cotton manufactured in the united states was spun in the south financial interests having the welfare of new england s textiles at heart have begun to take marked notice and from many sides reasons are being advanced to explain the aladdin growth of the textile industry in a land where for a century it seemed unable to strike root there must also be some factor at work which has caused the relative slowing up in the growth of this industry in that section which has always seemed the best suited of all to its highest development a high official of one of the national textile associations in a recent address dwells at some length upon the present situation of the industry in the two sections of the country and mentions a number of factors which may have brought about the recent changes in relative volume for the checked growth of the industry in the north he assigns as the chief cause the new england state legislatures many of whose acts he deems hostile to her manufacturing interests in his opinion the time has arrived when the local law makers must decide whether they desire their section of the country to retain its industries or to become a mere summer resort state laws restricting working hours high taxes and similar handicaps may of course serve to curtail for the time being the profits of the new england mills but these things cannot possibly furnish a satisfactory explanation of the almost over night growth of a mighty industry in a section whose people have always been considered as being unsuited by tradition environment and temperament for skilled technical enterprise on a large scale were this textile growth diffused throughout the entire south or were it confined to a given area but one with nothing to differentiate it from the south in general then it would seem necessary to change the entire popular conception of southern culture as our deductions up to this point would not be justified by the event however even a casual survey will disclose the fact that while not confined to any one state the successful textile plants of the south are almost without exception located in a clearly defined area comprising portions of several states yet at the same time comprising a section of country similar in all its extent and standing out in marked contrast to all other portions of the south and to all popular conceptions of the southern land and people i refer to the piedmont plateau which begins in virginia crosses both carolinas and ends in the hills of northwest georgia this is the home of the textile industry and this region differs so strikingly from its surroundings as to seem an island of alien culture therefore fully to understand the development which is taking place there it is important to note the character of the country the history of its settlement and the causes of those differences which set it off as a land apart it is a continuation of that hill country which skirts the whole eastern base of the alleghanies from pennsylvania through maryland and virginia from 1740 until the beginning of the revolution there flowed southward along this high tableland a constant stream of scotch irish and german settlers from pennsylvania the coastal plains were already preëmpted by the english planters who had the lands divided into vast estates where they established their slave baronies they clung to the coast and to the lands near navigable streams where the cultivation of the great money crops was profitable and where the waterways furnished easy communication with the culture and life of the mother country the hill lands they deemed worthless and so left them open for the influx of a hardy yeoman stock from the northward into this open gap flowed the vigorous liberty loving stock which had settled the northeast and which later was to set toward the west about twenty years after this movement began many shiploads of scotch irish and palatines landed at the georgia and carolina ports finding the coast lands already taken up by the planters under whose system there was no dignified place for the small landowner or the white laborer these settlers pushed on through to the hill lands and there found already established their own people who had come by way of pennsylvania they mingled with them and so the piedmont plateau was settled its people had nothing in common with the bourbon culture of the low countries during the civil war and the period just before that conflict the civilization of the piedmont was merged and joined with the remainder of the south in the face of a common enemy as soon as the crisis was past the fundamental differences of the two peoples became at once evident the coastal south whose prosperity and wealth were founded on slavery and on class lay prostrate for decades the piedmont under the new order of things came into its own and advanced rapidly toward healthy and well rounded development as soon as the first shock of the great war was past and when means of transportation had been established its people turned naturally to that industrial progress for which they were in all respects well fitted even the religions of the two sections of the south marked a difference of origin the church of england was supreme on the coast while the men of the hill country were presbyterians lutherans and moravians as a proof of the extent of the movement which i have mentioned it is a fact of church history that nearly all the early presbyterian churches in the upper carolinas were supplied with pastors from pennsylvania and new jersey the country became a land of small farmers industrious pioneers who cleared up the hardwood forests tilled the soil with their own hands lived simple frugal lives and on sundays gathered at their little log meeting houses here for a long while slavery was almost unknown and it never gained sufficient volume to leave its effects upon the people naturally two such distinct types of culture could not long exist in such close proximity without some strife and some modification as early as the year 1800 considerable friction developed between the pennsylvania pastors and the slave owners of the lower districts as the country filled up and communication became easier and frequent the manners and customs of the coast did to some extent penetrate into the up country and change the life there especially in the larger towns ohio and the near west were nowopened up and the tide which had flowed south into the piedmont for fifty years receded and turned westward while that culture which bounded the piedmont lands on the east did change to some degree the life of the towns the character of the rural districts remained almost identical with that of the states located north of the potomac from the piedmont there was also a constant trickle from the hills into the coves and gaps of the high mountains which lay just to the west it is important to note that here in a country very similar to the highlands of scotland the pioneer anglo saxon stock has remained almost unchanged down to the present day the wealthy planter element of the coastal plains having leisure to travel and to engage in public life forced the acceptance of its particular brand of culture as being representative of the spirit of the south they were good publicity men and so in time the world lost sight of the latent possibilities which lay in the simpler hard working small farmers scattered over the wide extent of the hill country and the mountains ii it is often said that france is that portion of the earth best fitted to be a dwelling place of the human race possibly taking the country as a whole this may be true yet i cannot believe that even france contains any one spot better suited for the development of a happy well rounded civilization than the piedmont of the carolinas owing to the latitude the winters are mild yet one finds pleasant summers and the invigorating effects due to a considerable altitude the elevation is from 600 to 1200 feet above the sea the surface of the land is gently rolling the soil is nearly everywhere fertile producing bounteous crops of cotton corn wheat and all kinds of fruit the streams are clear and cold and in their rapid descent from the mountains offer almost unlimited power for hydro electric development from some open vantage point one frequently obtains a wide outlook over the landscape of low hills checkered into well tilled fields and small patches of woodland white farmhouses and here and there the tall stacks marking busy industrial towns it is indeed a pleasant land viewed against a setting of the blue mountains to the west as one travels nearer to the mountains past neat prosperous mill villages past compact stone farm homes by cool springs shaded with white pine and hemlock one feels on all sides a brooding spirit of peace of contentment entering the passes of the mountains which rise blue and abrupt on either side one hears at evening from high pastures the tinkle of alpine bells and the vision is of a land where not only is the laborer deemed worthy of his hire but of a goodly land where he who plougheth shall plough in hope the population as we have shown is pure anglo saxon stock of colonial american traditions extremes of wealth or poverty have been negligible since the first settlement so that we find here to day probably as pure an example of democracy as exists anywhere sufficient negroes are found for certain necessary labor yet not enough ever to become a problem we have seen that the first chapter of cotton in america was that the south raised the plant and new england manufactured the fibre into the finished product at first the anglosaxon stock of the new england hills bred large families but scanty crops and so provided ideal labor for the mills during the civil war most of the looms stood idle while the former operatives carried the blue lines across distant cotton fields after the war they never returned to the mills they had traveled far and their vision was broadened some returned home to other pursuits while many moved into the new states of the west their place was at first filled by irish and some english labor but after a time this also was replaced by labor from central and southern europe so at last those who owned and managed the mills and those who labored in the mills were poles apart in race understanding and frequently in language the conditions which had once given birth to successful textile development had changed and passed and the industry was forced to shape itself to meet new conditions the labor was now chiefly that class most susceptible to the influences of trades unionism and to all those new doctrines concerning the relations of capital and labor which whatever may be their fundamental merits have not thus far made for the efficient and harmonious operation of large industrial enterprises in the piedmont section of the southern states on the other hand are found conditions almost exactly paralleling the new england of sixty years ago the population is of a hardy stock reared amid hard work and rural simplicity from which spring leaders of enterprise and efficient captains of industry unlimited native labor comes from those mountain coves where the pioneers from scotland and ireland ended the long migration these people better their condition of living when they move from a lonely log cabin in the mountains to a comfortable bungalow with all modern conveniences situated in some piedmont mill town living conditions for labor in a southern country are necessarily easier than they are in the north as i have suggested the languor and lassitude often associated with a southern climate are here overcome by altitude and by bracing air from near by mountains long summers and short winters give greater opportunity for raising vegetables and poultry and there is also less expense for fuel and heavy clothing a factor which makes for harmony is that the labor here has never developed class consciousness or social isolation farming conditions are easy and real estate is cheap many families retain and operate small farms while certain members move to near by mills and obtain there profitable employment thrifty operatives frequently own real estate in town which they either occupy or rent they thus retain a keen interest in the economic and agricultural life of the country they are simply individual citizens who are engaged in textile work should one for any reason become dissatisfied with his mill life he would probably move back to a farm or find other town employment it is hard to picture such a group of individuals becoming a solid class mass apart from the general life of the home state we have here good american stock well pleased with their lot in life the walking delegate who comes to this country is wise if he brings with him his return fare in many instances the presidents of large mills are men who were raised on adjacent farms neighboring farms produce alike presidents superintendents and operatives employment in a cotton mill is looked upon as an honorable vocation which any may enter and as a good training school for young men who hope to expand into leaders the manufacturing cities such as greenville charlotte gastonia and spartanburg are attractive places of from twenty to fifty thousand inhabitants as a rule the mill villages are located in the outskirts so that ample space for healthy living is furnished all operatives occupy individual homes civic pride is encouraged by cash prizes offered for the best kept lawns and gardens parks paved and shaded streets good schools libraries and churches all tend to render the lives of the operatives satisfactory in several instances large mountain tracts are owned by the mills and turned over to the operatives for summer campingsites and recreation parks while i do not believe that the southern states will ever have a monopoly of american textile industry i do believe that this piedmont land is today adapted for the highest development of this industry in all its branches the most intricate processes and the production of the finest fabrics can here be successfully carried on new england s lawmakers while not unmindful of the welfare of labor must also remember to temper their legislation with wisdom and not suffer themselves to be led by the voices of political expediency also her labor in making its demands should realize that this section to day holds no natural advantage in cotton manufacturing over the favored section which i have described if too many and too great legal burdens and handicaps are placed upon her industries then southward will the star of textile empire inevitably take its way
given time these innovative companies can put investors on a path to complete financial freedom regardless of how long you ve been putting your money to work on wall street the first five months of 2022 have been a challenge since hitting their all time highs in early january the 126 year old dow jones industrial average and widely followed s p 500 have tumbled 13 and 18 respectively meanwhile the growth stock focused nasdaq composite is off 30 from its november record closing high while there s no question that big one day moves lower in the market can be unsettling and tug at investors emotions it s far more important to recognize the history behind these moves namely that crashes corrections and bear markets are an inevitable part of the investing cycle and that over time they ve always eventually been wiped away by a bull market rally going shopping during steep corrections and bear markets offers investors the opportunity to buy innovative growth stocks that can deliver transformational wealth with some patience of course what follows are five examples of growth stocks with supercharged return potential that can over many years or decades put investors on a path to complete financial independence okta the first innovative growth stock that s been clobbered during the downturn is identity verification solutions company okta okta 4 10 okta has been punished for its near term forecast which calls for more losses as well as the nosebleed premium to sales that the company s shares were once valued at but that s all history as of now what makes okta such a no brainer buy is the evolution of cybersecurity software from optional to a basic necessity with businesses accelerating the shift of data online and into the cloud in the wake of the pandemic third party providers like okta are being leaned on more than ever to recognize and respond to potential threats since okta operates a cloud native platform and leans on artificial intelligence ai it should be able to thwart attacks more effectively than on premises solutions this efficacy is what can sustain a 20 or higher annual growth rate as well as desensitize the company to recessions and economic pullbacks additionally investors should be excited about the auth0 acquisition which closed last year aside from gobbling up a competitor okta s purchase of auth0 opens the door for okta to spread its wings internationally this overseas growth should come in handy in the latter half of the decade which is when europe should be well past the inflationary supply chain and geopolitical issues currently haunting the region pubmatic another company that offers transformational wealth to long term investors is cloud based small cap adtech stock pubmatic pubm 5 21 advertising revenue is often the first thing to get hit when a recession strikes which is why pubmatic has taken it on the chin recently but this short term pain is investors opportunity to pounce on a truly innovative provider of programmatic ad solutions in simple terms pubmatic is what s known as a sell side provider it acts on behalf of publishers to automate and optimize the sale of their digital ad display space interestingly this doesn t mean the highest priced ad always gets placed in an available space rather pubmatic leans on ai and machine learning algorithms to place relevant content in front of users this way advertisers stay happy and publishers can command more pricing power over time pubmatic is at the center of the digital ad revolution it s no secret that ad dollars are shifting away from print and toward mobile video and connected tv whereas the digital ad industry is slated to grow by a little more than 10 annually pubmatic has been more than doubling up the industry s growth rate as one final note keep in mind that the company built its cloud infrastructure not having to rely on third parties can allow for scaling efficiencies to push its operating margins higher than its peers teladoc health a third innovative growth stock with transformational wealth ambitions is telemedicine kingpin teladoc health tdoc 4 64 the reason shares of teladoc are down 90 from their pandemic high is simple the company continues to lose more money than expected and it grossly overpaid for its acquisition of livongo health a leader in applied health signals that overpriced acquisition led to a mammoth first quarter write down that equates to more than the company s current share price while management deserves a kick in the pants following the livongo deal there s no denying teladoc s pole position in today s changing personalized care landscape the beauty of telemedicine is that the entire healthcare treatment chain wins although virtual visits can t replace all doctor patient interactions it s ultimately more convenient for patients and can allow physicians to keep closer tabs on chronically ill patients the latter should lead to improved patient outcomes and less money out of the pockets of health insurers and anything that results in lower expenses for insurers is something they re bound to promote prior to the pandemic teladoc s sales grew by an annual average of 74 over a six year stretch which demonstrates that telemedicine isn t a fad what s more the livongo deal should pay long term dividends as both companies use their customer bases for cross selling purposes once teladoc can put a number of acquisition related expenses in the rearview mirror wall street is likely to recognize the value in this fast growing platform once again planet 13 holdings a fourth innovative growth stock with transformational wealth building potential over the long run is multi state cannabis operator planet 13 holdings plnh f 2 94 yes a small cap marijuana stock pot stocks have been a buzzkill for 15 months and counting largely because the democrat led congress has failed to pass legalization or cannabis banking reforms as anticipated by wall street however with about three quarters of the country legalizing weed in some capacity 19 states of which allow adult recreational consumption and or sale plenty of organic opportunity awaits planet 13 no matter what happens on capitol hill what makes planet 13 so special is the company s operating model instead of planting its proverbial flag in as many legalized states as possible planet 13 has only two operating dispensaries but they re massive the flagship las vegas superstore spans 112 000 square feet that s bigger than the average walmart while the orange county superstore in santa ana calif is 55 000 square feet in size with 30 devoted to sales space in other words the company is focused as much on the nostalgia of the buying experience as it is on making a sale although planet 13 s superstore blueprint hasn t been duplicated and should be a long term moneymaker the company is also expanding into new markets with a more traditional community based retail setup it has already signed two leases in florida with these stores expected to contribute to the company s results in 2023 nio a fifth innovative growth stock that can deliver transformational wealth with some patience is china based electric vehicle ev manufacturer nio nio 5 35 auto stocks of all sizes are contending with historic headwinds at the moment semiconductor shortages high inflation and supply chain disruptions caused by covid 19 and or the russian invasion of ukraine have caused nio and many of its peers to significantly scale back production but the long term opportunity for evs is plain as day what s intriguing about nio is that it s operating in the largest auto market in the world china and is already going head to head with tesla for example the recently introduced et7 and et5 sedans offer a top tier battery upgrade that allows 621 miles on a single charge that provides substantially better range than either of tesla s flagship sedans the model 3 and model s aside from new vehicle innovation nio is also being smart with its high margin service potential in august 2020 the company initiated its battery as a service subscription which allows buyers to charge swap and upgrade their batteries as well as net a discount on the purchase price of their nio ev in return nio collects a monthly subscription fee and more importantly locks in the brand loyalty of new buyers look for nio to deliver exceptional sales growth for the next decade if not well beyond

that were hit hardest early in the pandemic jessica jordan managing partner of the rothman food group is struggling to hire the workers she needs for two of her businesses in southern california katella deli bakery and manhattan beach creamery she estimates that both are only about 75 staffed but half of applicants never answer her emails for an interview and even new hires who already submitted their paperwork often disappear before their first day without explanation she said i am working so hard to hold their hand through every step of the process just to make sure they come in that first day jordan said larger restaurant chains also have tall hiring orders sandwich chain subway for example said thursday it s looking to add more than 50 000 new workers this summer taco bell and inspire brands which owns arby s said they re also looking to add staff hotels and food services had the highest quit rate across industries in march with 6 1 of workers leaving their jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics the overall quit rate was just 3 that month some of those workers are walking away from the hospitality industry entirely julia a 19 year old living in new york city quit her restaurant job in february she said she left because of the hostility from both customers and her bosses and too many extra shifts added to her schedule at the last minute she now works in child care you have to work really hard to get fired in this economy said david kelly chief global strategist at jp morgan asset management you have to be really incompetent and obnoxious slowdown in silicon valley and if industries in rebound are hiring to catch up the reverse is equally true after a boom in recruiting several large tech companies have announced hiring freezes and layoffs as concerns about an economic slowdown the covid 19 pandemic and the war in ukraine curb growth plans richly funded start ups aren t immune either even if they aren t subject to the same level of market value degradation as public tech stocks at least 107 tech companies have laid off employees since the start of the year according to layoffs fyi which tracks job cuts across the sector in some cases companies such as facebook and twitter are rescinding job offers after new hires have already accepted leaving workers like evan watson in a precarious position last month watson received a job offer to join the emerging talent and diversity division at facebook what he called one of his dream companies he gave notice at the real estate development firm where he worked and set a start date at the social media giant for may 9 just three days before then watson received a call about his new contract facebook had recently announced it would pause hiring and watson anxiously speculated he might receive bad news when i got the call my heart dropped watson said in an interview meta was freezing hiring and watson s onboarding was off i was just like silent i didn t really have any words to say watson said then i was like now what i don t work at my other company the news left watson disappointed but he said facebook offered to pay him severance while he searched for a new job within a week he landed a job at microsoft as a talent scout watson said he feels good about landing at microsoft where the company is a lot more stable in terms of stock price for months retail giant amazon dangled generous sign on bonuses and free college tuition to lure workers the company has hired 600 000 employees since the start of 2020 but now it finds itself overstaffed in its fulfillment network many of the company s recent hires are no longer needed with e commerce sales growth cooling plus employees who went on sick leave amid a surge in covid cases returned to work earlier than expected amazon cfo brian olsavsky said on a call with analysts last month now that demand has become more predictable there are sites in our network where we re slowing or pausing hiring to better align with our operational needs amazon spokesperson kelly nantel told cnbc amazon did not respond to questions about whether the company foresees layoffs in the near future recession shield the reductions and hiring shifts are isolated for now but they have some executives on edge any kind of news flow when its high profile companies around job losses has the potential to chip away at sentiment a bit said bank of america s tinsley cautioning that the job market is still strong things are not as bad perhaps as the picture some might paint he said the pace of job growth in the service sector will likely begin slowing however jpm s kelly said that even if the market lost 3 million openings it would still be a job seekers market there s strong excess demand for workers it really shields the economy from recession he said but job cuts can ripple through other sectors a sharp increase in hiring freezes job cuts wage stagnation or even a pullback in company spending on things such as employee benefits and a return to business travel could hurt the very service sectors that have thrived as covid cases fell the question is will consumer spending keep its head above water tinsley said cnbc s jordan novet contributed to this story correction this story has been updated to correct that amazon has hired 600 000 employees since the start of 2020 an earlier version misstated the timeframe
i there is no romance in coal the word calls to mind no pleasing pictures of adventure and conquest argonaut expeditions never set sail to find coal but to mention the spicy indies sunny california the far away rand and australia and the frozen yukon is to recall the lure and the glamour centuries old yet ever new of man s perennial search for gold yellow gold suggests high adventure in the open but black coal suggests only hard toil underground it belongs to the big world of work rather than to the smaller realm of romance dull and dirty coal is the symbol of the purely utilitarian in life for coal is as highly useful as it is meanly prosaic though it is won from the depths of the earth by laborious effort and though it soils everything it touches coal makes our world a brighter and better place to live in what coal means to the world however is little appreciated by the many who share its benefits the man on the street thinks of coal only in terms of the few tons he buys for his furnace and his range a coal strike though it may be country wide means little to him i use anthracite and i bought mine in march is the casual remark with which he absolves himself from any further interest in an impending shortage of both bituminous and anthracite coal a newspaper headline telling of disorder and riot at a mine in illinois or west virginia may bring from him the question that s where they mine coal is n t it the fact that coal is mined in thirty states and that the industry employs three quarters of a million men as well as two and one third billions of invested capital all this escapes his notice and the notice of most of us absorbed as we are in our own daily tasks at times it is true public interest hi coal is thoroughly aroused of the raw materials that go into the warp and woof of modern life coal is one of the few that is directly purchased by the citizen our consumption of the useful metals per capita is in value roughly equal to our consumption of coal but few of us ever buy pig iron or bar copper and so we rarely think of the prices of these metals but unless he is so unfortunate as to dwell in a hotel an apartment or a boarding house every head of a family must buy coal for his own household when therefore for any cause the price of household coal rises his pocketbook nerve is touched and he begins to feel feverish concern a rise in the price of no other commodity gasoline excepted can more easily bring public opinion to a high temperature this sporadic concern about coal and coal prices lacks both perspective and proportion the public interest in coal is something far larger than that based on all the use we make of it in our homes of the six tons that measure the per capita consumption in the united states less than one and a half tons are used for heating and cooking even though that is the coal which we buy and whose price we know there is a large persona service that we receive daily from coal that we often overlook if indeed we ever fully appreciate it coal comes into our homes not only by way of the chute to the cellar bin but over the wire and through the pipes and also in no small amounts by the kitchen door our electric current and gas and water and ice all represent coal more coal than we are likely to realize into the house that i happen to know best for example there came in a single year thirteen and a third tons of bituminous coal which was never seen by any member of my household but for which i had to pay just as truly as i paid for the fifteen tons of anthracite i bought that year a study of the accounts for the year shows that one and one fifth tons of coal had to be used at the power station to furnish my electric current more than four fifths of a ton of coal at the ice factory to make my ice more than eleven tons of coal or its equivalent in coke or oil at the gas plant to furnish the more convenient fuel in my home and even with a gravity system one hundred and twenty pounds of coal at the city pumping station to raise the water we used from filter plant to reservoirs these thirteen tons of coal thus bring to a home of to day what we call its modern conveniences service rendered by energy slaves whose presence we forget but who quietly do so much work that our grandfathers and grandmothers had to do for themselves this indirect consumption of coal amounting to more than two tons a person in the household i have studied is nearly as great as the direct consumption of coal for heating the same home so that the visible coal i buy from the coal dealer is only half of my supply and be it noted the most of my invisible coal is received in the form of what we call public utility service for which i pay at publicly regulated rates ii essential as coal both seen and unseen is to the comfort of the home it is a far larger aspect of our coal supply that demands national attention our industrial and transportation systems are built on a coal foundation take coal away and the great structure that expresses all the material progress of which we as americans are proud would be a useless thing coal we take too much as a matter of course too seldom do we notice how it enters into the life of the nation as we watch the railroad train passing laden with coal the truth of the statistics of coal and the problem of its transportation should come home to us 40 per cent of all the freight loaded is coal and the locomotives themselves consume more than a quarter of all the coal mined for every five cars of coal that the railroads deliver to themselves seven cars go to the boiler house of factory mill or power plant three and one half cars to the dealers who deliver the coal to our homes for heating and cooking and two other cars to the coke ovens and gas works the rest of the coal is used at the mines for power or taken to the seaboard for bunker or export almost every modern industrial and commercial activity depends upon coal for its motive power nature did not trouble to make an equal distribution of coal among the nations nor until recently have the makers of national boundaries given much heed to the location of coal fields to day the wealth of each continent and country in unmined coal is well known though the figures showing these world reserves of energy are far too large to be comprehended roughly five million million tons of coal not including the low grade variety known as lignite an easily remembered and thoroughly gratifying detail however is that half of the world s known supply of coal is in north america if by way of humanizing these incredibly large statistics of coal reserves we give the measure of a nation s wealth in coal in the per capita tonnage of coal unmined we find that the leading industrial nations rank about as follows the united states possesses more than 23 000 tons of coal other than lignite for every man woman and child of its present population great britain has about 5000 tons per capita germany probably still owns not less than 4000 tons per capita belgium perhaps 1500 tons france probably more than 800 tons spain less than 400 tons and japan 150 tons or considerably less than our own per capita reserve of anthracite our luxury coal the supply of which we regard as extremely scant if population were a fixed quantity and the uses of coal were a fully determined factor the rate of consumption of coal might be predicted for future centuries but what we know about our grandfathers days justifies some hesitation in prophecy about our grandchildren s days if fifty years ago the per capita consumption of coal was one ton a year and it is now six tons what dare we say as to the requirements of future generations this rapidly increasing rate of consumption is in fact an ever changing unit which we have to use in measuring our reserve stocks of coal it is true that over 99 per cent of our country s original supply is even yet unmined but it is also true that in the last dozen years we have mined more coal than in the whole of the preceding century and a half since coal mining began this startling increase in our country s consumption of coal can be better understood if we look beneath the surface of everyday things the trace of coal is found everywhere in modern life that large tonnage of unseen coal already mentioned as entering our homes disguised as public utility gas electricity and water is by no means the full measure of the domestic service rendered by coal we know for instance that in the industrial zone between boston and washington a relatively small area in which however is concentrated one fourth of the population of the united states the bakeries use over half a million tons of coal a year for heat and power the sugar refineries a million and a quarter tons the manufacturers of other food products another million and a quarter tons and the ice plants nearly three quarters of a million tons indeed fully seven per cent of what is called industrial coal in this area is thus translated into food so that again in invisible form more than ten thousand tons of coal come each day to our tables to this extent is coal consumed outside the home in fact a food necessity even more has coal become the staff of life of our industries we can best realize what coal means in a national sense if we study history in terms of the steam engine and industry in the century and a half since the declaration of independence gave to the world a new political ideal the substitution of steam for human labor in doing the world s work has created a new industry a new commerce and a new social order the leading industrial nations lead because of the coal they produce their rank in the world s markets is largely fixed by the coal they consume and their future power must be conditioned by their wealth in coal hence the national significance of a properly functioning coal industry the modern industrial system as we know it in the united states is founded on a use of mechanical power more generous than prevails elsewhere in the world we multiply man power with machinery we lift the load from the back of man by offering him the use of electrically driven tools and man thus becomes the master of a machine rather than the slave of a herculean task yet these power driven machines must be thought of as not so much labor saving as product increasing agencies the modern steel plant may employ thousands of men but back of each human worker there is from five to ten horsepower of electric drive and this large coöperation of the machine with the man explains the low cost of american steel and practically all this vast supply of energy upon which every industry draws so heavily comes from coal so it is that each ton of steel we use represents more than two tons of coal the cement that forms the other essential component in our modern structures has cost half its weight in coal and the roof of copper shingles three times their weight in coal so too this printed page has cost more than twice its weight in coal and even the sheerest of fabrics contains its quota of coal for the silk mills of new jersey and other eastern states consume each year nearly half a million tons moreover this large and increasing use of coal generated power is typically american no other country equals ours in its per capita equipment of powergenerating and power using machinery and we need to keep in mind as we face the future the obvious truth that there is no other route to nation wide prosperity so direct as this machine method of increasing the productivity of labor planning for an ever larger supply of mechanical power and for the ever wider use of improved machines is the surest way to continue american standards of wages and living against all competition in the world s markets we have learned to look upon radium as the wonder worker among minerals yet the more common and commonplace coal possesses truly marvelous powers in its contribution to the everyday work of the world coal perhaps deserves to be called the magical multiplier of man power take the average daily output of the soft coal mine worker four tons in 1920 the half ton of coal he mines in an hour will yield under average practice steampower to an amount of 500 horse power hours or say 5000 man power hours in that ratio do coal and the steam engine multiply human energy or to put it in other terms although the coalminer works a short year at best nevertheless his year s endeavor measured in the coal he mines is equivalent in mechanical energy to the continuous effort for a year of a thousand men turning wheels in some man power machine by a thousandfold at least does the energy in our coal replace the slavelabor of the ancient world better the coal age of america than the golden age of greece coal then is a wonder worker whose rôle has become a commonplace a faithful slave whose service we take for granted yet the sum total of all that coal means to us is so great a part of modern life that the public can no longer with safety shift the responsibility of the coal industry even though the larger users of coal the railroads the steel industry the electric public utilities all have a more direct interest in watching it in speaking to the members of the american iron and steel institute men of engineering and financial talent who have won worldleadership for their industry i held them to a definite responsibility for the one hundred million tons or more of coal they use each year in making steel but the rest of us must also face the plain issue that the story of coal is a story of waste all the way from the face of the mine working to the smokestack of the boiler plant waste of a natural resource waste of human endeavor waste of capital waste of transportation capacity and waste of energy and of none of these have we enough much less any to spare iii the betterment of the coal business is not a simple matter first of all there are two major classes of coal anthracite or hard coal and bituminous or soft coal a distinction that is commercial and industrial even more than scientific the contrast in the physical characters of these two kinds of coal is so marked that it is evident even to a passer by but this nature made difference results in two distinct types of industry whose diverse features are essential in any consideration of the coal problem the annual output of anthracite for instance is less than one fifth that of bituminous coal although more than one fifth as much capital and even one fourth as many mineworkers are engaged in the anthracite industry that is the dollar invested and the man employed cannot produce as much hard coal as soft coal practically all the anthracite comes from a limited area in pennsylvania while bituminous coal is mined in thirty states there remains in the ground in the united states about one half of one per cent as much anthracite as bituminous and lower grade coals so it happens logically that anthracite mining is a natural monopoly out of which has grown a well organized business duly proportioned to meet current demands for its high grade product which commands a luxury price not closely related to the price of soft coal to maintain this favored standing anthracite is prepared for domestic use by cleaning and separating into different sizes with a resulting by product of sizes too small for domestic use the steam sizes of commerce which are sold in competition with soft coal at prices much below the average mining cost for the whole anthracite output the anthracite industry is thus a manufacturing as well as a mining business and its product is roughly divided into 70 per cent domestic sizes and 30 per cent steam sizes a contrast sometimes overemphasized is that while 70 per cent of the anthracite mined goes to homes only 12 per cent of the bituminous coal mined is classed as household coal yet the fact is that about the same quantity of each sixty million tons is burned in domestic use both may equally be said to keep the home fires burning but bituminous coal is preëminently the fuel that makes the wheels go round with so much at stake it is high time that the common people look into the soft coal business or at least learn the a b c s of its economics nature has blessed these united states with wonderful beds of high grade coal that can be easily mined the productivity of our american mine workers backed by modern machinery is higher than that of any coal miners elsewhere in the world but in europe the miners work much longer years in coal mining it is the american hare and the european tortoise for while in normal times in great britain germany belgium and france the coal mines have been open for work from 290 to 320 days a year our average american bituminous mine has been open only 215 days in the average year and considerably less than 170 days last year moreover for over thirty years the american soft coal miner has faced not only the certainty of idle days but also the uncertainty as to when his idle days were to come intermittency of employment year after year does not breed good working habits it is all too plain that this irregular running of mines for hardly more than two thirds of the working days of a year requires more mines and more mine workers it involves a sad waste of capital and a sadder waste of manpower this overdevelopment of a basic industry is now generally acknowledged even by those most interested this excess of capital and of labor in the coal industry leads to the hazards of unemployment and naturally both capital and labor seek wages high enough to cover expected idle time as well as actual working time larger profits and higher wages loom up as the logical content of this vicious circle of too many mines and too many miners and too short working time all this makes the consumer s coal bill too large because it includes a charge for too much idleness he pays for what he does n t get the obvious remedy for inflation is deflation but who is to begin the deflation a coal operator with wide outlook suggests bankruptcy for one third of the soft coal mines and a spokesman of union labor suggests back to the farm for 150 000 surplus miners probably neither of these radical programmes can be carried out however desirable a more practical line of attack will be to strike at the causes that have opened thousands of new and unneeded mines and attracted this excess army of mine workers the stimulus to overdevelopment has been furnished by high prices obtained under exceptional market conditions and the stimulus to overmanning the industry has been furnished by high wages demanded for short time employment and so again we discover this chain of irregular operation and intermittent employment together causing a too high wage scale and yet resulting in too low annual earnings with full justification the coal operator and the coal miner and the coal consumer each thinks he is not getting a fair deal the average mine and the opportunity it offers the average miner is a statistical fact rather than a social picture thousands of miners have a better chance to work than that four day week of the average mine but unfortunately many thousand others have a much poorer chance for ten years the coal mines in new mexico have had an average working week of five and one half days but in the same period the oklahoma mines have been open almost two days less to the week with such extremes the united states plainly is not a land of equal opportunity for the coal miner and the steady work in new mexico has not helped the family of the miner employed in oklahoma the marked differences between states in the length of the working year are due in part to differences in type of market demand quality of coal mining costs including wage scale and degree of overdevelopment copper smelters and railroads stabilize the demand for new mexico coal and the mine capacity of the state is well proportioned to the needs of the market in alabama the steel industry and the cotton oil industry together give to the coal mines a much longer working year than is possible in illinois where a seasonal demand and overdevelopment of mines have combined to make a working year that is all too short undoubtedly these market differences tell only part of the story for the lower wage scales in the nonunion districts have made possible lower cost coal giving it an advantage over coal from union districts in any competitive market and affording the lower cost mines the longer working time and more days wages to their workers it is part cause and part effect therefore that the strongest union centres are the districts with the shortest working years much that may be done to better the condition of coal mining can be done only by the coal industry itself the mining engineer is needed to raise the underground efficiency of the average mine nearer to what has been attained in the best mines for we have large coal mines well laid out and fully equipped with modern machinery which show in practice how coal can be mined with the least waste of manpower it is significant that in these larger and better planned mines there is opportunity to work more hours in the day and more days in the year best of all in such mines the individual mine worker loads more coal for society and earns more money for his family so that the two ideals are attained cheaper coal and larger earnings both mine worker and mine operator have paid far too little heed to this method of bettering the coal business the one has specialized too much on selling his labor and the other on selling his coal iv yet the economic defects in the coal business cannot all be cured by more attention to engineering by the mineoperator or a larger interest in his work by the mine worker for much of the trouble originates not at the mine but at the distant market the consumer is too often uninformed about coal and even if informed he is too often utterly neglectful of any but his own interests the charge of selfishness can be brought home as strongly to those who buy coal as to those who mine or sell coal and public opinion needs to put the same ban on the consumer who disregards the interests of the coal producer as on all those who disregard the interests of the coal consumer learning the a b c s of the economics of the coal business is indeed no more needed than are a few kindergarten lessons in practical ethics as applied to coal buying few coal consumers for example ever consider the possibility of accommodating their coal dealer by ordering a year s supply of coal to be delivered let us say a d c at dealer s convenience yet that simple reform would enable the local dealer to stabilize his business and in turn would help to stabilize the mine operator s business to the end that the mine worker s april might contain nearly as many days as his november instead of six or seven days less a thought provoking instance of shortsighted self interest is afforded by the recent bituminous coal market in june new england and new york buyers were refraining from adding to their fast disappearing stocks of coal and were even cancelling their orders for shipments because freight rates to seaboard points were to be lowered july first the known facts that the country needed the product of every mine that was then running that half a million tons waited on the cars at hampton roads and that the failure to move this coal slowed down mine operation in west virginia all this counted for nothing against the expected reduction of 28 cents a ton on freight in july even though at the national conference of social work an earnest inquiry was made about ways and means of aiding the miners families in west virginia dollars for charity bat not 28 cents in a business deal the result of this penny wise disregard of the larger interest was about what might have been expected in july everyone who had waited for the saving of 28 cents in freight rushed to market and this demand not only cleared the docks of unsold coal but quickly pushed the price of coal at the mine up 56 cents so that those who found coal to buy paid 28 cents more not 28 cents less for their coal at tidewater nor is this recent experience unique for most of the surplus mines owe their origin to the high prices of panicky markets and these in turn are due to the mass movement of buyers whose selfishness causes them now to delay buying until coal may be cheaper and now to rush to market for coal of any kind at any price the 28 cent margin of such speculator buyers is soon wiped out this failure of the consumer to see the producer s side of the shield may be due as much to the distance that separates them as to lack of sympathetic vision measured even by the recent unusually high transatlantic rates from cardiff welsh coal is only a few cents more distant from the boston market than all rail pennsylvania soft coal this long haul from mine to market so large an item in the cost of coal hinders the growth of community of interest between those who burn and those who mine coal too often they are not citizens of the same state coal in its relation to general welfare and to interstate commerce thus has special significance in the new england states new york new jersey and delaware for this industrial belt has no coal of its own and is therefore wholly dependent upon mines outside of it this means that the 21 000 000 citizens of these nine states look to their federal government to protect their health and welfare so far as these depend on fuel and power they ask washington to provide coal adequate as to supply and reasonable as to cost the evidence that sets forth the bad economics of the whole coal business is not yet all in what we have learned in the last few years about the mining distribution and marketing of coal simply opens up wide fields for further inquiry the sooner all the facts are known the better it will be for the coal industry as well as for the public dead set opposition to permitting representatives of the public to poke into so called private business is a policy already out of date what is most to be feared is public action without adequate consideration of the facts public opinion needs for its guidance a better understanding of the consumers possible influence on the marketing of coal of the burden put on the railroads by the seasonal variation in coal shipments of the useless duplication of transportation facilities demanded by competitive service to too many mines of the waste of man power in small mines that operate intermittently of the lack of mine efficiency due both to poor management and to union regulations and of all the man made handicaps placed on this industry upon the health of which practically every other industry depends we should not expose the coal industry to political experiments but we must plan its restoration to economic health it may be that radical changes will be found necessary such as permitting larger combination under strict public regulation of corporations engaged in mining and marketing coal or controlling the distribution of coal along rational rather than fortuitous lines a revival of zoning so as to secure economy in the large item of transportation cost or limiting the development of the industry more nearly to the measure of public requirements any of these methods may seem to run counter to the established ideas of the rights and privileges of private business but public regulation has already taken similar liberties with the public utilities and for the general benefit of all concerned monopoly of market regulated quality of service and prices adjusted to costs are now accepted as basic premises in the conduct of what are well termed public service corporations what was private business a few years ago has now become public business and it is noteworthy too that the public service executives have visions of future advances in economy of power generation and distribution in the public interest far beyond anything proposed by private initiative in the coal business indeed it appears wholly inconsistent that although the energy put at our service through the agency of railway train or street car or electric light is recognized as of a public utility nature and the rates we pay for it are fixed by municipal state or federal regulation the price of the coal that constitutes the source of that energy and the chief component of that public utility is regarded by some as outside the pale of public control or even of public inquiry coal they say is simply a commodity like boots and shoes and is therefore not to be made a matter of public concern or investigation the coal mine say these defenders of the past is private property even though the electric power plant and the steam locomotive which together consume so large a part of the output of that mine are agencies engaged in business so affected with a public use that they are wholly subject to public regulation the futile conferences in washington in july between coal operators and coal mine workers emphasized again and again the fact that the stoppage of coal mining was looked upon by both parties as purely a matter of private business a controversy to be fought to a finish and clever cartoonists were quick to portray the insignificance of the common citizen with the empty coal hod president harding s repeated references to the larger public interest in this issue were sorely needed to offset the vociferous utterances of those who set their business and their jobs above the general welfare and no argument however skillfully framed could meet the president s assertion that both workers and operators had an obligation to serve that public which made possible your industrial existence it is society that gives value to coal and opportunity to the coal industry the general welfare clause undoubtedly must play an increasingly prominent part in national affairs as the constitutional basis for action to protect the majority against any minority that arrogantly exhibits its indifference to the common good the aggressive minority may derive its power from its monopoly of a valued resource or its monopoly of skilled labor but the eventual reaction of the public will be the same whether the monopolistic minority wears the label of trust or of union too long have the mine owners treated the coal business as private privilege and too long have the labor leaders with no less monopolistic attitude obstructed every move for underground efficiency and economy the people s coal costs too much because of the mistaken idea that mineowner and mine worker can continue indefinitely to fight over contracts and rules yet there is equal need and greater opportunity for the general welfare clause to be made a standard for personal decision and a motive for individual action the coal problem may yield in part to better engineering underground but that engineering should have the humanitarian purpose of increasing the earnings of labor as well as the economic purpose of reducing the waste of capital the coal problem may be solved in part by better distribution but railroads and coal companies need to coöperate in a spirit broader than that of exchanging empty coal cars for coal contracts at prices below cost the coal problem may also be made simpler by bettering the marketing system but here too no machinery of public regulation can be so effective as the mutual recognition by buyer and seller of coal that broken contracts and profiteering prices do not serve to stabilize any business not only does the trouble in the coal industry include sins against both economic and moral law but at bottom there has been a lack of vision of its true relation to the general welfare in the present readjustment period for example the coal operator coal miner and coal merchant have too often failed to see that the price at which coal sells becomes a first item of cost in the great productive industries so that the general recovery of business for which everyone prays is conditioned by the trend in coal if the coal industry fails to keep down prices what hope is there in other industries no other producers exert a more general influence and this relation of the coal industry to the general welfare carries the larger obligation to the nation for many years the coal industry has been burdened with evils that were only in part of its own making it is told that the first man who sold hard coal in philadelphia was chased out of town as a swindler and now in 1922 the controversy between the two active partners in the business has involved the silent partner in heavy losses exasperated by indifference and neglect this silent partner has come to realize to some degree how large his share in the coal business really is and has now even threatened to take over the management of the business perhaps it would be wiser first to learn more about the coal industry and to apply the force of public opinion to its betterment in less extreme fashion than by government operation a somewhat radical journal recently referred to a naïve belief in the power of public opinion yet in a democracy what other power can be appealed to for either conservative or progressive influence in public affairs a larger faith in popular government was voiced by our president at the dedication of the lincoln memorial when he said deliberate public opinion never fails let a public opinion enlightened by a thorough study of the coal industry be the force that refuses capital to open or operate unneeded mines that refuses either wages or profits figured on only two thirds working time that refuses in short to regard as private business the mining and marketing of so indispensable a commodity as coal but that encourages in turn off season purchase and storage of coal by consumers that replaces suspicion and criticism with true coöperation between consumer and producer and especially that endorses any legislation needed to put coal mining and coal distribution on a better economic basis with this more lively appreciation of what coal means to us and with a more definite purpose to help to make the industry function better the passing car of coal may catch our eye as one of the symbols of american greatness as visible evidence of the energy whose uninterrupted service is needed in home and factory alike for without coal our great industrial cities would be cold and dark and silent
