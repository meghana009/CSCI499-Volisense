provided by xinhua economist nathan janzen said that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels ottawa april 8 xinhua canada s unemployment rate fell 0 2 percentage points to 5 3 percent in march the lowest rate on record since comparable data became available in 1976 statistics canada said friday the drop in the overall unemployment rate in march was driven in large part by a decline of 2 1 percentage points in the unemployment rate for male youth which fell to a low of 10 2 percent in contrast the unemployment rate for female youth was little changed in march at 9 3 percent according to statistics canada with the exception of an increase in january 2022 the unemployment rate has fallen consistently in recent months mirroring the situation in other countries with increasingly tight labour markets including the united states australia and britain statistics canada said the total employment rose by 73 000 or 0 4 percent in march driven by an increase of 93 000 or 0 6 percent in full time work a frequent point of comparison between canada and the united states is the employment rate defined as the number of people who are employed as a percentage of the working age population which is typically higher in canada adjusted to u s concepts and for the population aged 16 and older the employment rate was 62 4 percent in canada and 60 1 percent in the united states in march the rate was unchanged from february 2020 in canada compared with a decline of 1 1 percentage points in the united states statistics canada explained provided by xinhua royal bank of canada economist nathan janzen said in a market report that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels we look for the central bank to hike rates next week to build on a 25 basis point increase in march with a 50 basis point hike this time more likely janzen said andrew grantham economist with the canadian imperial bank of commerce also forecast a non standard 50 basis point hike from the central bank at next week s meeting because we think that the jobless rate can move down slightly further without creating sustained inflationary pressure labour market conditions don t yet warrant a rapid rise in interest rates to above the neutral rate which is the path financial markets are currently anticipating we still see rates peaking around that neutral level of 2 25 percent in 2023 grantham said in his market report the central bank is slated to announce its decision for the benchmark rate target next wednesday
green bay wi wtaq the end is near for the legendary the exclusive company record store in downtown green bay a phrase an ad recited by just about anyone who grew up in eastern wisconsin say it with me it was an iconic sounding call for a record shop unlike any other tom smith is the manager at the exclusive company location in the broadway district he s been working there for 33 years this building has had such a music history for a long long time it s going to be sad to see it not as a house of music smith told wtaq news the company showed up exclusively as mr g james giombetti opened up shop in west bend in 1956 mr giombetti just had this vision and this passion and determination to build america s best full line independent record chain smith said he was the best record store owner to work for because he s 100 percent behind us on stocking the stores how we wanted to and i think that s why people like the exclusive company they all have their own complexion their pros and cons and that was because of mr g smith says while mr g was a supportive owner there were definitely rules about what was acceptable at the exclusive company he gave all the stores the autonomy to stock what we wanted what we felt was appropriate for our market or even stuff that we think we should try in our market smith said he was like a father figure at times you don t want him angry at you the building itself has a long history of music serving as the pipe dreams record shop before giombetti took over this building has a lot of history we ve had a lot of in store like ozzy was here cheap trick the violent femmes came when it was still pipe dreams smith recalled lately record sales seem to be on the rise but smith says the industry is struggling to keep up with demand i hate to say it but the record industry has always been the biggest detriment to the record industry like it s its own worst enemy smith said last christmas parents to come in with their lists of what they wanted for their children or other family members or friends and they d hand me list i d have to say i m sorry that one we ve been out for 6 months or that one here is 9 months out this one s been a year it s because the record companies just can t keep what s in demand in supply they sure would help all the record stores if they just built some more pressing plants but incredibly the industry and the stores survive even through a pandemic but the passing of the local record king mr g seemed to be the tipping point our participation in it will be wrapping up smith said we re goners as they say it s all she wrote it s a wrap but as music and record sales survive so do the enthusiasts in fact they seem to be multiplying mike mckeough remembers going to the record shop in green bay even before mr g took over i ve been coming here since it was pipe dreams and that was 60 70 i m 67 now so 50 years it s been part of green bay for 50 60 years the store itself mckeough said i just enjoy music can t play an instrument but i just enjoy listening to it and in this store here you get everything i just love the store i could stay here all day just listen the music they play i think they re going to miss a lot of it just looking around in here you see the younger kids so it s nice to see the younger generations started coming here and everything like that too and all of a sudden they re not gonna have any place to go to now one of those young people was sam kalies we found him flipping through vinyls waiting for something to catch his eye he might be in his mid twenties but for sam and his friends the exclusive company has been home for years i was probably like 15 or so so about 10 years ago and i ve lived in green bay my whole life so i ve been coming here often like a couple times a month probably kalies said i feel like they have a really great selection and it s been a cool way to find some smaller indie artists and some things you wouldn t see in bigger retail stores it helps me connect with the the city i ve brought a lot of friends here and we connect over music and we often have a lot of conversations and share stuff that we find here so there s a community aspect of it for sure that community young and old still seems to be working to grasp the news that the exclusive company won t be around much longer well the way i heard about it was from my nieces and nephews it shocked me at first they d always ask if it s closing and i d say i have no idea but i sure hope not i m just sad it s closing mckeough added i ll miss the place when it s gone it was pretty shocking i found out really early this morning and it kind of set a somber tone for the day kalies said i love this place and i ll miss it that tone prompting kalies to rock an exclusive company branded shirt during what was surely not his final stop in the store but even with a few more stops between now and the end he s still trying to figure out one thing sadness loss and thinking about where i ll get my records from now on kalies said no matter where that will be mckeough says it simply won t be the same they re not as knowledgeable as tom and his crew here you can ask them for something they know exactly what you mean and where it is and go get it for you in those big stores you can stand there for hours and not get any service mckeough said the green bay location is expected to officially close sometime in july others are set to close by the end of july they will still take part in national record store day on april 23rd with special deals the shop in milwaukee will live on as a record shop under a new name lilliput records smith says they re even buying the building he thinks that will go well and admits he s already special ordered some things from that shop the original shop in west bend will also survive as a record shop long time customers bought the inventory and fixtures and kept the manager and staff on that ll be known as the beat goes on and more records
treasury secretary janet yellen says more government regulation is needed to police the proliferation of cryptocurrency and ward off fraudulent or illicit transactions one potential upside is that users would get documentation of their crypto dealings for use in filing their taxes taxpayers should receive the same type of tax reporting on digital asset transactions that they receive for transactions in stocks and bonds so that they have the information they need to report their income to the irs yellen said in remarks thursday at american university it was yellen s first speech about cryptocurrency since president joe biden signed an executive order on digital assets in march the administration s action follows several high profile examples of alleged cryptocurrency laundering and fraud this year in february the justice department announced its largest ever financial seizure more than 3 6 billion and the arrests of a couple accused of conspiring to launder billions of dollars in cryptocurrency stolen from the 2016 hack of a virtual currency exchange in march federal regulators accused two siblings of defrauding thousands of investors out of 124 million in unregistered securities offerings involving a digital token we will make policy recommendations including assessment of potential regulatory actions and legislative changes yellen said her speech centered on the importance of reducing digital currencies risks to the financial system along with maintaining the international prominence of the u s dollar we have a strong interest in ensuring that innovation does not lead to a fragmentation in international payment architectures she said adding that over the next six months treasury will work with the white house and other agencies to develop reports and recommendations on digital currencies biden s cryptocurrency executive order urges the federal reserve to explore whether the central bank should create its own digital currency and directs federal agencies including the treasury department to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security as banks and other traditional financial firms become more involved in digital asset markets yellen said regulations will need to appropriately reflect the risks of these new activities the use of cryptocurrency and other digital assets have exploded in recent years surveys show that roughly 16 of adult americans or 40 million people have invested in cryptocurrencies and 43 of men age 18 to 29 have put their money into cryptocurrency the white house said in march that digital assets have reached a market cap of 3 trillion last november from 14 billion just five years prior our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy yellen said lawmakers and administration officials have also voiced concerns that russia may be using cryptocurrency to avoid the impact of the avalanche of sanctions imposed on banks oligarchs and the energy industry in the past weeks due to the invasion of ukraine but treasury officials and cryptocurrency experts have said crypto is not a workaround for sanctions credit associated press ap photo credit ap

willmar minn willmar is again serving as the center for responding to the highly infectious avian influenza in minnesota as was done in 2015 the state of minnesota has established a command post at the kandiyohi county law enforcement center where staff with both the state and federal governments are working together on the response to h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza that coordinated effort is going smoothly according to dr beth thompson state veterinarian and executive director of the minnesota board of animal health she was on site at the command post last weekend the minnesota board of animal health and minnesota department of agriculture brought in help from the united states department of agriculture one week ago to assure there is a coordinated federal and state response said thompson beth thompson contributed minnesota board of animal health the usda team members have a variety of roles they play a key role in epidemiological investigations thompson noted while also assisting with indemnification for producers who suffer losses advertisement willmar is also playing a central role in this response thanks to the minnesota poultry testing laboratory that opened in 2016 in 2015 producers needed to deliver samples of suspect birds to st paul for testing now samples are delivered directly to the laboratory in willmar the test results from birds delivered by 8 a m can be known by noon said thompson minnesota s response team also includes case managers who are assigned to work one on one with producers who have flocks that need to be depopulated thompson said one of the lessons from 2015 was the importance of being able to assign local case managers to assist producers with the challenges they face the minnesota poultry testing laboratory opened in september 2016 in willmar carolyn lange west central tribune file photo it s too early to know whether this outbreak of the avian influenza will prove as devastating as 2015 but that possibility is very real she said the state has mounted an aggressive and early response we re not in peacetime now we re at war she told the west central tribune in describing the state efforts she estimates that more than 50 but less than 100 staff workers who are part of the response team are in the field already the state is prepared to ramp up the team as needed about two thirds of the board of animal health staff is dedicated to roles with the response whether in the field or the central office the state department of agriculture has also committed significant numbers of staff she said the two agencies are also working with counterparts in other state agencies the department of health minnesota pollution control agency and department of natural resources in various ways waterfowl are spreading the virus during the spring migration this year s outbreak is different from 2015 in some respects advertisement during a conference call earlier this week with the national testing laboratory in ames iowa a scientist examining the genetics of the infection reported that all of the introductions of the disease to domestic flocks had been from wild waterfowl according to thompson in 2015 there had been cases where infections were traced to farm to farm spreads she explained that is not happening so far backyard poultry producers have been the site of just two of the 21 avian flu infections reported in minnesota since march 25 however one third of the infections nationwide have been in backyard flocks contributed iryna mylinska adobe stock this year backyard flocks are playing a bigger role in the outbreak than was the case in 2015 while only two of the 21 reported infection sites in minnesota so far have been identified as backyard producers one third of the reported cases nationwide have been in backyard flocks there is one constant when it comes to the virus responsible for the disease it does not tolerate dry and warm conditions and is most readily spread during wet and cool weather conditions unfortunately minnesota has been experiencing cool and wet weather so far this season with a forecast for more of the same next week we re hoping the sunshine comes out here and that it dries and warms up soon said thompson we know the virus doesn t like that she said to date operators have been very vigilant about stepped up biosecurity measures the state is seeing very good cooperation from the owners of backyard flocks in reporting any suspected signs of the disease in their birds as well she said

rep raymond ward r bountiful is the house chair of the social services appropriations subcommittee 2022 ward is a practicing family physician and is affiliated with the utah medical association and utah academy of family physicians ward recently spoke on his caucus health policy priorities at our 2022 utah state of reform health policy conference on april 7th in salt lake city in this q a ward reflects on the 2022 legislative session and on future legislative items he hopes to implement in the next session stay one step ahead join our email list for the latest news subscribe state of reform how would you summarize this session s health policy legislation what would you say is the most important legislation that came out rep raymond ward i think the biggest issue is not one that gets a lot of headlines but it was making sure that we increased payment in a number of different small areas enough to keep staff working to provide those different services the biggest one that got attention was services for people with disabilities because the frontline workforce there was completely leaving the field it was really bad and services were just shutting down hopefully what we did will be enough to keep our workforce there sor can you tell me a bit more about what the committee did to address workforce shortages rw the amount of money that you need to pay to get someone to respond to a wanted ad for an entry level job is not the same as it was two years ago that s not a governmental decree and it s not a government set minimum wage it s just where the private market went we see that here in my medical office where it took us four or five months longer than i wanted to say look i know that that s less profit at the end of the day but we can t hire staff and we have to adjust how much we re offering in the wanted ad as a private business we re able to make that change and it s still tough but now we have people answering to our wanted ads but the government is slow they can only adjust one year at a time and administrators are still somewhat distant from the contractors with whom we contract for the services so the session is our one chance to try and be accurate about sor can you tell me about the fiscal year 2023 budget from the social services appropriations subcommittee what s in it and how has it changed from previous years rw some of the big rocks in the social services budget include some increases in pay where we tried to identify the most at risk job categories across social services including the division of services for people with disabilities dspd which was the biggest one the other big change in the budget is hardly discussed because of our process in utah we have what s called consensus for medicaid to keep medicaid running our fiscal analysts from the legislature work together with the department and the governor s office to come to what they call a consensus number where an increase will need to be made just for medicaid that is probably bigger than any other appropriation that the committee makes but is taken for granted at the beginning of a session we are in a very odd time since two years ago under the trump administration we said it s a public health emergency phe for covid so one may not be taken off the medicaid at all period unless they themselves asked to be taken off well every state has rules about when you can come on and when you no longer qualify so all those rules have just been put on hold and the longer that time goes on the more people get put on medicaid and then no one gets taken off that just distorts things and so we have a very large increase in the number of people on medicaid since that normal review isn t happening the administration has continued to extend the phe there were several discussions this year about what other portions of people who receive medicaid ought to receive longer services should you cover a woman a year postpartum should you cover contraception up to a higher percentage of poverty should you do something different for somebody who s just been released from prison all those are valid discussions but i don t even know how to discuss them right now because right now no one gets taken off ever sor what were the most important bills relating to health policy to pass or fail in this session rw utah has been one of the stingiest states about saying doctors can prescribe medicines but they can never also dispense them but most other states do allow that so this year one of the bills that i worked on was able to get an agreement between prescribers and dispensers so now a medical office that wishes to also dispense medicines can get just a license called a dispensing practice license if it s an acute medication so less than 30 days and it comes prepackaged and it s not a controlled substance then they could stock their most common medicines and also dispense them to folks if they wanted to do that you can drop in for your visit and we take care of everything for there you don t have to go anywhere else but on the other end of the scale you think of clinics serving a homeless population someone might have a big cellulitis on their leg and you can write them a prescription but you know what the pharmacy is two thirds of a mile away and it s night and it s down the frozen road they might not make it clear down there to wait for an hour and then get your prescription so let s just put that into their hands there so they don t fall through the cracks that way sor what do you and your caucus plan to tackle in the next legislative session rw the social services appropriations committee would like to have some different process for dspd services in particular our waiting list which just gets more and more people on it every year people have been there for 10 years they ve been there for 15 years they ve been there 20 years and more on the one hand i know the waiting list is a bottomless pit right now it s kind of hit and miss every year whether money gets appropriated directly to the waiting list some people come off the waiting list every year because people die or move out of the state and that frees up some money so then some other new ones come on but i know there s interest on the committee to try and find some other process so there are at least some high acuity people that we don t leave in the lurch on the waiting list forever this interview was edited for clarity and length

people walk past a restaurant in toronto canada on dec 3 2021 photo by zou zheng xinhua economist nathan janzen said that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels ottawa april 8 xinhua canada s unemployment rate fell 0 2 percentage points to 5 3 percent in march the lowest rate on record since comparable data became available in 1976 statistics canada said friday the drop in the overall unemployment rate in march was driven in large part by a decline of 2 1 percentage points in the unemployment rate for male youth which fell to a low of 10 2 percent in contrast the unemployment rate for female youth was little changed in march at 9 3 percent according to statistics canada with the exception of an increase in january 2022 the unemployment rate has fallen consistently in recent months mirroring the situation in other countries with increasingly tight labour markets including the united states australia and britain statistics canada said the total employment rose by 73 000 or 0 4 percent in march driven by an increase of 93 000 or 0 6 percent in full time work a frequent point of comparison between canada and the united states is the employment rate defined as the number of people who are employed as a percentage of the working age population which is typically higher in canada adjusted to u s concepts and for the population aged 16 and older the employment rate was 62 4 percent in canada and 60 1 percent in the united states in march the rate was unchanged from february 2020 in canada compared with a decline of 1 1 percentage points in the united states statistics canada explained an exhibitor showcases maple syrup products at the 29th annual wellness show in vancouver british columbia canada on march 26 2022 photo by liang sen xinhua royal bank of canada economist nathan janzen said in a market report that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels we look for the central bank to hike rates next week to build on a 25 basis point increase in march with a 50 basis point hike this time more likely janzen said andrew grantham economist with the canadian imperial bank of commerce also forecast a non standard 50 basis point hike from the central bank at next week s meeting because we think that the jobless rate can move down slightly further without creating sustained inflationary pressure labour market conditions don t yet warrant a rapid rise in interest rates to above the neutral rate which is the path financial markets are currently anticipating we still see rates peaking around that neutral level of 2 25 percent in 2023 grantham said in his market report the central bank is slated to announce its decision for the benchmark rate target next wednesday
as the federal reserve intensifies its efforts to tame high inflation its top officials are casting their aggressive drive in a new light as a blow against economic inequality that thinking marks a sharp reversal from the conventional view of the fed s use of interest rates normally the steep rate hikes the fed is planning for the coming months would be seen as a particular threat to disadvantaged and lower income households these groups are most likely to suffer if rate hikes weaken an economy cause unemployment to rise and sometimes trigger a recession instead some of the most dovish fed officials who typically favor low rates to nurture the job market are now going out of their way to point out ways in which inflation falls hardest on poorer americans curbing high inflation they argue is a fairness issue the burden of high prices is particularly great for households with more limited resources lael brainard an influential member of the fed s board of governors and a longtime interest rate dove said in a speech tuesday that is why getting inflation down is our most important task brainard noted that food and energy together account for one quarter of the price spikes that have driven inflation to 40 year highs poorer americans spend about one fourth of their incomes on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit too fast and derailing the economy last month the fed raised its key rate from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 still some democrats have expressed concern that higher rates will slow hiring significantly even while unemployment for black workers for example remains higher than that for whites we clearly have a long way to go when it comes to making sure everyone has a good quality job sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat said last month at a hearing on jerome powell s nomination for a second four year term as fed chair hiking up interest rates too early can depress job growth tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers and some other analysts say the fed is right to highlight the damage that inflation can do to americans ability to afford basic needs such as food gas and rent but they also suggest that some recent fed comments have exaggerated the notion that inflation worsens economic inequality nathan sheets global chief economist for citi and a former fed economist notes for instance that inflation reduces the burden of debt which can disproportionately benefit lower income americans wages typically rise to keep up with inflation but mortgages and other debts usually carry fixed interest rates making them easier to pay off brainard s speech this week was one of the starker examples of the fed s argument that inflation can exacerbate inequality brainard who has been nominated for the fed s no 2 role and is part of powell s inner circle said that lower income households defined as the poorest one fifth spend 77 of their income on necessities including food and housing by contrast the richest one fifth spend just 31 of their incomes on those categories likewise mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and long a dovish voice on the fed s policymaking committee surprised fed watchers this week when she declared that inflation is as harmful as not having a job i understand that if you have a job but you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night daly said in remarks to the native american financial officers association brainard in her speech noted that poorer people often pay higher prices for the same item higher income households for example can afford to make bulk purchases or to stock up on an item when it s being sold at a discount thereby lowering their cost per item and when inflation rises brainard said households that buy name brand cereals can switch to cheaper store brands but poorer consumers that are already buying cheaper items can t make an equivalent price lowering switch powell himself began shifting his rhetoric in this direction last winter during testimony to congress duy said when the fed chair mentioned the harsh impact that inflation inflicts on disadvantaged americans powell hadn t raised that concern in previous testimony in september it was a notable change for the powell fed which has focused on inequality in the job market more than its predecessors in august 2020 the fed updated its policy framework to specify that its goal of maximum employment was broad and inclusive this meant the fed would consider unemployment rates for black and hispanic workers rather than just headline figures in setting its interest rate policies the central bank also said it would no longer raise rates in anticipation of higher inflation but would wait until higher prices actually materialized brainard had highlighted one reason for taking a more patient approach in a speech in february 2021 in those remarks she said that raising rates to pre empt inflation may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges powell and other fed officials say their goal now is to reduce inflation by slowing but not stopping growth reducing high inflation is important to keep the economy expanding they say and ultimately to keep unemployment low for now sheets suggested the fed can raise rates without worrying too much about hurting the job market because its benchmark rate is so low fed officials don t think their key rate will start to restrain growth until it reaches about 2 4 the minutes from the fed s most recent meeting in march released wednesday showed that the officials want to expeditiously reach that level and economists expect them to do so by the end of this year at that point if inflation is still too high the fed might have to raise rates further to a point where layoffs occur and the risks of a recession rise that s when it will get sticky and challenging for the fed when those short run trade offs arise sheets said

wwe appears to be at it again after months of having one or two teams at their disposal on the main roster the company decided to heat up it s women s tag team division heading into wrestlemania 38 many people including myself feared that they we re only doing this as a way to get as many women on the card as possible the end result ended up being a highly entertaining fatal 4 way match that saw sasha banks and naomi walk out with the gold ok great i m all for sasha banks getting her first win at wrestlemania you could see on her face just how much getting that 3 count meant to her after going 0 6 in her previous matches on the grandest stage of them all and while her pairing with naomi was a bit random at the time this team bad reunion has worked out really nicely the questions is what now unfortunately the answer appears to be more of what we ve grown accustomed to with the women s tag team division in the past year queen zelina and carmella had a falling out on raw this past monday and became the fifth consecutive team to split after dropping the titles let me say that one more time queen zelina and carmella became the fifth consecutive women s tag team to break up or to be broken up almost immediately after losing the championships in a bubble this particular split makes sense carmella will be taking an undisclosed amount of time off for her wedding and honeymoon congrats to her and corey and ending her partnership with zelina will presumably keep both the queen and the tag belts on tv however this is a division that badly needs teams right now there are three active tag teams left and one may be done sooner rather than later i ll admit it when rhea ripley and liv morgan were first paired together i rolled my eyes shoe horning two singles competitors together just to make sure creative had something for them to do at wrestlemania is not exactly ideal booking especially considering that rhea was just coming off another make shift tag team run with nikki a s h but much like the talent themselves i quickly learned to love this pairing and began rooting for them as they started rooting for each other she s been working so extremely hard for so extremely long and she always gets to the point but then she just misses out so i really want to help her just get over that wall rhea ripley said about liv morgan even if we have the tag team championships and then we move on to other things separately i just wanna see her exceed and excel in this business because she works so extremely hard and people don t understand that and i don t think people give her enough credit for it i had the chance to chat with rhea ripley in dallas for the bleav in pro wrestling podcast and even she admitted to having some reservations about being apart of another team so soon but it didn t take the traditionally lone wolf performer long at all to realize the chemistry that existed between herself and liv morgan she s a great human she definitely does put a smile on my face which is something that i try to hide when i m out there but she just i don t know it s something about her she just gets to me you know and we go out there and we just have fun rhea followed that up with a funny story about liv asking if she wanted to wear her shirt before their first match together which included a spot on impersonation see clip below ripley new from about that point on that this partnership had potential and as you can see liv morgan felt the same way i looooove her liv morgan yaonlylivvonce april 1 2022 these two may love working with one another but that love wasn t felt this past monday on raw when rhea gave liv the cold shoulder following an unsuccessful attempt to earn a women s tag team title opportunity despite the loss however rhea somehow talked adam pearce and sonya deville into giving liv for brutality at shot at sasha banks and naomi on next week s monday night raw so for now everything appears to be ok but we ve seen this exact same scenario play out before in fact we saw it very recently with nikki a s h the almost super hero lost a number of matches for her team which ultimately led to rhea asking to just be friends not partners and a subsequent heel turn for nikki so if you couple monday s events with recent reports about rhea ripley s future then the writing is clearly on the wall for liv for brutality rumors indicate rhea ripley could soon be channeling her inner darkness and aligning herself with edge and damian priest nothing is set in stone until it actually happens but the nightmare would be a natural fit for this apparently growing faction not only that but it s probably what s in the best interest for rhea the 25 year old has all the makings of a future top star not just in the women s division but in all of wwe her in ring work is impeccable she has a wonderful personality and great mic skills if wwe would allow her to actually showcase those every now and again she also has the all important connection with the audience the only thing that s been lacking is completely out of her control and that s her booking much like the stock of damian priest her positioning on the red brand would instantly rise if she were paired alongside edge a heel turn and a prominent position in a high profile group led by a wwe hall of famer would make ripley a prime candidate to challenge bianca belair for her newly won raw women s championship that s a title that the nightmare has held before but she never really got a chance to get comfortable with the gold around her waist she told me last week that she will definitely be better equipped to handle it the second time around one thing that i definitely learned the most from her first title run is to be calm and just in the moment and to not only hold the championship but show everyone that you are the champion that s something that i didn t really do i was so nervous because i was so new to raw and i was a little bit nervous going out there every time i did and i didn t feel like the champion that everyone was looking at me like i was ever since dropping the title to charlotte at money in the bank last year ripley has just flat out been lost in the shuffle at times in large part due to the booking of the women s tag team division rhea and nikki a s h would have had a much better chance at sustained success had they actually had any teams to defend the women s tag team championships against they spent more time watching john morrison stretching backstage than actually defending the gold ripley herself even told phil strum on under the ring that the tag belts just don t get the love that they deserve the women s tag team championships they sort of get looked down upon by a lot of people i see it on social media all the time and i get it we don t really get good positions on the show and our matches are very very quick so i think that it is important to put it on wrestlemania and remind everyone exactly what we can do and how much these titles do truly mean the match at wrestlemania ended up being a tremendous showcase of what the women s tag team division can be when wwe choses to highlight it however my worry is with wrestlemania in the rear view mirror wwe won t have highlighting that division high on it s priority list then again maybe i m wrong the last time those titles we re heavily showcased on a regular basis one of them rested on the shoulder of sasha banks that said it doesn t matter who the belts are on if there is no one to defend them against the foundation for a strong women s tag division is currently there the boss and glow connection along with liv for brutality are two foundational blocks that wwe should be building upon not immediately tearing down rhea ripley alongside edge would be really cool and great for her career but the argument could be made that the women s division would be healthier as a whole by keeping her with liv morgan wwe really is in a win win situation with ripley when you look at the creative fork in the road they find themselves in with rhea all paths lead to success the reason i hate the idea of splitting her from her new tag team partner is that morgan doesn t deserve yet another change in creative direction so allow me to propose a solution here if rhea ripley is set to join the ranks of the followers atop the mountain of omnipotence why can t liv morgan just go along with her edge s new faction should be comprised of talented superstars in dire need of elevation veteran guidance and a clear direction after years onboard the wwe creative rollercoaster does anyone fit that description more than liv morgan she has worked incredibly hard to earn an opportunity just like this one and should be heavily considered for the group this faction which i ve theorized will be called the grand jury based off the language of edge s promos priest s new punishment for the guilty nickname and a recent wwe trademark filing already has it s leader edge and it s enforcer priest common sense dictates that a tag team could be next but who says it has to be a male team the seeds were sown a year ago pic twitter com fp4gsmnrul adam edge copeland edgeratedr april 5 2022 the viking raiders could certainly use some rehabilitation and a new creative outlet in wwe but i really hope the company breaks from the mold here and adds a female team instead please dare to be a little bold and let this promising pairing of rhea ripley and liv morgan flourish again my thought process here is all about building a viable women s tag team division centered around boss and glow and liv for brutality of course additional teams will need to be added to insure sustained success a pairing of nikki a s h and doudrop has been teased and makes a ton of sense personally i wouldn t mind seeing that group being led by a crazed becky lynch desperate to regain her hold of the thing she covets most her precious raw women s championship natalya and shayna baszler could certainly continue to be utilized and there is no shortage of talent in nxt that could soon get some opportunities on the main roster as well the possibilities are there to build something special should wwe chose to go that route they could certainly elevate rhea ripley by aligning her with the rated r superstar or they could help lift up an entire division the future certainly seems bright for ripley if these latest reports come to fruition but again i ask if they split up liv for brutality what happens to liv morgan if anyone has earned some solid creative footing for a while it s her i really hope that there is a solid plan in place rick ucchino can be reached at rick bleav gmail com you can follow him on twitter rickucchino and

world food commodity prices made a significant leap in march to reach their highest levels ever as war in the black sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao reported today the fao food price index averaged 159 3 points in march up 12 6 percent from february when it had already reached its highest level since its inception in 1990 the index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly traded food commodities the latest level of the index was 33 6 percent higher than in march 2021 the fao cereal price index was 17 1 percent higher in march than in february driven by large rises in wheat and all coarse grain prices largely as a result of the war in ukraine the russian federation and ukraine combined accounted for around 30 percent and 20 percent of global wheat and maize exports respectively over the past three years world wheat prices soared by 19 7 percent during the month exacerbated by concerns over crop conditions in the united states of america meanwhile maize prices posted a 19 1 percent month on month increase hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum contrasting trends across the various origins and qualities kept the march value of fao s rice price index little changed from february and thus still 10 percent below its level of a year earlier the fao vegetable oil price index rose 23 2 percent driven by higher quotations for sunflower seed oil of which ukraine is the world s leading exporter palm soy and rapeseed oil prices also rose markedly as a result of the higher sunflower seed oil prices and the rising crude oil prices with soy oil prices further underpinned by concerns over reduced exports by south america the fao sugar price index rose 6 7 percent from february reversing recent declines to reach a level more than 20 percent higher than in march 2021 higher crude oil prices were a driving factor along with currency appreciation of the brazilian real while favorable production prospects in india prevented larger monthly price increases the fao meat price index increased by 4 8 percent in march to reach an all time high led by surging pig meat prices related to a shortfall of slaughter pigs in western europe international poultry prices also firmed in step with reduced supplies from leading exporting countries following avian flu outbreaks the fao dairy price index rose 2 6 percent and was 23 6 percent higher than in march 2021 as quotations for butter and milk powders rose steeply amid a surge in import demand for near and long term deliveries especially from asian markets updated forecasts for cereals fao also released its new cereal supply and demand brief which includes a forecast for global wheat production in 2022 of 784 million tonnes a 1 1 percent increase from 2021 that estimate factors in expectations that at least 20 percent of ukraine s planted area to winter crops notably winter wheat may not be harvested due to direct destruction constrained access or a lack of resources to harvest crops reports from russia of continued conducive weather conditions as well as prospective production trends in china the european union india north america and elsewhere coarse grain production prospects remain favorable in argentina brazil and south africa wrapping up the 2021 crop year fao s estimate points to a worldwide cereal production of 2 799 million tonnes up slightly from 2020 with rice production reaching an all time high of 520 3 million tonnes in milled equivalent global cereal utilization in 2021 22 is projected at 2 789 million tonnes including a record level for rice with increases also expected for maize and wheat global cereal stocks ending in 2022 are forecast to rise by 2 4 percent from their opening levels largely due to higher wheat and maize stocks in russia and ukraine on account of lower expected exports the global cereal stocks to use ratio is forecast at 29 7 percent in 2021 22 only marginally below the previous year and still indicating a relatively comfortable supply level according to fao fao lowered its forecast for world trade in cereals in the current marketing year to 469 million tonnes marking a contraction from the 2020 21 level largely due to the war in ukraine and based on currently available information expectations point to the european union and india increasing wheat exports while argentina india and the u s shipping more maize partially compensating for the loss of exports from the black sea region source fao
the possibility of a supply disruption to russian oil owing to the russian ukraine crisis has caused a physical and financial shock to the global crude oil market russia is a significant crude oil exporter in the world although it is the third largest oil producer after the united states and saudi arabia preinvasion russian crude oil exports were approximately 4 5 mmb d currently russian crude oil exports have reduced and further reductions are likely understanding the crude oil disposition capacity and capability is important as the situation evolves post invasion in the global crude oil market what are the current crude oil pipeline disposition outlets and what are the possible implications from further reductions in russian crude oil exports the disposition of crude oil from russia has several outlets a critical outlet for europe is via the druzhba pipeline the druzhba pipeline delivers crude oil from russia to poland and germany through belarus hungary slovakia and czech republic via ukraine however if the situation escalates further and impacts russian crude oil exports where can the surplus russian barrels go are there alternative routes that russia can redirect the pipeline flow to beyond europe is incremental offtake to the east and mainland china an option the following map illustrates existing russian oil related infrastructure highlighting oil pipelines refineries and oil storages that are currently operating for level setting purposes russia has an export capability of 11 mmb d for crude oil and refined products and a total operating oil storage capacity of 96 8 mmbbl the largest crude oil storage is the 10 6 mmbbl omsk refinery owned by gazprom neft followed by a 7 3 mmbbl novorossiysk marine terminal owned by caspian pipeline consortium however russia does not own and operate an spr while an spr enables a country to stock up crude for times of supply shortage it also can in this circumstance soak up the immediate surplus without spr russia theoretically has less supply flexibility and can only manage downstream consumption decreases by production cuts correspondingly if the russian crude oil exports are reduced alternative outlets are minimal to nil in country in contrast to russia s lack of crude oil storage facilities its neighboring country and biggest oil consumer mainland china has 12 spr sites in operation totaling 249 7 mmbbl and is contemplating another 5 more going forward russia exports nearly 50 of its crude oil and refined products via long distance pipelines with the balance waterborne liftings and trade it has the two longest oil pipelines in the world the druzhba to the west and the east the espo oil pipeline in addition to these major pipelines waterborne crude oil liftings via very large crude carriers vlccs medium size aframax tankers and other vessel sizes and types provide additional russian crude oil disposition options the focus here is on the east side of russia and the espo oil pipeline the following map shows russia s pipeline export route to asia via the espo oil pipeline the 4 857 km espo oil pipeline starts from taishet in eastern siberia sending oil to the pacific ocean terminal at kozmino the espo oil pipeline was built and operated by russian pipeline company transneft and construction of the pipeline started in 2006 and was completed in 2012 the espo oil pipeline is the key route of russia oil to reach its key consumers in asia including mainland china japan and south korea under the current russia ukraine war situation japanese and south korean companies have backpedaled trading activities with russia while mainland china remains to be an outlet for russian oil deliveries of russian oil via the espo oil pipeline to mainland china started in 2011 crude oil is injected into the 942 km mainland china branch of the espo oil pipeline and further into the northeastern oil pipeline network the mainland china branch pipeline was built and is currently operated by the china national petroleum corporation cnpc with an initial annual transportation capacity of 15 million metric tons mmt per year approximately 0 3 mmb d1 cnpc launched several projects to lift the capacity to 20 mmt to date to further strengthen its oil connection with russia mainland china built a parallel line in 2018 to receive an additional 15 mmt from russia each year the two lines currently have a combined annual capacity of 35 mmt per year mmt y approximately 700 000 b d crude oil import by espo has made russia the largest oil exporter to mainland china overtaking saudi arabia in 2021 asian refineries imported 2 4 mmb d or about 120 mmt y of russian oil via the espo oil pipeline and waterborne routes with over 80 of the oil delivered to mainland china under the current war circumstances is it possible for russia to direct more west word crude to the east there are likely commercial limitations to delivering incremental crude oil to the east via the espo oil pipeline russia and mainland china market participants signed a long term oil supply contract in 2012 for an estimated annual volume of 15 mmt for the term of 20 years the commercial negotiations for the supply contract took the two countries 15 years before it finally concluded the commercial negotiations and executed a supply contract in september 2012 the negotiations for additional supplies and a new supply contract are unlikely to be concluded over a short period of time russia however has a second route to supply oil to mainland china rosneft has signed a 10 year contract with cnpc in february to extend its oil supply through kazakhstan via the atasu alashankou pipeline the contract is for a total of 100 mmt of crude over 10 years or 200 000 b d the atasu alashankou pipeline commissioned in 2006 by kazakhstan china pipeline company has a designed capacity of 400 000 b d the pipeline has previously been used to transport oil from russia to mainland china during 2014 16 140 000 b d of russian crude was sent to mainland china and also during 2017 21 as 200 000 b d of russian crude was sent to mainland china the atasu alashankou pipeline despite the existing spare capacity of 200 000 b d after being assigned for the new russia mainland china contract is not a solution for the standing issue owing to the relatively small designed capacity the estimated espo oil pipeline capacity for deliveries to mainland china for russian oil is approximately 35 mmt y higher than the 30 mmt y designated by the supply contract assuming the volumes available are more than the pipeline s capacity mainland china traders have the ability in an unconstrained world to import espo blend taking waterborne the espo oil pipeline crude blend is favored by mainland china refineries particularly refineries in the northeastern provinces and the tea pot refineries in the shandong province the following map shows pipeline connections with cnpc refineries and tea pot refineries in shandong cnpc has recently upgraded its daqing petrochemical refinery to process 3 5 mmt y of russian oil the refinery joined the existing fleet with dalian petrochemical liaoyang jilin jinzhou jinxi harbin and wepec these refineries process espo blend with indigenous oil production with the espo portion ranging at 15 50 mainland china has currently a total of 38 independent or so called tea pot refineries with a combined capacity of 2 53 mmb d approximately 126 mmt y this figure excludes those refineries that have been acquired by large companies such as by chemchina and norinco espo is the blend at these refineries followed by the urals ihs markit research shows espo import ranges from 1 5 2 5 mmt per month via ports at the shandong coast in summary we believe that the espo pipeline is a critical route for russian oil to reach its key consumer mainland china however this pipeline seems to be at its capacity even before the russia ukraine crisis and it is unlikely for russia to be able to increase its existing supplies to mainland china via this route the other pipeline the atasu alashankou pipeline has limited spare capacity the insufficiency in oil transmission capacity will force russian barrels to take sea routes to mainland china if russian ships continue to be diverted from countries that have imposed self sanctions on russian crudes chinese demand for seaborne russian crude particularly the espo blend and urals will remain stable because these are the preferred grades run by most of the independent large refineries that are owned and operated by national oil companies source ihs markit

washington the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week indicating a further tightening of labor market conditions heading into the second quarter which could contribute to keeping inflation elevated part of the decline in claims back to a more than 53 year low touched in mid march reflected a revision of the seasonal factors the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic the labor department switched to additive factors to seasonally adjust the initial and continued claims data from multiplicative factors which economists had complained were less reliable because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis now that most of the large effects of the pandemic on the unemployment insurance series have lessened the seasonal adjustment models are once again specified as multiplicative models the labor department said in a statement on thursday statistical tests show that the unemployment insurance series should in normal times be estimated multiplicatively initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 166 000 for the week ended april 2 claims were at this level during the week ending march 19 which was the lowest since november 1968 seasonal factors back then were much different from now making it difficult to make comparisons economists polled by reuters had forecast 200 000 applications for the latest week the government also revised claims data from 2017 through 2021 which showed the level of filings much lower last year the switch back to multiplicative factors pushed applications down by about 20 000 40 000 for the recent weeks claims hit a record high of 6 137 million in early april 2020 the government said it would use a hybrid of multiplicative and additive seasonal factors while the pandemic remains within the five year revision period multiplicative seasonal factors are assumed to be proportional to the level of filings while additive factors are not affected the message from these volatile and revision prone data continues to be that the labor market is very tight by most historical standards said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york a severe shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low and boosting hiring worker demand is being driven by a sharp decline in covid 19 infections which has resulted in restrictions being lifted across the country there were big declines in claims in michigan and texas which offset increases in california ohio and pennsylvania stocks on wall street were trading lower the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies prices for longer dated u s treasuries fell near record job openings there is no sign yet that the russia ukraine war which has pushed gasoline prices above 4 per gallon has impacted the labor market nonfarm payrolls increased by 431 000 jobs in march the government reported last friday march marked the 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400 000 which pushed the unemployment rate to a fresh two year low of 3 6 the jobless rate is just one tenth of a percentage point above its pre pandemic level with a near record 11 3 million job openings on the last day of february the scarcity of workers is forcing companies to boost wages which is contributing to high inflation while the claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17 000 to 1 523 million during the week ended march 26 the trend in the so called continuing claims remained low this was just a modest move up from the revised reading for the week ended march 19 that currently stands as the low since the start of the pandemic said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york minutes of the federal reserve s march 15 16 meeting published on wednesday showed policymakers observed that demand for labor continued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market the us central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points the first hike in more than three years wednesday s minutes appeared to set the stage for hefty rate increases down the road job openings far outpace the number of unemployed illustrating the hiring challenges companies are facing there were 6 0 million officially unemployed people in march the resulting strong wage growth is providing some cushion for consumers battered by soaring prices with annual inflation rising at its fastest pace in 40 years the job market is strong giving consumers a break from inflation and geopolitical concerns said scott murray an economist at nationwide in columbus ohio open positions and fewer layoffs point to solid economic growth lucia mutikani reuters
uranium prices are skyrocketing and investors see uranium energy as a strong beneficiary what happened uranium energy uec 1 24 stock has been on a tear in recent months and it seems unstoppable the uranium stock jumped 15 in the month of march according to data from s p global market intelligence and is already up another 19 6 so far this month macro and company specific news combined to drive the rally in the hot stock so what uranium energy stock has been rising alongside uranium prices but the stock shot up earlier this week after the company filed a technical report summary with the u s securities and exchange commission sec on april 4 the filing is important for two reasons it confirms that the assets uranium energy acquired as part of its acquisition of uranium one in december are material to the company s business and that the company has a valuable uranium resource the wyoming hub and spoke project has nearly 7 million pounds of inferred mineral resources and nearly 62 million pounds of measured and indicated mineral resources this is the second hub and spoke project for uranium energy with irigaray processing facility acting as a hub for seven mining sites the company acquired irigaray one of the largest uranium processing facilities in the u s from uranium one this development came around the same day uranium prices rallied and were within an arm s reach of their 11 year high reached on march 10 on april 7 uranium prices touched the 11 year high of 61 60 per pound on speculation that bills to ban imports of russian uranium as part of u s sanctions could see the light of day such a ban could disrupt uranium supply significantly in an already tight market as russia is a key exporter of uranium to the u s uranium fuel is used in reactors to generate nuclear energy which accounts for almost 20 of the electricity generated in the u s now what to be sure uranium energy doesn t produce or sell any uranium for now but the company has production ready assets investors perhaps expect the company to start production soon to take advantage of the rise in uranium prices uranium prices are headed even higher today and rose to 62 8 per pound according to the latest data from tradingeconomics com if the u s imposes a ban on russian imports or russia bans its uranium exports to the u s uranium prices should rally even higher in any case investor interest in uranium stocks is unlikely to die down anytime soon now that the russia ukraine conflict has led several nations to pay more attention to alternative sources of energy over oil and gas with oil prices regaining ground and natural gas prices hitting multiyear highs on friday the prospects for nuclear energy looks even rosier and that could help uranium energy stock sustain momentum
did tesla just threaten to get into the lithium business or the opposite what happened shares of lithium mining start up lithium americas lac plummeted more than 10 on friday before turning around and paring their losses in the late afternoon as of 3 20 p m et lithium americas stock is down only 6 and you can blame elon musk for that so what responding to a post on twitter from world of statistics this afternoon which showed how the price of a ton of lithium has surged 16 5 times in cost over just the last 10 years musk reiterated a thought he first expressed back in 2020 on the occasion of tesla s tsla 5 59 ballyhooed battery day price of lithium has gone to insane levels tesla might actually have to get into the mining refining directly at scale unless costs improve there is no shortage of the element itself as lithium is almost everywhere on earth but pace of extraction refinement is slow elon musk elonmusk april 8 2022 so once again musk is musing publicly about the potential for tesla to go not just into the business of making batteries for its electric cars but actually mining the lithium that goes into those batteries in the first place and if he follows through on that plan well you can see why the threat of tesla competing in lithium americas sandbox might upset shareholders of the latter just a little bit now what and yet here s another thought for you it s been more than 18 months since musk first floated the idea of tesla mining its own lithium eighteen months later musk just tweeted that tesla might actually have to get into the mining refining i repeat tesla might have to get future tense into mining to me this sounds like a confirmation that for the past 18 months despite suggesting that it would mine its own lithium tesla has in fact not taken any steps toward actually doing so contrary to what musk s tweet has investors worrying about today therefore i suspect that the real upshot of this announcement is that lithium americas and other lithium companies probably don t have to worry about tesla getting into the mining refining business at all
with challenges mounting the electric truck maker s 2022 production could disappoint what happened investors who thought rivian automotive rivn 8 00 stock had bottomed out in march were apparently too optimistic the electric vehicle ev stock tumbled by another 16 5 this week according to data provided by s p global market intelligence interestingly enough at least one analyst expects rivian stock to more than double from its current price but investors are finding it hard to maintain faith in the electric truck start up so what rivian filed its annual 10 k report with the securities and exchange commission on march 31 while its numbers were nothing to write home about the filing gave investors a bit more insight into something they hadn t been privy to earlier the impact of the russia ukraine conflict on rivian s operations rivian admitted the supply crunch in critical parts such as semiconductors was posing a major challenge to it noting that it had been compelled to make changes to its processes to adapt to those shortages the changes have only added to the company s vehicle production costs which were already on the rise because of the sharp increases in the prices of metals such as lithium and nickel key inputs for evs rivian also didn t rule out the possibility of a hike in the prices of its vehicles in the near future to offset its rising costs this may not work in rivian s favor as it s already struggling to scale up production and fulfill its order backlog for perspective on april 5 rivian reiterated its forecast that it will produce 25 000 evs in 2022 just a few weeks ago it said it could have produced 50 000 units this year if not for the supply and logistics challenges moreover rivian said on april 5 that it had produced 2 553 vehicles and delivered 1 227 vehicles in the first quarter although i find this production run rate encouraging given that rivian had produced only 1 410 vehicles this year through march 8 investors wanted more from the company in between general motors gm 0 91 and honda announced plans to co develop and mass produce affordable electric vehicles by 2027 although the legacy automakers are targeting crossovers and suvs the possibility of them developing an electric pickup cannot be ruled out general motors gmc hummer ev which is expected to start production in 2023 is already being viewed as a rival to rivian s r1t pickup meanwhile tesla tsla 5 59 has officially opened the texas gigafactory that will initially produce the model y suv but will next year start manufacturing the delayed cybertruck another direct competitor to the r1t now what to be fair i m not surprised that rivian shareholders are feeling nervous the r1t pickup truck may have received glorious initial reviews but that will make little difference to investors until the company can produce trucks at scale and deliver them to buyers competition in its niche is heating up and costs are on the rise and with investor confidence slipping those headwinds are getting reflected in rivian s stock price

provided by xinhua economist nathan janzen said that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels ottawa april 8 xinhua canada s unemployment rate fell 0 2 percentage points to 5 3 percent in march the lowest rate on record since comparable data became available in 1976 statistics canada said friday the drop in the overall unemployment rate in march was driven in large part by a decline of 2 1 percentage points in the unemployment rate for male youth which fell to a low of 10 2 percent in contrast the unemployment rate for female youth was little changed in march at 9 3 percent according to statistics canada with the exception of an increase in january 2022 the unemployment rate has fallen consistently in recent months mirroring the situation in other countries with increasingly tight labour markets including the united states australia and britain statistics canada said the total employment rose by 73 000 or 0 4 percent in march driven by an increase of 93 000 or 0 6 percent in full time work a frequent point of comparison between canada and the united states is the employment rate defined as the number of people who are employed as a percentage of the working age population which is typically higher in canada adjusted to u s concepts and for the population aged 16 and older the employment rate was 62 4 percent in canada and 60 1 percent in the united states in march the rate was unchanged from february 2020 in canada compared with a decline of 1 1 percentage points in the united states statistics canada explained provided by xinhua royal bank of canada economist nathan janzen said in a market report that with extremely tight labour markets and above target inflation there is no reason for the bank of canada to leave interest rates at emergency low levels we look for the central bank to hike rates next week to build on a 25 basis point increase in march with a 50 basis point hike this time more likely janzen said andrew grantham economist with the canadian imperial bank of commerce also forecast a non standard 50 basis point hike from the central bank at next week s meeting because we think that the jobless rate can move down slightly further without creating sustained inflationary pressure labour market conditions don t yet warrant a rapid rise in interest rates to above the neutral rate which is the path financial markets are currently anticipating we still see rates peaking around that neutral level of 2 25 percent in 2023 grantham said in his market report the central bank is slated to announce its decision for the benchmark rate target next wednesday

it s no secret that the statutory deck under erisa is stacked heavily in favor of multiemployer pension plans mepps and against employers contributing to or withdrawing from taft hartley trust funds for example an employer who receives a demand to pay its alleged allocable share of a multiemployer pension plan s unfunded vested benefits withdrawal liability will generally only have 90 days to properly respond or be forever barred from raising any defenses except payment in full the deadlines for initiating arbitration are even trickier an employer must initiate arbitration on the earlier of 1 60 days after the date the plan responds to the employer s request for a review or 2 180 days after the employer s request for review an unwary employer may miss the arbitration deadline by simply expecting the mepp to respond to the request for review which it has no obligation to do even more alarming to some employers is that if certain interim withdrawal liability payments as calculated by the mepp are not timely made the otherwise applicable 20 year payment schedule can be accelerated and the full amount as alleged by the fund can be enforced in federal district court by the trustees for the mepp this is true even before the merits of the underlying liability have been arbitrated and assuming no deadlines were missed this harsh result sometimes called pay now dispute later is an extraordinary remedy that allows the funds to at times avoid due process the federal courts have further expanded the reach of these mepps the ninth circuit lowered the bar for mepps seeking to enforce withdrawal liability against successors resilient floor covering pension trust fund bd of trs v michael s floor covering inc 801 f 3d 1079 1090 91 9th cir 2015 citing nlrb v jeffries lithograph co 752 f 2d 459 463 9th cir 1985 the seventh circuit appears even more willing to allow mepps to enforce a predecessor s withdrawal liability against successors by focusing on the intent and motives of the asset purchaser see our article on indiana elec workers pension benefit fund v manweb servs 884 f 3d 770 7th cir 2018 however on a seemingly rare occasion reasonableness and fairness prevail in favor of the employer and against the mepp in a recent decision by the eastern district of washington the employer was able to overcome successor allegations by the international painters and allied trades industry pension fund iupat fund d9 contrs inc v int l painters allied trades indus pension fund 2022 u s dist lexis 37072 e d wash mar 2 2022 in that case the iupat fund sought to enforce withdrawal liability alleged to be owed by division 9 contractors inc division 9 against a similarly named employer d9 contractors inc d9 d9 filed the action in federal court seeking a declaration that it did not owe any withdrawal liability to the iupat fund despite never initiating arbitration and never making an interim payment under the applicable legal standard the court focused on continuity of operations between d9 and division 9 both entities shared some employees and both relied on the same equipment and methods of production however in the end the court held that based on all the applicable factors the iupat fund failed to connect the dots between division 9 and d9 the court also discussed a procedural issue but in the end the case was decided on the merits and in favor of the employer phew d9 is like a terrible surprise party that turned out ok in the end the necessity of the employer s declaratory action although ultimately successful is a chilling reminder that all correspondence from mepps should be taken seriously especially demands for withdrawal liability the failure to strictly adhere to statutory deadlines can be and often is catastrophic savvy employers would be well served by treating withdrawal liability like any other potential liability that could threaten the solvency of the company and all trades and businesses under common control with the withdrawing employer with the proper counsel withdrawal liability can be managed and most unwanted surprises avoided deal counsel is similarly well served by seeking our counsel with due diligence and in negotiating asset stock purchase agreements when either seller or buyer ever contributed to a mepp withdrawal liability can be a huge scary number but attempting to merely white knuckle it may deliver your company or your m a deal a fatal yet avoidable blow
infowars conspiracy theorist alex jones talks a lot about preparing for the apocalypse selling his fans all manner of ways to stock their bunkers ahead of the end of the world but now plaintiffs for sandy hook families suing jones allege that he s doomsday prepped his own business ahead of hefty legal judgments illicitly moving money out of infowars into shell companies to avoid paying his victims in a court motion filed wednesday in texas the families claim that he has concealed infowars assets to make the company appear to be nearly bankrupt the families were joined in the motion by another man suing jones for falsely accusing him of carrying out the 2018 parkland shooting the filing was first posted online by courthouse news infowars didn t respond to a request for comment on paper infowars parent company free speech systems seems to lose money every year yet jones has allegedly transferred significant amounts out of the company financial transactions that often coincide with legal setbacks jones has faced in the sandy hook cases after the families sued him in 2018 for example jones allegedly started personally withdrawing a total of 18 million from the free speech systems bank account over three years along with drawing an annual 600 000 salary many of the suspicious transfers center on a mysterious company called pqpr which the plaintiffs claim is controlled by jones and his family members shortly after jones lost his last appeal to block the defamation cases in texas pqpr claimed that free speech systems owed it 54 million almost all of infowars assets free speech systems began transferring its money to pqpr then onto a series of shell corporations controlled by other jones family members according to the motion while the payments were ostensibly made to pay off the hefty 54 million in arrears a debt pqpr hadn t bothered to enforce in the seven years during which infowars racked up the tens of millions in supposed debt the plaintiffs say this was just a scheme to shelter infowars assets in an alphabet soup of shell entities they re transfers designed to siphon off assets to make them judgment proof the lawyers allege the debt payments accelerated after a texas judge ruled before trial that jones lost his case an unusual step taken because of jones repeated violations of other legal rules since that ruling the plaintiffs say free speech systems has paid pqpr between 11 000 each day and 11 000 each week along with as much as 80 percent of infowars sales revenue in their motion the lawyers for the sandy hook families describe the payments as jaw dropping the discovery of the alleged transfers marks just one in a number of legal headaches facing jones as the sandy hook cases head to trial later this month he has lost cases in both texas and connecticut by default judgment meaning the upcoming trials will only be used to determine how much he has to pay the plaintiffs in late march jones dodged a deposition in the connecticut case by claiming he had a surprise illness only to ultimately sit for the interview after a judge ordered him to pay 25 000 a day until he complied

pamela a smith who was named chief of the u s park police in february of last year abruptly retired friday after 24 years in the department no reason was given for her departure smith 54 had been a longtime commander in the department and was the first black woman to lead the agency in its 231 year history she had previously been the first woman to lead the park police s new york field office and she had been deputy chief of the homeland security division and the field operations division park police officers are stationed in federal parks in and around the district new york city and san francisco when smith took the job she inherited a troubled department with issues that had been becoming increasingly public in recent months it was unclear friday night how much progress had been made in addressing these issues advertisement in february the interior department s inspector general issued a harsh report on the state of the park police s dispatch center in southeast washington which it said police commanders had ignored for years the report said automated emergency alarms are sent to a room separate from the dispatchers that they cannot hear allowing a flood at arlington national cemetery to go unaddressed that dispatchers are poorly trained and understaffed and that mold and bird droppings are rampant in the building and on wednesday the park police officers union filed a five page complaint with the inspector general saying the agency was engaged in gross negligence and mismanagement at great risk to the safety of the public due to understaffing of sworn personnel the fraternal order of police s park police labor committee said staffing for the three field offices had dropped from about 639 officers to 494 officers lower than the force size in 1975 the complaint said that smith decided in february to cancel certain days off to fill the massive holes in even bare minimum law enforcement coverage under the current staffing system every officer is basically on call all the time and there is no end in sight the complaint signed by union chairman kenneth spencer said the san francisco office which mainly protects the presidio park is down to 33 officers from a previous staffing of 83 advertisement then on thursday the union filed a 25 page grievance with smith citing the dispatch center problems and the understaffing as matters that put officers in danger the department of interior national park service does not give our current chief pamela smith the tools she needs the grievance says to make the uspp successful and provide quality law enforcement service to the public in san francisco new york and the washington metropolitan area spencer was surprised by the friday evening announcement this is news to us spencer said it s unfortunate because we were hoping to accomplish some things together with her being a former union executive but unfortunately that s not going to happen now so we wish her well in whatever her future endeavors are smith did not respond to an email friday seeking comment she sent an email to the department at 5 30 p m friday announcing her departure without giving a reason i look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks as i cap off an extraordinary career smith wrote advertisement smith s announcement said her resignation would be effective april 30 share this article share deputy chief christopher stock was appointed interim chief when smith was appointed last year she said she was going to implement body worn cameras for the department which had no cameras in its cars or on its officers last may smith announced that san francisco officers would begin wearing such cameras by the end of 2021 spencer said friday that they are now wearing them the only other federal officers that currently use body cameras are rangers in the national park service and officers in the fish and wildlife service according to testimony and information gathered by the house natural resources committee last fall the justice department with more than 43 000 sworn agents in the fbi the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and the marshals service does not use body worn or in car cameras advertisement smith followed two chiefs with somewhat stormy tenures she replaced former chief robert d maclean who was promoted in august 2019 to head the interior department s office of law enforcement and security and who maintained a strict silence over the 2017 slaying of unarmed motorist bijan ghaisar by two park police officers in fairfax county maclean refused to release any information about the shooting or address the ghaisar family s allegations of poor treatment by his officers while trying to see ghaisar as he lay in a coma in a news conference after she was appointed smith said that one of my first priorities as chief of police is to be briefed as to what occurred and that she was certainly looking forward to providing a response but the ghaisars said they never heard from her in november the interior department served notice on the officers involved lucas vinyard and alejandro amaya that they would be fired within 30 days smith told officers in roll call meetings that she was not consulted on the move according to emails obtained by the washington post and that she supported the union s opposition to the move a lawyer for the officers noted that firing the officers without due process violated multiple aspects of their union contract and the officers remain on the department on administrative leave with pay manslaughter charges against them filed in 2020 were dismissed by a federal judge in october but fairfax prosecutors are appealing that advertisement acting chief gregory monahan served after maclean and oversaw the park police s actions as they aggressively pushed protesters out of lafayette square on june 1 2020 in advance of a visit to st john s church by then president donald trump for a photo opportunity monahan testified before congress and an inspector general s report later confirmed that the park police did not act on trump s behalf but instead were moving to expand a protective perimeter for officers in the park
as discussed in our previous blog on april 1 2022 los angeles superior court judge terry green granted summary judgment in favor of individuals represented by d c based nonprofit judicial watch declaring assembly bill 979 ab 979 to be unconstitutional and granting an injunction preventing the expenditure of taxpayer funds on the implementation of the measure ab 979 required publicly held corporations with a principal executive office in california to have at least one member from an underrepresented community on their board of directors by december 31 2021 a director from an underrepresented community included an individual who self identifie as black african american hispanic latino asian pacific islander native american native hawaiian or alaska native or who self identifie as gay lesbian bisexual or transgender companies in violation of ab 979 faced fines of 100 000 for first violations and 300 000 for repeated violations in its lawsuit challenging the law judicial watch claimed ab 979 violated the equal protection clause of the california constitution by using taxpayer funds to enforce a quota based on race ethnicity sexual preference and transgender status california disagreed arguing that ab 979 was necessary to reverse a culture of discrimination and pointing out that no companies had been fined and no tax dollars had been used to enforce the measure judge green has since issued an order agreeing with judicial watch that ab 979 violates the equal protection clause of the california constitution on its face because ab 979 treats similarly situated individuals qualified potential corporate board members differently based on their membership or lack thereof in certain listed racial sexual orientation and gender identity groups it requires that a certain specific number of board seats be reserved for members of the groups on the list and necessarily excludes members of other groups from those seats the use of suspect categories is not justified by any compelling interest the broader public benefits produced by well run businesses do not fit that bill on the other hand while remediation of discrimination can be a compelling interest the state must define a specific arena in which the discrimination has occurred orporate boards are not such an arena the legislature did not even attempt to limit its investigation or its findings to california corporations though jurisdictional restrictions ensured that only california corporations would be covered by the law and even supposing that corporate boards were a sufficiently specific arena neither the legislature nor the secretary has produced the combination of a valid statistical comparisons and b anecdotal testimony which could serve as convincing evidence of discrimination in that arena the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve the compelling interests offered the legislature made no attempt to conduct a demographic survey of the qualified talent pool of potential board members made no attempt to obtain disclosure from california corporations regarding the current demographics of their boards the legislature and the secretary blame a secretive insular selection process for the problem with current board compositions yet there has been no attempt to improve that process nor has any good explanation been offered for that lack of effort this decision may impact another lawsuit judicial watch filed against the state challenging a 2018 law senate bill 826 requiring a minimum of one female director on corporate boards this decision may also impact the securities and exchange commission approval of a rule proposed by nasdaq set to go in effect this year that will require companies listed on its exchange to have at least one director who self identifies as a female and to have at least one director who self identifies as black or african american hispanic or latinx asian native american or alaska native native hawaiian or pacific islander two or more races or ethnicities or as lgbtq or explain why they do not the current california secretary of state dr shirley weber has yet to comment on whether or not she will appeal this decision nevertheless proponents of ab 979 are hopeful that the law has already created expectations of increased diversity on corporate boards moving forward we will continue to monitor this decision and provide any relevant updates

green bay wi wtaq the end is near for the legendary the exclusive company record store in downtown green bay a phrase an ad recited by just about anyone who grew up in eastern wisconsin say it with me it was an iconic sounding call for a record shop unlike any other tom smith is the manager at the exclusive company location in the broadway district he s been working there for 33 years this building has had such a music history for a long long time it s going to be sad to see it not as a house of music smith told wtaq news the company showed up exclusively as mr g james giombetti opened up shop in west bend in 1956 mr giombetti just had this vision and this passion and determination to build america s best full line independent record chain smith said he was the best record store owner to work for because he s 100 percent behind us on stocking the stores how we wanted to and i think that s why people like the exclusive company they all have their own complexion their pros and cons and that was because of mr g smith says while mr g was a supportive owner there were definitely rules about what was acceptable at the exclusive company he gave all the stores the autonomy to stock what we wanted what we felt was appropriate for our market or even stuff that we think we should try in our market smith said he was like a father figure at times you don t want him angry at you the building itself has a long history of music serving as the pipe dreams record shop before giombetti took over this building has a lot of history we ve had a lot of in store like ozzy was here cheap trick the violent femmes came when it was still pipe dreams smith recalled lately record sales seem to be on the rise but smith says the industry is struggling to keep up with demand i hate to say it but the record industry has always been the biggest detriment to the record industry like it s its own worst enemy smith said last christmas parents to come in with their lists of what they wanted for their children or other family members or friends and they d hand me list i d have to say i m sorry that one we ve been out for 6 months or that one here is 9 months out this one s been a year it s because the record companies just can t keep what s in demand in supply they sure would help all the record stores if they just built some more pressing plants but incredibly the industry and the stores survive even through a pandemic but the passing of the local record king mr g seemed to be the tipping point our participation in it will be wrapping up smith said we re goners as they say it s all she wrote it s a wrap but as music and record sales survive so do the enthusiasts in fact they seem to be multiplying mike mckeough remembers going to the record shop in green bay even before mr g took over i ve been coming here since it was pipe dreams and that was 60 70 i m 67 now so 50 years it s been part of green bay for 50 60 years the store itself mckeough said i just enjoy music can t play an instrument but i just enjoy listening to it and in this store here you get everything i just love the store i could stay here all day just listen the music they play i think they re going to miss a lot of it just looking around in here you see the younger kids so it s nice to see the younger generations started coming here and everything like that too and all of a sudden they re not gonna have any place to go to now one of those young people was sam kalies we found him flipping through vinyls waiting for something to catch his eye he might be in his mid twenties but for sam and his friends the exclusive company has been home for years i was probably like 15 or so so about 10 years ago and i ve lived in green bay my whole life so i ve been coming here often like a couple times a month probably kalies said i feel like they have a really great selection and it s been a cool way to find some smaller indie artists and some things you wouldn t see in bigger retail stores it helps me connect with the the city i ve brought a lot of friends here and we connect over music and we often have a lot of conversations and share stuff that we find here so there s a community aspect of it for sure that community young and old still seems to be working to grasp the news that the exclusive company won t be around much longer well the way i heard about it was from my nieces and nephews it shocked me at first they d always ask if it s closing and i d say i have no idea but i sure hope not i m just sad it s closing mckeough added i ll miss the place when it s gone it was pretty shocking i found out really early this morning and it kind of set a somber tone for the day kalies said i love this place and i ll miss it that tone prompting kalies to rock an exclusive company branded shirt during what was surely not his final stop in the store but even with a few more stops between now and the end he s still trying to figure out one thing sadness loss and thinking about where i ll get my records from now on kalies said no matter where that will be mckeough says it simply won t be the same they re not as knowledgeable as tom and his crew here you can ask them for something they know exactly what you mean and where it is and go get it for you in those big stores you can stand there for hours and not get any service mckeough said the green bay location is expected to officially close sometime in july others are set to close by the end of july they will still take part in national record store day on april 23rd with special deals the shop in milwaukee will live on as a record shop under a new name lilliput records smith says they re even buying the building he thinks that will go well and admits he s already special ordered some things from that shop the original shop in west bend will also survive as a record shop long time customers bought the inventory and fixtures and kept the manager and staff on that ll be known as the beat goes on and more records

james s brady press briefing room 2 38 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone q happy friday ms psaki happy friday is there more to say on this historic day laughter okay so i want to first start by outlining our security assistance to ukraine and there s been a lot of good questions about this and we thought this would be a helpful rundown for all of you it s the department of defense also put out a factsheet that has this detailed as well the security assistance the biden administration is providing to ukraine is enabling critical success on the battlefield against the russian invading force the number one reason that they re able to fight back is their bravery and courage the number two reason is the security assistance that we are providing and we are providing in coordination with our allies and partners we re working around the clock to fulfill ukraine s priority security assistance requests delivering weapons from u s stocks when they are available and facilitating the delivery of weapons by allies and partners when their systems better suit ukraine s needs all of the anti armor and anti air systems from the two packages of security assistance the president approved in march have been delivered we are continuing work with allies and partners to identify additional weapons systems to help the ukrainian military defend its country obviously there was the announcement about the s 300s earlier today and our efforts to work to backfill that at president zelenskyy s request this includes helping ukraine acquire long range anti aircraft systems and munitions that they are trained to use more than 30 nations have sent ukraine security assistance thanks in part to the leadership of president biden and diplomacy that he has been implementing for months now on april 5th we announced an additional 100 million in security assistance to ukraine through a presidential drawdown authority we also announced 300 million in security assistance on april 1st under authorities provided by the ukraine security assistance initiative these announcements bring the u s commitment to more than 1 7 billion in security assistance since russia s february 24th invasion and 2 4 billion since the beginning of the administration i will not read through all of this for you you can all of course read it yourself and we will provide all of the list to all of you should if you did not receive the department of defense factsheet i also wanted to note that today according to a new independent study the biden administration s historic vaccination program saved 2 3 million lives in the united states prevented 17 million hospitalizations and 66 million cases and avoided 900 billion in healthcare costs over the past 15 months the president has mounted a successful nationwide vaccination effort while executing a comprehensive strategy on treatments testing and more as a result schools are open our economy is booming and importantly today s report shows we ve spared millions of families the immeasurable loss that too many others have suffered and because of the president s comprehensive response we ve entered a new moment in our fight against the virus while covid isn t over americans now have more tools than ever before to protect themselves and this country is moving forward safely back to many of our more normal routines unfortunately republicans in congress are holding up critical funding we need to make even more progress to save even more lives and to stay prepared against any potential surges or variants inaction will leave our nation less prepared for future surges and variants it will mean fewer vaccines treatments and tests for the american people this is deeply disappointing and it should be unacceptable to every american i also wanted to give you a sense of the week ahead just one trip next week that we announced earlier today at this point there could be more on thursday the president will travel to greensboro north carolina to discuss his administration s efforts to make more in america rebuild our supply chains here at home and bring down costs for the american people as part of building a better america following that trip he will travel to camp david where he will remain over the easter weekend and then finally as i ve been doing a little bit this week i just want to shout out some amazing colleagues i have lewis who we have stolen from fema not really stolen he s a detailee well he s a fellow actually we ve had him since november soon they will steal him back and lewis has been remarkable lewis has been reading russian media which comes in use in great use he has been tracking down a range of coverage about the war in ukraine he has been relentless in giving us updates and providing us information and we re incredibly grateful to lewis and we ll be sad to see you go back to fema to do very important work many of you know amanda finney i call her the mayor because she knows every person seemingly who works in the building and on the complex which is about 2 000 people i would not survive this job without amanda finney you probably would all not have received all the help you have received about a range of things without amanda finney she is smart sassy levelheaded stable she s remarkable and we may all work for her one day in some capacity i certainly may but i m very grateful to her so i just wanted to shout that out and her yellow suit is very joyful for a joyful day okay with that it s a friday q it s friday thanks so much i ve got a couple things ms psaki sure q first on this the missile attack at this train station does the administration think that russia might have intentionally targeted the train station knowing that there will be a lot of civilians there ms psaki well what we ve seen over the course of the last six weeks or more than that has been what the president himself has characterized as war crimes which is the intentional targeting of civilians this is yet another horrific atrocity committed by russia striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety where we are now is we re going to support efforts to investigate this attack as we document russia s actions hold them accountable and we will continue to surge security assistance and weapons deliveries to help ukraine defend their country obviously the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime and we ve already called a range of the actions we ve seen to date a war crime but we re going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here q okay changing topics senior administration officials have said publicly on tv suggesting it s possible the president could get covid i m wondering is the administration attempting to prepare the public for the possibility of the president getting the testing positive ms psaki well what we re trying to do is be as transparent and direct with the american people as possible about the fact that while the president is takes a range of protocols we have a range of protocols in place here that are aligned and even beyond the cdc requirements those include as we ve outlined here many times in the past testing before you see the president testing before you travel with him social distancing when possible we believe we have the tools and protocol to address this point we are in the virus but like anyone else the president may at some point test positive for covid and while we have seen an increase in recent i would just note while we have seen an increase in cases around people i should just say that some of us may know i would also note that cases remain down 95 percent since the height of omicron that is fact that is data even as we ve seen cases of people we know but what is important for the american people to know is that he has taken a range of precautions as we all have but he s also taken steps like getting the second booster as he did last week in public and his doctors are comfortable that he could continue to carry out his duties because of all these steps and precautions and protections he s taken and we certainly that s one of the reasons we encourage the rest of the american public to do the same go ahead q do you this is the first time that we ve heard a white house official sort of describe it as a certain possibility that the president could get covid are you saying that you think it s more possible now given sort of the little outbreak that we re seeing in d c right now ms psaki no we re just saying that it is a possibility again we are cases are down 95 percent across the country since the height of omicron while cases are up in washington d c they re also far below the height of the cases and where they were in omicron but it is also the case that despite all the precautions we take and even with the president being double boosted he could still test positive for covid just as people in the many people in the white house have many people in the press corps have that is a possibility and we want to be transparent with the american public about that q by our rough count here you have at least 18 politicians and people close to the president who have now tested positive this week though and you ve reiterated all the extra precautions that you are taking to try and keep him safe some of the extra masking and testing protocol but just to be safe have you considered maybe cutting down some of the big indoor events or scaling back any or changing sort of your tactic with some of these events ms psaki well clearly we did the event the historic event today outside that was in part to ensure that we could have a huge number of people on the south lawn celebrating the confirmation of justice ketanji brown jackson but also we know that having events outside is better for safety protocols there s no question about that but what s important for the american people to know and understand is that because of all the steps we ve taken because the president is double boosted because of you know obviously he has access to the best healthcare in the world but his doctors have assessed that these are risks that can be taken we risk assess just like everybody out in the country and it s important for him to be able to continue his presidential duties now and even if he tests positive in the future just like americans out there in the country are taking their kids to school they go to the grocery store maybe they re making a decision to go to dinner this is a time where we are certainly living with the virus but we have a range of tools at our disposal to do that go ahead q thanks jen a couple of quick questions on oil and then one on the french election we have some reporting showing that the administration is considering easing sanctions to allow some oil imports from venezuela as a way to replace banned energy shipments from russia can you talk a little bit about any such considerations ms psaki i m not aware of that being under consideration q okay okay at the moment is it is it going to perhaps be considered for going forward or ms psaki it has not been so i m not aware of it being under consideration q okay and one other one on when daleep was in india he delivered this warning to india to not raise purchases of russian oil and we were wondering if perhaps sanctions along similar lines are being considered for other nations asking them to keep purchases of russian oil only limited to previous levels and perhaps not raise inaudible ms psaki first i wouldn t characterize it as a warning nor did we at the time he went and had a constructive conversation and made clear that while it s the decision of each individual country including india to determine whether they re going to import russian oil it is only 1 to 2 percent of their imports about 10 percent of their imports is from the united states and so he conveyed of course they should abide by sanctions which are not related to that decision but also we would be here to help them diversify and move towards even reducing further beyond the 1 to 2 percent q is that decision perhaps being relayed also to other countries asking them to perhaps follow the same guidelines ms psaki well we convey to every country to abide by sanctions and we ve conveyed to a range of european countries as you know and as we ve talked about that as they work to diversify their energy sources that we are here to assist in those efforts and there are a range of steps we ve taken including efforts on lng i mean that s natural gas of course but efforts on lng and moving some resources from asia and other places and ensuring that there are options to for any country that wants to to diversify their energy sources q okay and one on the french elections are you watching the french elections coming up this sunday perhaps with any concerns especially with the rise of le pen who is a far right candidate running against macron ms psaki we are certainly watching the elections but i don t have any prediction of what the outcome will be and once there is an outcome i m sure we will speak to it go ahead q understanding it s a fluid situation but i think the atrocities in bucha serve as an accelerant towards the latest sanctions package the coordination between the g7 ms psaki that we announced two days ago q yes ms psaki yes q is there any sense that the strike that we saw this morning will also accelerate talks on additional sanctions between the coordinated allies ms psaki well i would say just go to go back to a couple of days ago that obviously the sanctions package we announced on wednesday with some the biggest bank in russia sberbank certainly that was augmented as a result of the atrocities that we were seeing in bucha and what we have done to date and we will continue to do is look at unfortunately the continued atrocities that we re seeing in the country and assess how that s going to impact sanctions consequences and obviously additional security assistance so that s how we ve been evaluating and working with our allies to date and i m certain given the video footage we ve seen on airwaves across the world and photos that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward q okay on the s 300 ms psaki mm hmm q it s been fairly apparent for the last several weeks that that was a process that you guys were engaged in ms psaki yeah q i know you are deliberately ambiguous as to some of the other processes that may be taking place but is it fair to say that there are multiple other tracks that are similarly far down the line for other weapons systems or how can you characterize how far along you are compared to where you are now with the s 300 on other systems ms psaki so well one i mean part of our objective here and the s 300s are an example of that is to see that we can get defensive equipment that ukrainians are trained on and that we know can be effective moved to ukraine so we are of course grateful to slovakia and we work closely with slovakia to also meet their defense needs and part of our considerations here as we re looking at the list of requests that the ukrainians have is what do we have access to here in the united states what military equipment do we have access to there are systems we may not have access access to or we may not even have those systems so how can we work with countries around the world like slovakia to meet those needs so there are a range of those conversations happening with our partners and allies at the same time i will tell you that often it is the preference of these partners and allies not to be public about these conversations and at times it is the preference of the ukrainians and we certainly respect that q and just one final one it s been a pretty historic 24 hours ms psaki yeah q for the history of the supreme court for the country we ve seen the president speak publicly can you talk about do you have any color in terms of what he s been like behind the scenes delivering on a campaign pledge ms psaki yeah q putting the first african american woman on the court how he s been with staff with the justice all that ms psaki sure i m going to try not to ugly cry about this day because which we were all we were all doing on the south lawn look i was with the president before he went out i was there on time i didn t run out as you would have seen i was with him before when he was reviewing his doing his final review of his remarks and what he was reflecting on is and you saw some of this in his speech were the number of people whether it is people who work at the white house people who are part of his every day you know stewards or others who have commented to him how significant this moment is and how you know in a place where you are just trying to trying to make it through every day and every day is history in many ways history can be heartbreaking and many days it has been history can be exhausting and many days it has been and history can be joyful and today was a joyful day in history and that is certainly how the president was you saw his granddaughter naomi who he talked about in the speech come out she was there also for a brief greet with with justice jackson beforehand and he made a made an effort to also introduce the new associate justice to some members of his close staff who just were inspired by the significance of today as well so i would say there was a deep recognition of this moment of history a joy in reaching it and i think we ve all been saying to each other in the hallways no one can speal our steal our sunshine today because that s how everybody is feeling q thanks jen ms psaki go ahead q thank you jen to follow up on that did the president spend any time with the jackson family before the formal event or afterward inaudible ms psaki well i think as we confirmed she signed her commission or he signed her commission and her family was with her for that so it was briefly before he came out to do the remarks q okay got it and to follow up on a question from katie earlier this week about other precautions that the president may or may not be taking do you know or he is taking any monoclonal antibodies to help prevent catching covid ms psaki well evusheld is for immunocompromised that would be the preemptive step and he s not immunocompromised so he s not taking evusheld q is taking any other medication that might help ms psaki like what q well i don t actually know laughs that s a great question other than the booster you know we ve heard other people taking other kinds of prophylactics to prevent it is he taking anything that you know of ms psaki there are not other this is why i asked there are not other evusheld is obviously one that if you re immunocompromised is something that has been approved and recommended since he is not categorized that way he isn t taking it but other than that the precautions we re taking are he obviously got the booster when he was eligible last week and you know we take additional steps including testing socially distanced meetings when possible as well in order to protect him as much as possible q thank you and then just one more on something that samantha power shared ms psaki sure q she said that russian forces have killed at least seven journalists in ukraine in six weeks and that putin soldiers are killing journalists at an unprecedented rate is there any intelligence any information that putin is targeting journalists and do you have any warning that you re sharing with american journalists covering the war ms psaki well one we we value the role that american journalists and journalists from around the world cell phone disruption that felt like a direction to somewhere have played in in bringing light bringing to light for a lot of people in this country this war what s happening the devastation the horrors it has been a had a direct impact on people s emotional response in the united states there s no question about that we recognize the work of journalists in war zones of course and value it and as you all know we also work very closely with leaders of news organizations to ensure that they have up to date information to keep members of their media organization safe it is still a war zone an active war zone and we re still conveying that americans should not be there right including journalists in terms of specific targeting we knew from the beginning and we ve talked publicly about this of course that president putin and the russian military was going to target was intending to target or could target civilians and others including journalists could be part of that but i don t have anything any new intelligence or anything beyond that q thank you ms psaki go ahead q thanks jen is there a carve out in cdc regulations for covid for the vice president ms psaki tell me more peter i m sure this is going somewhere let s see q well you know the ms psaki what do you got for me on a friday q the cdc says for people exposed to covid up to date on their covid 19 vaccinations do not go to places where you are unable to wear a well fitting mask so why is she here at the white house today giving the new supreme court justice a big hug with no mask ms psaki you mean when she gave her a ma a hug outside q yes ms psaki she was outside q does the cdc say that people who are close contact can give people hugs outside ms psaki we know peter that outside it is it is you are you can benefit significantly being outside that s why we have we had the event outside today i will tell you that the vice president has been wearing a mask inside when there was a private greet they were all wearing masks before they went out q we saw she was wearing a mask yesterday at the senate ms psaki she was playing an important role in confirming or overseeing the confirmation of the first black woman to the supreme court the vast majority as was on camera peter q is there a public health carve out for that ms psaki as was on camera let me finish my answer here because fox and other i don t know actually that fox carried it but others did saw that she was socially distanced from people for the vast vast majority of her time overseeing that confirmation yesterday q so this is not a case of rules for thee but not for vp ms psaki in fact the vice president wore a mask inside today when she was both with the president with her staff other people she was outside at the event she was socially distanced for 99 9 percent of the event today and she had an emotional moment which is understandable q okay and one other topic following up on the smartphones that are being given to border crossers with technology so they can be tracked or so they can check in is there any plan to give free smartphones to u s citizens that want them ms psaki should we not be tracking migrants who irregularly cross the border q i m asking if the same ms psaki or do you have an alternative suggestion for how they should be tracked q i unfortunately have not been asked to make u s immigration policy that s not my ms psaki today s your moment laughter q well it d be great if anybody that wanted a free phone and a free monthly plan could get one so is that going to be an offer for everybody or just people that walk into the country illegally ms psaki well peter as when we talked about this the other day what i noted to you is that we have a range of means of tracking individuals who irregularly migrate to the country as in order to ensure that they are meeting their notice to appear obligations and that they are appearing in court when they should appear in court phones is one of them there are also ankle devices and a range of tracking devices eighty percent of individuals have of non citizens released at the border from dhs custody under prosecutorial discretion have either received a notice to appear or are still within the window to report so yes there is telephonic reporting there is smartlink which enables participant monitoring via smartphone there s the global positioning system these are the range of means with modern technology that we monitor q last one on this does the president have any plans to figure out what these small towns who are bracing for a major influx in migrants next month need by making his first ever trip to the border ms psaki i have nothing to predict for you in terms of additional trips the president will be traveling the country but i don t have any more specifics for you at this point thanks for the question q just for clarity earlier earlier you guys told us via pool that the president was tested tested negative that was today for clarity ms psaki yup mm hmm q okay so the cadence has clearly changed right we know there was one on wednesday he was negative today is friday he tested negative just for keeping track of his is it now three times a week two times a week is there a way to describe it ms psaki his doctor makes an assessment on how many times he should be tested and we do our best to provide that information to you as he s tested q and aside from the time he spent with ketanji brown jackson and her family there was no because there s precedent to this there was no indoor reception indoor ceremony that existed of some kind that the cameras didn t see before ms psaki no q okay let me if i can during his remarks today the president said something that was a bit striking he was condemning some of the conservative republicans and their criticisms of judge jackson when she was testifying recently he said there was verbal abuse the anger the constant interruptions the most vile baseless assertions and accusations whoo is that a preview of messaging that we re going to hear from the president heading into the midterms was that was that is that a message that the white house wants to deliver and will be repeating ms psaki i don t believe that the conduct of senators at a hearing is going to be central to the president s remarks when he s out in out traveling the country but i think what he was speaking to on a historic day is that while judge jackson was the picture now justice jackson was the picture of dignity in her hearings some others in the room decided to be the opposite and he is somebody who has more experience overseeing supreme court hearings than anyone living he has overseen them during republican and democratic presidents and expects a certain level of conduct professionalism and decorum and that is not what we saw q so that was more of a one off for today as opposed to like a central theme that we ll see in terms of contrast ms psaki i would say that i think the american people can expect that he ll continue to talk when he s out in the country for whatever reason about how to bring down their costs how to make sure that he is fighting for them and bringing them relief and how s going to get the covid pandemic under control less about the conduct of senators at a hearing q let me ask a very quick question then on costs if i can right now the cost of gas in this country on average is 4 14 does the white house want a gas tax holiday ms psaki is it certainly on the table and certainly something we continue to consider we have seen a number of states do that and while you know it can have an impact about 18 cents i believe if i remember correctly one of the reasons why we re considering it our primary focus to date as you all know has been taking steps to increase supply and get it get more supply into the global marketplace but it remains an option under consideration go ahead q the u n today put out a report saying that global food prices in march reached a record high ms psaki yeah q what is the u s doing if anything to mitigate possible additional increases here ms psaki here in the united states q correct ms psaki well it is something that we are certainly watching very closely while we continue to believe that the impact will largely be in the middle east and in africa i believe and a lot of you know other parts of the world less in the united states we are continuing to work our department of agriculture is continuing to work with farmers and suppliers about any needs we have here and the president is continuing to work to bring down costs in a range of areas for the american people as we prepare for the impacts of this war q it was pretty widely reported yesterday prior to her covid diagnosis that speaker pelosi was planning a trip to taiwan beijing reacted very negatively to that is the u s is the biden administration comfortable if she were to do that such a high ranking u s official ms psaki i don t i think we ve understood her trip i don t have any further comment on it go ahead q thanks jen two questions for you the first today my colleagues in the uk reported that the chancellor of the exchequer rishi sunak had a u s green card which he surrendered this past october he s been an mp since 2015 and uscis manual says that serving in a foreign government while standing for election in a foreign government is not compatible with lawful permanent resident status why was this not flagged earlier ms psaki i would point you to the state department or the department of homeland security i don t have any more comment from here q is it i mean is it a problem does the president see it as a problem that possible for someone to serve at high level in a foreign government and maintain lawful permanent resident status in the u s i mean what if this were someone who was serving in the russian duma ms psaki it wasn t but i would also again point you to the portions of the government that oversee green cards and oversee you know q they haven t responded ms psaki the status of documents i m happy to bump it for them as well and see if there s more we can provide q that s fine the second question there s a death row inmate in texas melissa lucio she s set to be executed soon many experts believe her confession was coerced and is false she has bipartisan support for clemency and support from the eu and many other foreign allies would the president consider asking governor abbott to intervene ms psaki well you know the president s position and view on the death penalty and there s an ongoing review at the department of justice at a federal level this is obviously at a state level q right ms psaki i don t have anything to predict for you on that q and then a follow up given his commitment to police reform would he consider asking the doj to prohibit police departments that receive federal funds from using the reid technique for interrogations it s considered to create a lot of false confessions ms psaki well again i know the department of justice has taken a number of steps including on chokeholds and other actions that needed to be reformed in police departments across the country i don t have anything to preview or predict in terms of additional steps the president supports their efforts to do more many of them have talked about their desire to do more and obviously we are continuing to consider an executive order on police reform here given there has been an inability of congress to move forward go ahead q thanks jen there s some pretty desperate images coming out of shanghai right now which is under lockdown for covid people begging for food and medicine is the white house monitoring that is there anything the u s can do to help the humanitarian situation there and also on the supply chain front is the administration aware of any further supply chain snags coming as a result of this and how are you prepared to address them ms psaki sure well first the on the first part of your question the state department is closely monitoring the situation they re providing consistent updates of the situation on the ground and we ll certainly assess with usaid and others if there s additional assistance that could be provided on the supply chain component what we know is that the port is continuing to operate normally and where we re seeing the impacts which still could have an impact over the course of time of course is factories warehouses and trucking where we are seeing shutdowns within the region which we know could cause delays especially for air cargo as well because this is just happening we don t have a prediction at this point on how that could impact bigger global supply chain issues it depends on a lot of factors how long et cetera but it is something we are closely monitoring and it is something we will continue to work to to address if it extends farther q and then just one more housekeeping item do you have a timing update on when the president might sign the trade preference bill on russia that passed ms psaki i don t and i know you and others have been looking for this and let me see if i can get an answer before we all wrap up today q thank you ms psaki go ahead q jen could you speak to the efficacy of sanctions i know there was a new sanctions package rolled out this week and initially we heard a lot from administration officials about this being a deterrent i know that has changed and so can you speak to sort of the end goal and what is the efficacy of sanctions ms psaki well i would say that it has we have a couple of objectives at this point as it relates to the war in ukraine one is to impose severe consequences send a marker for the world and for history about the horrific nature of these atrocities these consequences and the second part of our objective is to ensure that these consequences are having a significant impact on the economy in russia we re seeing an inflationary rate of about 15 percent a projection of a contraction of 15 percent in the russian economy six hundred private sector companies have left russia we know it is having the impact that the world intended this is the most significant coordinated set of sanctions ever done in history on this large of an economy the third objective here is to make it much more difficult for president putin to fund his war and if you look back say earlier this week at the example of the bond payments and how russia has basically been put in a decision of in a place where they either have to use their limited resources they have that are also being used to fund the war to prevent a default or default that is the position they re in at this point in time but also because we have cut them off through export controls and a number of other means from having access to materials and technology but also access to funds it makes it more difficult for them to fund the war that is part of it and the last objective is to continue to make it clear that this is a strategic blunder their decision to invade ukraine and one that will make president putin a pariah in the world so those are why and what we are hoping to achieve q can i ask one follow up ms psaki yeah q is there anything being done in terms of either monitoring or actually just i guess monitoring to take a look at the effects of sanctions on ordinary russians or anything the administration is thinking to just deal with that population of people who are being affected ms psaki the russian people you mean q yes correct ms psaki cert i mean certainly we are looking at how this is impacting the russian economy writ large and it is certainly as inflation is going up and as the economy is contracting that means prices will go up and we do know there will be a broad impact that is the fault of president putin and the fault of president putin invading a sovereign country so it is important also for the russian people to know and understand that and we have been working through a range of means to communicate about the realities of the war and the facts of the war through telegram through youtube through a range of channels as well go ahead q thanks jen general milley earlier this week talked about the possibility of building permanent u s bases on nato s eastern flank i wonder what seriousness the white house has given that or as you look long term at the war in ukraine whether shoring up the eastern flank with permanent bases is something that s been considered ms psaki they ll continue to be a range of discussions but i have nothing beyond what general milley said q can i ask you one more question i want to dig a little deeper on the french elections ms psaki sure q does the white house worry that the election of le pen could you know destabilize the nato alliance or make it difficult being that she s you know come up with pro russian statements ms psaki well i m just not going to get ahead of an election in a foreign country and obviously we will watch it closely and i m sure we ll have more to speak to once the results are concluded go ahead q thanks jen what can you tell us about the multiple secret service agents who have been suspended or removed from the president vice president and first lady s detail pending this investigation of two men impersonating officers of law enforcement ms psaki not much from here i can point you to the secret service and obviously the fbi is overseeing the investigation q is there a broader concern in the administration that these principals is there concern that they re not being protected effectively is can you speak at all to that or ms psaki as i said yesterday we the president remains confident in the leader of the secret service and beyond that i would point you to the secret service and to the fbi q and then i guess just on the invitations you issued to republicans who voted to confirm justice jackson i know one of them has covid but did you hear from the other two senator murkowski and romney i know the president went a little further to talk about senator romney s father today in his speech did the white house hear from the republicans who were invited today why didn t they come ms psaki i would point you to their offices to speak to that i mean it doesn t change the president s gratitude to them for you know bucking the trend in their party of not supporting an eminently qualified nominee and they they did that and it was something he wanted to call out today and express his gratitude thank you q yeah thank you jen i m wondering what the white house s reaction is to yesterday s u n vote to suspend russia from the u n human rights council the fact that there were 58 nations that abstained from taking a vote and then on top of the other 24 nations that voted against it although there was you know more obviously the majority of countries did vote to suspend russia do you think that this you know that many abstains abstentions that many people sitting on the sidelines of this shows that the entire world really isn t unified around condemning these actions by russia ms psaki well a win required two thirds present and voting and that is exactly what happened and far beyond that and we know that there were abstentions and only 24 countries including north korea voted with russia but the outcome which is what is most important to us is what we wanted which is russia has been suspended from the u n human rights council suspension just so everybody knows somebody asked me this question the other day but it is the only method provided for in the u n resolution that established the human rights council back in 2005 is the most serious action available it s only been applied once in history this is only the second time in history that a country has been kicked out of the u n human rights council the last example was libya so that obviously speaks to the significance and it also speaks to the fact that two thirds more than two thirds of countries who are members are believe that they should not have a leadership role on global human rights as they work to subvert and violate global human rights this also means that once suspended russia will not be able to vote against future actions during subsequent human rights council sessions and so to us it is significant only the secs time second time in second time in history and it speaks to the global outrage in response to these atrocities q but are there any concerns that nearly 60 nations decided not to weigh in on this matter ms psaki again our focus is on the fact that it was a win for only the second time in history was a country kicked out of suspended from the u n human rights council q and then one other question does president biden still intend to attend the white house correspondents association dinner here later this month in a couple of weeks ms psaki we haven t announced his plans to attend or anything about his schedule so i don t have any update on that today q all right ms psaki go ahead karen q thanks jen just some follow ups to things that came up ms psaki sure q to follow up on peter s question about the testing cadence you guys have told us about negative tests on monday wednesday and friday should we expect that the president would get tested on sunday two days later ms psaki i would say i don t have a prediction of that his doctor makes an assessment of when he should be tested and how often and what the cadence should be it s not always exactly the same and but we will provide information to you when he tests negative q okay ms psaki or either way of course yes q and to follow up on katie s question did the president talk to any of the senators romney murkowski and collins after their vote yesterday on ketanji brown jackson ms psaki i don t have any update on that from here q okay and when he said he hoped he didn t get them in trouble today when he referenced them what did he mean by that ms psaki he meant he recognizes that the vast majority of the other members of their party voted a different way go ahead q thank you on india next week secretary of state blinken and defense secretary are hosting their indian counterparts external affairs minister s jaishankar and defence minister rajnath singh for the first india u s 2 2 dialogue under this administration what is president s message to the meeting what is his expectations is he sending any concrete ideas to this meeting as well q president biden believes our partnership with india is one of the most important relationships we have in the world as you know he met with presi prime minister modi and other quad leaders in march he expects that at this 2 2 secretary blinken and secretary austin will continue driving forward our work with india and our shared goals in the indo pacific region and around the world we also believe both sides will continue our close consultations on the consequences of president putin s brutal war against ukraine and mitigating the impact by addressing energy and food prices obviously it could cover a range of topics but we expect that to be a central one q and secondly given the u s s frustrating experience having the u n security council inaudible coming out and doing all they should do with ukraine what is president s thoughts on the reforms to the u n security council itself ms psaki well i know a question has been asked about whether russia could be kicked out of being a permanent member we don t anticipate that happening but obviously the step taken yesterday to suspend russia from the u n human rights council is an indication of the global response and horror at the atrocities we ve seen happen on the ground in ukraine but beyond that i don t have any other predictions of reforms q should there be individual veto or group veto inside the security council ms psaki again i understand your questions but i don t have any predictions or calls for that at this point go ahead francesca q thanks jen ms psaki okay we ll just do a few more go ahead q thanks jen since his state of the union address the president has only made a handful of domestic trips we ve talked in here before about how he d like to get back into the community and have a chance to interact with the american people is the current covid wave getting in the way of his travel plans ms psaki no i expect he s going to travel a bunch in the next few weeks q okay and you had mentioned that you will be going to north carolina and you didn t have too much more to add on that but might the president while he s in greensboro be visiting one of the area s two historically black colleges and universities ms psaki i don t have more details at this point in time as they get finalized i m sure we ll share them with all of you go ahead q thanks jen i have a two part question on student loans ms psaki yep q last year president biden directed the department of education to create a report on whether he has presidential authority to unilaterally do a broad cancellation of debt i don t believe that s ever been made public and as you re looking at loan extensions or loan pause extensions will we can we anticipate seeing a release of that report and secondly as you ve talked about how the president wants to lower costs for americans borrowers have expressed stress anxiety about these short term extensions what s your message to them ms psaki i think our message to them is that not a single person has paid a dime on their student loans since the president took office and he s continued to evaluate and assess with the department of education and other policymakers in the administration what the needs are to lower costs for people including people who have student loans and are do feel stressed even as the economy is continuing to recover but as we see costs too high in some areas on the first question i don t have any update on that i would tell you that if congress were to send him a bill to cancel 10 000 in student loans in student debt he d be happy to sign it go ahead last one last one last one go ahead q thank you well rachel wallace who was the general counsel of the science office who the white house found had been bullied by dr lander has been told that she will not be getting her job back as general counsel why ms psaki i am not aware of this personnel update i d have to check on it i m happy to do that and we will get you back a comment q okay then a follow up yesterday you said when asked about vice president harris and the mask at the senate you said that

it remains to be seen if the endorsement of former president donald trump will mean a whole lot while many on the right still support him others are ready to move on from the trump era however he s still going to endorse candidates and many want it advertisement however it seems one endorsement was for a candidate who supports assault weapon bans former president donald trump endorsed rep brian mast r fl on wednesday citing the congressman being strong on the second amendment even though mast supports an assault weapons ban which second amendment supporters oppose in a new york times opinion piece mast called for taking action such as but not limited to efining what constitutes an assault or tactical firearm and not allowing them for future purchase just as we already prohibit the purchase of fully automatic firearms and anning the sale of accessories and add ons that circumvent the ban on automatic firearms and increasing the ages at which individuals can purchase various categories of firearms now understand this was 2018 and emotions were more than a little high in the wake of parkland a lot of people were supporting things in the aftermath of that horrible tragedy that they don t support now the question is whether mast still supports such legislation advertisement on his campaign website he makes no specific mention of assault weapon bans only saying that he s worked to oppose gun control legislation he s also backed a bill that addresses gun rights for medical marijuana users but still he s said nothing disavowing that 2018 op ed however as i ve said with other gop candidates who seem to espouse support for gun control he needs to clarify where he stands right now while flip flopping is considered a bad thing in a politician and for good reason it actually is ok to change one s mind about an issue over time and with careful examination of the facts if mast were to make a statement that no he doesn t feel that way now and that his op ed was driven by emotion but since then he s come to realize the error of that thinking well fine for me the issue would be done he learned the error of his ways no longer supports assault weapon bans and now he s ready to move forward absent that though there s no way i could vote for him were he running in my district not in the primary at least advertisement but what about trump s endorsement the truth is that while trump was better than a lot of people on the right expected he was never a huge supporter of the second amendment remember that it was he who pushed the atf to ban bump stocks for example and he was more than ready to work with nancy pelosi on additional regulations the idea that he d bad a candidate who espoused support for an assault weapon ban isn t overly shocking to me the question remains as to whether or not that endorsement will matter it won t to me but if mast steps up and disavows his previous comments the 2018 op ed won t matter to me either that leaves the big question of whether or not he ll do so
dividend growth stocks can be a great way to combat inflation the dividend growth strategy is without a doubt one of the most popular approaches to investing it involves buying and holding shares of quality dividend paying companies that are increasing their cash flows enough each year to consistently boost their payouts to shareholders a big reason why dividend growth investing has such a strong reputation among investors is that it actually works holding a diversified portfolio of companies that are increasing their payouts at a steady pace can help investors generate substantial wealth over the long term particularly if they decide to reinvest the dividends into more shares over the years get the full walter schloss series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on walter schloss in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q4 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more dividend stocks always attract a fair share of buyers in almost any market environment but this year these types of investments are more attractive than ever thanks to persistent inflation concerns finding assets that can help you fight inflation is certainly not easy thanks to how many questions there are about the economy and whether or not the federal reserve can get things under control quickly that s why we ve put together the following list of 3 dividend growth stocks to help you fight inflation here are a few reasons why these companies stand out as great long term buys one particularly important detail about dividend growth investing is that it s very important to select companies with strong business prospects and reliable free cash flow generation that way you can likely rely on them to continue rewarding long term shareholders with increasing payouts that s a big reason why fedex corporation should be on your radar especially since the stock has been hammered this year and could be a great buy the dip opportunity fedex is a blue chip company that provides air express and ground package services to residences and businesses globally along with truck freight and logistics services we know that fedex is going to stay busy over the next decade thanks to e commerce tailwinds and the company s massive international shipping network is both impressive and very difficult for competitors to imitate while it s true that fedex is dealing with higher employee related costs in the short term it s hard to argue against adding shares of an industry leading company at such an appealing valuation fedex currently trades at a 9 9 forward p e ratio and the company s management recently bumped up its dividend by 15 which are both great reasons to consider adding shares the stock is down over 21 year to date but according to marketbeat s consensus analyst estimates the stock has over 48 of upside from current levels given the 302 52 average price target making this a very appealing option to consider investors obviously have a lot to think about this year thanks to all of the complicated factors that are occurring in the world which is why keeping things simple can be a sound approach to markets at this time case in point amerisourcebergen has been one of the biggest outperformers in the market in 2022 is not going to be significantly impacted by the current geopolitical turmoil and has continued to increase its forward guidance which likely means that shares are set to continue trending higher it s one of the nation s largest pharmaceutical distributors with over 210 billion in annual u s drug distribution revenue and a company that investors can likely bank on for continued dividend growth for years to come investors likely recognize how massive the pharmaceutical industry is and the fact that amerisource is one of three huge companies operating as a pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution oligopoly is another strong selling point to consider with a 10 year dividend growth rate cagr of 13 9 investors should certainly be compelled to park some capital in this leading company for the long term the fact that it s in a sector that has dramatically outperformed the market this year makes it an even more intriguing option so keep an eye out for pullbacks if you are interested in adding shares kinder morgan inc nyse kmi the energy sector has been nothing short of impressive this year which makes a dividend growth stock like kinder morgan all the more attractive it s one of the largest energy transportation and storage companies in north america which is important given the sanctions on russia that are occurring at the moment whether it s transporting storing or processing natural gas crude oil natural gas liquids and more it s safe to say that kinder morgan plays a key role in the economy and has a successful business model that should help investors feel confident that the dividend growth will continue the stock currently offers a 5 68 dividend yield and some analysts anticipate the resumption of a share buyback program this year which are certainly strong reasons to consider adding shares investors should also be happy to hear that kinder morgan has paid down over 12 billion in debt since 2015 freeing up plenty of capital to support earnings and dividend growth going forward fedex is a part of the entrepreneur index which tracks some of the largest publicly traded companies founded and run by entrepreneurs should you invest 1 000 in fedex right now before you consider fedex you ll want to hear this marketbeat keeps track of wall street s top rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis marketbeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and fedex wasn t on the list while fedex currently has a buy rating among analysts top rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys article by

keep refreshing for the latest results hey there people it s friday so here s another episode of wwe smackdown in the wake of wrestlemania we ve now got one champion still two belts in form of the undisputed wwe universal champion so high on the agenda tonight will be determining the next challenger for uwu champion roman reigns charlotte flair did what charlotte flair normally does refuse to put someone over at the time when they should be put over and retained the smackdown women s title so we ll see if she s moving on from ronda rousey or if that feud must continue i m betting it must continue shinsuke nakamura will need something new to do now that rick boogs got injured hopefully he recovers quickly wwe might remember that ricochet is the ic champion and hopefully drew mcintyre can finally move on from this happy corbin stuff there is a happy talk segment set for tonight though and there s a decent chance corbin and madcap moss split up as there has been some friction between them lately well that s enough preamble let s get to the action we re in milwaukee wisconsin tonight with michael cole and pat mcafee on commentary we open with a video recap of wrestlemania in case you missed it kayla is in the ring to welcome us to the show then brings out ronda rousey guess we ll have to wait for the main event for anything relevant to happen ronda has a mic and kayla asks her about the wrestlemania match giving us video highlights as though we didn t just see this there s clear video evidence of charlotte tapping out and ronda says she lost and isn t here to make excuses to be the best in the world you have to be able to beat everyone else twice on your worst day because you don t always get to fight on your best day and the refs screw things up kayla asks what ronda s next step is and ronda wants a rematch but not a regular match she doesn t want charlotte to have loopholes she wants an i quit match at wrestlemania backlash the most stupendous wrestlemania backlash perhaps we get charlotte in the back claiming ronda can t beat charlotte at anything charlotte doesn t quit it s not in her dna but you know what is winning dated reference charlotte mocks ronda and claims she can t win when it matters then declines her challenge for a rematch tells ronda to get in the back of the line then adds a bitch so we know she s serious ronda promises charlotte that this fight is going to happen and charlotte isn t just going to say i quit she s going to scream it well like every promo between these two that was painful another recap this time focused on new day taking on the blind peekers as butch will get his first main roster match when he takes on xavier woods they hooligans are at gorilla ridge holland and sheamus hype him up then they head to the ring they hit the ring and pose as we head to break post break here come xavier woods and kofi kingston new day have mics kofi mocks them a bit then woods gets the music cut so they can be heard woods brings up that he doesn t have a wrestlemania win kofi tries to give him part of his title win since mania is the season finale that makes this the season opener and so all records are reset which means the score between them is 0 0 god that s dumb woods says butch s own family want him to beat butch s rabies infested ass match 1 butch w sheamus and ridge holland vs xavier woods w kofi kingston butch lands a clothesline and goes to mounted elbows right away as kevin dunn tires to give the audience a seizure woods fights back with puna modified fujiwara armbar woods uses the ropes to force a break then hits a jawbreaker and a russian leg sweep then a drop kick butches and chops then trips butch into the corner butch with an enziguri then a double knee drop to the arm and he goes for the arm with ch rolls out of the ring then avoids a diving drop kick and lands an elbow then a release suplex onto the apron as we head to break we come back as butch is still in control laying in strikes butch goes for a hammerlock as mcafee gets in trouble for saying that there s blood on butch s nose i mean there is but you re not supposed to say it more strikes from butch get a 2 count butch goes back to the arm woods fights back up and lays in strikes of his own before they hit the ropes and he lands a rolling elbow super kick from woods then a suplex attempt but butch fights out only to eat an enziguri woods is sent to the apron and lands another kick then tries the jumping ddt but he s caught with a right hand butch with more strikes and an enziguri of his own more stomps from butch then woods avoids a running kick and grabs a small package to get the win official result xavier woods won rating 2 5 stars the commercial break hurt this and it s a crying shame they neutered what woods and pete dunne could have done post match butch gets pissed and throws hands at both sheamus and ridge then pouts on the top rope they re apparently calling this trio the eastie boys and when xavier woods uses a small package it s the back woods after this break we ll get more recap action when we come back we get highlights from sami zayn vs johnny knoxville then in the back sami zayn complains to adam pearce about losing at mania he wanted an anything goes match not something with interference sami s been reduced to a laughing stock since losing that match he dislikes cheese apparently and he wants his respect back so he wants a match with the next person to walk out of the locker room door pearce agrees and here comes drew mcintyre sami tries to crawfish on his wager pearce tells him his match with drew will be later tonight now sami thinks if he beats the toughest guy on the roster he ll get his respect back and wanders off a pa gives pearce a note pearce then says he can t meet with ronda right now because of this to the ring here s ludwig kaiser the former marcel barthel talks he s the epitome of efficiency and elegance and he s here to introduce the ring general gunther i m still pissed about walter not being walter but here s our svelte ring general after this break gunther will be in action match 2 gunther w ludwig kaiser vs joe alonzo this is going to go poorly gunther tosses alonzo around backs him into a corner then starts chopping away big boot from gunther then another chop more bludgeoning to the chest from gunther then a scoop slam the crowd starts with a walter chant god bless them another chop from gunther then a folding powerbomb to win official result gunther won rating romanesco squash delicious squash in the back kayla talks with the former raquel gonzalez now going by raquel rodriguez the height difference is amusing raquel says smackdown has an impressive locker room of women but they ve never seen anything like here in come los lotharios to hit on her they want to welcome her with a kiss but she declines and they head out kayla confirms those two are always that annoying to the ring and here comes happy corbin and madcap moss moss is happy while corbin is a sad eyesore seriously that shirt is loud some highlights from mania including drew chopping a couple of the ring ropes moss moves over to the andre the giant trophy and points out his name right below jey uso and please don t look at the top couple of names because neither cesaro nor paul big show wight work here anymore happy talk will be up after this break post break moss is still happy while corbin is not corbin says this was supposed to be the happiest happy talk ever we re supposed to be celebrating his victory over drew mcintyre at mania but at these low points you figure out what kind of man you are corbin thought about that on his yacht he had an honest conversation with himself and is ready to admit that there s only one person to blame for his loss and that s madcap moss moss somehow didn t see this coming corbin would never have lost to drew if not for the distraction moss is sorry but corbin doesn t care somehow moss made wrestlemania all about him winning the andre the giant trophy and corbin mocks his accomplishment brief madcap moss chant corbin thinks moss is too big for his suspenders and has forgotten his place he s here to tell jokes moss has a joke for him what do you call moss when he s such a bonehead he cost corbin a match madcap loss corbin correctly calls that terrible and demands another joke moss what would you call adam pearce if he ran a brothel madame pearce corbin thinks that one sucks too he brought moss here to make him laugh and all of moss s jokes lately have been terrible so now corbin is giving moss another chance he wants a funny joke a joke that could save his job moss what do you call a guy who treats his friends like garbage who thinks he s better than everyone else who dresses like he s going to a funeral for tommy bahama you call him happy corbin corbin asks if we think that s funny then whacks moss with the mic moss starts fighting back and abuses corbin for a bit before tossing him out of the ring corbin jumps moss as he follows him and tosses him into the barricade again moss fights back and bounces corbin off of the announcers table a few times back in the ring moss hits more punches then clotheslines corbin out of the ring and stands tall in the back jinder mahal and shanky complain about not being on the mania card to adam pearce jinder says he wants an intercontinental title shot but before pearce can continue ronda interrupts the meeting ronda wants to know if she gets the i quit match pearce says we ll get an answer on that tomorrow back to the ring here comes drew mcintyre after this break he ll take on sami zayn post break here s sami zayn match 3 drew mcintyre vs sami zayn sami runs out of the ring right away drew just waits for him to get back in the ring again sami rolls out of the ring rather than lock up but this time drew follows him and starts tossing him around the ringside area back in the ring sami lands a kick but takes a belly to belly suplex then another one drew lays in a chop then sami rolls out of the ring again sami gets abused on the announcers table they re telegraphing the count out finish pretty hard here back in the ring sami rolls back out of the ring and begs off sami decides this isn t worth it and starts walking to the back but drew follows him and lands a clothesline drew carries sami back to the ring and they head in drew wants a claymore but sami rolls out of the ring yet again this time sami runs through the crowd and drew just lets him go official result drew mcintyre won via count out rating dud i mostly get the story they re trying to tell here but this fell incredibly flat another recap will be up after this break post break they follow through on the threat of another recap this one about pat mcafee vs austin theory and all the associated shenanigans also pat mcafee is a better worker than ridge holland the edit job done by the company is impressive you d almost believe vince wasn t nearly immobile mcafee s stunner sell and drinking beer while still stunned are still great next is a video from lacey evans she brings up being from a small town and her tough family situation the combination of emotional and physical abuse became too much and she and her mother had to relocate she spent the rest of her childhood in women s shelters and camp grounds but all that proved that she could adapt and overcome she refuses to give up she may not have had the same straight shot to stardom as others but because of what she s gone through she is the woman she is now none of that makes her better than anyone else but no one is better than her either we ll get another update next week to the ring here comes sasha banks after this break she ll be in action against liv morgan post break we get a recap of naomi and banks defending their tag team titles from raw liv morgan is in gorilla she s asked by megan what she s doing here liv came here to beat sasha banks and gain momentum for the tag team title match on raw rhea ripley isn t here tonight match 4 sasha banks w naomi vs liv morgan naomi has joined commentary for the match they tie up liv goes for a roll up then banks chops her arm drag from banks but liv counters a charge into a modified wing clipper then hits a drop kick banks avoids oblivion then hits a backstabber as we head to break we come back as banks hits a suplex then a frog splash for a 2 count in the back natalya and shayna baszler watch tv at an incredibly awkward angle banks and liv trade caught kicks then trade roll ups for a bit jackknife from banks liv counters for a backslide but banks knees her in the head then liv lands a modified codebreaker and they re both down liv avoids a backstabber and lands kicks banks avoids a corner splash then lands a knee strike a running knee from liv connects but banks catches her on the top rope and heads up there with her to hit a super plex but liv catches her in a small package off of the impact and pins to win official result liv morgan won rating 1 5 stars the commercial break gutted this it came across as disjoined and slowly paced we get a recap of the injury to rick boogs he s had surgery and is now looking to begin rehab here comes roman reigns with the rest of the bloodline while roman s universal title reign is quite old his uwu one is just beginning as roman heads to the ring we get you guessed it another recap when it s done the bloodline is in the ring and posing with all of the gold after this break we ll figure out what s next for roman reigns post break we re told that jinder mahal will get an ic title shot next week hey they did remember that ricochet is the champion good for them roman is in the ring with his entourage and gets a mic from heyman there s a small tribal chief chant then roman tells milwaukee to acknowledge him they do so with a lot of cheers he wants to tell everyone something that he s been talking over with the wise man it turns out smackdown and the universal title wasn t enough so he went to mania and smashed cowboy brock took monday night raw and the wwe championship the next step for the tribal chief well he doesn t think he can do much more he s done it all at this point but there s still plenty for the bloodline to achieve we ve had a ton of videos and pictures this week but the one thing missing is that his cousins only have two titles each roman is one man with two titles his cousins are two men with two titles and that s not enough a long time ago roman promised to elevate jey uso to show him greatness there s only one way to do that it s time to unify the tag team titles as well roman wants the usos to go to raw and bring him their tag team titles the usos are down the bloodline will have all the gold soon shinsuke nakamura s music interrupts this nakamura gets a mic and heads into the ring he goes face to face with roman as the crowd sings his theme song roman doesn t let nakamura talk he says nakamura doesn t have to say anything because roman knows how he feels nakamura lost his partner and roman gets that jey knows what this is like as they lost his brother to a knee injury roman completely understands and says that with all the gold the island of relevancy is a place of love and then hugs nakamura once he breaks the hug the usos hit a double

newsletter how to la every weekday you ll get fresh community driven stories that catch you up with our independent local news subscribe covid 19 has been around long enough that we are not even counting the waves anymore but the virus and the tools we have to fight it keep evolving and the guidance seems to change just enough with each surge that it can leave even the most diligent among us feeling lost now more than two years into the pandemic some parts of the u s are seeing an uptick in cases driven by the ba 2 subvariant dr celine gounder is a senior fellow and editor at large for public health at kaiser health news and a former adviser to the biden administration we spoke with her about the latest thinking on everything from at home tests to isolation times contact tracing and why we may be repeating the same mistakes we made with other diseases this interview has been edited for length and clarity on whether the rapid at home tests work for ba 2 the rapid antigen tests do work to pick up omicron this pattern that you see is really similar across all the variants which is that there is usually a day or two delay between when you might test positive on a pcr versus when you might test positive on one of these at home rapid antigen tests but they do work to pick up an infection as the pandemic wears on contact tracing and guidelines have changed and evolved robyn beck afp via getty images on the expiration dates listed on rapid at home tests i organize my tests in my drawer actually by expiration date so i m using the oldest ones first so that s just a small tip there but the tests probably are good for much longer than they re labeled for and that s really a reflection of the fact that early on when they were first developed we weren t quite sure how long they would be good for and they probably do last probably on the order of months longer than what they re labeled to be good for on when and how to seek treatment if you test positive to access treatment you can go to covid gov and look up where in your area you can access paxlovid and monoclonal antibodies what facilities currently stock them and how you can go about getting that if you already have a primary care physician they can also help you navigate that right now we have a pretty short supply of treatment and so we re really trying to target that supply to people in whom it would really have the most benefit people who are young healthy who don t have significant symptoms are probably not going to end up in the hospital regardless and so that s not the best use of that short supply that we currently have on isolation times if you test positive what we re seeing is that people very often test positive for longer than five days you have maybe about half of people who are negative by five days but then the other half are positive out to even 12 14 days and so i think the way to address that is repeat a test if you re still positive really try to stay at home and if you absolutely cannot stay at home that s a situation where you really should be masking when you re around other people so that you re not infecting others on the current state of contact tracing contact tracing efforts have largely been dismantled at this stage and it s become even harder to do contact tracing now especially if you re trying to use that as a way to prevent onward infection and that s because the incubation period for covid has gotten shorter and shorter with each variant and so with omicron the incubation period is only two to three days and so that makes it really hard to try to track down the person that you might have infected and take measures to prevent an onward infection i do think if you have been around people and may have exposed them i think it s just polite and good form to inform them so they know they may want to get tested themselves on federal funding for covid measures drying up and whether this is a normal progression i guess it depends on what you call normal is it how we have addressed other diseases and fallen short absolutely it is repeating those same mistakes we ve run out of money to reimburse providers for offering testing to uninsured patients but it s not just testing we ve also run out of money to reimburse providers for treating uninsured patients for vaccinating uninsured patients and it s really unfortunate that we refuse to learn from previous experiences i m not going to tell congress what to do here but i think if our goal is to adapt and live with covid in a way that this is not impacting our social lives or economic lives our work then it will mean doing things differently doing things better and i hope we will what questions do you have about southern california ask a question
green bay wi wtaq the end is near for the legendary the exclusive company record store in downtown green bay a phrase an ad recited by just about anyone who grew up in eastern wisconsin say it with me it was an iconic sounding call for a record shop unlike any other tom smith is the manager at the exclusive company location in the broadway district he s been working there for 33 years this building has had such a music history for a long long time it s going to be sad to see it not as a house of music smith told wtaq news the company showed up exclusively as mr g james giombetti opened up shop in west bend in 1956 mr giombetti just had this vision and this passion and determination to build america s best full line independent record chain smith said he was the best record store owner to work for because he s 100 percent behind us on stocking the stores how we wanted to and i think that s why people like the exclusive company they all have their own complexion their pros and cons and that was because of mr g smith says while mr g was a supportive owner there were definitely rules about what was acceptable at the exclusive company he gave all the stores the autonomy to stock what we wanted what we felt was appropriate for our market or even stuff that we think we should try in our market smith said he was like a father figure at times you don t want him angry at you the building itself has a long history of music serving as the pipe dreams record shop before giombetti took over this building has a lot of history we ve had a lot of in store like ozzy was here cheap trick the violent femmes came when it was still pipe dreams smith recalled lately record sales seem to be on the rise but smith says the industry is struggling to keep up with demand i hate to say it but the record industry has always been the biggest detriment to the record industry like it s its own worst enemy smith said last christmas parents to come in with their lists of what they wanted for their children or other family members or friends and they d hand me list i d have to say i m sorry that one we ve been out for 6 months or that one here is 9 months out this one s been a year it s because the record companies just can t keep what s in demand in supply they sure would help all the record stores if they just built some more pressing plants but incredibly the industry and the stores survive even through a pandemic but the passing of the local record king mr g seemed to be the tipping point our participation in it will be wrapping up smith said we re goners as they say it s all she wrote it s a wrap but as music and record sales survive so do the enthusiasts in fact they seem to be multiplying mike mckeough remembers going to the record shop in green bay even before mr g took over i ve been coming here since it was pipe dreams and that was 60 70 i m 67 now so 50 years it s been part of green bay for 50 60 years the store itself mckeough said i just enjoy music can t play an instrument but i just enjoy listening to it and in this store here you get everything i just love the store i could stay here all day just listen the music they play i think they re going to miss a lot of it just looking around in here you see the younger kids so it s nice to see the younger generations started coming here and everything like that too and all of a sudden they re not gonna have any place to go to now one of those young people was sam kalies we found him flipping through vinyls waiting for something to catch his eye he might be in his mid twenties but for sam and his friends the exclusive company has been home for years i was probably like 15 or so so about 10 years ago and i ve lived in green bay my whole life so i ve been coming here often like a couple times a month probably kalies said i feel like they have a really great selection and it s been a cool way to find some smaller indie artists and some things you wouldn t see in bigger retail stores it helps me connect with the the city i ve brought a lot of friends here and we connect over music and we often have a lot of conversations and share stuff that we find here so there s a community aspect of it for sure that community young and old still seems to be working to grasp the news that the exclusive company won t be around much longer well the way i heard about it was from my nieces and nephews it shocked me at first they d always ask if it s closing and i d say i have no idea but i sure hope not i m just sad it s closing mckeough added i ll miss the place when it s gone it was pretty shocking i found out really early this morning and it kind of set a somber tone for the day kalies said i love this place and i ll miss it that tone prompting kalies to rock an exclusive company branded shirt during what was surely not his final stop in the store but even with a few more stops between now and the end he s still trying to figure out one thing sadness loss and thinking about where i ll get my records from now on kalies said no matter where that will be mckeough says it simply won t be the same they re not as knowledgeable as tom and his crew here you can ask them for something they know exactly what you mean and where it is and go get it for you in those big stores you can stand there for hours and not get any service mckeough said the green bay location is expected to officially close sometime in july others are set to close by the end of july they will still take part in national record store day on april 23rd with special deals the shop in milwaukee will live on as a record

the securities industry and financial markets association had enough to celebrate by holding its first in person private client conference since 2019 this week but merrill lynch wealth management president andy sieg told the audience of advisors at a miami hotel that was just the beginning sieg said that despite the challenges the stock market is facing right now war in ukraine inflation and higher interest rates it is as he put it not the time to sell everything and buy crypto he told advisors that the bull market for advice is alive and well and that with the easing of pandemic restrictions clients want what he called a return to culture rather than simply a return to the office what do clients expect by 2030 and beyond he asked they say simplify our lives with a genuine one stop shop basis points for alpha don t help clients sleep at night but are we on track to achieve their goals they say watch our back and know what makes us tick don t assume you know who s calling the shots and who made the money accomplishing this he said will depend on a few things first he cited the importance of teamwork noting that 10 years ago only 45 of advisors at merrill were on teams today that figure is 80 and by 2030 he said it should be 100 next a one stop shop has to have the goods he said with offerings such as investment banking lending trust capabilities and a fully integrated technology platform with self service options and finally sieg said there must be diversity of people and perspectives when a client says know me we better the high net worth market has changed he said women are making financial decisions more than half the time there has been enormous wealth creation in communities of color and there are the unique needs of lgbtq clients and blended families he had some unsolicited advice for advisors if you want your demo to look anything like america in 2030 you need to change your hiring and development program pretty much yesterday he said and all of this will happen fastest said sieg when we are back together in our offices not all the time but most of the time a panel of advisors addressed the subject of being back together agreeing that two years of working from home had produced innovations that they will keep that events outside the investment world had changed their relationships with clients and that it took a little doing to get their staffs to resume some of their 2019 ways christina anderson a wealth management advisor for fidelity who works with high net worth clients in south florida said the second and third generations in the families she works with people 20 to 40 years old like working virtually it has allowed us to engage with younger family members she said but i still feel that when we dive into emotional conversations with clients we should be sitting across the table from each other the murder of george floyd by a minneapolis police officer in may 2020 has brought an honesty to client relationships said christopher jay a merrill advisor in seattle after george floyd said jay who is black clients would say how are you doing but i knew what they meant i chose authenticity and it really resonated sometimes the folks who really wanted to have honest conversations were not the ones i would have expected and some surprised me the other way but that s fine and i have continued this it s okay to talk about these things now jay said the deeper relationships in turn have helped business a difficult moment for everyone turned into a tailwind for me he said i have continued not having a filter my family says i never had a problem with that anyway he said now when he goes to meet with clients it s no longer with an armful of papers the nuts and bolts stuff has been done virtually and he said clients actually seem to prefer watching him circle numbers on a zoom screen rather than on paper that means when we re together we re really together it s lighter more fun he said but back in the office he said he wants people to step away from that screen i said no more chatting and skyping he said no more while we re here if someone asks me a question on skype i open my door and say here s the answer there is such a thing as a free lunch and northwestern mutual advisor matthew wunder of westport connecticut said it worked very well to get his staff back into the office they were a little reluctant even though they had gone to other types of events he said with a laugh so i offered free lunch three days a week and first two people came in but then they told the others and it snowballed so i made it five days a week
