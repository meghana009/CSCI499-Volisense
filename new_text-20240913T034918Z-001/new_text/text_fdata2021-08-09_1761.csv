shanghai afp advertising read more china telecom could raise more than 8 billion in a shanghai initial public offering that would be the biggest this year months after it was delisted in the united states amid washington s stand off with beijing the firm said it had priced its offer at 4 53 yuan per share which would be worth 47 1 billion 7 3 billion according to a filing with the shanghai stock exchange on friday however if an over allotment option was exercised that would jump to 54 billion yuan 8 4 billion bloomberg news said china telecom was delisted by the new york stock exchange in january along with fellow state owned telecoms firms china mobile and china unicom following an executive order by former president donald trump the order banned investments by americans into a range of companies deemed to be supplying or supporting china s military and security apparatus china telecom is the country s largest fixed line operator and the share issue would be the biggest of the year topping the 5 4 billion raised in hong kong by tiktok rival kuaishou technology in february many of china s biggest tech and telecom firms listed their shares on the more developed us stock markets in the 2000s as they sought access to funding but the tide has been turning authorities have been pushing in recent years to instead encourage such companies to list on its domestic exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen as well as hong kong a trend expected to be accelerated by an ongoing government campaign to strengthen control over its major tech giants china is in the midst of a digital transformation drive and proceeds from the shanghai listing will be used for 5g and cloud network infrastructure among other initiatives the exchange filing said 2021 afp
bluejay mining plc epic jay market aim sector mining 9 august 2021 bluejay mining plc bluejay or the company definitive joint venture agreement signed with kobold metals to explore the disko nuussuaq project bluejay the aim and fse listed and octqb traded exploration and development company with projects in greenland and finland is announcing a joint venture agreement jv or the agreement with kobold metals kobold a mineral exploration company that uses machine learning to guide exploration for new deposits rich in the critical materials for electric vehicles this agreement brings a globally significant partner to the company s disko nuussuaq nickel copper cobalt platinum magmatic massive sulphide project disko or the disko project in central west greenland highlights principal investors in kobold include breakthrough energy ventures a climate technology fund overseen by bill gates and whose investors include michael bloomberg jeff bezos and ray dalio other investors in kobold include andreessen horowitz the premier silicon valley venture capital fund and equinor the norwegian state owned multinational energy company under the terms of the agreement kobold can earn 51 of disko through a two stage earn in bluejay can maintain a 49 interest through proportionate funding of the project and will manage field operations during this period kurt house ceo of kobold said the disko region has seen the rare convergence of events in earth s history that could have resulted in forming a world class battery metal deposit kobold s technology is perfectly suited to discovering new resources at disko our proprietary library of analytical tools machine prospector will enable effective deployment of exploration capital and maximize our chances of discovery at disko nuussuaq we are excited to invest in greenland s emerging mineral sector and to partner with bluejay in light of their strong track record in greenland and the outstanding potential of the disko project bo stensgaard ceo of bluejay said this agreement is transformative for bluejay we are delighted to have a partner at the pinnacle of technical innovation for new exploration methods backed by some of the most successful investors in the world additionally bluejay retains the ability to self fund to maintain a 49 ownership through to production providing external public investors with the opportunity of investing alongside a private investment entity of this magnitude disko is a project with great potential for the discovery of globally significant deposits of battery metals it is however this scale that necessitated a financially and technically strong partner to develop disko after many conversations with many groups from all over the world we are pleased to enter into partnership with a group that shares our position on fairness and providing a transparent long term outcome for shareholders as well as being a credible and reliable partner that shares our commitment to environmental sustainability i am very pleased to say that we have achieved this now with kobold an organisation with the heft and technical capability to grow this project to its full commercial potential we are extremely excited to be working with them dr peter lightfoot technical lead of magmatic systems at kobold said the disko nuussuaq property is centred in a region of extensive contaminated and metal depleted volcanic centres where there is clear evidence for the equilibration of flood basalt magma with crustal sulfur with potential for the concentration of magmatic sulphides in shallow sub volcanic intrusions the rich inventory of government and exploration data provides an excellent starting point for kobold to utilize proprietary technology to support exploration after working on the noril sk mineral system and applying the ideas to help falconbridge with their exploration work it is exciting to see this work come to fruition about kobold kobold s purpose is to discover and develop new ethical sources of the critical materials for electric vehicles kobold s objective is to make more discoveries of outstanding orebodies with fewer failures by drawing on world class expertise in exploration geoscience and by developing full stack exploration technology to use machine learning and other scientific computing techniques to enable highly effective exploration decision making the kobold team brings a unique group of industry leading specialists within data science machine learning and artificial intelligence software engineering physics and mathematics coupled with well known mine finder professionals with proven track records notably for the disko nuussuaq project kobold s distinguished and well recognised nickel expert dr peter lightfoot was earlier involved with the historical falconbridge campaign at disko nuussuaq during the 1990s and moreover has been part of a team that has identified major discoveries in every one of the cobalt producing nickel copper sulphide belts in canada kobold s disruptive innovative in house developed machine learning and artificial intelligence data technologies terrashedsm and machine prospector have been built from scratch by alumni of top silicon valley software companies to guide every aspect of mineral exploration as well as mine development and operations terrashedsm integrates all types of geoscientific data into a single system for quality control visualization and predictive modeling kobold s proprietary suite of analytical tools machine prospector interrogates the data with techniques from computer vision to ensemble machine learning to stochastic inversions to predict the locations of orebodies and the critical controls on ore formation kobold has been recognised in 2021 as a technology pioneer by the world economic forum and as one of the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies in the world by cb insights and the only one within the mining industry the agreement the true scale and complexity of disko nuussuaq has always meant that bluejay required an equally sophisticated partner one with financial and technical capabilities that also recognised the expertise operational knowledge local relationships and high environmental social and governance standards that the bluejay team represents whilst there was opportunity to pursue alternative scenarios the company s view was that in all likelihood this would have left bluejay shareholders with reduced ownership exposure as well as limited longer term financial protection and transparency it has always been the company s approach with disko to maximise bluejay s ongoing ownership of an asset that the company firmly believes has the potential to host multiple globally significant occurrences of nickel and copper key terms of the agreement kobold will earn 51 of the disko nuussuaq licence holding through a two stage earn in commitment o stage i advanced geological and geophysical evaluation of disko nuussuaq to refine drill targets using kobold s proprietary technology 3 4 million sole funded by 31 december 2022 o stage ii sole funding of either us 11 6 million in drilling expenditure or 15 pre agreed drill holes within the disko licence area by 31 december 2024 o bluejay can maintain its 49 shareholding by funding its pro rata commitment after stage ii bluejay is a well recognised and respected partner by communities stakeholders and regulators in greenland and will manage field operations until 2024 should kobold complete stage i work but not complete the drilling commitment in stage ii before 31 december 2024 2 0 of the jv company and thereby control will revert to bluejay with both parties subject to continuing standard dilution methodology the disko nuussuaq project all bluejay licence areas were selected carefully following examination of all existing and newly available data and mineralisation models and were specifically chosen due to their accessibility via wide valley systems that cut through the topography therefore making drilling and operations feasible the disko nuussuaq project is hosted within the west greenland tertiary igneous province this province is a well recognised geological analogue to the siberian flood basalts of the noril sk region previous studies and work conducted by the company highlighted the similarities between the geology of the noril sk region of siberia which is the marginal producer of nickel and palladium and disko nuussuaq this is supported by multiple peer reviewed scientific studies historical work at disko nuussuaq initial investigations at disko nuussuaq date back to the discovery in 1870 of the 28 tonne illukunguaq boulder of massive sulphide assaying 7 nickel 3 copper and 512 grammes per tonne g t cobalt as well as more than 2 0 g t platinum group elements following this more than 30 years of exploration by companies including cominco and falconbridge but also more recent work by vismand exploration and cairn energy backed avannaa resources as well as government backed work and data acquisition by the geological survey of greenland geological survey of denmark has resulted in a vast amount of scientific data both geological geochemical and geophysical all pointing to a process producing a globally significant accumulation of metals the total cost of this multi decade data acquisition and field work represents millions of dollars of total expenditure detailed geochemical mass balance calculations on the kukunguaq member sulphide saturated contaminated basalt sequence indicates that between 12 16 million tons of nickel metal are missing from lavas extruded from the mantle the most likely explanation for this is that these metals have precipitated as nickel and copper sulphides proximal to the main volcanic vents and other structural corridors which controlled the migration of magma bluejay licence areas cover all of the currently known contaminated and metal depleted volcanic centres on disko and nuussuaq in addition to the magmatic sulphide mineralisation system massive gold bearing boulders of native iron have been found on the company s licences specifically the 10 tonne hammer dal boulder providing another significant target for iron nickel copper cobalt platinum group elements gold mineralisation bluejay has undertaken multiple work campaigns over several seasons with the inclusion of several state sponsored technical partners undertaking aerial surveys extensive geochemical sampling utilising the most modern analytical techniques with ultra low sensitivity as well as soil gas hydrocarbon sampling these new deep penetrating geochemical and gas surveys have for the first time provided metal anomaly signals coincident with previously identified large scale geophysical responses bluejay s assessment and investigation over the last several years has identified more than 20 drill ready targets on licence holdings at disko nuussuaq of the targets defined notably there are seven large conductive targets previously defined by vismand exploration and avannaa resources and reconfirmed by bluejay the two largest conductive targets are extraordinary in scale the largest being more than 10 0 kilometres km long and around 2 0 km wide and another being around 4 8 km long and 800 metres m wide both comparable in footprint to the world class noril sk talnakh ore bodies details on the potential analogue norilsk nickel district the copper nickel platinum group metal deposits at noril sk talnakh are located at a depth of 500 to 1 500m beneath surface in a series of flood basalts and sedimentary rocks the massive sulphide orebodies are hosted within the talnakh intrusive complex the ores range from ni rich contact ores with cu co pt pd rh and au footwall and hanging wall cuprous ores rich in cu and precious metals with some ni and co and disseminated sulphide mineralization the most recent reserve estimates by noril sk nickel estimate proven and probable ore reserves totalling 663 1 million tonnes mt containing 6 0 mt of nickel 11 4 mt of copper and 117 5 million ounces moz of platinum group metals reserves are reportedly sufficient to support 80 years of output measured and indicated ore resources are in the order of a stunning 1 702 9 mt containing 11 6 mt of nickel 22 mt of copper and 257 3 moz of platinum group metals source mmc norilsk nickel annual report 2020 it is estimated that since mining started in 1940 the norilsk district has produced a total of 8 3 mt of nickel 16 3 mt of copper 178 moz of platinum group metals and 3 1 moz of gold from 691 mt of ore after adjusting for mining and processing losses the total pre mined resource for the district camp is estimated to be 2 800 mt at 0 9 nickel 1 7 copper 6 0 g t platinum group metals and 0 2 g t gold table 1 comparing global reserves plus resources the norilsk camp contains 15 of the global resource of sulphide nickel 27 of the total global palladium resource and 30 of the global resource of magmatic sulphide hosted copper based on the above estimates of combined reserves resources and historic production the total value of the ores in the norilsk district in 2020 metal prices is us 1 4 trillion of which the platinum group elements account for about 60 the oktyabrysk massive sulphide orebody alone accessed from the oktyabrsk and taimyr mines contained over half a trillion dollars of metal value exceeding the value the next 5 largest metal deposits and making it by far the most valuable

the first licence holdings at disko nuussuaq were purchased by bluejay in 2017 from capricorn oil limited capricorn a subsidiary of cairn energy plc cairn which was the licence holder at the time after the oil and gas exploration and development company cairn ceased its offshore activities in west greenland at the same time it also ceased funding its parallel onshore mineral exploration vehicle and operator avannaa resources ltd the transaction included all licences at disko nuussuaq as well as licences at the kangerluarsuk zinc lead silver copper project located north of the former famous and most profitable historical mine in greenland the black angel zinc lead silver mine the acquisition price was 500 000 the initial licence holding at disko nuussuaq was expanded by bluejay in 2017 2018 and 2020 to the current total holding of 2 897 km² the bluejay licence holdings are concentrated over the most prospective settings contaminated basalt as well as targeting the larger fault systems magmatic pathways bluejay s land holdings also host most of the previously recognized magmatic sulphide and native iron boulders and native iron occurrences moreover the bluejay licence ground was acquired in areas where valleys incised into the flood basalts that reduces the drill depth to potentially mineralized subvolcanic intrusions all licences have access to a deep water fjord or deep open water and can be operated from either land or boat barge based camps from the later part of 2019 and into 2021 disko nuussuaq has seen a licence acquisition race that means that bluejay s first mover holdings have been surrounded by other licence holders and notably anglo american holds an area of almost 10 000 km² the northern coast of disko island has seen earlier mining operations when the qullissat coal mine was in operation from 1924 to 1966 the former coal mine and the abandoned mining town is located within the bluejay licence holdings the nearest major town to the holdings at disko nuussuaq is ilulissat which is located in mainland greenland c 100 170 km south east of the licence areas ilulissat is the gateway as well as the educational business and administration centre to northern west greenland and is an active hub with an airport deep water port facilities and service providers bluejay has had an established office and storage facility in ilulissat since 2016

notes bluejay is listed on the london aim market and frankfurt stock exchange and its shares also trade on the otcqb market in the us with multiple projects in greenland and finland bluejay has now secured three globally respected entities as partner customer and co investor on three of its projects giving the company and its shareholders both portfolio and commodity diversification in high quality jurisdictions its most advanced project is the dundas ilmenite project in greenland which is fully permitted and being developed towards production in the near term the dundas ilmenite project has been proven to be the highest grade mineral sand ilmenite project globally with a mineral resource reported in accordance with the jorc code of 117 million tonnes at 6 1 ilmenite and a maiden offshore exploration target of between 300mt and 530mt of ilmenite at an average expected grade range of 0 4 4 8 ilmenite in situ the company has agreed a master distribution agreement with a major asian conglomerate for up to 340 000ktpa of its anticipated 440 000ktpa annual output the company s strategy is focused on securing financing ahead of commencing commercial production at dundas in order to create a company capable of self funding exploration on its current and future projects bluejay holds two additional projects in greenland the 692sq km kangerluarsuk zinc lead silver project kangerluarsuk where historical work has recovered grades of 41 zinc 9 3 lead and 596 g t silver and identified four large scale drill ready targets and the 2 025 sq km thunderstone project which has the potential to host large scale base metal and gold deposits bluejay also has a joint venture agreement with a mining major at enonkoski in finland has recently signed a binding agreement for a partial divestment in a fourth finnish project and with kobold at disko nuussuaq following today s announcement ends
a record breaking heat wave a town devastated by fire sea animals cooked to death and far too many lives lost and the summer isn t even over yet in b c unprecedented wildfires and floods are now common across the world due to climate change and our lives will be drastically transformed over the next decade and beyond expect a grim update when the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change drops today but in the face of the planet s most defining challenge and a fast approaching deadline to address it what can people like us reasonably do it s a question noted environmentalist paul hawken sets out to answer in his new book regeneration ending the climate crisis in one generation to be published in september hawken had been thinking about regeneration even before his last book about climate change drawdown subtitled the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming was released it was always my next book the sequel he wrote in an email to the tyee a lot has happened since 2017 the year drawdown was released the landmark intergovernmental panel on climate change report that warned of a 12 year deadline to avoid climate catastrophe was released in 2018 the next year saw an explosion of youth led movements across the world pushing for urgent climate action more recently the new u s administration seems to be more interested in addressing the issue and has rejoined the paris climate agreement but a lot has stayed the same too emissions continue to rise governments and institutions still drag their feet on climate action many of the main contributors to the crisis particularly the fossil fuel industry that spent decades obscuring its responsibility continue to obstruct progress the tyee reached hawken by email to talk about what individuals can do how we got to this place in human history and what comes next our interview was edited and condensed for clarity and length the tyee how has your thinking on the climate crisis changed in the four years since your last book was released paul hawken i always suspected that there would not be widespread action until global warming became experiential instead of conceptual that is increasingly so and that has changed my thinking about how to communicate climate deniers are now completely irrelevant political corruption is the key obstacle and it is a formidable challenge that being said it is important that everyone take action in every way they can and not wait for political awareness or change part of taking action is voting speaking truth to power boycotts influencing one s peers the greater part of action is making change on the ground in our communities across our regions in our companies within our schools at our homes closets and kitchens etc while your 2017 book drawdown tried to lay out a map for building a better future it didn t look then like we would actually draw down our emissions to where they needed to be has that changed what has dramatically changed is the production installation innovation and cost reductions on renewables solar and wind they now outcompete fossil fuel generated electricity on cost it is no longer a race renewables won the main challenge there is the funding coming from u s and canadian banks and china for coal and gas fired generation facilities in the developing world if this continues it will lock in non renewable energy grids through 2050 and prevent what could a be a complete transition to renewable energy by some time in the 2040s jp morgan bank of america wells fargo royal bank of canada td bank scotiabank and others have made 3 8 trillion in investments and loans to fossil fuel companies since the paris agreement when you pull out a credit card from one of these banks you are pulling out a card that is destroying our future what does regeneration mean to you regeneration means placing life at the centre of every action and decision i was asked to come up with guidelines or principles by a friend and in 15 minutes this is what i came up with others can make their own guidelines these seem obvious to me and i think they are common sense to anyone who wants to create a meaningful life on this planet does the action create more life or reduce it does it heal the future or steal the future does it enhance human well being or diminish it does it prevent disease or profit from it does it create livelihoods or eliminate them does it restore land or degrade it does it increase global warming or decrease it does it serve human needs or manufacture human wants does it reduce poverty or expand it does it promote fundamental human rights or deny them does it provide workers with dignity or demean them in short is the activity extractive or regenerative regeneration seems to strike a different tone from the last book with sharper more specific language and a focus on fairness and equity could you talk about that drawdown had two goals the first was to name the goal drawdown as a way to reverse global warming mitigate fight combat or tackle climate change are verbs and verbs are not goals furthermore you can t tackle or mitigate change climate changes every nanosecond and always will what we want to do is peak in greenhouse gas emissions and begin to draw them down bringing the carbon that is increasing atmospheric warming back home from whence it came the second goal was to map measure and model the most substantive solutions and to determine if drawdown was possible we chose solutions that were extant and scaling and calculated the cost and savings end of the day drawdown was a what could be done book that was enough it was a lot regeneration is a what and how to do it book and website it is about action and connection so that anyone on any level of agency can see exactly what they can do about climate challenges and solutions the reason that equity and fairness are bedrock to the book goes back to the word regeneration we are in an extractive economy that takes life and concentrates wealth any time we take life whether it be the life of a community soil oceans species insects cultures forests or human rights it is degenerative regeneration is a pivot it chronicles and delineates how to do a 180 and move to regenerative outcomes the current socioeconomic system is stealing the future climatically biologically culturally ethnically and generationally regeneration is about healing the future because that is what life does without exception and we are life and we need to recognize that innate quality within us and our intelligence and capability and implement it on every level of social political and economic activity i am not proposing an alternative solution to global warming reversing degeneration is the only way we can regenerate climatic stability social well being human health biodiversity how do you think we got to this point where we have this existential crisis facing us but most people feel disengaged and powerless to do anything about it we got to this point because the need to address global warming was communicated to us largely by scientists scientists never took communication courses climate communication is filled with data jargon and acronyms and the predictions were about or incited fear and threat 1 5 c is a complete abstraction to most people so are 418 ppm billions of tonnes greenhouse gas equivalence and the term future existential threat these terms mean nothing to the vast majority of humanity the prognostications of science became guilt blame and shame in the hands of activists i give credit to both scientists and activists for being right and leading however that type of communication is guaranteed not to be effective ask any neuroscientist and getting back to the point of regeneration people do not know what to do truly it was the number one question i got after virtually every one of the 128 speeches i gave following the publication of drawdown if the people especially those in power haven t listened up to this point what hope do you have that they ll listen now almost all governments are corrupt the few that aren t are active and leading corrupt governments don t listen until they have to two things will change that the weather and human mobilization political leadership today is not a pretty sight on the other hand look at what happened with the keystone pipeline tackling the climate crisis from various angles beyond just changing our energy systems seems to be a major goal for your last two projects could you tell us why it is true that we have to get energy systems and sources right no question however the earth is a system so is your body so are soils forests oceans countries and societies we can end this civilization with renewable energy too pepsi is made with renewable energy and it is a sugary over hyped soft drink that is causing metabolic disease in our children including obesity and type 2 diabetes the current socioeconomic system is destroying our health cultures soil rivers oceans biodiversity and climatic stability it can be done just as easily with renewable energy as not the true cause of global warming is disconnections in all systems we are disconnected from each other we are disconnected from nature and we have disconnected nature from itself through habitat fragmentation chemicals poison pollution overfishing deforestation and more regeneration is about reconnecting those broken strands you heal a system whether it is an ecosystem social system or an immune system by re connecting more of it to itself you ve contributed to climate discourse in long lasting consequential ways with citations from climate activists to car columnists how do you feel about that impact the climate crisis is increasingly the subject for more and more people and institutions i think both books have and will make an impact and it is fascinating to see where and how drawdown was taught in fourth grade all the way to mit graduate school and is published in 17 languages glad to be part of the conversation we will see what happens with this next book what do you think is the most efficient and impactful way for ordinary people to combat climate change right now the first thing is to eliminate the idea of combat that this is a fight anytime we use those types of verbs we are othering nature and in this case the exquisite complex interactions amongst the biosphere and atmosphere a system that brings about food beauty water speciation seasons and hummingbirds what we want to do is bring human action in alignment with biology this is harmony not a battle climate is an expression of the biology of the earth not something out there somewhere nature never makes a mistake we do it is far more interesting to see climate as a teacher not an opponent we are being home schooled by planet earth the changes in climate are feedback any system that ignores feedback perishes the most important and effective action a person can take is something that lights them up that they want to know more about that they care about that fascinates them what s the dark horse climate solution one that is underrated or often overlooked but has immense potential the human heart mind and imagination seriously we have the tools techniques and practices at hand that we need to reverse the climate crisis what is missing is human engagement the solutions are not seen as benefiting the majority of people we share the planet with overwhelmingly most people wake up and immediately focus on their current needs not future existential threats how can someone get engaged on climate when they can t get a job or properly feed their family or have access to health care education and personal safety this has been a blind spot of the climate movement it is a privileged movement meeting in five star hotels every year to discuss what should be done if we fail and if a history is written there will be a discussion on how ironic it was that we failed even though the solutions were under our nose the whole time the collective climate solutions that i and my team have gathered and analyzed are extraordinary in this respect every solution is something we would want to do could do and should do even if there was not a single climate scientist alive and we were clueless as to the cause of extreme weather every solution we offer creates a better kinder more fulfilling and compassionate life for humanity and all the creatures that inhabit our extraordinary home in other words there is no reason not to do them now the economy of the future is the healing of the world and that is regeneration is there any solution that has moved to the forefront for you partly because the current and existing data and science has changed the main change that can be seen is the extraordinary drop in the cost of renewable energy i don t think anyone would have seen or predicted where it is now 10 years back much less five years ago the other is regenerative agriculture regenerative agriculture was seen not so long ago as tangential or marginal by the agricultural establishment that is no longer the case industrial agriculture was born in the mid 19th century and was greatly amplified by the haber bosch method that created artificial nitrates farming changed to a system where the plant was being fed not the soil and it worked in certain ways what it also did was kill the microbiome of the soil over the decades until soil became dirt a medium to keep the plant standing up feeding the plant essential nutrients created bigger plants but not stronger plants and insects attacked the weaker monocrops and then came pesticides and finally glyphosate to prevent weedy competition basically agriculture became a process of killing instead of living regenerative agriculture feeds the soil which feeds the plant as soil and plants have done for hundreds of millions of years regenerative agriculture is now ascendant it works better is more profitable less inputs less equipment healthier for the farmer and his family more resilient and it produces more nutrient dense food when fields are converted how do you think canada is doing in terms of what needs to be done canada is having a tough time because of alberta the texas of canada a rich province that is financially addicted to the tarsands the dirtiest oil on earth on top of that it is opening up the boreal forest to mining mountain top clearing for coal and increasing deforestation to make plush toilet paper catalogues newspapers and shopping bags the boreal is the single largest stock of terrestrial carbon on the planet anything really interesting you ve noticed coming out of canada or british columbia more specifically i am very impressed with what is coming out of the city of vancouver with respect to planning walkability social justice becoming a 15 minute city transport decarbonization commitments heat pumps the built environment and much more i think gregor robertson left a great legacy what advice would you give to young people about reversing climate change i would probably crib a commencement speech i gave 12 years ago i mentioned during the talk that ralph waldo emerson once asked what we would do if the stars only came out once every thousand years good question i said people would stay up all night and be ecstatic but what we actually do is watch television every night bc needs a wartime approach to the climate emergency and now read more i ended the speech like this this extraordinary time when we are globally aware of each other and the multiple dangers that threaten civilization has never happened not in a thousand years not in 10 000 years each of us is as complex and beautiful as all the stars in the universe we have done great things and we have gone way off course in terms of honouring creation you are graduating to the most amazing stupefying challenge ever bequested to any generation the generations before you failed they didn t stay up all night they got distracted and lost sight of the fact that life is a miracle every moment of your existence nature beckons you to be on her side you couldn t ask for a better boss the most unrealistic person in the world is the cynic not the dreamer hope only makes sense when it doesn t

will be available to all customers from august and will include new mapping module space connect o arr up 157 in the six month period to 0 4m driven primarily by successful reseller agreements

and usa o naso sales lower than expected but first significant order received in july 2021 o new space connect mapping module released anders kern a k o sales below expectations due to covid lockdown in h1 but significant increase in orders and improved revenue and sales pipeline since july cash as at 31 july 2021 of 3 4 million 31 january 2021 4 5 million the board is very pleased with the progress made by the business in the last six months during what was a challenging and unpredictable environment group arr grew by 28 on a constant currency basis from 2 9m to 3 8m in the period and by 51 over the 12 month period with good arr expansion for both swipedon and space connect importantly we also made considerable progress in establishing the foundations for further expansion of arr and arpu with increased number of resellers enhanced functionality and streamlined processes revenue for the six month period amounted to 2 5m 2020 2 3m of which 63 was recurring 2020 45 recurring whilst revenues from hardware sales in the a k business were impacted by uncertainty around the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the uk the business is well placed to support office re openings through provision of both workplace hardware and software solutions with growth expected to accelerate in the second half of the year as lockdown restrictions continue to be eased the board remains confident of achieving future growth in line with market expectations cash as at 31 july 2021 totalled 3 4 million 31 january 2020 4 5 million swipedon swipedon arr growth is in line with board expectations increasing by 22 in the six month period on a constant currency basis from 2 6m to 3 2m our strategy of increasing arpu from existing customers increasing the focus of new sales into higher value multisite opportunities continues to positively impact swipedon and remains the key driver for growth over the coming years in may 2021 we reported arpu was at nz 99 3 49 9 up from 91 8 in jan 2021 by the end of july arpu increased to nz 111 8 56 1 an increase of 22 since the beginning of the year our main sales focus has shifted to higher value customers who opt for our more expensive business and enterprise plans and who have potential for multilocation and swipedon desk sales this has resulted in an increase in average locations per new customer signed in the period to 1 8 compared to a historic average at the beginning of the year of 1 4 locations per customer churn is still significantly below budgeted levels and is currently running at 1 1 per month for customers and 0 7 per month for revenue the majority of churn is from our lower value starter plan customers with limited if any land and expand opportunity these lower value customers cost as much to acquire as the higher spending customers and can take a disproportionate amount of support time notwithstanding the churn of lower value customers growth has occurred in both customers and more importantly locations the number of locations swipedon is deployed into has increased during the period from 6 741 to 7 003 net new customers have slightly from 4 735 to 4 747 as we focus on higher value multi location clients this is well illustrated by the recent client win in june with major airline catering group gategroup we have signed and implemented our first swipedon desks customers in the uk and we are now ready to offer this product across our entire swipedon customer base an example of one of our most recent customer wins for swipedon desks is jamie oliver group taking their arpu from 39 to 375 space connect space connect saw significant increase in demand for its products in the period leading to 157 arr growth over the six month period to 0 4m we are seeing a strong pipeline from our resellers reinforcing the momentum seen in the business and underpinning our confidence in the opportunity for space connect its product capabilities and the potential market this increase in arr was driven largely by the successful relationship with partners such as softcat in the six months to 31 july 2021 space connect added a further 14 partners along with our first partner signings in poland ireland belgium canada and the usa we have also started to make good progress in signing crestron partners globally of these new signings insight partners and xma are key as they have significant customer bases and we envisage they will become major resellers of space connect in the uk we have had a number of significant orders for space connect recently from new clients including travis perkins xps pensions rank leisure group and nhs highlands the arpu for space connect customers is now 804 per month in july we released our new space connect mapping module this product has been developed inhouse allowing customers to upload their floorplans and intuitively and quickly identify desks on these plans and give access to employees previously we used a third party service provider to undertake this mapping task which depending on complexity could take up to three weeks to complete with this new module customers can get up and running instantly the mapping module has been well received by both existing and new customers and will be critical to our speed of deployment differentiator as customers can activate their applications immediately as this module is enhanced further it will also create new revenue opportunities as customers will be able to use it on a standalone basis to continuingly model floorplan schemas as their requirements changes sales of our strategic partner s meeting room panel the evoko naso for which space connect receives both licence fees and saas revenues were less than we expected in the first half of the year as detailed below indications of improvement occurred in july with the first significant strategic order for naso products being placed by a major international hospitality brand as evoko partners progressively reopen we expect this momentum to continue the shortfall in sales of naso was mainly a result of evoko partners in key markets such as germany spain and austria being closed due to lockdown these partners experienced what we ourselves experienced in a k a reluctance to place orders for hardware when their customers were not in the office evoko have used the time during lockdown to ensure partners are fully trained in naso and to further develop and release naso marketing collateral evoko have also confirmed that all partners now have active engagements with naso prospects which they expect will transform into orders in the second half of the year evoko s sales estimates for the remainder of the year are in excess of our assumptions they are confident in achieving their estimates and have sufficient naso units in stock to fulfil orders anders kern a k as lockdown in the uk was extended a large number of a k s customers were closed and a number of end user customer investment decisions for hardware were delayed this led to lower revenues for a k in april to june however since july there has been a significant uptick both in revenues and in near term pipeline this is as a direct result of removal of lockdown restrictions in the uk and a reluctance to invest when there was no clear date to return to the office during the period a k continued to furlough a small number of employees taking advantage of the uk government s job retention scheme whilst we remain confident that the recent increase in orders for a k products will continue in the second half of the year any return to further lockdown conditions is likely to place uncertainty on this business outlook we continue to build on the foundations we have set over the past year with our focus on building arr and arpu we have also centralised our product support operation under a newly appointed head of customer service based in mildenhall this structure will allow us to offer 24 hour global support to both swipedon and space connect customers these changes together with the development of our own mapping tool and streamlined sales process were essential to the roll out of swipedon desks the initial soft launch of swipedon desks aimed at customers based in the uk demonstrated demand for the product therefore from august 2021 onwards we will be targeting our entire swipedon customer base this will contribute to further growth in arr and arpu for swipedon in the second half of the year with lockdown restrictions progressively easing around the globe we believe naso will start to generate new sales momentum as seen in the recent order from a major international brand for the naso product as covid and lockdowns ease across the globe and businesses gradually return to the office many will adopt hybrid working implement systems for more efficient space utilisation creating a better employee experience in this environment demand for space connect will continue to grow the agility of space connect to rapidly deploy to customers with a high degree of user control means that we are particularly from a competitive perspective ideally placed to assist these customers with their requirements there has been a noticeable change in a k customer activity since lockdown restrictions eased in july orders that had been put on hold during the earlier part of the year are now being placed and we now have good visibility over our sales orders for the coming months commenting on the announcement frank beechinor ceo of smartspace said both swipedon and space connect have successfully achieved strong growth and demonstrated robust business models through these challenging and unpredictable times as we move forward we will continue to globalise the businesses and enhance our product offerings with the continued focus of becoming a leading workplace optimisation saas business our focus through to fy22 will be on maintaining and increasing arr through increased arpu further expansion of reseller channels further internationalisation of the business and continuing to offer enhanced functionality this will support the group in subsequent years in becoming a leading global saas business in particular swipedon desks along with enhanced features and a focus on larger multi location contracts continue to be major catalysts for achieving our growth objectives for swipedon in space connect the continued successful partnership with our existing partners will continue to develop whilst more recently signed resellers are already growing their sales pipelines we will continue to expand the reseller base in new international geographies whilst evoko naso sales have been slower than originally anticipated we understand the reasons why as we have experienced similar delays in investment decisions from a k customers due to covid restrictions however we are optimistic that through the second half of the year and beyond naso will contribute significant revenues to the business this confidence is underpinned by both the reopening of resellers in important overseas markets for evoko and the signing of the first strategic contract for naso as a result the board is confident growth will accelerate in the second half of the year allowing us to achieve our expected growth for the full year in line with market expectations

investment in our people proposition service and technology as well as the cost of servicing an enlarged and growing client base we expect 2022 costs to reflect this investment and continue to be broadly aligned to client growth the impact of covid on individuals businesses and the economy still provides an uncertain backdrop to the current year as we have eased out of lockdown and entered the summer months we have seen a slowdown in dealing volumes and client activity versus the elevated levels this time last year which is also normal for this time of year and in line with management expectations however given our enlarged client base we would still expect to see stronger client activity in 2022 versus 2020 which also included a few months of elevated activity during the peak of the pandemic period and the breadth of proposition and client focus gives us confidence that as the year progresses we will continue to win in this growing market here is what you need to know at the

new clients under the age of 55 further it said it saw high levels of engagement from the trading phenomenon around gamestop and so called meme stocks looking ahead ceo hill said with this continued investment in our people proposition service and technology as well as the cost of servicing an enlarged and growing client base we expect 2022 costs to reflect this investment and continue to be broadly aligned to client growth the impact of covid on individuals businesses and the economy still provides an uncertain backdrop to the current year as we have eased out of lockdown and entered the summer months we have seen a slowdown in dealing volumes and client activity versus the elevated levels this time last year which is also normal for this time of year and in line with management expectations however given our enlarged client base we would still expect to see stronger client activity in 2022 versus 2020 which also included a few months of elevated activity during the peak of the pandemic period and the breadth of proposition and client focus gives us confidence that as the year progresses we will continue to win in this growing market here is what you need to know at the

asian markets rise but fed taper talk delta keep traders on edge business asian markets rise but fed taper talk delta keep traders on edge spiking infections around the world from the delta covid variant are also jangling nerves 09 august 2021 08 27 am hong kong afp asian markets rose monday but investors remained cautious after a forecast beating us jobs report reinforced optimism about the economic recovery but fanned speculation the federal reserve could begin tapering monetary policy this year spiking infections around the world from the delta covid variant are also jangling nerves as governments reassess their growth outlooks with some including china forced to reimpose lockdowns and other containment measures data on friday showed the world s biggest economy created 943 000 new jobs in july while the june reading was also revised higher to more than 900 000 the news provided some much needed reassurance that the rebound was still on track despite delta s spread however it also renewed concerns that in a bid to prevent overheating the fed will start to wind down the ultra loose policies including record low interest rates and a vast bond buying scheme that have been integral to an equity market rally since april last year the bank has continuously stressed that it will maintain its accommodative stance for as long as the economy needs to recover but with inflation at multi year highs and jobs returning it is coming under increasing pressure to act you have these concerns that if the economy is growing very very strongly then that might bring forward the tightening or the tapering by the fed shane oliver at amp capital told bloomberg television there is a good chance they might announce that tapering in september and it would start later this year and national australia bank s rodrigo catril added overall there is not a lot of disagreement on a taper announcement coming sometime between september december followed by actual tapering sometime between november and january he said fed chief jerome powell s speech to the jackson hole symposium of top finance and banking chiefs this month had taken on even more significance still us investors were broadly upbeat with the dow and s p 500 ending at all time highs though the nasdaq slipped with tech firms more sensitive to higher rates and asian investors took up the baton hong kong shanghai sydney seoul wellington manila and jakarta all rose though taipei slipped tokyo and singapore were closed for holidays there was little major reaction to data showing growth in chinese exports slowed last month while inflation came in slightly above expectations however oil prices extended friday s losses as the fast spread of delta raises concerns about the outlook for demand particularly in china investors are also keeping tabs on developments in washington where lawmakers are close to a vote on joe biden s 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill which will provide another massive shot in the arm for the economy
the us economic recovery is being threatened by the covid 19 delta variant increasing vaccination rates is the most important thing the us can do to sustain the economy over the next few months beyond that however full recovery might require creating new vaccines against delta and other emerging variants us stock markets and treasury yields took big dips in recent days before rebounding despite the bounce back the volatility is evidence that investors are worried about the health of the recovery it s not just markets either there are some concrete signs of economic weakness such as a week with an unexpectedly high number of initial jobless claims the lights aren t flashing red yet but these are clear warning signs the obvious reason is the delta variant of covid this variant which is both more infectious and more resistant to vaccines than previous versions of the virus has become the dominant strain in the us as a result cases are rising again if the us ends up looking anything like the uk the country is in for another big wave of disease the economic risk isn t a renewed policy of lockdowns and mandatory social distancing the american populace and government officials seem to have had their fill of such restrictive measures but in fact lockdowns were never a very big contributor to the economic devastation of 2020 evidence on the timing and the strictness of government mandated social distancing measures has shown that economic harm occurred pretty much regardless nor did state level reopenings give economies much of a boost but if lockdowns weren t what hurt the economy what was it it was simply widespread fear of the virus the existence of a deadly highly contagious plague is a powerful reason to order from amazon com instead of going to a store or to dine at home instead of going to a restaurant some people went out heedless of the danger but that paltry demand wasn t enough to sustain local service businesses which laid off workers after the initial wave when masking became commonplace and people began to understand the risks of what they were facing economic activity wasn t so hobbled by fear even during the disheartening fall and winter surge in late 2020 and early 2021 but it was only after vaccines became widely available that local economies really began to roar back to life delta puts that rapid recovery under threat its high infectiousness means that even a fairly substantial percent of vaccinated americans won t be enough to protect the unvaccinated from getting the virus and america has quite a lot of unvaccinated people thanks in part to a right wing campaign against the safe and highly effective vaccines even an apparent recent positive shift in fox news tone toward vaccines is unlikely to counteract the corrosive effect of months of highly politicized anti vaccination propaganda and while some of those unvaccinated americans will doubtless be as macho in their defiance of delta as they were with the original version of the coronavirus some will deem it more prudent to avoid crowded indoor spaces just a little bit more meanwhile even vaccinated americans may be hesitant to go out in the face of delta the mrna vaccines from moderna inc and pfizer inc biontech se significantly lower the risk of becoming infected with delta and in the vast majority of cases they prevent the vaccinated from getting sick enough to be hospitalized or die but they don t entirely eliminate the risks there s a fairly substantial number of breakthrough infections even among the fully vaccinated and while that s rarely life threatening there remains the possibility of the protracted symptoms called long covid even among young people perhaps if this were march 2020 this level of risk wouldn t be enough to deter americans from going out to eat and shop but they ve had a year to adapt to the habits of social distancing and many may just decide to extend their pandemic life a little while longer until the threat of delta has passed to monitor whether this is happening keep an eye on opentable restaurant reservation data so far it doesn t look too bad but if that changes watch out what can anyone do to allay this possibility as before only defeating the virus through more comprehensive vaccination will bring the economy fully reliably back we need an intensified public information campaign including the right wing media to make that happen but in the longer term confidence might improve with rapid government approval of vaccine boosters specifically designed for delta and other variants that may now be emerging ultimately it may take several iterations of vaccination to clean covid out of the us economy bloomberg
this is the week when we might find out whether the surge in us inflation to levels last seen nearly three decades ago is as the federal reserve keeps insisting transitory or entrenched the us inflation numbers for july are out this wednesday with the median market forecast of 0 5 per cent for headline month on month of 4 5 per cent inflation and 0 4 per cent for core excluding energy and food inflation reflecting a significant deceleration from the 0 9 per cent headline and 4 5 per cent core numbers in june federal reserve chairman jerome powell said americans are learning to cope better with covid 19 credit bloomberg those june numbers the biggest monthly increase since 1982 reignited a debate in the us over the fed s monetary policies and what the sustained burst of inflation might mean for bond and equity markets the fed chairman jerome powell has been steadfast in his view that the spike in inflation is transitory that it is a function of the disruption to supply chains caused by the pandemic and the distortions generated by the unprecedented fiscal response

a family were given a shock when they spotted what they believed to be a massive shark swimming just yards from the shore while walking on norfolk beach kerry hester 47 was strolling along the beachfront in caister on sea near great yarmouth when she and her daughters saw the fin of what she thinks was a basking shark poking out the water the mother of two from harlow essex quickly pulled

and a wind farm she said we looked out to sea and we spotted the shark it was really weird as there was hardly anyone down there and no one else seemed to notice it i was really mesmerised by it i think it was a basking shark and i don t think they re that common around here it was about 100metres from the shore and it was visible with the naked eye captioning the video which she posted on facebook on saturday kerry wrote was looking for seals and saw this don t think i will be in the sea for a while the mother of two from harlow essex quickly pulled out her camera to record the shark as it swam in the waters close by and shared the video on facebook on saturday kerry said in the 30 years she has taken trips to caister on sea she has never seen a basking shark in the waters basking sharks are most commonly seen in cornwall western scotland and the isle of man but other sightings have taken place across the uk they are the second largest shark in the world after the whale shark

sharks is around 39ft but there have been unconfirmed reports of larger ones it is unknown how long they live but scientists are trying to learn this by counting the number of vertebral spines in a similar way to counting the rings of a tree trunk to discover its age and comparing that to other animals whose age is known basking sharks feed mainly on zooplankton and will swim slowly just beneath the surface with their mouths open to filter the tiny organisms from seawater they prefer to live in cooler waters along coastlines and in open water and can be found across the world northern

judging by the number of times phrases such as equitable growth and the distributional footprint of monetary policy appear in central bankers speeches nowadays it is clear that monetary policymakers are feeling the heat as concerns about the rise of inequality continue to grow but is monetary policy to blame for this problem and is it really the right tool for redistributing income recently a steady stream of commentaries has pointed to central bank policy as a major driver of inequality the logic simply put is that hyper low interest rates have been relentlessly pushing up the prices of stocks houses fine art yachts and just about everything else the well off and especially the ultra rich thus benefit disproportionately this argument may seem compelling at first glance but on deeper reflection it does not hold up inflation in advanced economies has been extremely low over the past decade although it accelerated to 5 4 in the united states in june when monetary policy is the main force pushing down interest rates inflation will eventually rise but in recent times the main factors causing interest rates to trend downward include aging populations low productivity growth rising inequality and a lingering fear that we live in an era where crises are more frequent the latter in particular puts a premium on safe debt that will pay even in a global recession true the us federal reserve or any central bank could impulsively start increasing policy rates this would help address wealth inequality by wreaking havoc on the stock market if the fed persisted with this approach however there would almost certainly be a huge recession causing high unemployment among low income workers and the middle class could see the value of their homes or pension funds fall sharply furthermore the dollar s global dominance makes emerging markets and developing countries extremely vulnerable to rising dollar interest rates especially with the covid 19 pandemic still raging while the top 1 in advanced economies would lose money as one country after another was pushed to the brink of default hundreds of millions of people in poor and lower middle income economies would suffer much more many rich country progressives it seems have little time for worrying about the 66 of the world s population that lives outside the advanced economies and china in fact the same criticism applies to the burgeoning academic literature on monetary policy and inequality much of it is based on us data and gives no thought to anyone outside america still it is useful to try to understand how under different assumptions and circumstances monetary policy might affect the distribution of wealth and income it is possible that as artificial intelligence advances and monetary policy becomes much more sophisticated economists will find better metrics than employment to judge the stabilization properties of monetary policy that would be a good thing even today central banks regulatory role means that they can certainly help at the margins in addressing inequality in many countries including japan banks are essentially required to provide very low cost or free basic accounts to most low income citizens oddly this is not the case in the us although the problem could be elegantly solved if and when the fed issues a central bank digital currency but interest rate adjustments are far too blunt a tool for conventional monetary policy to play any kind of leading role in mitigating inequality fiscal policy including taxes transfers and targeted government spending is far more effective and robust one popular solution to the problem of wealth inequality notably advocated by economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman of the university of california berkeley is a wealth tax but although far from a crazy idea it is difficult to implement fairly and does not have a great track record across advanced economies arguably there are simpler approaches such as reforming the estate tax and raising capital gains taxes that could achieve the same end another idea would be to shift to a system of progressive consumption taxes a more sophisticated version of a value added or sales tax that would hit wealth holders when they go to spend their money and a carbon tax would raise huge revenues that could be redirected toward low and lower middle income households some might argue that political paralysis means none of these redistributive proposals are advancing fast enough and that central banks need to step into the gap if inequality is to be tamed this view seems to forget that although central banks have a certain degree of operating independence they are not empowered to take over fiscal policy decision making from legislatures as extreme poverty has declined in many countries in recent decades inequality has become the leading societal challenge but the view that a central bank s interest rate policy can and should be the main driving force behind greater income equality is stupefyingly naive no matter how often it is stated central banks can do more to address the inequality problem particularly through regulatory policy but they cannot do everything and please let s stop ignoring the other two thirds of humanity in this crucial debate

acushnet when kenneth gonsalves saw a gentleman counting out loose change to pay for a can of pet food it sparked an idea that blew up instantly he immediately arrived home and told his wife jill he returned back to the store and bought more pet food for the man it was just bothering him jill gonsalves said it made him think how many people must struggle to do that jill said her husband was also worried that man was struggling to feed not only his pet but himself as owners of two large labrador retrievers the couple understands how expensive it can be to nourish pets they put a request out on facebook for a solution and told the story of the gentleman s inability to cover food costs and received hundreds of comments starting their journey of a charitable act for the community of pet owners how the acushnet pet food pantry started kanneth and jill gonsalves bought their current home in 2016 located at 95 wing road in acushnet previously owned by kenneth gonsalves grandfather his grandfather once owned and operated a farm stand on the large plot of farmland in the 1950s as his sole source of income for the past 20 years the couple continued the grandfather s tradition during farmer s market season that is until covid 19 hit and the couple took up a new use for the farm stand pet food pantry the acushnet pet food pantry is based on a take what you need leave what you can honor system after posting on social media and seeing another use for the farm stand the couple went out and bought a couple hundred dollars worth of pet food from wal mart bags of dry dog and cat food cans of wet food along with large rubbermaid clear totes for storage they labeled the totes and reopened the farm stand posted on social media and soon enough they received local recognition from a boston news station they also discovered a sweet note inside their mailbox we were really excited that somebody had actually used it jill gonsalves said shortly after they created a facebook page for the pantry and when they were featured on the news the next morning the account was flooded with messages jill gonsalves said that the first saturday it was open it was pouring rain but that didn t stop people showing up from town with bags of food donations instantly people really took to it jill gonsalves said i d come home to stacks of boxes from amazon and chewy at this point the food pantry hadn t posted an amazon wish list for the public community members were just picking out food on their own accord and dropping it off having it shipped or sending venmo donations between all of these contributions jill gonsalves said the pantry was full for a couple of months the couple set up a nonprofit to take it as far as we can take it it s been a really incredibly rewarding experience she said it s neat to hear from people all over the country massachusetts saying i m going to start something like this where i live the couple said their goal was to keep the type of food people are looking for in stock so they don t have to change a pet s food they shared the page to a buy nothing group on facebook where people post items they want to give away or are in need of for free and even a website for food pantries in the area jill gonsalves said while not many people will randomly leave items at the farm stand as the majority of donations come from online locals will call and ask to donate leftover food from pets who have recently passed away making it to the rachael ray show after opening the pantry in december 2020 local news outlets began to give it more publicity over the next few months in february 2021 kenneth gonsalves received a phone call from producers of the rachael ray show saying that segment coordinators found the couple and would like to run a story ray whose self named foundation focuses on charitable acts toward animals wanted to feature the gonsalves through a six week long process of phone interviews pitching to bosses the gonsalves filming their own video and photos due to covid 19 restrictions and finally a live zoom interview with ray the segment finally aired in the last week of april she was awesome to us jill gonsalves said recently the segment was run again and caused a stir on social media i didn t know about this place what an amazing community we live in the story of this place is so great it made rachel cry i am so excited to go donate food for our furry friends karee norton posted to the facebook group dartmouth helping dartmouth what you can do to continue to help the acushnet pet food pantry has created an amazon wish list of regularly stocked dry and wet animal food so there s no guessing in which food will be accepted in addition the wish list includes feeding bowls cat litter treats toys bones pet beds and even hay for rabbits guinea pigs hamsters gerbils and other small animals more after 7 months at the fairhaven shelter two shepherds have a place to call home after being featured on the rachael ray show the host donated food and a shed to store all contributions unfortunately due to covid 19 the shed was delayed so the couple currently operates the pantry out of their own home all of the attic basement entryway all filled with food jill gonsalves said like any other store or pantry however inventory is running low the hardest thing for us is cat litter jill gonsalves said it s expensive necessary and something that people don t consider as much when the pantry first opened it was much more cat owner focused but over the past couple of months the gonsalves have seen a shift and there seems to be an even split between dog and cat inventory you can view and shop the amazon wish list to help keep regular supply of food and litter check out the facebook page for more updates and announcements

during the past week the temperature dropped slightly but otherwise it has been a good start to the winter barley harvest samples have been coming off the combine down as low as 13 moisture and care had to be taken not to store bulk tonnage for too long due to the temperature of the grain usually that s because it is too wet we have been experiencing some very different weather climates over the past few years and last year for example was the third wettest fifth warmest and the eighth sunniest year since records began this year we have already seen some very different weather patterns around the world with extreme rain in parts of europe recently and ongoing drought in canada the us and also in other areas of europe in a normal year canada would account for around 60 of the global rapeseed trade but much of its canola crop is being decimated by dry conditions and output is now seen as below 15m tonnes with no relief forecast from the hot dry weather conversely widespread rain in the key australian production regions is helping crops there but that production will not be available until december onwards this means european oilseed rape crush plants will be concerned as to where their tonnage will come from before that oil world has reduced the german rapeseed crop potential once again and the polish crop yield could be 11 down on last month s estimates there are also weather issues in spain italy and the czech republic but better crops in bulgaria and romania could help to offset some of the losses eu rapeseed production is thought to be around 16 73m tonnes which would be 200 000 tonnes up on last year and most analysts think there will be a substantial rebuilding of global oilseed stocks in 2021 22 after two years of deficits with soyabean production leading the way the uk oilseed rape harvest is making progress in the south of england early yield reports suggest around 3 3 tonnes per ha and yields are expected to improve as harvest moves up to the northern regions and scotland oilseed rape was slow to ripen and at just 9 complete up to july 27 this was the second slowest start since 2014 as you can imagine with all that s happening around the globe rapeseed prices have been highly volatile and on one day earlier this week rose by 10 per tonne due to the weather concerns and future availability of the crop and the paris rapeseed futures market recently hit 450 per tonne the start of the winter barley harvest in england was about one week later than average but yields have so far been in line with expectations although quality has been mixed and bushel weights lower than average crop harvested up to july 27 according to the ahdb is averaging 6 6 7t ha which is matching the five year average of 6 8t ha in the week ending july 20 just 2 of the gb winter barley area had been cut but with recent good weather a week later 47 completion had been achieved the later harvest has affected feed barley and straw prices both of which were becoming scarce and stocks were low before harvest got underway after the start of harvest uk spot ex farm barley averaged 147 per tonne in the week ending july 22 and this was a drop of 33 per tonne from the week ending june 24 when stocks were tight similarly big square bale prices dropped 33 per tonne and are now quoted at 74 per tonne with a smaller than average carryover from crop 2020 due to the significant premium that old crop had to new crop there has been good demand for early barley from animal feed compounders and there was also some strong export demand at harvest also last year the uk produced its smallest wheat crop since 1981 at 9 7m tonnes and at the same time produced 8 1m tonnes of barley which was the largest since 1997 as a result barley delivered in the south of england in 2020 21 traded at an average discount of 40 per tonne and that was the largest discount in any ahdb survey since 2010 barley s discount to wheat is now around 17 18 but this is expected to reduce down to around 15 per tonne especially if wheat prices move lower for 2021 22 uk wheat production is estimated to increase year on year by 54 to 14 9m tonnes and barley production is estimated to decrease by 11 to 7 2m tonnes despite increased wheat production and reduced barley production the balance of supply looks set to swing marginally in favour of barley that s due to the relative tightness of opening stocks and going forward the large barley discount to wheat that we saw in 2020 21 will not be as big but should remain at a relatively hefty discount the malting barley market across europe remains firm as poor weather has interrupted harvest progress and the possibility of quality issues means farmers are not selling forward until they see the crop in the barns that said feed prices are firming and this this why malting prices are holding up well for now the us has delayed its decision as to how much ethanol and other biofuels must be blended into fuel and some refiners want to be exempt from the obligation to blend maize produced ethanol into fossil fuels if this were to happen it would reduce demand and have a negative effect on maize prices as more than a third of us maize output is currently used for this purpose maize weekly sales have been poor and due to order cancellations export sales were just 40 700 tonnes the lowest since july 2012 and the second worst on record there has also been a lack in demand from china recently compared to earlier in the year when they substantially supported the market china is expecting a 12m tonne increase in its own maize production due to a 2 7 increase in domestic planted area and this has seen us maize futures fall by 28 from may until now ending stocks for the 2021 22 global maize crop are forecast to increase by 4 year on year due to more production looking to the future china has 10 47m tonnes of maize on order to import but depending on its own production levels this could still be cancelled so far this marketing year from september 2020 to august 2021 us maize exports to china hit 18 14m tonnes with a further 5 1m tonnes of outstanding trade to export it is unlikely any new large forward sales will take place before the chinese crop has been harvested with some barley fields now harvested and the ground being prepared for its next winter crop fertiliser prices for spot and september ammonium nitrate prices have seen another 10 per tonne rise this reflects higher production costs as gas prices moved towards 1 per therm going into the last three months of this year and this price is up from 15p per therm in august last year india has confirmed a tender for 1 2m tonnes of urea with a reported 700 000 tonnes coming from china this has surprised the market given china s high production costs and could be a sign of a potential dip in global markets and there have been reports of urea prices dropping by 10 per tonne in other countries including south america however tight global stocks of urea could still keep the market at current price levels with more international buying expected soon the widely reported shortage of hgv drivers in the uk haulage industry is adding pressure on the fertiliser delivery chain and has also impacted on deliveries of soft fruit from scottish farms to the supermarkets this has resulted in fines for late delivery and is now becoming a bigger issue with lack of other produce on supermarket shelves as well uk liffee feed wheat futures have risen this past week due to weather the expected reduction in russian wheat production and concerns for a potentially record low us spring wheat crop november 2021 new crop wheat is up nearly 20 from a few weeks ago to 185 and may 2022 is up by around 15 to 187 50 per tonne the widely reported recent floods in germany have been estimated to have resulted in wheat production losses of between 150 000 200 000 tonnes in a year when germany was expected to produce around 23m tonnes hot dry weather in the us regions of north dakota and minnesota had seen wheat crop condition ratings fall to 11 good to excellent which is just one point above the worst condition rating on record in 1988 the area rated as poor to very poor increased to 63 up from 55 and this pushed us spring wheat futures to their highest level since november 2012 yields in the states are forecast to be 40 below the five year average and will have a serious impact on us end stocks canada cut its wheat crop by 500 000 tonnes down to 31 5m tonnes again to dry and parched soil conditions and some analysts forecast their tonnage at nearer 25 0m tonnes the increasing likelihood of crop losses for some of the world s primary wheat and maize producers saw markets gain 10 from last week s lows as of july 26 just 47 of the soft wheat in france had been cut compared to 67 last year and by july 19 ukraine has harvested 22 of its grain area including 50 of the barley area and 30 of wheat land overall yields in some areas might not be as bad as expected but quality will be an issue which will mean a higher availability of feed wheat and less milling wheat for export or domestic use total production of uk flour millers group1 and 2 varieties in gb could reach 6 4m tonnes which would be 63 up on last season and up 10 on 2019 2020 and this would suggest a reduced demand for imports of milling wheat but import demand will be as dependent on quality as it is on quantity farmers sitting on last year s wheat could still be able to maximise prices for old crop as the market looks to find stocks to supply

to sales multiple of 10 56x which looks reasonable considering the strong growth outlook xpev looks like a good electric vehicle stock to play the growth in the chinese ev industry 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider 3 nio nyse nio nio looks like another chinese electric vehicle stock worth considering in august the company is targeting the premium ev market in china and is also entering europe beginning with norway the company has the strategic backing of the chinese government which bailed it out last year when it was battling a survival crisis nio also provides battery swapping services which help lower the initial price for its vehicles the chinese electric vehicle maker delivered 7 931 evs in july which was below june and the company s deliveries were below that of li auto and xpeng motors nio is a bet on the premium electric vehicle market meanwhile nio s premium product positioning makes it an electric vehicle stock worth looking at earlier this year citi had upgraded the stock from a neutral to buy we upgrade nio to buy 1h from neutral 2h on 1 potential sector upgrade we lift our 2021e 25e china new energy vehicle passenger vehicle sales forecast to 2 52 7 84mn units 2 accelerating orders 3 upcoming catalysts said citi in its release while nio stock could be volatile in the short term it looks like a good electric vehicle stock to buy for the long term that said like other chinese companies listed on the us exchanges it finds itself at a crossroads amid the us china spat which has been further aggravated by china s tech crackdown which has resulted in massive losses for us investors 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider 4 ford motors nyse f when investors think of electric vehicle stocks they tend to overlook mainstream automakers meanwhile legacy automakers have seen a rerating this year and are outperforming the markets by a wide margin ford s second quarter earnings released last month had shattered estimates and it posted a surprise profit ford is also a play on the electric vehicle industry the company also raised its guidance and said that it expects pre tax profits between 9 10 billion in 2021 notably the company had lowered the guidance during the first quarter earnings call as it warned of bottlenecks from the chip shortage situation the company had then forecast that it would lose half of its second quarter production due to chip shortage meanwhile the situation did not turn out to be as dire as it had expected ford did better than expected leveraging strong demand to optimize revenue and profits through lower incentives and a favorable mix of vehicles which generated companywide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 1 1 billion the company said in its release ford also said that their mustang mach e is the second largest selling electric suv in the country it has received 120 000 preorders for its f 150 lightning the electric pickup that it launched earlier this year the company also said that three fourth of these bookings have come from customers who are new to ford while ford is not a pure play electric vehicle stock the company is investing heavily in electric vehicles and autonomous technology the stock trades at depressed multiples which are way below that of pureplay electric vehicle companies overall ford looks a good and cheap way to play the pivot towards electric vehicles 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider 5 general motors nyse gm general motors is another legacy automaker that is a play on the electric vehicle industry it is the first detroit automaker to commit itself to a zero emission future and intends to stop selling ice internal combustion engine cars by 2035 the company released its earnings earlier this week the stock fell despite posting better than expected earnings and raising its 2021 guidance deutsche bank sees the fall in gm stock after the earnings release as a buying opportunity we believe the run up to gm s scheduled for oct 6 7 could serve as a positive catalyst for the stock prompting investors to refocus on the company s strong positioning product technology and strategy in autos 2 0 said deutsche bank s emmanuel rosner he added while 2q results and 2021 guide came in soft we think 2q was impacted by one time warranty charges that will reverse and management set an easy bar for 2h assuming lower volume sequentially as a result of chip shortage gm looks a good electric vehicle stock to buy gm is investing heavily in electric vehicles and looks like a good way to play the story like ford it also trades at low valuations the company has several best selling models and their electric versions are expected to give it a foothold in the electric vehicle industry unlike some of the startup ev companies that are struggling with execution general motors has decades of production experience as well as a service network post sales service is something which has been troublesome even for tesla as was exemplified by a protesting customer at the shanghai auto show earlier this year gm should continue to see rerating as its electric vehicle plans unfold both ford and gm are very much in the electric vehicle race and would give a tough fight to pure play ev companies looking at the technicals gm has found support at the 200 day sma but is facing resistance at the 100 day and 50 day sma if the stock can rise above the 100 day and 200 day sma it would signal a further uptrend in the stock 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider

cemeteries are full of stories of lives lived at prarie river cemetery in centreville michigan a grave for an unknown boy tells of a life cut short the small stone marker reads simply unknown boy killed at wasepi and gives a death date of april 9 1916 wasepi is a small settlement once a railroad stop in central st joseph county a photo of the grave the image above is a stock image and not the actual grave marker was shared to the abandoned old and interesting places in michigan facebook group with the poster wondering of anyone knew the history of the incident at wasepi incredibly someone did turn up a death certificate for the boy he was believed to be a drifter and riding the rails he was aged 15 17 at the time of his death the certificate reveals a horrific end to his life stating evidently fell from a moving freight train on which he was stealing a ride after having been crushed between bumpers the train originated from chicago and that s where investigators at the time placed his city of birth commentors on the posting were quick to note that there was a family somewhere that never knew what happened to this lost boy sad that if he had family they would never know what became of him where was he going was he looking for work was he trying to get home to family i am glad that someone or the community gave him a marker find a grave has a listing for the unknown boy here the boy likely born in 1900 may very well have been christened with one of these very popular biblical names

methyltransferase inhibitor of ezh2 developed by epizyme that is approved by the u s food and drug administration fda for the treatment of certain patients with epithelioid sarcoma es and certain patients with follicular lymphoma fl it was approved under fda accelerated approval based on overall response rate orr and duration of response dor in january and june 2020 for es and fl respectively we are thrilled to be able to launch this collaboration designed to bring tazverik to patients in greater china and to have hutchmed participate in the global development of tazverik commented mr robert bazemore epizyme president and ceo hutchmed is an ideal partner for us in greater china given their development and commercial expertise and shared commitment to expanding the value of tazverik through new clinical trials that complement epizyme s development plans mr bazemore continued through this collaboration we anticipate tazverik to become the first ezh2 inhibitor brought to market in greater china and we believe the involvement of hutchmed in the global development of tazverik can allow for a more rapid resource efficient and geographically inclusive development plan for the u s confirmatory ezh 302 trial of tazverik in second line follicular lymphoma 2l fl in combination with revlimid plus rituximab r² we view the activity of tazverik and its epigenetic mechanism in controlling the expression of certain genes as highly complementary and potentially synergistic with our broad portfolio of novel oncology assets said mr christian hogg ceo of hutchmed tazverik s potential for broad applicability and favorable safety profile may provide further inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis when used in combination therapy this collaboration will accelerate the exploration of the clinical potential of ezh2 inhibition in multiple tumor types including both hematological malignancies and solid tumors we believe that epizyme and hutchmed are uniquely positioned

www hutch med com event please use participant access code 85770452 about epigenetics ezh2 its role in cancer and tazverik s complementary role with hutchmed s portfolio of drug candidates epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression without altering the sequence of the genes themselves ezh2 is one member of a class of histone methyltransferases hmts it catalyzes the methylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 h3k27 which controls expression of various genes and in turn plays a role in the normal physiology of many cell types dysregulation of ezh2 has been seen in a wide range of cancers and is associated with poor clinical prognosis and outcomes it is associated with follicular lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma b cell malignancies that are estimated to respectively account for approximately 17 and 32 of the estimated 544 000 new cases of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl worldwide in 2020 ezh2 dysregulation has been described in the five most common solid tumors breast lung colorectum prostate and stomach with an estimated combined incidence of over 1 million in 2020 globally tazverik inhibits ezh2 which allows transcription of genes involved in functions such as cell cycle control and terminal differentiation and thus tazverik action inhibits cancer cell proliferation this mechanism of action is highly complementary and potentially synergistic with hutchmed s portfolio of cancer drug candidates for solid tumors these include fruquintinib a highly selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and surufatinib a unique compound that inhibits angiogenesis and promotes the body s immune response against tumor cells for hematological malignancies these include many assets including inhibitors of the b cell signaling pathway such as the highly selective and potent pi3kδ inhibitor hmpl 689 the syk inhibitor hmpl 523 and third generation btk inhibitor hmpl 760 as well the idh1 2 inhibitor hmpl 306 the erk inhibitor hmpl 295 the fgfr inhibitor hmpl 453 and the cd47 antibody hmpl a83 the potential for broad applicability and favorable safety profile of tazverik may provide more effective inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis when used in combination therapy about tazverik tazemetostat tazverik is a methyltransferase inhibitor indicated in the united states for the treatment of adults and

the communications megatrend should help push these three stocks higher over the 2020s the rollout of 5g communications may seem overhyped but it s really a big deal not only will lightning fast low latency wireless communications become a new standard and speed up economic activity but 5g will also open the door to a host of new killer apps from virtual reality to highly automated factories and farms to other ways we may not have even contemplated yet the buildout of 5g is just beginning in earnest today with the first 5g iphone introduced one year ago yet because of the difficulty of 5g deployments the rollout will take a few years with the benefits kicking in gradually that s why the three companies leading this revolution t mobile tmus 0 13 taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsm 0 56 and micron technology mu 0 91 will see compounding benefits this decade even better each stock looks reasonably priced today t mobile has a two year lead in 5g deployment thanks to its 2020 acquisition of sprint and other smart spectrum investments over the years un carrier t mobile has a solid lead in 5g deployment in fact seven recent independent third party reports clarified that t mobile has the superior 5g network a big contrast from the 4g era when it was a laggard t mobile s stock didn t do much of anything after its latest earnings report strong net additions a beat on revenues and profits and raised guidance for the year were offset by news that dish network dish will move off t mobile s wholesale network for at t s t 1 23 that move will put a near term hole in t mobile s financials to the tune of over 500 million in revenue per year yet despite this small setback ceo mike sievert reiterated the company s impressive medium and long term guidance outlined in its analyst day back in march on the conference call with analysts the loss of dish will also free up capacity on t mobile s network which the company will turn around and aggressively market to its three main growth targets enterprises rural areas and home 5g broadband each of those segments represents a tremendous growth opportunity for the company t mobile plans to cover 200 million points of presence pops with its ultra capacity midband 5g spectrum by the end of 2021 a target competitors won t be able to reach until the end of 2023 and t mobile will continue to cement its lead with more capacity and 300 million midband pops by that time as more people get 5g phones and the capabilities of 5g become clearer it appears t mobile will continue to benefit from its lead the current consolidation in the stock therefore looks like a good opportunity to pick up shares in this 5g leader taiwan semiconductor manufacturing is also leading the pack in foundries the world s largest and most capable semiconductor foundry will also benefit handsomely in the 5g era 5g requires more advanced leading edge chips and taiwan semi now has a multiyear lead over rivals in pulling off the most exacting complicated semiconductor manufacturing processes since it pulled ahead of rival intel intc 0 17 on the leading edge several years ago tsm s stock has rallied however tsm s stock is actually down about 18 off its all time highs the culprit could be the massive spending plans announced by rivals samsung and intel which intend to catch up to tsm and build their own third party foundry capabilities over the next several years and while tsm posted strong 28 revenue growth last quarter margins slipped perhaps also dampening enthusiasm however tsm has announced its own 100 billion spending plan over the next three years to satisfy booming demand and cement its industry leading position the u s government is also subsidizing tsm to build capacity in arizona because of its clear manufacturing lead in addition margin compression was due to foreign exchange fluctuations plus the faster ramp up of the leading edge 5 nanometer node when a new node ramps its margins are lower but they expand as production matures so neither of the reasons for the margin compression are really causes for concern meanwhile the long term picture is exceptionally bullish management said it now expects to grow revenue at the high end of its 10 15 five year annualized growth rate and even that is probably conservative also encouraging ceo c c wei claimed that any sort of future semiconductor industry slowdown is likely to be less severe than in the past because of the dual 5g and artificial intelligence megatrends likely to grow every year this decade with the stock trading around 30 times earnings and with its 1 5 dividend sure to grow over the next five years and beyond now looks like a good time to add to this 5g leader micron introduces a dividend in a show of confidence finally all 5g phones networks and applications will require much more data and firepower than those of the 4g era that means an era of heightened demand both dram memory and nand flash storage as one of only three major dram producers and about six nand flash producers micron should be able to generate hefty profits in the 2020s the solid outlook for memory and storage recently encouraged micron to initiate a small dividend of 0 10 per quarter or about a 0 5 dividend yield at today s stock price that relatively small dividend may not seem like much but this pleasant surprise for investors could be pretty significant in terms of what it signals the memory industry has historically been prone to booms and busts but the initiation of a dividend shows confidence that micron will be able to generate solid profits through future cycles a stark contrast from the 2000s and 2010s management s confidence is due to the combination of improved demand for memory thanks to 5g ai and the internet of things meanwhile on the supply side industry consolidation has helped the remaining players focus on generating returns on investment rather than endless price and market share wars in addition under ceo sanjay mehrotra micron itself has greatly improved relative to its competitors introducing the industry s first 1 alpha dram node and first 176 layer nand flash chip during the past year the small dividend also still leaves plenty of cash left over for stock buybacks which the company will continue cfo david zinsner said the company will take a more opportunistic approach to buybacks conserving cash when the stock price is high but being more aggressive when it is low given the higher than normal volatility in micron s stock price which is nearly 20 below its recent all time highs that seems like a prudent strategy if management s sunny outlook is to be believed and memory cycles become more muted and profitable over time micron s shares look extremely cheap at just 7 6 times next year s earnings estimates if the strong semi market continues into 2022 those earnings estimates may end up being conservative too

remain constant rates and volumes are high labor is short and tech platforms hold the promise of customer satisfaction here are the earnings reports from the top fleets for the second quarter q2 this year figures shown within parenthesis represent a loss covenant sets records cuts cost by 3 cents per mile covenant transportation posted record setting numbers in q2 of 2021 with its highest ever

ability to build cash to 167 2 million at the end of the quarter without any debt on our balance sheet freight demand continued to be strong throughout the second quarter of 2021 and is expected to

freight demand we have increased wages and enhanced the compensation features for our drivers multiple times in the last nine months further we have continued to get more creative in providing better pay benefits equipment and facilities for our drivers while this same employment challenge is facing many businesses in america today we believe it is more pronounced within our industry given that we

first quarter by over 12 percent the second largest first quarter to second quarter increase in over 10 years this outperformance was particularly impressive considering we were following an already

investors were interested in buying its plant in kosice eastern slovakia having entered the slovak market in 2000 us steel kosice is slovakia s biggest employer providing 13 000 jobs afp photo samuel kubani photo credit should read samuel kubani afp via getty images afp via getty images u s steel corp stock nyse x has seen a formidable rise of over 50 in the last six months and currently trades at a little over 25 per share the impressive rally over the last couple of months was driven by the recovery in steel prices the lifting of lockdowns over recent months and the successful vaccine rollout has led to expectations of healthy growth in shipments in 2021 and 2022 as demand gets back on track and supply constraints are reduced also stimulus packages and spending on infrastructure is likely to lead to increased demand additionally the u s raw steel capacity utilization for the week ending 31st july 2021 was 85 which is significantly higher than the 60 recorded in the prior year period this is also a marked improvement over the 51 utilization in the beginning of may 2020 which indicates that there are signs of a strong rebound in activity in the steel sector but will u s steel s stock continue its upward trajectory over the coming weeks or is a correction in the stock more likely according to the trefis machine learning engine which identifies trends in a company s stock price data for the last ten years returns for x stock average close to 0 in the next one month 21 trading days period i e the stock is likely to remain flat in the next one month after experiencing a 50 rise over the previous six month 126 trading days period also there is a 46 probability that the stock will give a positive return in the next one month but how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding x stock for a shorter or a longer time period you can test the answer and many other combinations on the trefis machine learning engine to test x stock chances of a rise after a fall and vice versa you can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter month or even just one day machine learning engine try it yourself if x stock moved by 5 over five trading days then over the next 21 trading days x stock moves an average of about 1 percent also there is a 48 chance that the stock will give positive return in the next one month following a 5 drop over the previous week average return trefis some fun scenarios faqs making sense of x stock movements question 1 is the average return for united states steel stock higher after a drop answer consider two situations case 1 united states steel stock drops by 5 or more in a week case 2 united states steel stock rises by 5 or more in a week is the average return for united states steel stock higher over the subsequent month after case 1 or case 2 x stock fares better after case 2 with an average return of 1 over the next month 21 trading days under case 1 where the stock has just suffered a 5 loss over the previous week versus an average return of 3 2 for case 2 in comparison the s p 500 has an average return of 3 1 over the next 21 trading days under case 1 and an average return of just 0 5 for case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the average return for the s p 500 after a fall or rise try the trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how united states steel stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period question 2 does patience pay answer if you buy and hold united states steel stock the expectation is over time the near term fluctuations will cancel out and the long term positive trend will favor you at least if the company is otherwise strong overall according to data and trefis machine learning engine s calculations patience absolutely pays for most stocks for x stock the returns over the next n days after a 5 change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below along with the returns for the s p500 average return trefis question 3 what about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while answer the average return after a rise is understandably lower than after a fall as detailed in the previous question interestingly though if a stock has gained over the last few days you would do better to avoid short term bets for most stocks although x stock appears to be an exception to this general observation x s returns over the next n days after a 5 change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below along with the returns for the s p500 average return trefis it s pretty powerful to test the trend for yourself for united states steel stock by changing the inputs in the charts above what if you re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead

against last year s retailer driven stock in additionally cooler and wetter weather in may across many parts of the u s negatively impacted seasonal traffic in the otc channel the global seresto brand remains on track toward full year revenue expectations the global farm animal business contributed approximately one third of the upside versus the midpoint of second quarter guidance driven by continued improvement in u s cattle and swine and to a lesser extent by customer orders for aqua products shifting into the second quarter from the third quarter outside the u s farm animal was impacted by re emerging african swine fever headwinds and sharply lower hog prices in china as well as continued challenges in international poultry due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and reduced consumption driven by the global pandemic the company s full year outlook assumes a gradual recovery in chinese hog prices and further industry improvement in international poultry and aqua innovation launches and approvals innovation is expected to drive elanco s long term growth algorithm with an anticipated two to three percentage point contribution to overall average annual revenue growth seven of the planned eight launches for 2021 have occurred in the first half of the year with eight approvals achieved year to date highlights include credelio plus exceeding expectations in japan and europe and scheduled to launch in australia in the third quarter of 2021 enhancing our highly competitive parasiticide portfolio in international markets experior making important strides toward achieving packer ecosystem integration with seven packers now accepting the product compared to one at the end of the first quarter and continued potential for blockbuster status over time revenue contribution from the three pet health launches is running ahead of expectations while farm animal contribution is on track with the exception of one externally sourced poultry product zoashield is facing greater than anticipated market supply of the leading competitive product consequently elanco now anticipates the eight total products launching in 2021 to contribute 65 million to 85 million in revenue during the year this revision does not alter the company s previously stated innovation revenue expectation of 600 million to 700 million by 2025 reflecting an additional 100 million with the announcement of the kindredbio acquisition operational efficiencies elanco continues to make progress toward the company s investor day commitment to deliver on 300 million in cost efficiencies by the end of 2023 including 160 million to 175 million of cumulative synergies to be achieved in 2021 in june 2021 elanco announced actions to further optimize its manufacturing footprint following the acquisition of bayer animal health elanco evaluated how to best allocate its manufacturing efforts to ensure efficient reliable quality supply for customers as a result elanco has entered into an agreement with connecticut based trirx pharmaceuticals a global contract manufacturer for the sale of the company s sites in shawnee kansas and speke united kingdom the sale of the shawnee facility occurred on august 1 2021 and elanco expects to close on the sale of the speke facility by early 2022 with these sales to trirx elanco now expects its adjusted gross margin efforts to reach 60 percent by 2023 these changes also reduce annual capital expenditures by 25 million to 30 million which more than offsets an operating income reduction of approximately 5 million from third party contract manufacturing activities associated with the sites furthermore elanco anticipates an improvement in working capital as approximately 75 million to 85 million of inventory on the company s balance sheet will exit as part of these transactions elanco will additionally cease operations of its regional manufacturing site in belford roxo brazil working capital and balance sheet in the

percent for the quarter driven by the addition of bayer animal health product revenue of 348 million legacy elanco revenue increased 32 percent in the quarter driven by a favorable comparison to the prior year period which included actions taken across brands to reduce channel inventory levels as well as reduced demand for veterinary products as a result of the pandemic primarily in u s vaccines and international markets and in the current period higher underlying volume trends from newer generation parasiticide and pain products and price growth led by u s vaccines farm animal revenue increased 79 percent for the quarter driven by the addition of bayer animal health product revenue of 157 million legacy elanco revenue increased 30 percent in the quarter driven by a favorable comparison to the prior year period which included lower levels of demand due to the impact of the pandemic on global protein markets the unwind of anticipatory buying by direct customers in international export markets actions taken across brands to reduce channel inventory levels and increased demand in china partly offset in the current period by lower levels of demand in certain

updating its full year 2021 guidance for revenue eps and adjusted ebitda which was most recently addressed on june 16 2021 with the kindredbio acquisition announcement the company s raised revenue guidance reflects a balanced approach including strong momentum to exit the second quarter seasonality in elanco s higher margin parasiticide products likely moderation in pandemic driven pet health tailwinds in the vet clinic ongoing competitive dynamics and strength in elanco s broad based durable portfolio the 15 million increase in the midpoint of full year revenue guidance is primarily driven by the 39 million overperformance compared to the midpoint of second quarter of 2021 guidance partly offset by the phasing of certain aqua orders and the 15 million reduction of expected innovation revenue contribution from zoashield in the second half of 2021 the full year 2021 guidance for reported eps includes a write down of 0 46 per share from the exit of the three manufacturing sites announced on june 9 2021 with no impact on adjusted eps guidance compared to the previous expectation of 0 43 to 0 54 for these exits guidance also includes the operating costs associated with the kindredbio acquisition anticipated to be dilutive to elanco s reported and adjusted eps in 2021 by approximately 0 02 the updated adjusted eps range includes the 0 04 outperformance compared to the midpoint of second quarter of 2021 guidance offset by two items in the second half of 2021 1 increased logistics costs and inflationary pressure with an anticipated impact of approximately 0 03 and 2 the reduced revenue forecast for zoashield with expected impact of 0 02 with respect to the kindredbio acquisition elanco expects the transaction to close in august 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including approval by kindredbio s shareholders the hart scott rodino hsr waiting period relating to the transaction expired on july 30 2021 the full year 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance represents a 20 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our may guidance the company s 29 million outperformance compared to the midpoint of second quarter of 2021 guidance is expected to be more than offset by increased logistics costs and inflationary pressure reduced zoashield revenue operating costs associated with the kindredbio acquisition and a reduction in depreciation add

an ongoing solo exhibition in lagos featuring recent installations by british born leading nigerian artist ndidi dike addresses issues bordering on the general lack of preparedness during the pandemic and the concurrent upheavals swirling around the excrescences of materialism okechukwu uwaezuoke reports a mixed media installation holds court somewhere beyond the exhibition hall s entrance way it is at first glance visually overwhelming sooner than later a momentary fog of incomprehension clears up as it becomes more and more coherent and intelligible an extensive panoramic polyptych composed of monochrome archival images and photographs taken by the artist from lagos markets almost forms a quadrilateral enclosure around a cluster of 3 d arrangements of detached auto parts in the form of totem poles and an assortment of flesh tone fibreglass face masks suspended on metal spikes also courting the viewer s attention from its position amid this cluster stands a horned ikenga sculpture as a symbol of igbo man s aspiration for individual success and penchant for upward mobility this installation titled panoramic meditation on trade capitalism and dispossession bears the hallmarks of ndidi dike s resourcefulness and diligence like the others adorning the exhibition hall of the eko hotel and suites victoria island based art twenty one gallery the work was produced between 2020 and 2021 according to dike it uses the panoramic format to suggest the passage of time and a macro perspective on the centrality of marketplaces to african lifeworlds both historically and in the present indeed the british born leading nigerian female artist is right about the continent taking the cake as the global north s dumping ground and the site for the unscrupulous plundering of natural resources yet beneath this apparent fixation of the african on marketplaces lurks the will to survive and a commendable resilience that ultimately evolves into the informal economy as part of an ongoing exhibition titled working through an impasse the installation joins forces with the rest in the hall to proclaim dike s new formal and technical approaches to problems that remain unresolved talking about the exhibition which opened on saturday july 17 and ends sometime in september it is the first solo exhibition by the 1984 university of nigeria nsukka graduate since 2016 she had intended to hold this career defining show sometime in early 2020 at the time i envisioned titling the show intersections and realities of an aesthetic vocabulary as the title suggests i was really thinking about ways to tie together and develop conceptual and material ideas found in my past work engagements with the aesthetics of marketplaces assemblage globalisation the politics of the global south and the ever changing realities of world trade but then the covid 19 pandemic with the ensuing federal government imposed lockdowns forced her into an interregnum of introspection that led to a reexamination of what it means to be an artist in times of distress a glance at her surroundings and keeping abreast with the incredible happenings on the international scene convinced her to recalibrate her ideas for the show for the pandemic as the ultimate leveller has exposed the feet of clay of the proud edifice of global capitalism at the beginning of my sequestered lockdown in mid march 2020 when ordinary life in nigeria and other parts of the world was on pause i found myself going off on tangents my mind racing in so many directions she recalls i went into a deep freeze of sorts a reflective mode and period of anxiety about my future as a full time artist what s more i found myself overly concerned about the social economic and political impact of the virus on nigeria my country with its population of 200 million plus people of course it was not unexpected that these government imposed measures against the pandemic unleashed untold hardship on a greater percentage of nigerians for most people frequent power outages living in cramped hovels called face me i face you dependence on meagre daily incomes for survival and visiting crowded markets are daily realities which make adherence to social distancing impossible beyond these other concerns are bordering on racial and political upheavals against inequalities these are what dike considers the impasse that she has to work through thus she conceived the art installations in this exhibition which she sees as the unending process of working through the realities that challenge our dream of a full and healthy life replete with care kindness and collective joy but a full and healthy life replete with care kindness and collective joy will remain elusive so long as the spectre of unfulfilled promises of modern sanitation infrastructures continues to haunt nigeria hence another mixed media installation titled the luxury of distance between empathy and apathy expresses the metaphor of the unfulfilled promises of the 60s and 70s seven spotless white washbasins each containing shiny gold appropriated water taps on white cuboid plinths are positioned in grids marked out with white tape on the gallery s floor to evoke social distancing guidelines suspended above all this are clusters of gold sprayed bottles of hand sanitiser i conceived the overall installation in order to raise questions about the efficacy of social distancing practices in the global south the scarcity of sanitation resources and the inadequacies of local governance to ensure the health and safety of the nation dike says about this work yet another mixed media installation titled the reckoning evokes the violence unleashed on black people in the us and elsewhere in the world hundreds of batons typically used by policemen are placed in single slots within a large grid structure while they obviously symbolise police brutality they also represent the bodies of their black victims slotted into dark cold refrigerators of morgues many of these batons bear tags with the names of nigerian and black american victims whose deaths in recent years led to the blacklivesmatter and endsars protests the work according to the artist was partly inspired by the comments by professor wole soyinka while responding to the racial upheavals in the usa on june 10 2020 the nobel laureate was reported to have drawn parallels between the kind of dehumanisation of black peoples going on in the united states and the sort of dehumanisation on our own soil by our own people whether it s by leadership whether it s by the military whether it s by the police or whether it s by any kind of institution of state or private enterprise still revolving around dike s musings on these troubling times are other mixed mixed media installations like a kindred lament to quarantine taking stock building blocks of desire and consumption residues of provoked dissent i iv ashes beyond and a series of four untitled mixed media paintings in monochrome colours of white red blue and yellow ochre interestingly this exhibition burnishes dike s credentials as a versatile artist who expresses herself through painting sculpture collage lens based media video and 3 d installations as the widely exhibited artist sets her sights on new creative courses her renown for totem poles ebbs away from the industry s consciousness

by marilisa barbieri a high net worth individual hnwi is somebody with around 1 million in liquid financial assets according to the a high net worth individual hnwi is somebody with around 1 million in liquid financial assets according to the 2021 world wealth report north america surpassed asia pacific to become the 2020 leader in both hnwi population and wealth the city with the highest number of millionaires is new york city with nearly one million millionaires i have more than a decade s worth of experience in the luxury design industry building relationships with affluent clients across north america and in nyc during this time i discovered eight traits my clients all have in common 1 they spend time with impressive people i noticed all my clients surround themselves with people who energize and support them they have a powerful network lifting them higher they make it a priority to spend more time with people who are driven and like minded it s rightly said your future depends on whom you spend the most time with if you spend most of your time with people that have no ambitions you will also never achieve your goals if you spend most of your time with those who are goal oriented and work hard to achieve their goals you ll be captivated by their energy and be positively influenced remind yourself to spend time with the right people related how do wealthy people get away with not paying their fair share of taxes 2 they detach emotion from the business during business negotiations my clients are intentionally objective they are aware of their emotions and how displayed emotion may be perceived if they don t feel 100 percent comfortable in the negotiation they take their time or ask a third party to negotiate for them during business negotiations my clients are intentionally objective they are aware of their emotions and how displayed emotion may be perceived if they don t feel 100 percent comfortable in the negotiation they take their time or ask a third party to negotiate for them emotions cannot be eliminated from negotiations however they can be acknowledged both in ourselves and in others one of the best ways to train your mind to detach your emotional self from business is to do it deliberately once you ve decided this is the path you want to take try to be as objective as possible 3 they are efficient with their time the 1 percent consider every minute precious and they don t waste it doing something that doesn t add any value to their lives time is the ultimate luxury and high net worth individuals are very selective when it comes to deciding where and with whom to spend their time time management plays an important role in our day to day lives and even educating ourselves with basic time management tips can do wonders 4 they see fear as an opportunity one thing that always strikes me is how my clients deal with the uncertainty of their new ventures they mastered a way to manage stress and unpredictability in their unconventional choices they achieved such a level of self confidence by seeing fear as an opportunity for personal growth either they win or they learn opportunities are everywhere but you need to grab them without fear most people don t take action because they have fear of losing even if you fail you learn something in the end every opportunity comes with an upside and very few downsides related you ve actually never failed at anything here s why believing in your failure controls your relationship with money 5 they know how to commit individuals belonging to 1 percent make their reputation a priority they do what they say they are consistent act with integrity help others achieve their goals and go a step beyond what is expected individuals belonging to 1 percent make their reputation a priority they do what they say they are consistent act with integrity help others achieve their goals and go a step beyond what is expected committing is easy but fulfilling commitment is not everybody s cup of tea build trust and preserve your reputation by under promising and over delivering 6 they worry about themselves worrying about yourself is a big job and the affluent know that no one else can effectively do it for them they care about others and worry for and with them but in the end they are aware that worrying about others can t solve their problems knowing how to worry about yourself and not others is not about selfishness it s about helpfulness it s about observing the rules of self containment taking responsibility for yourself and working to solve your problems while knowing how to be happy for others successes growing yourself cultivates strength and resilience and inspires others to do the same 7 they embrace failure the wealthy know how to embrace success as well as failure they accept the situation and themselves as a part of life failure is an opportunity for growth but it is not a measure of their future or self worth if they want to improve their business then embracing failure is the goal even if the process is slow failure generates motivation creativity and resilience the more often we navigate failure successfully the stronger and more resilient we become challenge yourself stop avoiding the word failure embrace the phrase fail fast and be a culture change leader 8 they value education the truth is that anyone who is part of the 1 percent not only values education but is also a lifelong learner being a lifelong learner helps them understand the world they live in provides them with more and better opportunities and improves the quality of their life it is a deliberate and voluntary choice not a chore most people are unable to enter the niche because they undervalue the power of self education they think that getting some degree will be sufficient to be successful but it s not like that self initiated education focuses on personal development and offers many long term benefits including improved self confidence renewed self motivation and the building of new skills

expected impacts of quarter over quarter working capital changes largely driven by an increase in inventory levels during the year we ve invested in inventory to ensure we can maintain high service levels through the first quarter of fiscal 2022 which is peak battery selling season in addition we have taken a proactive approach to invest in incremental safety stock given the continued volatility of the global supply network including uncertainty around product sourcing transportation challenges and labor availability in addition to the working capital changes the prior year s first quarter

0 times as of june 30 2021 the company intends to enter into a 75 0 million accelerated share repurchase asr program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 which based on the august 6 2021 closing price

repurchases using available cash on hand and revolver borrowings and anticipates that the asr program will be completed before the end of the calendar year 2021 any repurchases will occur under the board of directors existing november 2020 repurchase authorization financial outlook and assumptions for fiscal year 2021 1 we are updating our full year fiscal 2021 outlook for the following key metrics net sales growth is now expected to be between 8 to 9 attributed to distribution gains elevated demand and favorable currency impacts adjusted gross margin rate is expected to decrease 80 to 110 basis points on a year over year basis as inflationary cost pressures continue to increase additional productivity management efforts synergies and the impacts of favorable currency are expected to help offset some of the increased operational costs adjusted free cash flow is now expected to exceed 225 million as noted above this is a result of our investment in inventory to support the upcoming peak battery season and to ensure we maintain high service levels for our customers we believe the steps we are taking to make these investments are prudent given the potential disruptions which continue to persist in the global supply network we view this investment as short term in nature and expect our inventory balances to normalize in 2022 we are maintaining our previously

mould investment director at aj bell hotter than expected inflation data has given the federal reserve yet another reason to sit on its hands and kick the prospect of a rate cut further down the road the signs have been clear to see for a while and investors are now having to readjust their expectations for when we will finally see the much desired pivot in monetary policy hopes for a june interest rate cut were almost crushed on wednesday after some hotter than expected data paired with the latest us federal reserve minutes according to the bureau of labor statistics the year on year

take on a notably more dovish tone that could set us up for a rate hike in june eurozone rates are significantly lower than many of their global counterparts but that looks unlikely to stifle any calls to further wide gap between us and eurozone rates the relative importance of the beleaguered manufacturing sector has been one of the major hurdles faced by the eurozone and investors will be

here s how to course correct your tdf strategy eight in 10 401 k savers are invested in target date funds tdfs that s according to vanguard s how america saves 2021 report an in depth look at 401 k plans and how u s workers are preparing for retirement the growing popularity of tdfs isn t surprising more 401 k plans are adopting automatic enrollment which selects tdfs for plan participants by default tdfs are also easy to own relative to other securities they maintain a defined asset mix that gradually gets more conservative over time if you trust the tdf strategy you don t need to do much the fund is positioned for growth in your younger years and then capital preservation as you near retirement still tdfs aren t infallible you can easily end up in the wrong one which will make it harder to reach your retirement goals here are four ways your tdf investment can fall short and how to avoid them 1 the tdf is too aggressive the common advice is to choose the tdf that aligns with your expected retirement year this is the simplest approach but it could leave you with more risk than you want every tdf has a plan called the glide path for shifting fund assets from aggressive to conservative over time these plans generally fall into one of two categories to glide paths and through glide paths a to glide path reaches its most conservative asset mix in the target year this insulates you from market volatility thereafter but also limits your growth a through glide path reaches its most conservative mix some time after the target year this gives you more growth opportunity later in life but could create more volatility than you want the to and through formats are both valid what s important is that you know which one you own a bad surprise can happen when you think you have a to fund and you re really invested in a through fund in that scenario you d expect stability from your 401 k in your retirement year if you instead face more volatility than expected you could end up in a difficult situation avoid this fate by reviewing the glide path for your tdf and make sure it aligns with your risk tolerance and expectations if the fund looks too aggressive for example switch to an earlier target year 2 the tdf no longer matches your retirement timeline you may have looked over your tdf s strategy ages ago if your retirement timeline has changed since then it s time for a check in say you ve delayed your scheduled retirement by five years thinking you d use the time to fatten your savings balance a conservative to tdf isn t likely to offer strong returns during your five year delay if you can tolerate additional risk you may prefer a fund that s geared for moderate growth in those final working years plan on reviewing your tdf periodically if the fund no longer aligns with your retirement timeline and goals you ll want to know quickly so you can make the necessary changes 3 the tdf has high fees tdfs like all mutual funds pass along their operating expenses to shareholders these expenses are quoted to you as the fund s expense ratio expense ratios cut into the fund s investment returns for that reason it s best to keep them as low as possible a low expense ratio provides an easier path to competitive returns for shareholders a morningstar report pegs the 2018 average expense ratio for tdfs at 0 62 if your fund s expense ratio is higher you might want to adjust your retirement strategy the options you have are formally request lower fee funds from your 401 k administrator this may not go anywhere but it doesn t hurt to ask after you max out your employer match send excess contributions to your ira you ll have a broader range of investment options in that account see the next point below for tips on owning other assets alongside your tdf consider shifting to an index fund strategy if you re willing to monitor your asset allocation index funds typically have very low expense ratios 4 the tdf doesn t fit with other retirement assets a tdf s asset mix is designed to align with your retirement timeline if you hold a tdf alongside other securities your overall asset mix will differ from the tdf s for example a tdf and an s p 500 index fund together would provide greater stock exposure and probably more risk than you may want the solution is to build your retirement portfolio with a single tdf that can be challenging though if you have retirement funds in multiple accounts the tdf in your 401 k may not be available in your ira or vice versa in that case you have two options look for similar tdfs compare glide paths and pair up funds that have parallel strategies replicate the tdf s asset mix with index funds if your 401 k tdf holds 65 stocks and 35 bonds today build the same exposure in your ira with index funds then adjust the mix in your ira annually so it remains aligned with your tdf retirement success with tdfs tdfs are low maintenance but they re not maintenance free to get the most from a tdf you should do some research upfront reevaluate your timeline periodically and be strategic about choosing other assets in your retirement portfolio these are manageable action items that can keep risk in check and support better returns long term that should streamline your journey to reaching your retirement savings goals
the communications megatrend should help push these three stocks higher over the 2020s the rollout of 5g communications may seem overhyped but it s really a big deal not only will lightning fast low latency wireless communications become a new standard and speed up economic activity but 5g will also open the door to a host of new killer apps from virtual reality to highly automated factories and farms to other ways we may not have even contemplated yet the buildout of 5g is just beginning in earnest today with the first 5g iphone introduced one year ago yet because of the difficulty of 5g deployments the rollout will take a few years with the benefits kicking in gradually that s why the three companies leading this revolution t mobile tmus 0 13 taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsm 0 56 and micron technology mu 0 91 will see compounding benefits this decade even better each stock looks reasonably priced today t mobile has a two year lead in 5g deployment thanks to its 2020 acquisition of sprint and other smart spectrum investments over the years un carrier t mobile has a solid lead in 5g deployment in fact seven recent independent third party reports clarified that t mobile has the superior 5g network a big contrast from the 4g era when it was a laggard t mobile s stock didn t do much of anything after its latest earnings report strong net additions a beat on revenues and profits and raised guidance for the year were offset by news that dish network dish will move off t mobile s wholesale network for at t s t 1 23 that move will put a near term hole in t mobile s financials to the tune of over 500 million in revenue per year yet despite this small setback ceo mike sievert reiterated the company s impressive medium and long term guidance outlined in its analyst day back in march on the conference call with analysts the loss of dish will also free up capacity on t mobile s network which the company will turn around and aggressively market to its three main growth targets enterprises rural areas and home 5g broadband each of those segments represents a tremendous growth opportunity for the company t mobile plans to cover 200 million points of presence pops with its ultra capacity midband 5g spectrum by the end of 2021 a target competitors won t be able to reach until the end of 2023 and t mobile will continue to cement its lead with more capacity and 300 million midband pops by that time as more people get 5g phones and the capabilities of 5g become clearer it appears t mobile will continue to benefit from its lead the current consolidation in the stock therefore looks like a good opportunity to pick up shares in this 5g leader taiwan semiconductor manufacturing is also leading the pack in foundries the world s largest and most capable semiconductor foundry will also benefit handsomely in the 5g era 5g requires more advanced leading edge chips and taiwan semi now has a multiyear lead over rivals in pulling off the most exacting complicated semiconductor manufacturing processes since it pulled ahead of rival intel intc 0 17 on the leading edge several years ago tsm s stock has rallied however tsm s stock is actually down about 18 off its all time highs the culprit could be the massive spending plans announced by rivals samsung and intel which intend to catch up to tsm and build their own third party foundry capabilities over the next several years and while tsm posted strong 28 revenue growth last quarter margins slipped perhaps also dampening enthusiasm however tsm has announced its own 100 billion spending plan over the next three years to satisfy booming demand and cement its industry leading position the u s government is also subsidizing tsm to build capacity in arizona because of its clear manufacturing lead in addition margin compression was due to foreign exchange fluctuations plus the faster ramp up of the leading edge 5 nanometer node when a new node ramps its margins are lower but they expand as production matures so neither of the reasons for the margin compression are really causes for concern meanwhile the long term picture is exceptionally bullish management said it now expects to grow revenue at the high end of its 10 15 five year annualized growth rate and even that is probably conservative also encouraging ceo c c wei claimed that any sort of future semiconductor industry slowdown is likely to be less severe than in the past because of the dual 5g and artificial intelligence megatrends likely to grow every year this decade with the stock trading around 30 times earnings and with its 1 5 dividend sure to grow over the next five years and beyond now looks like a good time to add to this 5g leader micron introduces a dividend in a show of confidence finally all 5g phones networks and applications will require much more data and firepower than those of the 4g era that means an era of heightened demand both dram memory and nand flash storage as one of only three major dram producers and about six nand flash producers micron should be able to generate hefty profits in the 2020s the solid outlook for memory and storage recently encouraged micron to initiate a small dividend of 0 10 per quarter or about a 0 5 dividend yield at today s stock price that relatively small dividend may not seem like much but this pleasant surprise for investors could be pretty significant in terms of what it signals the memory industry has historically been prone to booms and busts but the initiation of a dividend shows confidence that micron will be able to generate solid profits through future cycles a stark contrast from the 2000s and 2010s management s confidence is due to the combination of improved demand for memory thanks to 5g ai and the internet of things meanwhile on the supply side industry consolidation has helped the remaining players focus on generating returns on investment rather than endless price and market share wars in addition under ceo sanjay mehrotra micron itself has greatly improved relative to its competitors introducing the industry s first 1 alpha dram node and first 176 layer nand flash chip during the past year the small dividend also still leaves plenty of cash left over for stock buybacks which the company will continue cfo david zinsner said the company will take a more opportunistic approach to buybacks conserving cash when the stock price is high but being more aggressive when it is low given the higher than normal volatility in micron s stock price which is nearly 20 below its recent all time highs that seems like a prudent strategy if management s sunny outlook is to be believed and memory cycles become more muted and profitable over time micron s shares look extremely cheap at just 7 6 times next year s earnings estimates if the strong semi market continues into 2022 those earnings estimates may end up being conservative too

jeff knox jknox dailyherald com members of the automobile mechanics local 701 on strike friday outside of pugi hyundai on ogden avenue in downers grove after weeks of vacant showrooms suburban auto dealers have adjusted to telling consumers there is a scarcity of new cars courtesy of a microchip shortage courtesy of the covid 19 pandemic you keep calm and sell on or at least take new car orders from customers for delivery later what else could go wrong well on aug 2 auto mechanics hit the picket line at 56 chicago area dealerships following a contract dispute between the international association of machinists and aerospace workers local 701 and the new car dealers committee ncdc we got our auto show in at least said chicago auto trade association president dave sloan referring to an abbreviated chicago auto show held in mid july the strike is just 56 of 400 dealers in the region so it s a fraction but it s still important and it s frustrating because for the last six months we ve been working as a team with the union to pass legislation regarding reimbursements for warranty work from automakers sloan said dealerships affected range from max madsen s aurora mitsubishi to arlington heights buick to oakbrook toyota in westmont pickets outside in the heat at numerous dealerships along ogden avenue in dupage county agreed on one thing the situation is frustrating everybody would rather be inside working former mechanic and local 701 spokesman ronnie gonzalez said it costs everybody to be on strike but it would cost a lot more to take an unacceptable contract that s detrimental to our future union officials say sticking points in the contract offered by ncdc include language that gives dealers the ability to reduce mechanics pay an insufficient balance in the health and welfare fund and a section letting owners cherry pick provisions in other labor contracts favorable to management and implement them striking workers employed by the 56 dealers are a subgroup of other mechanics local 701 represents the car dealers group countered their proposal included significant wage and benefit increases and language that allows dealerships to more cost effectively service customers and ensure that dealers and their service techs are not put at a competitive disadvantage by contracts the union may make with other dealers in the future in summer 2017 a similar strike that lasted for nearly eight weeks led to delays for customers seeking to get their cars fixed neither side predicted when the mechanics will return to work this time diesel mechanic robert filas eyes lit up as he described his typical day troubleshooting everything from ambulances to dump trucks instead of picketing outside packey webb ford in downers grove anytime you have to step up on something to see the engine it s a whole different ballgame filas explained i have a lot of steady customers that come in to see me because they trust me with their vehicle but it s rewarding i m happy when i go home at night you should know meanwhile automakers faced a dearth of semiconductor chips this year after they cut orders from suppliers in 2020 when the pandemic spiraled but many homebound consumers filled the gap by buying computers and other electronics causing a supply disconnect it s been absolutely dreadful said greg webb of packey webb ford usually i have about 300 to 350 new vehicles sitting on the ground now it s about 15 we re selling them literally as they get off the transport trucks in a meeting with ford last week the manufacturer was telling us that it s really going to be closer to jan 1 before we get to a point where we have our normal on the ground stock webb does expect vehicle shipments to improve each month and in the meantime customers are learning a new old trick ordering cars sloan added when i was growing up my dad who worked for ford always ordered our cars the day it was delivered was a big day gridlock alert lake county drivers should prepare for delays from intermittent lane closures at the intersection of routes 45 and 173 in antioch township as idot crews rebuild pavement and install new traffic signals work should wrap up in summer 2022 one more thing how can a tri state tollway i 294 project affect traffic on the jane addams tollway i 90 when massive steel beams that will hold up the new southbound i 294 mile long bridge are being carted on i 90 the beams will be moving east on i 90 and south on i 294 to the construction site between 4 a m and noon this week no joy in strike auto mechanics say mechanics strike drags on but some cutting solo deals with union plenty to see and test drive at chicago auto show as dealers grapple with lean inventories
the company s executives have repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered there are lots of mistakes that corporate executives can make one of the most problematic is overpromising and underdelivering this blunder can lead to an erosion of credibility novavax nvax 0 35 ceo stan erck and his leadership team face this very issue right now the company has maintained for a while now that it planned to file for u s emergency use authorization eua of its covid 19 vaccine candidate nvx cov2373 in the third quarter of 2021 however novavax announced last thursday in its second quarter update that its eua submission in the u s will be pushed back into q4 the vaccine stock sank on friday following the news is novavax still a buy with its management s credibility crumbling delay after delay one case of overpromising and underdelivering usually isn t a cause for serious concern unfortunately novavax s executives have now established a pattern in february erck stated that the company expected to file for u s eua of its covid 19 vaccine candidate in the early second quarter and that it could be available in the u s by may his timing assumed that the u s food and drug administration fda would accept a submission based on u k clinical study data however erck acknowledged that the fda might require novavax to use its u s clinical study data for an eua filing he said on march 1 2021 that in this scenario a u s submission could be pushed back to mid summer by may novavax had revised its forecast the company stated in its q1 update that a u s eua filing was expected in the third quarter investors continued to look for a q3 submission until the latest delay announced last week still some uncertainty erck said in novavax s q2 conference call that he believes all of the key components are in place to achieve our filing within the fourth quarter however the company still must complete the validation of its analytical methods as well as working with third parties to finalize its eua submission the involvement of third parties is important for novavax it s a small company with no previous fda regulatory filings under its belt using other organizations to bolster its limited resources makes sense however the use of third parties also increases the risk of further delays other statements that erck made underscore that there is still some uncertainty in reference to the u s eua filing he said uncertainly the current timeline looks to now be in the fourth quarter hopefully early in the fourth quarter novavax still expects to file for u k eua in the third quarter however erck added that as with all applications this may change buy but don t buy it s totally understandable if investors find it hard to place much trust in novavax s projected timelines a pattern of overpromising and underdelivering has taken an inevitable toll on management s credibility despite this disappointing track record though i still think novavax s shares could and likely will move significantly higher last week novavax announced a deal with the european commission to supply up to 200 million doses of its covid 19 vaccine the company also has a supply deal with canada for 52 million doses plus an option for up to 24 million additional doses it finalized an agreement with the covax facility for 1 1 billion doses novavax s partner sk bioscience will supply 40 million doses of nvx cov2373 to south korea the bottom line is that novavax could have billions of dollars flowing into its coffers once its covid 19 vaccine wins euas and approvals around the world and while its submission in the u s has been pushed back the company in collaboration with the serum institute of india has already filed for eua in india indonesia and the philippines my view is that novavax remains on track to win eua in multiple countries including the united states the clinical data supporting nvx cov2373 hasn t changed after its sell off on friday novavax s market cap is below 15 billion considering its realistic revenue prospects in 2022 and beyond that s a low valuation i think buying novavax stock still makes sense even if buying what its management team might promise doesn t

jennifer weir the assistant of united states attorney exploited her power and authority to attempt to terrify a 73 year retired dentist pushing an imaginary fraud case to drive her narrative the intent of the law is clear government sectors were made to protect people s interests government sectors should be the foremost bodies people run to seek help but with jennifer weir it s the opposite the ausa jennifer weir told marchitto that they wanted to put ronald flynn founder of vuuzle media corp limited in prison she said this while in a video conference with fbi agent michele l belluzzi along with marchitto and his attorney jay weiner ausa jennifer weir during a video call showed pictures of jets boats and women posted on flynn s facebook ausa jennifer weir and the fbi agent said the jet s and boats were owned by flynn weir went on to elaborate that flynn was using the money he raised from investors to buy expensive jewelry stay in expensive hotels and go out to nightclubs at this point marchitto knew that the video conference meeting was spurious and an outright sham dr marchitto became nervous by weir s intimidation pressing him to admit he was guilty or they were going to come to arrest him straight away they said if he would agree to sign a plea agreement they would go easy on him and he would only get 5 years in prison weir wanted marchitto to agree that he conspired to commit fraud so they could use him as a witness to send flynn to jail during the whole meeting jennifer weir continued to bash flynn by showing marchitto pictures of women who were with flynn that they concluded to be self indulgent however unbeknown to the fbi or weir richard marchitto knew full well what the truth was and how all the money was spent in fact flynn does not own a boat nor a jet also the pictures of the women ausa weir showed during the meeting had nothing to do with vuuzle tv or fraud moreover flynn and marchitto had never committed fraud or did anything wrong when building the ott streaming service in fact everyone knows facebook and social media is not the place to find factual news in general facebook and social media are used as a medium for fun fake news real pictures fake pictures fantasy make believe stories humor facts and or truths marchitto was surprised to hear how the fbi was creating a fairytale during the video conference about creating expenditures by flynn when the expenses by flynn were accounted for and were receipted on the company ledger books with a complete record of where every penny was spent the real question is since when did the fbi start believing everything that is posted on facebook is real why did weir and the fbi agent michele l belluzzi try and convince marchitto to believe everything posted on flynn s facebook was real pretending it was true their incompetence would surely know this story gets even more twisted after the s e c filed and sent out a press release about the fraudulent civil case ausa jennifer weir suddenly filed an indictment and sent out a press release with no proof in a dual effort with the fbi to shut the company down and destroy flynn s name posting that if he was convicted he would receive 300 years in jail the fact is the fbi weir and the s e c had no proof of anything what they have is a hidden agenda filled with corruption at the highest level attempting to make flynn look guilty of a crime he did not commit for reasons still unknown to the company or marchitto the fbi and weir went on to tell marchitto in the interview that their star witness lived with flynn and had all the proof about the case unfortunately little did they know at the time the man they say lived with flynn jay pinara a well known pig farmer living in hawaii had been sending death threats to dr marchitto aol s email account texting that he was going kill flynn john lamb and his son below are few screenshots from a bunch of emails sent daily to marchitto for two years now september 23 2020 we gonna smash ronald before we dispose of him september 29 2020 world trade center explosion send me location you faggots you are all the same ronald shane flynn american terrorist all three of you bantay kayo sa akin i ll keep an eye towards you september 27 2020 stephen a smith predicts that ronald shane flynn will definitely be put in a box this is not funny real life if we don t knife him we will bomb his country these emails were sent from a verified email address from jay pinera as seen in the screenshot below what s funny about these emails is that all of these were also forwarded to a certain michelle buluzi mlbelluzi fbi gov an fbi agent but does nothing about it how come the company with a good reputation is being dragged into the spotlight of crime whereas it s the one who s oppressed how did that happen after the indictment by the doj jacob frenkel the legal counsel for vuuzle tv issued a press release on law com all comments written by jacob frenkel can be found as part of pleadings filed with the court suddenly the daily mail uk published the preposterous story with an article displaying flynn s fun pictures on facebook trying to smear and damage him as being a convicted and indited scammer one must wonder what the daily mail uk has to do with all this and why they posted the ridiculous article the interrogation of richard marchitto and the indictment on flynn can only be viewed as a setup by ausa jennifer weir this whole case is filled with government corruption and stinks the high heaven of a fraudulent investigation why has the inspector general chosen not to step in to stop this by ausa jennifer weir in the state of california the inspector general or i g and employees are charged with identifying auditing and investigating fraud waste abuse embezzlement and mismanagement of any kind within the executive department the case against vuuzle tv marchitto and flynn is iniquitous patently unfair and not true people nowadays have easy access to the truth we all know that we can now fact check within few clicks this opportunity shouldn t be taken for granted especially for those working in government sectors the proper party that justice should side on should be the focus and goal not pointing fingers at innocents just to cover corruption and incompetence justice does not work like that got a question call 1 866 4vuuzle 488 8953 for

made from human plasma products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents e g viruses and theoretically the creutzfeldt jakob disease cjd agent the risk that such products can transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses by testing for the presence of certain current viral infections and by inactivating and or reducing certain viruses the nabi hb manufacturing process includes a solvent detergent treatment step using tri n butyl phosphate and triton x 100 that is effective in inactivating known enveloped viruses such as hbv hcv and hiv nabi hb is filtered using a planova 35 nm virus filter that is effective in reducing the levels of some enveloped and non enveloped viruses these two processes are designed to increase product safety despite these measures such products can still potentially transmit disease there is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products all
