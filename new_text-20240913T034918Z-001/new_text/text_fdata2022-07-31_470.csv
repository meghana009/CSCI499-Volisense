u s cattle producers are sending higher numbers of breeding stock to the sale barn and some are liquidating their herds entirely signaling a trend that analysts say will likely push already elevated beef prices even higher in the not too distant future the latest cattle report from the u s department of agriculture shows the market has contracted to levels not seen in years with total inventory dropping 2 to 98 8 million head since july 2021 cattle inventory has dropped to its lowest level in years as it continues to decline united states department of agriculture expand but it s not just the reduction in cattle overall that is of concern it s what is getting sent to slaughter there is a notable boost in calf producing females getting sold for processing in addition to steers which are typically favored for consumption we are seeing large numbers of female stock have been placed in feedlots usda livestock analyst shayle shagam said in a radio report for the agency tuesday heat wave hits us farms stressing crops and ranchers herds the number of females in feedlots is up 3 and existing herds are down roughly 2 7 from a year ago shagam said that combination means supplies of cattle going to feedlots is going to be declining resulting in progressively tighter supplies of all fed cattle available for slaughter as we move into 2023 the latest usda cattle report shows the market is contracting further amid high input prices and drought conditions mario tama getty images getty images with the price of ground beef up 9 7 in june from the same month a year ago the ongoing decrease in supply could cause prices to surge even further than earlier estimates the usda s previous price forecast projected average steer prices would be up nearly 8 5 next year prior to the storm of conditions causing increasing headaches for producers farmers in the west face slew of challenges warn of more supply chain disruptions sky high input prices coupled with ongoing drought conditions in much of the country are exacerbating the sell offs national cattleman s beef association ceo colin woodall says this year s drought is more widespread than the regional droughts seen in years past when producers could send their cattle to other parts of the country to graze until it started raining again but so much of the country is in a drought there s no place to go because everybody is struggling to find the forage they need to feed their cattle woodall told fox business cattle graze amid drought conditions june 21 2022 near ojai calif mario tama getty images getty images expand we do expect the prices to continue upwards but everybody has to remember that it s not cattle producers setting that price it s all about costs when you look at those who make a decision to send their cattle to market to either thin down their herd or completely eliminate their herd it is always going to be attributed to the increase of their input costs and that is everything from the cost of feed cost of hay and cost of diesel for tractors diesel for the truck fertilizer costs and there s so many things that go into producing cattle that the producers just don t have any control over the increased number of cows and heifers sold for slaughter means herd depletion will continue and building it back will take years biden epa proposes regulation that farmers warn will drive food prices higher a heifer is two years old before she produces her first baby john kleiboeker who owns a seedstock breeding cattle operation in california missouri explained that calf is another 18 months after that so you re talking about close to 40 months from the time that little baby heifer is born until she has produced a pound of beef kleiboeker says he hasn t been forced to sell any stock yet but the soaring prices of forage and feed sparked by the ongoing drought has prompted him to prepare his cull list for the past five years he said he has purchased anywhere from 110 to 120 big round bales from the same supplier s first cut of hay this year the first cut only produced 57 but the cost was up 50 from last year to 75 per bale a bale of hay in a field during a heat wave outside elgin texas july 20 2022 sergio flores bloomberg via getty images getty images expand there was no second cut due to drought now he s hoping the rain will bring what would have been the typical third cut in the meantime he has to buy hay from elsewhere get fox business on the go by clicking here there is hay available but with freight the cost of transportation to bring it 200 to 250 miles south may be prohibitive klieboeker told fox business the cheapest price we can find is 5 05 to 6 per loaded mile well if you go adding an extra 1000 to 1 200 to a load of 30 round bales of hay it gets really expensive real fast link get updates and more on this story at foxbusiness com

michael mcdaniel courthouse news phoenix cn a federal judge in arizona has ruled that 18 horses seized by the u s forest service should not be re introduced into the apache sitgreaves national forests because they are considered unregulated livestock instead of protected wild horses according to the federal complaint filed in june the international society for the protection of mustangs and burros believes horses have lived in the apache sitgreaves national forests for decades and the 18 horses removed from the forest are wild and free roaming horses entitled to protection by the wild free roaming horses and burros act of 1971 wha the society was seeking a temporary restraining order preventing the defendant the u s forest service from selling those horses as livestock to non government entities u s district judge steven logan found thursday the wha strictly defines protected horses and that this group does not fall under its purview the wha provides that wild horses are to be considered in the area where presently found as an integral part of the natural system of the public lands logan wrote in his decision according to logan the 1971 act established at that time areas where the government must maintain and nurture wild horses horses that manifest outside of those areas should be considered unauthorized livestock the u s forest service argued in a hearing on july 22 that these horses were not a part of that territory but were probably livestock bred in the area logan agreed with that assessment and cited a 2021 report prepared by forest service historians recounting an unruly family that had trouble wrangling their horses ach sighting was attributable to horses that had escaped from either the nearby fort apache indian reservation or from one of several family allotments in the area he wrote one family in particular the wiltbank s endlessly struggled with reports of their stock leaving the allotment or simply winding up in the road logan also found clear efforts by the forest service to go above and beyond its due diligence by gathering stakeholders to discuss the horses before their roundup those in attendance included representatives of the arizona department of agriculture a representative of over 30 sportsman organizations and representatives from allotments nearby the area at issue he wrote the notes from the meetings indicate that the stakeholders were supportive of the forest service s efforts and plan to remove the horses aside from the december 2021 meetings defendants provide an extensive list of all organizations and individuals contacted by the forest service in relation to the unauthorized livestock issue importantly none of the interested parties who were contacted voiced an objection to the determination that the horses on the forest are unauthorized last week troy froderman of fr law group representing the international society for the protection of mustangs and burros argued it was the only party to provide concrete historical evidence indicating the presence of horses in the area before the 1971 act froderman showed the court a snippet of a newspaper submitted as evidence which describes a resident viewing wild horses in the region we re the only ones who presented evidence of an eyewitness who said in 1918 he saw the wild horses froderman said logan found that evidence to be lacking in sum this court cannot credit this newspaper article as anything close to evidence substantially indicating the presence of horses prior to 1971 he wrote aside from the newspaper article plaintiff has provided nothing in its briefing or at the hearing in the way of affirmative evidence indicating that horses were present on the relevant allotments logan said determining the autonomy of those horses before 1971 may be nearly impossible and therefore he must assume the forest service s records to be accurate without more from plaintiff this court must defer to the expertise of the forest service and assume that such is the case he wrote in last week s hearing froderman claimed the horses could be sold to organizations for slaughter according to expert witness ericka luna a deputy forest supervisor for apache sitgreaves national forests the forest service will do its best to prevent butchers from taking the animals we re doing our best possible job to make sure that we are preventing animals from getting into the slaughter pipeline while also meeting our regulatory obligation for removal of unauthorized livestock she said courthouse news reached out to the international society for the protection of mustangs and burros and its attorneys but did not receive comments by press time
tl dr the top 1 google result for blockchain production users and related queries lists 34 individual real world blockchain projects one would expect some actual functioning projects that have an impact on every day consumers outside of cryptocurrency nfts looking into all 34 i found that 13 are already dead including one that has been killed by the sec 6 are only useful within the crypto nft ecosystems and not in the real world and 14 use blockchain in a way where removing the blockchain would not impact functionality at all or make the product better the remaining project is chainalysis which has real world impact by helping law enforcement de anonymizing blockchain users overview and scope if you ask people without or with limited background in tech about blockchain or distributed ledger technology dlt the general understanding is that even though the cryptocurrency and nft ecosystem is plagued by scams blockchain is the future of it deloitte compares it to the arrival of the postal services or the internet forget bitcoin blockchain is the future blogs investopedia how blockchain will change writes nasdaq even within the it industry plenty of people bought the hype blockchain will be as important to the next generation of internet applications as the public cloud microservice architectures and devops are to the current generation blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members but while the 13 years of blockchain s existence certainly had no shortage of prototypes promises and pr outside of cryptocurrencies darknet markets and money laundering use cases it is hard to find news articles or an overview about real world use cases of blockchain technology so i decided to dig myself the top search result for blockchain real world applications on google is this builtin com article titled 34 blockchain applications and real world use cases disrupting the status quo archived version quote we ve rounded up 34 examples of real world blockchain use cases for this pragmatic yet revolutionary technology it s far from an exhaustive list but they re already changing how we do business apart from being the top 1 result and a reasonably recent article builtin com has 300 employees per linkedin and is a company built around the tech startup community part of their business seems to be maintaining a database of startup companies including the ones mentioned in the blockchain article so they have some business incentive for the data to be accurate additionally the majority of the following results did not list actual projects or products but rather high level ideas like supply chain management healthcare food safety etc usually with a 2 3 sentence high level description but no concrete examples so i figured the builtin list would be a good starting point to find check out some real world use cases for the purposes of this article i am making the assumptions that the projects should be not just crypto as the point of this article is to find applications outside of cryptocurrency i m categorically excluding anything where the only effect of the application is in the user s cryptocurrency wallet as the point of this article is to find applications outside of cryptocurrency i m categorically excluding anything where the only effect of the application is in the user s cryptocurrency wallet not dead projects should have had a sign of life in the last 12 months or so projects should have had a sign of life in the last 12 months or so not bad uses blockchain and in a way that makes sense they do use a blockchain dlt and the dlt adds some form of value to the users and the value add comes at reasonable tradeoffs the product is still somewhat usable and does not cause obvious legal problems uses blockchain and in a way that makes sense it turns out these are sufficient to cross out 33 of the 34 projects from the list i have listed those in the next section in the order in which they appear in the original article the dead the bad the ugly smart contract use cases smart contracts as a concept have their own set of problems but luckily that doesn t affect any of the projects builtin listed in this category because none seem to use them burstiq not blockchain bad blockchain prototype bad use of blockchain unfinished prototype and likely does not use dlt at all the website is full of marketing buzzwords and apparently they seem to have pivoted back and forth to iot at some stage and now to web3 completely lacking is any technical description on how the system works beyond a few high level buzzword filled boxes their careers page mentions blockchain only in passing nothing blockchain related in the skills qualifications sections for any engineering role aws sql everywhere though the word blockchain appears only twice in their whitepaper both times in the last sentence the burstiq platform connects any data from any source in a global network of businesses researchers and people through a full end to end blockchain enablement system with blockchain based big data management consent and data sharing cognitive computing monetization and global data exchange this is also the only sentence describing the platform s functionality in the whole whitepaper there is a tell me more link to sign up for a 60 day free trial for burstiq the link doesn t work mediachain dead dead acquired by spotify in 2017 website and twitter last updated then there has been no mention of any progress on mediachain s core proposition within spotify ever since in 2022 though spotify is recruiting people to work on early stage web3 projects they are starting another prototype propy inc bad in 5 years they seem to have sold only 2 properties one in kyiv 2017 and one in tampa fl 2022 the article is somewhat ambiguous what rights you own with the nft it s either access to the paperwork or some ownership rights i reached out to propy and asked what happens when you lose your keys the answer was in effect we ll give you new login information in other words you don t actually own or manage the nft propy does all the advantages you are supposed to get with nfts access to the defi ecosystem for example or easier transfers obviously can t happen in this case what happens if propy runs out of funding and shuts down do you still own your house all blockchain does here is muddy the waters w r t legal responsibilities adding more complexity to the purchase process whereas earlier this year nft was all over their homepage as of mid 2022 they seem to be pivoting away from nfts they seem to be focusing on being a real estate sales management platform maybe a title and escrow company neither of which has anything to do with blockchain they also seem to be taking zillow or similar listings and offering to pay for the listings with cryptocurrency which in essence makes them an exchange internet of things the blockchain is supposed to secure everything from an amazon alexa to a smart thermostat by it s transparency and virtual incorruptibility this did not make sense to me in the first place and apparently it did not make sense to builtin s featured projects either filament dead according to their website they have pivoted to automotive their linkedin and twitter have both been dead for 2 years and the only change their website has seen since 2019 is that the series a investors verizon ventures bullpen capital have pulled out hypr not blockchain the builtin article claims that hypr makes iot devices virtually unhackable by by taking passwords off a centralized server it is hard to find any references to iot on their website their blog barely mentions iot anymore in fact since jan 2020 only one articlementions it in passing searching their website for blockchain yields only 8 results of over a thousand pages all of these are either only tangentially related encyclopedia articles and or updated 2017 or earlier there is no indication that hypr has used anything blockchain related for at least 4 years xage security not blockchain not dlt last mention of blockchain on their site in september 2020 a partnership with the us space force no less similarly their twitter account which tweets daily has last mentioned blockchain in july 2020 they seem to be pivoting to zero trust away from blockchain in fact that s in the title of the main whitepapers at the time of writing whereas any mention of blockchain is completely absent trying to access the actual whitepapers requires you to provide an abnormal amount of personal data not a good look for a security focused company to harvest pii most of the documents can be found with a filetype google search also not a good look if it s that easy to bypass their security still after downloading and going through the whitepapers it remains fundamentally unclear what they were actually trying to do with their blockchain system even high level information like what kind of data is stored on the blockchain is completely absent they keep talking about xage being tamper proof due to blockchain in virtually every document they reference blockchain in this is plainly false blockchains are tamper evident and maybe tamper resistant but not tamper proof bad start the little information that is available raises way more questions than it answers in their nist cybersecurity compliance analysis doc they claim that their encryption scheme somewhat benefits from blockchain there s two and both are messy data stored in xage fabric is encrypted on a per publisher and subscriber basis end to end if all data between all participants on the network is end to end encrypted with per channel keys how exactly do you get a readable presentation in the audit log are the keys centrally managed clearly this encryption scheme is orthogonal to any blockchain use but since we are using blockchain what happens if the key material of one node gets compromised and you need to rotate the keys how are you going to re encrypt past entries without breaking the blockchain merkle tree data stored in the xage fabric is encrypted using a threshold based encryption technique called shamir secret sharing compromises on fabric will require simultaneous access to multiple threshold xage fabric nodes to provide their shares making data leaks substantially more difficult compared to central databases and not exploitable this makes no sense to me whatsoever the only interpretation that i can get out of this is that the data at rest on disk is encrypted with a secret sharing scheme and that each blockchain node holds a chunk of the key you d need m out of n chunks to decrypt the data that sounds nice for 5 seconds until you realize that there must be mechanisms for participants to read the data for which the participant has a valid reason to contact those m nodes at that point the participants obtain the simultaneous access to the key material the encryption scheme offers protection only when some less than m database nodes are compromised but not against compromise of any of the other e g desktops iot devices in the network assuming this system makes sense it can just as well be implemented without a blockchain but with a central database and separated keyservers it can be reasonably assumed that this would actually be more secure separating database and keyservers would mean that there is fewer software running on each node which would mean fewer security concerns and the key server code could be much smaller compared to a node also containing the blockchain and database logic and can be audited better personal identity it should go without saying that putting anything id related on a public ledger is a privacy and gdpr nightmare i have talked extensively about the combination of did and blockchain in my previous article which contains even more dead projects ligero dead the company was founded in 2018 their website has no information on the platform or on any activity there doesn t seem to be a twitter or a company linkedin profile i was unable to find the ceo on linkedin the cto has no mention of ligero in their linkedin profile and neither does the company president illinois blockchain dead the final report was published to their website in 2018 and the illinois department of innovation technology twitter account has not mentioned blockchain since 2019 civic bad doesn t use dlt at all this company provides id verification and mfa login services specifically targeted at blockchain and nft companies they don t sell a product that utilizes blockchain itself evernym bad while the whitepaper from 2016 talk about a distributed ledger none of the two casestudies talk about their use of blockchain in fact the infographic in the former makes it pretty explicit that no blockchain is involved the second one seems to use the same on phone storage for credentials without blockchain i have discussed sovrin which is the creator of evernym in my previous article i reached out to them and apparently for a single project they write to a private hyperledger instance but their client doesn t read from it they did not clarify why that hyperledger is even there they did mention that they are exploring non blockchain solutions ocular dead the website ends with the registration form for the affiliate partnership program which has the note please note this is in early beta stages and estimated to start high volume testing early september 2019 the copyright is from 2020 there are no technical specs whatsoever the twitter account ocularkyc has a manowar profile picture and limits its post to central bank conspiracy theories healthcare as with identity what was really missing from the healthcare system is that all that privacy sensitive data is on a publicly accessible ledger wholecare bad likely dead there is virtually no information at all on their website the most detailed technical facts are resources to orient new caregivers hipaa compliant record keeping integrated scheduling tools alerts cross device compatibility that s it there is no mention of blockchain or dlt on their website their twitter account retweets a wapo article every few months patientory bad likely dead the app seems to mainly be focused on tracking exercise water body photos nothing that fitbit co can t do today hardly requires blockchain there is some talk about storing patient data in the ptoy blockchain which seems to be the token associated with the chain there s a whitepaper from 2017 which shows a wonderfully centralized architecture this graph could be stripped down to 3 nodes with the same exact functionality but less complex cheaper and more performant it even explicitly says that all the storage work is done by a hipaa compliant database so blockchain doesn t add anything here this is a classic 2017 ico boom project that somehow manages to still occasionally write tweets bonus the app store and play store links actually lead to a subscribe page not an app store page i doubt that is in compliance with apple s and google s respective policies for example the play store guidelines state any online use of the badge must link to the google play store the badge images are also clearly altered prohibited by both apple and google s tos pretty obvious trademark infringement on your homepage for a company in a compliance heavy industry that bodes well nebula genomics bad this company claims to allow people to buy their dna sequencing kit anonymously via bitcoin which makes these pop ups particularly fun of course the checkout process does not accept crypto at all there is some whitepaper that claims they can store and share genomics data in a privacy preserving way as dumb as the idea is in general the whitepaper at least seems somewhat technically interesting but that doesn t really matter because the data is sequenced in hong kong or in europe so who knows who has copies of your data and even if nobody stored the data however under certain circumstances your genetic information may be subject to processing pursuant to laws regulations or judicial or governmental orders warrants or subpoenas in other words whatever technical locks they have in place nebula has a master key wikipedia medicalchain dead the whitepaper is from 2018 the roadmap ends in 2021q1 their twitter has been dead since march 21 logistics are logistics companies and the businesses they work with interested in broadcasting their business activity to their competitors by putting reports receipts manifests on a public ledger let s find out dhl dead dead and or never left prototype phase the last press release is from 2019 about a mvp they tested with hewlett packard enterprise there is no technical description no details no further updates they did provide an overview pr document and it s an entertaining read especially section 2 blockchain examples across the industry every single example is experimenting with has built a prototype or is testing none deployed a prod product the exception is powerledger where they claim to have deployed the product but spot checking a few of their 30 clients all of those are either small scale deployments e g prototypes w 30 kwh or in planning prototyping stage powerledger is an interesting one though as it mixes both a fake blockchain approach per the whitepaper private blockchain in section 5 3 off chain channels in section 5 4 and an off chain trading engine in section 5 5 with what looks like a 2017 ico scam powr to build an energy market which already has working real world non blockchain implementations hewlett packard enterprise s blockchain solutions page has issued their last news in 2018 block array dead the link on the builtin com article links directly to their facebook page which hasn t been updated since march 2018 their actual website blockarray com is gone maersk bad dead updated 2023 01 13 maersk announced that they will be shutting down tradelens in early 2023 as need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved bad dlt i actually spent a serious amount of time looking at maersk this is a platform that actually seems to work is used by customers and they seem to be using a hyperledger internally the problem arises when you look at what that blockchain actually does virtually every component in the system is gated by an ibm com login there are multiple disconnected blockchains with nodes operated by only a few participants nodes can only be accessed through apis hosted by ibm acl d off of course data is by necessity gdpr mutable and not all data is shared by all participants the blockchain only seems to be used to store hashes which you if you have access can then compare against a separately stored document if you have it this does of course not preclude existence of other conflicting documents in the blockchain nor does anything really stop the few node operators to collude and re write history for which there might be legal reasons like gdpr which one node might not even be at liberty to disclose to other parties in essence this is a working system with a blockchain slapped on the side for pr reasons blockchain integration probably does not make the system much worse especially given that it seems to affect only a tiny part of a presumably massively complex shipping management system but it doesn t add value either at the end of the day trust in the data is established through the ibm logo on the login screen not through the blockchain shipchain extra dead extra dead in the offer of settlement shipchain inc offered among other things its payment to the sec of 2 050 000 unfortunately shipchain inc is now without sufficient resources to continue its business consequently shipchain inc has made the difficult decision to cease operations and is now in the process of closing its affairs it should be noted that this was in 2020 and it s still listed when google searching for blockchain production users government this is a category where at least in theory you d expect the everything is public aspect of the blockchain might add some transparency use cases unfortunately in the projects listed it doesn t voatz very very bad bad dlt now e voting is obviously a really bad idea eff has tons of material openprivacy on swiss elections 19 ccc on germany 2020 there s a principle in democracies that every person needs to be able to understand how the result was calculated and why it is anonymous and secure with that i invite you to read the technology on wikipedia in particular the blockchain infrastructure of voatz includes 32 identically arranged verifying servers that are distributed across amazon s aws and microsoft s azure each server runs an identical copy of hyperledger an open source blockchain software once a user downloads the voatz app they verify their phone number provide a photo id as well as a selfie facial recognition and voter rolls are used to verify identity and confirm a match between the picture and id submitted after the user is offered a secure token activated through the use of a fingerprint applicable to eligible elections the user s biometric information is removed from the voatz system after all votes are submitted to voatz votes are printed on a paper ballot and fed into a machine also the intro and security assessment and fbi investigation sections are entertaining now with that out of the way voatz uses paper ballots as the source of truth the votes are apparently printed out fed into a machine where they are then counted why is there a blockchain system in the middle at all voatz uses a replicated permissioned hyperledger which apparently can only be accessed through their apis how does blockchain provide auditability here so what exactly does the blockchain do here again a 2020 security review by researchers at mit came to a similar conclusion we further find that the system s use of the blockchain is unlikely to protect against server side attacks 5 2 the whole article but in particular section 1 is downright scary particularly worth pointing out is that voatz refuses to give a detailed description of how their election system works citing ip concerns so much for the whole idea of transparency david gerard has covered voatz extensively state of delaware dead dead via technically it s been four years since that episode and while corporations have the state s authorization to use blockchain for record keeping it s unknown how many delaware corporations are using it for stock ledgers technical ly has reached out to the governor s office and several individuals directly involved with the evolution of the initiative and has not yet received a response it s also unclear what came of the symbiont proof of concept follow my vote very bad almost dead dead ish founded 2012 virtually every article covering this project from their press section was written in 2017 or earlier their twitter account has not posted this year this seems to be mostly equivalent to voatz with the same privacy security problems of the one blockchain transaction per vote approach sure you may need to hop on a vpn that you paid for anonymously and you need to make sure that there s no cctv cameras watching you vote otherwise people corporations or governments could de anonymize your vote small price to pay for a blockchain based system as with voatz there is basically no technical documentation they have an infographic on how their cryptographic process works can an average person understand how this is secure privacy preserving in early 2021 they apparently scrapped the approach they have been working on to build a new fundamental platform called pollaris a year later they uploaded one commit to github there has been no activity since nor was i able to find any documentation on this system it is unclear whether the posts above refer to the pre pollaris or the post pollaris system but then again it wouldn t really matter either way media per builtin blockchain s strength in the media industry is its ability to prevent a digital asset such as an mp3 file from existing in multiple places wait what madhive bad mostly dead the company s core business adtech actually looks alive but not the blockchain part with the sparse information available it looks like they had two previous attempts to do something with blockchain adledger and madnetwork the last post on adledgers smedium page is from 2019 so that s almost certainly dead the whitepaper assumes a permissioned ethereum blockchain they do explain why this is required but they do not explain why using an immutable ledger when you need to be able to delete makes sense they then talk about the need for real time updates without the need of a blacklist and somehow the distributed state machine of a blockchain is a way to achieve that they don t actually explain why the other dlt attempt seems to have been a thing called madnetwork madproduction s madnetwork will allow for the mining of madbytes and minting of madtokens which need to be managed through an accessible user interface the above quote is from a job posting that exited when i started researching for this article but has since been pulled cached version assuming that this is the same as their last big update still featured prominently at the top of the page is from 2020 announcing that they are working on a prototype with verizon there is no indication that madnetwork is anywhere close to even being in a prototype stage it is unclear even whether this is supposed to be a distributed pki or a fraud detection network for adtech madhive s own resources section only lists documents from 2019 steem dead bad steem it is a reddit ish social media platform it is very close to dead these days per dapp radar its usage has dropped from 33k users day to about 35 making this project 99 9 dead justin sun took over the chain and the community left for a project called hive io however if you do consider the few remaining users as a real world use case or include hive there s plenty of bad dlt to go through here too the big and obvious problem is how an uncensorable platform would deal with illegal content csam is the obvious example the answer is apparently they don t they can t they just hope nobody will ever upload anything illegal gdpr is of course a problem too steemit responds to legal requests by censoring the content in the app apparently hoping that nobody will look into the steem block explorer where the content remains social media on blockchain creates a worst of both worlds situation you need a content moderation team just like existing social media platforms but they can t actually delete the content form the database so node operators are still broadcasting it steemit also has all the classic cryptocurrency traits a history of stealing funds through soft hard forks threats of class action lawsuits hacks and the earning model being a pyramid scheme with the twist that early investors make money not only from later investors but also from creators a similar project dtube which is a youtube esque social media platform requires you to refresh the ipfs cache every few days to keep your videos alive reddit exists micropayments in social media have been tried over and over again before dlts came around flattr google contributor steemit does censorship internally thus the key argument for uncensorable posts and transactions is not valid blockchain has no reason to be integrated here and makes things worse open music initiative dead dead last blog posts in 2018 most about hackathons conference attendance no actual products seemed to have tweeted about industry related things until october 2020 and only tweeted twice since not the real world money transfer use cases money transfer use cases would fall directly in the category of crypto only for as long as bitcoin has existed this has been touted as a great use case but it never really materialized chain io not blockchain according to the builtin article chain io s cryptographic ledgers help financial institutions safely and efficiently handle the transfer of cryptocurrencies there is no mention of this on their homepage it looks like they have now completely pivoted from being a blockchain financials company to being a logistics on cloud platform their careers page summarizes their company as chain io is a cloud based integrations platform that connects partners across the global supply chain the last mention of dlt in their blog is from 2018 algorand gemini circle crypto only not real world projects as discussed in the introduction i am only discussing projects that have real world effects outside of cryptocurrency balances gemini circle as exchanges and algorand as a blockchain implementation don t qualify here they don t actually add real world utility other than moving tokens around nfts candy pixura dapper labs as a whole nfts violate both the real world requirement but they are also a really bad engineering solution for the non fungibility in particular see the propy use case above when real world ownership law meets stolen or lost keys real world wins this also seems to be the case with the copyright law seth green s stolen ape a stolen nft is unlikely to give you rights ownership does but that is not the same as possession so the nftness of the ape doesn t add any better management or transferability of ownership the exact opposite is the case it muddies the waters adds another layer of complexity but not only are there complications unifying ownership with the real world and the crypto world even within crypto uniqueness and thus the ownership over the thing is far from guaranteed if ethereum forks again each nft would be duplicated and can be sold individually on each chain of course opensea might just declare one of the two forks the canonical one but other platforms might disagree from a purely technical code is law perspective both forks are equally valid it is of course possible to just clone the whole contract and plug the same images or uris in this exists as a service e g with clonemynft com which allows you to keep a copy of your nft in your wallet even after selling the original it is of course also possible to just clone the nft on a completely separate blockchain like candy does they run on a dlt called palm which uses proof of authority poa consensus with network validators being run by key stakeholders in other words it s completely centralized and if the key stakeholders decide to take your ape or a majority loses interest and shut down the chain your stuff is gone and you can t get it back except with a hard fork see problem 1 as cointelegraph writes just as in the traditional art market nfts can be faked through mimics and just like in traditional art markets this fact challenges users to take responsibility for tracing the provenance of what they re buying identifying vulnerabilities is how infrastructure is strengthened so how does this improve on things then more generally through labeling which nft collection s hash is the true bayc which fork of the blockchain is the true eth fork which collections can even be displayed and traded opensea co are the true gatekeepers and de facto owners if they want your ape to be gone they can pull the plug so again you re left with a central instance virtually controlling your apes so the nfts add practically nothing to the real world other than a very expensive layer of indirection so i will be excluding this category as a whole candy dapper labs are just generic nft companies pixura deserves honorable mention for the phrase helps non technical users to create track and exchange nfts because what we really needed was to make it easier to create useless tokens and the winner is chainalysis helps the government track down tax evasion darknet markets and csam providers consumers you can make an argument that they fundamentally require cryptocurrencies to work but the impact they are having extends far outside the crypto ecosystem into branches of law and tax enforcement they also provide mechanisms to automatically block transactions use kyt to detect patterns of high risk activity and prevent transactions with addresses identified on ofac s sanction list freeze deposits from hacks or ransomware screen eth accounts and more it is certainly ironic the only live real world blockchain use case in this list is an application that de anonymizes and censors transactions in the context of uncensorable anonymous cryptocurrencies closing words there have been overly hyped tech products before cloud machine learning internet where people promised more than what the product actually delivered but these products clearly delivered something this is not the case with blockchain technology the statements blockchain is the future and the more moderate there are use cases for blockchain outside of cryptocurrency seem to always fall apart when you look at any proposed use case from an engineering privacy and legal perspective blockchain advocates have been spending 13 years convincing people of those statements could they not have spent an hour or two to find facts to back them up given how many investors and members of the general public lose time and money on this i believe it is somewhat irresponsible that the software engineering community is not pushing back harder as a member of this community i also find it somewhat embarrassing acknowledgements thanks to david gerard u siccors and stephen diehl for their input
vienna austria energy minister leonore gewessler told broadcaster orf this week that austria will reach its natural gas storage target of 80 percent capacity by the start of the winter heating season she made the announcement in response to russia s gazprom statement stressing that gas supplies through the nord stream 1 pipeline to germany would drop to just 20 percent capacity i have to assume that this was a political announcement for austria this means that we are on course to achieve our storage target if that changes we will of course take measures but we see that nord stream 1 is not the central supply route for us this is different from germany she added according to reuters despite nord stream 1 being fully shut down for maintenance austria continues topping up storage using non russian gas and supplies from russia via ukraine she said
on saturday s broadcast of fox news live rep al green d tx stated that the economy is in a technical recession but not a recession of the type that we normally experience and that americans and his constituents are feeling a recession due to inflation although we ought not try to conclude that any president would be able to handle this better than this president has handled it green said it is a technical recession but you cannot overlook the fact that we re creating jobs that unemployment is very low those two things would cause one to conclude that we re not in a recession of the type that we normally experience just yet and we are working to prevent that from happening that s why we have the inflation reduction act to help us to bring prices down to make sure that persons will have the opportunity to have more money in their pockets and keep more of the money that they have in their pockets so i m very much pleased with what the president is trying to do to get this done this bill that we re looking at is going to reduce the deficit and it has offsets in it by making those big corporations the 200 that pay less than 15 in taxes they should pay their fair share there s nothing wrong with that host griff jenkins then asked do you believe americans and your constituents in texas are feeling a recession whether the white house is calling it that or not green responded of course they are of course people have a mindset that s been created to cause them to think recession i don t deny this my constituents care about the stock market but they live by the supermarket and when they see prices going up in the supermarket that impacts them at the service station but remember this if we had no worldwide pandemic no shutdown of the workforce worldwide if we didn t have those two things and if there was no russian invasion we wouldn t have 9 1 inflation it wouldn t be the case this is all brought on by a multiplicity of things and we ought not try to conclude that any president would be able to handle this better than this president has handled it follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett
on friday s pbs newshour new york times columnist david brooks said that inflation is truly terrible and the biden white house is being too gentle about talking about it too upbeat in its rhetoric about inflation he also said that while other areas of the economy are positive the historical record is not good and it s very hard for the federal reserve to bring inflation under control with a soft landing that avoids an economic downturn and this indicates that things might get bumpier and much more unpleasant for the american people brooks stated well it s complicated but inflation is terrible truly terrible and i think the white house is being too gentle about talking about it too upbeat in talking about it on the other hand labor markets are quite good productivity corporate profits the stock market s beginning to kick up gas prices are coming down and a post covid slowdown looks very different the problem is it s very hard for the fed to bring down inflation in a way that s a soft landing it s the historical record is not good here so we may see something bumpier and much more unpleasant for the american people follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett
euro fundamental forecast neutral euro slightly rallied as the us dollar weakened this past week markets continue to favor a fed pivot despite 75 bps rate hike all eyes are on the us labor market will it contrast gdp data recommended by daniel dubrovsky how to trade eur usd get my guide the euro edged just cautiously higher against the us dollar this past week this seemed to be largely a result of broad based weakness in the greenback allowing the single currency to capitalize on a depreciating dollar what fueled this it appeared to be markets further pricing in a pivot from the federal reserve are traders getting ahead of themselves setting up for disappointment the euro area economic docket is rather thin in the week ahead so the focus on eur will likely depend on external factors in this case it might make sense to look at what is going on in the united states although it should be noted that the european central bank has been pushing out increasingly hawkish commentary as of late but as we will see it still pales in comparison with the fed sentiment recovered this past week pushing the tech heavy nasdaq 100 higher in july the index gained about 12 5 making for the best monthly performance since 2020 this is despite the fed delivering a 75 basis point rate hike this past week with chair jerome powell making it clear that the central bank needs to fight and bring down inflation the haven linked us dollar depreciated however the central bank seemed to de emphasize forward guidance and pivot to a more meeting by meeting approach stressing data dependency puzzlingly inflation data would suggest there is still much more to do if you take a closer look the markets may be pricing in a dovish pivot due to rising concerns of a recession us gdp this past week showed that the economy contracted for a second quarter meeting the technical definition of a recession that likely helped the euro rally to a certain extent however markets might be getting ahead of themselves inflationary data this past week continued to show that the fed has a problem to tackle the employment cost index which is the central bank s preferred wage gauge surprised higher at 1 3 q q in q2 versus 1 2 seen meanwhile the fed s ideal inflation gauge also beat estimates this is quite an unusual situation for the central bank growth is weakening but inflation is still running hot perhaps due to a tight labor market see chart below some may view this as a sign of stagflation us job openings are still robust the unemployment rate is quite low and labor force participation never recovered back to pre pandemic levels does this mean there is room for growth to continue weakening and for the jobs market to have room to absorb this deterioration perhaps in the week ahead all eyes will thus be on the next non farm payrolls report for july the economy is seen adding 250k positions with unemployment sticking to 3 6 a slight slowdown is seen in average hourly earnings with a 4 9 y y outcome expected from 5 1 prior these are still healthy estimates and will likely contrast with the fed pivot markets are expecting as such remain vigilant volatility can still return opening the door for a us dollar reversal thus pressuring the euro recommended by daniel dubrovsky trading forex news the strategy get my guide us labor market remains tight data source bloomberg chart created by daniel dubrovsky written by daniel dubrovsky strategist for dailyfx com to contact daniel use the comments section below or ddubrovskyfx on twitter

have said in the past and as is especially true in the current financial markets we are taking an all of the above approach to financing our growth plan as we explore a variety of prospective sources of capital we have continued to focus on strategic investors who know our company and the markets we serve and who have the potential to make equity investments in the business as koch strategic platforms has done in the past and indicated its interest in doing so again in our june financing efforts in addition to potential strategic investors and the public equity and debt markets we are engaged with government programs as potential 2023 sources of capital for plant ii we have applied for a 150 million u s department of energy grant for advanced battery materials as part of the bipartisan infrastructure act which is designed to support u s based companies dedicated to the electrification economy we are also exploring other doe programs that are focused on battery performance and safety the programs target american manufacturing in an effort to address the resiliency of supply chains in the u s especially for projects in critical areas of sustainability such as energy storage and related materials while such doe programs can take time and are unpredictable we believe we are a very good candidate and that our pursuit is consistent with our all of the above approach to raising the necessary capital for us to execute our long term strategy we also believe that as additional public market investors learn the aspen story with its secular growth trends and sustainability focused themes these investors and of course our existing investors will again be a source of capital for a fast growing dynamic company like aspen aerogels despite the challenging markets we are confident that we will raise the necessary funds to execute on our strategy to become cash flow positive in 2024 and to create value for our shareholders we appreciate your continued support our business performance in q2 remain strong despite lingering supply chain and staffing challenges we had a strong start to the year in q1 with 37 year over year revenue growth and q2 built on that momentum with 44 year over year revenue growth the first half performance reflected continued penetration in the ev market and high levels of activity in the energy industrial market with this commercial momentum and of course our existing awarded programs with general motors and toyota we are confident that we will have high year over year growth rates in 2022 and we believe that we are in a strong position to meet our 240 million revenue target for 2023 pyrothin thermal barrier revenue was nearly 11 million in q2 compared to 7 6 million in q1 and less than 7 million for all of 2021 we anticipate that multi year thermal barrier revenue will be substantial and we are investing now to meet the demand we also recognize that automotive oems will be impacted from time to time by their own supply chain challenges that could impact their growth ramps in any given period we are trying to build in optionality to manage our overall revenue growth during this early stage of the ev megatrend by continuing to have a deep order book in the energy industrial side of our business the strong outlook for energy industrial is fueled by pent up maintenance demand high energy prices and strong long term activity levels in lng this flexibility is a good example of the benefit of our strategy to leverage the aerogel technology platform into a diverse set of large and dynamic markets i would also like to provide a brief update on plant ii our aerogel manufacturing facility under construction in georgia with long lead time items purchased starting in q4 of last year the first phase of plant ii remains on a projected timeline for completion in late 2023 while the project is not immune to challenges related to supply chain disruptions and inflation our team supported by koch project solutions is focused on building a first class aerogel manufacturing facility the first phase of plant ii target 650 million of annual revenue capacity and will bring our total annual revenue capacity to approximately 900 million as we approach full capacity utilization at this revenue level we are targeting ebitda of approximately 225 million per year with reports indicating that the auto industry is on track to invest a half a trillion dollars in the next five years to make the transition to electric vehicles we believe that we are well positioned to play an important role in battery performance and safety in addition to investments in plant ii in georgia and in our high volume assembly facility in mexico we continue to make important investments in people systems and automation these actions enable us to scale rapidly to transition to positive cash flow in 2024 and to monetize our investments in building our dynamic business we also continue to invest in in the strategy to leverage our aerogel technology platform into other high value markets with sustainability themes our teams have been extremely productive this year expanding our intellectual capital position across the aerogel technology platform with over 60 new inventions captured in 33 patent families filed or in draft year to date we believe these investments in technology and new business development will continue to validate the richness of our aerogel technology platform and create significant shareholder value we expect our carbon aerogel initiative within aspen battery materials to be next in line to commercialize products abm has completed the development phase of its next generation silicon anode material that targets both lower costs and increased energy density and is now preparing qualifying materials for select automotive and battery oems while these enterprisewide investments require capital and burden margins in the short term we believe they set us up structurally so that with full utilization of plant ii we are positioned positioned to generate 1 6 billion of revenue and 400 million of ebitda and at the same time have the opportunity from new businesses for potential additional breakout value we have important work still ahead of us but i am encouraged by the progress we are making toward achieving our goals and finally i would like to continue the practice of highlighting our esg work during quarterly earnings calls for the past two decades esg has been linked to the success of our business it is a natural fit for us to explore new uses for our aerogel technology platform with the goal of improving the environmental performance and safety of our customers products and processes it is also at the core of our culture to respect and celebrate our employees by striving to create a diverse and inclusive environment we believe we have the responsibility to make a positive impact on our communities and we are committed to creating a corporate culture that pursues its mission with the highest standards of integrity we will be releasing aspen s inaugural esg highlights report and launching our esg webpage in the coming days which will provide a comprehensive overview of our overall esg strategy we look forward to your feedback i will now turn the call over to ricardo ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer thank you don i ll start on slide 4 and our financial highlights for the second quarter starting with revenues high demand across all our markets and the successful execution of various initiatives to increase our throughput have enabled us to deliver 45 6 million of revenues in q2 this is close to our company s quarterly revenue record of 46 5 million in q4 of 2019 and translates into 19 growth over the previous quarter and 44 growth year over year year to date the team has managed to grow revenue by 40 year over year to 84 million while we have mentioned that the ev thermal barrier opportunities are materializing faster than originally expected i will start by highlighting that our energy industrial revenues increased by 13 over the prior quarter to 34 9 million this is driven by very strong demand from our distributors as we continue to fulfill a meaningful backlog of delayed maintenance demand while continuing to displace competitors materials and new projects that are being built to higher efficiency standards with tighter timelines delivering this level of growth in our core business while also increasing our ev thermal barrier revenues to 10 8 million a 42 quarterly increase demonstrates our team s continued ability to deliver the growth that is required to meet our long term objectives now i ll highlight our main expenses while reminding everyone that despite the growth that we ve been able to deliver during the quarter both of our business segments still aren t running at the annual revenue run rate that is needed to properly absorb our fixed expenses and meet our target profit objectives accordingly we continue to manage every cost element to ensure that all our recent productivity investments start delivering results i ll return to this point in more detail and cover how implementing operational elements beyond simply having a higher revenue base will drive meaningful gross profit increases these elements fortunately require no radical new process invention or development it is simply a matter of putting them in place and validating them material expenses of 26 million for the quarter made up 57 percentage points of sales which is over 10 percentage points higher than where we want this to be long term this variance is currently driven primarily by the scrap levels required to accelerate our ev thermal barrier throughput with processes designed for lower volumes and non recurring inbound freight expenses to ensure uninterrupted production various product design changes aimed at simplifying our assembly and reducing the number of parts and the bill of materials of our ev thermal barriers will help us address these nonrecurring costs conversion costs of 20 8 million reflected the last quarter of our thermal barrier assembly facility in rhode island delivering most of our production to illustrate the burden of this our temporary hourly labor costs of this facility were 4 5 million to deliver 10 7 million of revenues during the quarter more broadly the higher revenue run rate of our energy industrial business enabled our total conversion costs to decrease by four percentage points of sales quarter over quarter to 46 or 20 8 million operating expenses which are key to delivering our revenue and profitability goals of 2023 and beyond were 21 4 million these increased by 4 6 million quarter over quarter versus an increase of 6 7 million in q1 over the prior quarter as we go into the second half of the year our opex increases will be more modest and focused precisely on delivering three things one tangible productivity benefits through new process development and the implementation of systems that streamline our methods and drive productivity two new business awards through our ev thermal barrier technical sales efforts and three clear milestones in our r d efforts these include our silicon anode carbon aerogel development efforts along with r d efforts in our silica aerogel based insulation formulations these are the developments that drive lower chemical waste expenses through reformulation and enable throughput improvements such as longer rollings and faster line speeds while ensuring the same quality standards accordingly our net loss increased to 24 million or 0 68 per share versus a net loss of 6 7 million or 0 23 per share in the same quarter of 2021 adjusted ebitda was negative 18 3 million in q2 compared to negative 3 4 million in q2 of last year as a reminder we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation expenses and other items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance in q2 these other items included 2 3 million of stock based compensation and a 1 4 million of interest expenses next alternative cash flow and our balance sheet cash used in operations of 10 million reflected our adjusted ebitda of negative 18 3 million and the reduction in operational cash needs of 8 3 million that was mainly driven by a 12 9 million increase in accounts payable capital expenditures during the quarter of 37 9 million included the ground clearing foundation and building of plant ii assembly equipment for a higher volume thermal barrier operations and the r d lab upgrades for our carbon aerogel battery material efforts as progress remains on track for plant ii to come online at the end of 2023 we have capital of 62 5 million through the end of q2 toward it cash provided by financing activities of 4 9 million during q2 included 4 8 million of net proceeds from our atm offering transactions at a gross average price of 20 18 per share year to date we have raised 67 9 million opportunistically through atm offering transactions at an average price of 14 46 per share as don mentioned earlier we re employing an all of the above approach to raising capital and as we consider all markets and avenues the atm offerings play a very small role in our broader financing efforts we ended the quarter with 162 2 million of cash no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and shareholders equity of 164 7 million our outlook for the year remains unchanged we are geared to deliver revenues of 180 million with potential upside to 200 million and net loss in the range of 79 8 million and 86 8 million and adjusted ebitda in the range of negative 55 million and 62 million our capital expenditures for the year are expected to range between 250 million and 300 million delivering 100 million to 120 million of revenues during the second half of the year implies a 10 to 32 increase in our q2 revenue run rate this increase is subject to various external factors beyond our control such as our thermal barrier customers ability to fulfill their stated vehicle production volumes and the supply chain of our raw materials such as xylenes batting co2 and the local labor market particularly for our aerogel facility in rhode island we are proactively managing our supply chain risks and have ensure that we re supplied of xylenes and batting to execute our production plants recent nationwide co2 shortages and a tight labor market pose the highest near term risks to our continued throughput increased plants in managing capex we aren t seeing the same inflationary pressures of q1 and are cautiously ensuring that we pay the latest prices for some of the key commodities going into plant ii versus the cost of which some contractors built inventory earlier in the year turning over to slide 5 and going back to my earlier point on profitability during the quarter our ev thermal barrier segment run at a roughly 40 million annual run rate while our energy industrial business ran out at roughly 140 million annual revenue run rate at these run rates we re still not quite getting the most out of our overhead and fixed asset base above a run rate of 150 million per year our energy industrial business can deliver 20 plus gross margins our thermal barrier segment requires an annual revenue run rate of around 120 million to deliver 15 plus gross margins as we ramp up production in mexico the introduction of simpler designs and more automation will help us lower thia run rate requirement our ev thermal barrier business has been quoted to deliver our target margins of capacity and our energy industrial pricing environment is favorable enough to support price increases that will take effect on every order fulfilled in 2023 beyond fixed cost absorption our operating plan includes several initiatives that we re executing on both segments to pay our path to 35 gross margins at full capacity on this slide we d like to illustrate for you how the implementation of specific initiatives in our operating plan will drive gross margin improvements as our revenue growth at the same time as i mentioned earlier we re not reinventing processes and don t carry technical risk because we do this it s simply a matter of getting these initiatives done as we have year to date with the successful start up of our thermal barrier facility for our assembly in mexico our ev thermal barrier business is undergoing a meaningful operational transition as we mentioned earlier our production over the past three quarters has been delivered with a set of low volume processes in a manual facility in rhode island to illustrate this the number of thermal barrier assembly hourly staff in this facility increased from 278 at the end of november of 2021 to a peak of 428 in june of this year today we are back down to 280 people and have approximately 600 people in mexico ready for the volumes of the rest of this year and 2023 as we move this work to mexico and introduce processes designed for higher volumes our conversion costs are going to decrease significantly and improve our gross margins by over 30 percentage points in 2023 for q1 of next year we also have planned various automation processes for the encapsulation of the aerogel and the assembly of the thermal barrier parts these will further reduce our conversion costs by reducing cycle times the labor costs per part and at the same time increase our production yields the reduction in part complexity by implementing various engineering changes working with our customers is also streamlining our processes aiding with pricing and driving productivity over the next two years in our energy industrial business portfolio management longer product runs with less changeovers and reformulations in our base chemistry to reduce our chemical waste expenses will continue to drive conversion cost reductions longer installation production rollings and faster line speeds will increase productivity by q4 of this year our recently expanded supply chain team is also more than making up for the incremental fixed cost by streamlining our logistics and driving the negotiation of raw materials to a larger scale plant ii in georgia will also improve our composition overall with a linear process that will require little manual material handling and circular processes for key chemicals such as co2 and ethanol this will reduce our material costs significantly along with our environmental impact and the cost of this impact our target margins also factor in the dna of plant ii that will kick in as it comes online in 2024 and we grow into its full capacity as one can see here our plan is to not just rely on higher revenues to improve profitability most of the improvements come from the successful implementation of productivity improvements and the launch of operations in flexible and more productive locations with processes designed for higher volumes this plan is well within the capabilities of our current team and recent milestones keep us motivated to continue on our path to 35 gross margins of capacity turning over to slide 6 we would like to provide a brief market update on what we re seeing in the automotive ev market these dynamics validate our strategy and the effect that these are having on our commercial discussions with the world s most relevant oems here you can see that seven of the top eight oems that are expected to command over 65 of the ev market are focused on high energy density high nickel content chemistries they are also focused on prismatic or pouch cell form factors these configurations are most compatible with cell to cell barriers like pyrothin several oems are also evaluating lower energy density chemistries such as lfp and we are actively courting lfp programs as well when we look at the market we see pyrothin incompatible with at least 19 million vehicles in what piper sandler forecasts to be a 24 7 million unit market in 2025 we are creating the market for aerogel based cell to cell barriers we do this by leveraging the innovative the thermal isolation fireproofing and the mechanical properties of our material having a system level approach in building unrivaled scale all in all the size of the market and pyrothin s positioning as a unique solution presents an increasingly compelling opportunity turning over to slide 7 here we can see some other encouraging news and a summary of some of the most relevant un global transportation requirement updates for ev safety that are bringing additional focus to the issue of thermal propagation and thermal runaway around the world this issue is currently not at the top of consumers minds when evs make up less than 10 of the new vehicle market but will become more relevant as evs make up a higher share of the global vehicle market and more than 25 of global new vehicle sales in 2025 the update to the global transportation requirements is focused on providing drivers with a five minute warning intended to give them time to evacuate the vehicle in the presence of a danger caused by thermal propagation or runaway in a single cell current battery management systems can already trigger this warning but the hard part is enabling five minutes or more of safety with pyrothin we can enable oems to turn what is currently a catastrophic event into a serviceable event the gt r updates became mandatory new vehicle regulation for new vehicles last year in china south korea and japan they are being considered for implementation in the u s this year and come into effect in india next year helping oems to not just meet these warning requirements but provide real protection in the rare case of thermal propagation and runaway and proactively developing the capabilities and scale to meet their standards is ensuring that we maintain our lead position as we create this market in slide 8 the results of our market building efforts are illustrated where we are attempting to provide you with an accurate and constructive view of our commercial efforts in this chart the size of the circle is the vehicle volume in millions that piper sandler is forecasting for these volumes in 2025 and their placement on the map is their approximate headquarters location the color of the circle then determines whether we have been awarded business by that oem or actively courting business undergoing testing or not active with that oem it s no surprise that gm and toyota are the red circles with 2 3 million vehicles in north america and half a million vehicles in japan respectively you can see that our team has successfully entered the closing stages over the last 18 months with the largest customers in europe and asia that will be relevant on a global basis in 2025 we feel confident in their ability to convert this activity into additional awards over the next 12 months and are glad to see the value of these quotes surpass the value of our current awards with gm and toyota as you all know the timing of these awards is linked to an oem s readiness to award the business and we ll be as forthcoming as possible with our communication as these awards materialize assessing the value and probability of these quotes paves a path for us to become a company with a 1 6 billion of annual revenue capacity delivering over 400 million of ebidta shortly after we achieve our near term objectives through 2025 with that i m happy to turn the call back to don don young president and chief executive officer thank you ricardo before we turn to the q a session i would like to reiterate two important points first both our ev and energy industrial businesses are going strong and are providing a favorable backdrop for us to reach our 2023 and 2025 revenue targets and second we are laser focused on turning the investments that we are making today into a business that is cash flow positive in 2024 and is on the way to its longer term goal of 1 6 billion of revenue and 400 million of ebitda florem let s turn to the q a thank you questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of eric stine with craig hallum eric your line is now open eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst good morning everyone don young president and chief executive officer hi eric ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer hey eric eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst hey so first thanks on slide 8 that s a great slide very informative so thanks for including that um you know maybe just thinking about the acceleration and activity on the ev side i m just curious how scarcity value is playing into that and you know how it s playing into discussions and also plans that you re making on your side as you work toward phase 1 here of plant ii don young president and chief executive officer well let me just start by saying that it is important that we demonstrate our ability to build out our capacity as we ve said many times we have the we have the capacity in place to meet our 2023 targets and we ll be relying on phase 1 for our 2025 revenue targets but it s even more than that we know that even in the 2025 timeframe if you take energy industrial general motors and toyota it represents a significant majority of that capacity so it s important that we continue to you know to demonstrate to this next wave of oems that we ll have the capability of supplying them and we think we re doing a good job of communicating that eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst so today i mean it sounds like today that s not necessarily a concern of oems although i would think it is something that you know gets them to given the importance in this issue to want to you know maybe be further up in line in terms of the decisions they make around the quoting that you ve done don young president and chief executive officer i think that s a fair i think that s fair eric i think that s a fair sort of instinct that they have and again it s part of our communications as we go out and win these this next set of awards eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst yeah ok and then just on the second one just the fire containment you know that is a it seems to be a pretty important thing that you re able to do i mean what type of awareness in the industry are you seeing and i mean how does that play into the acceleration of activity as well making it more of a service event rather than catastrophic as you put it don young president and chief executive officer well the way i think about that and ricardo i think articulated well both in his script and on the related slide that we re seeing some of the regulatory standards begin to be implemented i think those are positive for us for sure most of the oems we re working with are setting a higher standard for safety than those baseline requirements and we ve discussed openly in the past that our work and the design of our products are striving not only to slow the propagation but to isolate the bad cell and that is a very dramatic mindset change from having that catastrophic fire that is well understood up to again to a service of that impacts a cell or a module itself that can be replaced again in more of a service oriented manner than the replacement of the automobile overall so we think those standards are excellent we ve never really relied on regulatory aspects to drive our business but we think those are foundational and very positive for our business eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst ok thanks a lot don young president and chief executive officer thank you eric ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer thank you operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of alex potter with piper sandler alex your line is now open alex potter piper sandler analyst great thanks a lot hi guys so i just have a question this is an interesting side slide 8 it s encouraging to see all that q uoting activity including on i guess landmasses other than north america one of the questions i had on that is i obviously altium is going to be primarily a north american platform but some of these other say european or asian oems clearly they have their own platforms and they have their own plans in those regions a lot of those places are pretty far from georgia so how much of a concern is that for some of these customers as people are looking more and more localizing battery supply chains are you able to supply all of their needs out of georgia are any of them insisting on having more localized capacity either in europe or asia to support their ramps don young president and chief executive officer yeah it s a it s a very good observation the way we re thinking about it today and the way we ve communicated it to the to the oems is that we will have our first 1 6 billion of revenue capacity here in north america between our rhode island and georgia plants but what we are also committing to is to have fabrication assembly facilities regionally and just as we have our north american operation principally expanding very rapidly in mexico it s clear to us that a european oem will want to have that capability and move that supply chain that aspect of the supply chain closer to their own assembly plants and i guess i would also just say that while we locate the circle if you will in their home base many of these companies are global in their nature so you know in their locations so in their regional locations i guess i should say and so anyway so we are mindful of that alex and i think depending on how our demand builds out over time and as we fully utilize plant ii we will certainly be mindful of that mix geographic mix of our business as we think about building our second plant today we are highly focused on phase 1 and on plant two and getting to that 1 6 billion of revenue and 400 million of ebitda target alex potter piper sandler analyst great perfect yeah one thing at a time ok so the second question you alluded this a couple of times in the prepared remarks and hoping maybe you know drill down a little bit it sounds like you may be experiencing some staffing bottlenecks it sounded like that was primarily in rhode island but it also sounded like you had now that the mexico facility has opened up you re able to i guess downsize a bit in rhode island so if you could just maybe elaborate on hiring staffing any potential problems you re having either in rhode island or in georgia that would be helpful as well thanks don young president and chief executive officer yeah thank you alex we have improved the staffing of our aerogel manufacturing facility here over the course of the past eight six months it was a bit of a struggle for us the latter part of last year q4 in particular coming into this year and q2 and here in july we have made good progress in staffing in that facility and so it is less of a less of an issue for us the we do and ricardo alluded to this and it really in the margin walk and what are we doing to improve we have redundant activities going on today as we ramp and i think the rhode island assembly to the mexico assembly facilities you know mexico s really meant for the high volumes that we re ramping up to here right now we have sort of both of them operating that won t be required going forward we ll always have some capability here but it will be more in the prototyping or very early stage work that we do so being able to eliminate those redundant activities being able to eliminate get to some of the nonrecurring activities get those off of our income statement will improve our gross margins improve significantly and we re very focused on that ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah if i may add another key thing here is particularly when it comes to the aerogel plant in rhode island our hr team and the operations team have come up with an incentive scheme aimed at managing retention and you know i know i mentioned that we currently have over 200 people still on the thermal barrier assembly side in rhode island that will drop here to less than 100 before the end of this month as well so that transition is actually a pretty quick one in q3 and so you know while we re highlighting the risk we do think that the team has implemented enough measures to get it under control don young president and chief executive officer yup alex potter piper sandler analyst ok perfect thanks guys don young president and chief executive officer thank you alex operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of chris souther with b riley chris your line is now open chris souther b riley financial analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question here could you provide a bit more color on the commercial progress slide just how should we think about quoting and testing versus the way you used to discuss the three stages should we think about testing or quoted as kind of the last step you know before toyota and gm orders came in and you know maybe just the timelines that it took from the different steps with gm and then toyota and just you know how that kind of timeline either shrunk or was consistent would be helpful don young president and chief executive officer well certainly the quoting phase is very much in the stage three part of our earlier kind of stage one stage two stage three sort of concept and i think testing is solidly in probably the later stages of two as we would again use those concepts but when we are quoting we have gone through a significant amount of testing and qualification and you know ran quality systems right through the product performance and specifications so this is pretty late stage in our development work with a given oem so where you see the blue circles on that slide 8 that is definitely stage three work that we re trying to translate into awards here over the course of the coming two three four quarters chris souther b riley financial analyst got it ok and then you know just kind of looking at you know the awarded oem forecast you re exciting here and the range as you ve talked about content per vehicle looks like you guys are being really conservative with that 540 million 2025 cars in target on either the volumes or the you know content per vehicle you know so maybe you could just kind of walk through you know where you guys think you are you know setting yourself stuff up you know particularly nicely because you know obviously that s you know toward the midpoint of that you know we re already looking at filling up you know phase 1 of plant ii pretty quickly there so i just wanted to get a sense of you know how we should think about that and then you know our content per vehicle you know still kind of come in in that range you guys had initially talked about or you know not initially but you know subsequently we re talking about ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah i mean this is an interesting one so we are seeing a difference in the content per vehicle between prismatic cell configurations and those oems where our technology is going in between how it sells and so for example altium is running pouch cells and so their content per vehicle is you know some are you know well above 1 000 per vehicle but we think it ll settle to around 600 a vehicle and you re right i mean when we take all the external assessments of gm s volume or piper sandler here on slide 8 at 2 3 million in 2025 that would put us well above the 540 million that we ve communicated for thermal barrier so far we are going through making our own assessment of where gm s volumes will truly lie and where the cpv will land right now we still think that that tripling of revenue with that mix of thermal barrier and energy industrial revenues in 2025 is still accurate to the best of our of our knowledge and with all the purview of the information that we have but yeah i mean there s definitely a chance to in which we could very well find ourselves in a situation here having to accelerate the buildup of phase 2 in order to accommodate you know an expansion of the current awards and these other awards that the commercial team is on the final stages of don young president and chief executive officer i think one other thing chris that i would just mention is that if you look across the spectrum of general motors and the vehicle model that we re on with toyota general motors has started off with some fairly large vehicles frankly and if you look at their roll out here that they ve articulated very clearly over the course of 2023 2024 2025 you get quite a broad range of vehicles and including some smaller higher volume vehicles and we know that those vehicles have fewer modules making up the battery pack and cpv sort of translates from there so your question is a very good one and we re mindful of that we ve i think continued to try to have people focus on cpv in that 300 and 350 kind of range and even though the numbers are higher than that today ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer and i guess this also goes back to why phase 1 was scoped out the way it is because when we look at the capex of phase 1 it really is around 200 million of equipment inside of a 375 million building that is already equipped to handle both phases and so then we re able to bring in phase 2 within around 12 months notice at any given point in time and so here as these quotes convert into awards we could very well accelerate phase 2 and that s why you know our mind really is at this 1 6 billion of revenue level and 400 million of ebitda as we look into the future don young president and chief executive officer yeah that spending in phase 1 to create the infrastructure to support both phases phase 2 we estimate to cost an additional 125 million but clearly we re spending in advance to be faster in bringing up that second wave of capacity in plant ii and i would say that s another example and ricardo and i talked about it in our scripts of the investments that we re making now to be able to handle the volumes that we see in 2023 and 2024 and 2025 and whether those are and people and processes and automation we are making those investments to a great extent here in 2022 to prepare ourselves for those higher volumes and we understand that it s pinching our margins today but we do believe in combination with the actions that ricardo articulated in his script doing those two things good business practices and in our margin walk and leveraging the greater volumes the math works out very favorably for us as we strive for those 35 gross margins that we ve articulated chris souther b riley financial analyst ok no that s very helpful and just you know if you kind of add up all the people that you re already quoting you know 1 6 is probably not enough here you know if you were to kind of win everything right so i m curious you know how you would think about kind of capacity beyond that is there additional space around the facility where you could kind of you know have a phase 3 there or is it you know something that you think you d just kind of look to build elsewhere and to kind of piggyback on someone else s question don young president and chief executive officer yeah that s these are questions and from that we do try to focus i think preparing for success and we feel we re doing that with a lot of the investments that we re making here i believe that when we have plant ii fully utilized that 1 6 billion revenue level and generating significant amount of cash in the business that we are likely to want to build our third aerogel manufacturing facility elsewhere and quite possibly in an international location just getting back a little bit to alex s question as well that those oems may very well want to shorten that supply chain and we think that will make a lot of sense for us to do it to think about it in that matter ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah i mean another thing worth noting on slide 8 is that the i mean these aren t exactly the volumes that we re quoting with these oems right these are the market sizing of how many evs the piper sandler forecast expects these oems to sell in 2025 in many of these quotes we were quoting a platform that has a subset of their total ev volumes or a nameplate that is being rolled out past 2025 as well so we think we can manage within the 1 6 pretty well here over the next three to four years don young president and chief executive officer yeah chris souther b riley financial analyst ok that s very helpful thanks guys don young president and chief executive officer thank you chris operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of jason bernoff on behalf of colin rusch with oppenheimer your line is now open colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst sorry this is actually colin i m on the line guys the energy industrial revenue here and the diversity of customers it looks like you guys are making some good progress in terms of expanding that customer base and also the visibility on our growth from this year to next year which looks pretty substantial don young president and chief executive officer it is really rewarding we have a you know these are this is our initial market obviously we have extremely strong team around the world serving that business that continues to be a business while we have tremendous growth here in the u s it continues to be a majority of the business outside the u s so i really like the footprint if you will of the business geographically i would just say that the diversity is also quite outstanding in the array of applications that we re serving maintenance work continues to be an important part of that business and maintenance work has always felt to us a lot like baseload apart from the covid interruption you know that business grew nearly every quarter since we introduced those products on the maintenance side and then we get the swings a bit more on the project side and we re seeing interesting project opportunities in our traditional sort of pipe and pipe subsea pipeline activities but also of course in the lng business both in the liquefaction side and on the receiving terminal side in all regions really and so we re really excited about that business sometimes i think it gets lost in our discussions about the ev megatrend for sure but it is a significant business that we think that we can continue to grow and we also believe that our products focused on efficiency asset resiliency and safety are spot on as these facilities think about their own esg goals and sustainability commitments so again i appreciate the question it s really an important part of our business colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst ok excellent and then on the capex numbers it looks like you spend about 66 million 67 million through the end of 2q and you ve got you know a fairly substantial amount left to go you know 200 or a little bit more for the balance of your plan this year i guess can you talk a little bit about the cadence of how that money is going to flow out and any of it that you can defer into next year without any real impact to time frames ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah i mean there s a good chance to defer some of the q4 spend which would be of around 150 million and then this quarter it s looking like it s going to be anywhere between 70 million to 100 million of capex we re actually seeing the expenses come in later than we originally planned and yet there is a good chance for around 15 to 20 of our total capex budget for this year spill over into next year colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst ok that s super helpful thank you so much don young president and chief executive officer yeah we re very focused on that colin as you can imagine we were trying to balance obviously our balance sheet and the importance of building plant ii in a timely way so we re very focused on making sure we re in good shape on both of those fronts thank you colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst ok thank you operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of tom curran with seaport global holdings tom your line is now open tom curran seaport research partners analyst thank you good morning don young president and chief executive officer good morning tom curran seaport research partners analyst thermal barriers for thermal barriers what i model guide it suggests you should hit that annual revenue run rate of 120 million over the second half of next year so you know potentially just 12 to 15 months out and you expect to be able to achieve a gross margin of 15 at that run rate ricardo would you please revisit and bridge for us the expected upswing in gross margin from the steep negative level being incurred at 40 million to 15 and 120 million could you please just break down it and quantify each drivers expected contribution to that target margin improvement ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer sure so i mean conversion i mentioned in my script that over 30 of an improvement at least in 2023 when we look at the full year we think that ll be closer to 35 as we think about that then our ability to improve the way we absorb fixed expenses better that s about another 10 improvement then some of the engineering changes that we re implementing are actually reducing the overall material cost as well and that i think we re being a little bit conservative as we assess that but that could be anywhere from 1 to 5 percentage points of sales here as that shakes out um logistics as we go from shipping aerogel from as we go for shipping you know less aerogel because we re improving our yields in mexico that s about a six percentage points improvement in 2023 and so when we put this all together that s what gets us to that positive 15 plus on a run rate basis closer to the third quarter of next year i think that s how it would break down i mean i think the negative 66 of q2 can t be totally walk to the 2023 point because of the variable labor expense of the temporary labor expenses that i outlined right so if we take that we re on tom curran seaport research partners analyst right and that s why i wasn t assuming that you know annualized 40 million was that negative that full negative 66 just you know steeply negative right ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer exactly yeah tom curran seaport research partners analyst yeah ok and then ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer so i mean i think as we look at q2 i mean q2 was better or q1 was better q2 got worse q3 is probably going to be about the same and then we ll see our improvements really kick in in q4 don young president and chief executive officer and it really goes through a lot of these tom curran seaport research partners analyst the first half of 2023 should really be the big inflection point in terms of don young president and chief executive officer correct yeah ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah tom curran seaport research partners analyst crossover into you know profitable and then double digit gross margin don young president and chief executive officer yeah we will have eliminated the majority of some of the redundant operations that we have we will have addressed a lot of the nonrecurring expenses that we have as we scale up right now and those are big drivers in the numbers as well especially compared to where we are here in q2 and q3 tom curran seaport research partners analyst great um helpful thanks for that and then for the 150 million deal grant application what would be the timing and nature of the next milestone on the path to approval and if you do qualify it certainly seems to me that you should you re certainly an ideal candidate when should the grant be extended don young president and chief executive officer it would have a 2023 impact on our capital and this will the process is going to play out here over the course of the next six months tom and these things are these things can be a little opaque but we have good advisors and we re very engaged and we think we have an excellent application if you will for the grant we re well engaged with doe and so again i think it s a little hard to i think i said in my script that you know these things play out in a little bit of an unpredictable manner but again i think we are a very good candidate and it fits neatly into our all of the above strategy and we re encouraged i think by where we stand in this but we will give updates on a certainly on a quarterly basis as we make progress through the process that the doe has outlined tom curran seaport research partners analyst great best of luck with it thank you don young president and chief executive officer thanks tom operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of amit dayal with h c wainwright amit your line is now open amit dayal h c wainwright analyst thank you good morning everyone most of my questions don young president and chief executive officer good morning amit amit dayal h c wainwright analyst just on the battery development side any updates for us any are you any closer to you know moving forward testing etc with customers ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer yeah i mean on that end we ve pretty much exhausted the testing that we can do in coin cells and are transitioning to testing on larger pouch cells and as we do that i mean obviously doing that with some partners whose core competencies making larger form factor cells is ideal and that s what the team is right now focused on really trying to find the right relationship so that we can accelerate our testing just given the encouraging results that we ve seen on coin cells and as we do that that s one of the really the piece of validation will ramp up here in the second half as we try to meet our goals for the year don young president and chief executive officer we ve made in the past 12 months some meaningful investments in that team and equipment and that is paying off we re as i said in my script we are now able and in the process around producing what we refer to as qualifying materials and those are destined for a select group of automotive and battery oems and so we ll see that play out here in the coming quarters this is this is not a fast process we don t underestimate how this works but the progress that we re making technically we think is outstanding both from a performance and a cost points of view and we also really believe in the market itself and that is to say the importance of introducing silicon in greater percentages into lithium ion batteries as a means of improving energy density and drive range amit dayal h c wainwright analyst understood and that s all i have guys appreciate it thank you don young president and chief executive officer thank you i appreciate it ricardo rodriguez chief financial officer thank you operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of chip moore with ef hutton chip your line is now open chip moore ef hutton analyst thank you morning don young president and chief executive officer good morning chip moore ef hutton analyst wanted to follow up on that doe funding you should be a great candidate there for a grant i m actually more curious about altium securing their conditional loan do you think there s potential there to accelerate paraffin sales or you know do you think that s largely contemplated in their existing plans don young president and chief executive officer yeah that was terrific that was part of a different program but the same themes right and that was a loan and we ve applied for a grant but again we were encouraged by what general motors and lg i think together were awarded in that process because i think we haven t upped our numbers to gm because of that but again we just find it really encouraging that business is well supported both internally by general motors and lg and externally in such programs as 2 5 billion from the doe yeah chip moore ef hutton analyst understood that s helpful just one more for me don young president and chief executive officer yes chip moore ef hutton analyst on just battery materials you talked about some qualifying material can you give us maybe a sense of you know how much of a replacement for graphite sort of these first materials could be and maybe sort of a sense of path to future iterations don young president and chief executive officer well we re working through much of this today you know our team has articulated goals of 20 to 40 replacement cost or i should say silicon content and that s a fairly large range obviously and a lot of times that range has much to do with the overall chemistry and system if you will as it does with the capabilities of our material so we think that range will vary according to the cell manufacturer and the battery design itself but meaningful improvements relative to the relatively small amount of silicon in some of today s lithium ion batteries you know single digit typically at best chip moore ef hutton analyst perfect all right thank you don young president and chief executive officer thanks thank you chip operator thank you for your question there are currently no further questions waiting so will pass the conference back to don young for closing remarks thank you don young president and chief executive officer thank you florem thanks for your help we appreciate everyone s interest in aspen aerogels we re very excited about the work we re doing in finishing the year strongly we look forward to reporting out our third quarter 2022 results in october be well have a good day thanks so much operator duration 0 minutes call participants

u s cattle producers are sending higher numbers of breeding stock to the sale barn and some are liquidating their herds entirely signaling a trend that analysts say will likely push already elevated beef prices even higher in the not too distant future the latest cattle report from the u s department of agriculture shows the market has contracted to levels not seen in years with total inventory dropping 2 to 98 8 million head since july 2021 cattle inventory has dropped to its lowest level in years as it continues to decline united states department of agriculture expand but it s not just the reduction in cattle overall that is of concern it s what is getting sent to slaughter there is a notable boost in calf producing females getting sold for processing in addition to steers which are typically favored for consumption we are seeing large numbers of female stock have been placed in feedlots usda livestock analyst shayle shagam said in a radio report for the agency tuesday heat wave hits us farms stressing crops and ranchers herds the number of females in feedlots is up 3 and existing herds are down roughly 2 7 from a year ago shagam said that combination means supplies of cattle going to feedlots is going to be declining resulting in progressively tighter supplies of all fed cattle available for slaughter as we move into 2023 the latest usda cattle report shows the market is contracting further amid high input prices and drought conditions mario tama getty images getty images with the price of ground beef up 9 7 in june from the same month a year ago the ongoing decrease in supply could cause prices to surge even further than earlier estimates the usda s previous price forecast projected average steer prices would be up nearly 8 5 next year prior to the storm of conditions causing increasing headaches for producers farmers in the west face slew of challenges warn of more supply chain disruptions sky high input prices coupled with ongoing drought conditions in much of the country are exacerbating the sell offs national cattleman s beef association ceo colin woodall says this year s drought is more widespread than the regional droughts seen in years past when producers could send their cattle to other parts of the country to graze until it started raining again but so much of the country is in a drought there s no place to go because everybody is struggling to find the forage they need to feed their cattle woodall told fox business cattle graze amid drought conditions june 21 2022 near ojai calif mario tama getty images getty images expand we do expect the prices to continue upwards but everybody has to remember that it s not cattle producers setting that price it s all about costs when you look at those who make a decision to send their cattle to market to either thin down their herd or completely eliminate their herd it is always going to be attributed to the increase of their input costs and that is everything from the cost of feed cost of hay and cost of diesel for tractors diesel for the truck fertilizer costs and there s so many things that go into producing cattle that the producers just don t have any control over the increased number of cows and heifers sold for slaughter means herd depletion will continue and building it back will take years biden epa proposes regulation that farmers warn will drive food prices higher a heifer is two years old before she produces her first baby john kleiboeker who owns a seedstock breeding cattle operation in california missouri explained that calf is another 18 months after that so you re talking about close to 40 months from the time that little baby heifer is born until she has produced a pound of beef kleiboeker says he hasn t been forced to sell any stock yet but the soaring prices of forage and feed sparked by the ongoing drought has prompted him to prepare his cull list for the past five years he said he has purchased anywhere from 110 to 120 big round bales from the same supplier s first cut of hay this year the first cut only produced 57 but the cost was up 50 from last year to 75 per bale a bale of hay in a field during a heat wave outside elgin texas july 20 2022 sergio flores bloomberg via getty images getty images expand there was no second cut due to drought now he s hoping the rain will bring what would have been the typical third cut in the meantime he has to buy hay from elsewhere get fox business on the go by clicking here there is hay available but with freight the cost of transportation to bring it 200 to 250 miles south may be prohibitive klieboeker told fox business the cheapest price we can find is 5 05 to 6 per loaded mile well if you go adding an extra 1000 to 1 200 to a load of 30 round bales of hay it gets really expensive real fast link get updates and more on this story at foxbusiness com

the ongoing saga of the bottle labeling practices of those behind templeton rye whiskey drew one step closer to being completed as a website has now gone live with information on how consumers can claim a stake in the 2 5 million set aside to settle a related class action lawsuit this money is on top of required changes to the templeton rye bottle labels which we chronicled towards the end of july after they were approved by the ttb if you are unfamiliar with what this lawsuit was about or just in case you need a quick refresher here is the nuts and bolts version as drawn from the settlement website a class action is a lawsuit in which one or more plaintiffs in this case plaintiffs mario aliano and due fratelli inc collectively plaintiffs sue on behalf of themselves and other people who allegedly have similar claims here plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against defendant templeton rye spirits llc templeton rye or defendant in the circuit court of cook county illinois on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of templeton rye whiskey alleging that defendant engaged in deceptive marketing and charged premium prices by stating that its whiskey was small batch and made in iowa templeton rye denies any wrongdoing and it has demonstrated to the plaintiffs that templeton rye whiskey is not a stock whiskey that is simply purchased from a third party and poured into a bottle for sale although defendant denies plaintiffs claims of wrongdoing the parties have agreed to settle the lawsuit by entering into a written settlement agreement entitled class action settlement agreement the agreement or settlement the individuals on whose behalf the settlement has been made are called settlement class members this agreement which was given the preliminary okay by an illinois court in late july still must go through a final hearing in early december before money is distributed to those who file a claim if you believe yourself to be one who might be eligible for so called monetary relief there are a few things you need to know first those who are eligible include all individuals and businesses in the united states who between january 1 2006 and july 21 2015 purchased bottles of templeton rye whiskey or purchased alcoholic beverages containing templeton rye whiskey those who submit a claim form see below for the link to this along with proof s of purchase are entitled to receive 6 for each bottle purchased up to a maximum of six proof of purchase is defined as any written documentation such as an itemized sales receipt credit card statement or upc from a templeton rye bottle if you don t have proof of purchase you can still be eligible for 3 for each bottle you purchased again up to a maximum of six per person if you consumed an alcoholic beverage containing templeton rye that was purchased on premise at a retail establishment such as a bar or restaurant you are entitled to 1 for each drink up to a maximum of five bottles which were purchased and later resold i e businesses that purchased templeton rye whiskey for resale are not eligible for this claim program claim forms are limited to one per household claim forms must be returned to the settlement administrator and postmarked on or before november 18 2015 this same date holds to those who submit a form online the maximum payment per valid claim is 36 with this amount being subject to reduction if a large number of claims are filed you can read more about how to file a claim and find the necessary paperwork to do so at this page i ve also embedded the settlement agreement at the end of this story for your consideration now one thing i find particularly interesting to note for all the whiskey purists out there from all of this in the agreed upon language between the templeton rye people and those at the heart of this lawsuit is what this whiskey was defined as the parties agree that templeton rye is not a stock whiskey sourced from a third party and labeled templeton rye furthermore as it is put another way on another part of the site templeton rye is a unique product made up of several ingredients that are combined in templeton iowa take from the fact it is not considered a stock whiskey what you will h t chuck cowdery
a person on the floor of the new york stock exchange watches tv screens on wednesday as us federal reserve reported that it again raised the benchmark interest rate afp photo a person on the floor of the new york stock exchange watches tv screens on wednesday as us federal reserve reported that it again raised the benchmark interest rate afp photo menafn jordan times hong kong asian and european markets rose on thursday following a surge on wall street fuelled by hopes that the federal reserve fed could slow its pace of inflation fighting interest rate hikes the dollar also struggled to bounce back from a sell off sitting at a three week low against the yen that came in response to comments by fed chief jerome powell suggesting its next super sized increase could be its last however analysts cautioned that the initial joy which sent new york s three main indexes soaring could be short lived as the global economy continued to face several headwinds and inflation would likely not come down quickly as expected the fed lifted borrowing costs 75 basis points to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 per cent close to the neutral level it considers neither stimulating nor slowing economic growth forecasts have rates going as high as 3 8 per cent in 2023 as the bank tries to control runaway inflation there is a growing concern that the sharp rise in rates is bearing down on the world s top economy and could send it into recession in his post meeting comments however powell said he did not consider that was the case because there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well he did note that growth was slowing powell added that officials would not give any guidance on their next move instead taking each decision on a meeting to meeting basis while he said another unusually large increase could be appropriate in september and officials wouldn t hesitate to lift by 1 percentage point markets took heart from the suggestion that the bank was ready to take its foot off the gas towards the end of the year on wall street the dow and s p rallied and the nasdaq soared more than 4 per cent its best one day rise since late 2020 as tech firms caught a wave of optimism the sector is more susceptible to higher rates asia followed suit though with more muted gains shanghai tokyo sydney seoul singapore mumbai manila jakarta and wellington were also well in the green but hong kong dipped as the city s de facto central bank followed the fed in lifting rates owing to its currency peg london paris and frankfurt were up in the morning the prospect of a slower pace of rate hikes weighed on the dollar against most other currencies and on thursday it hit its lowest level against the yen since july 6 there was a warning that the positive mood likely will not last however this market move is the victory of hope over experience jeffrey rosenberg at blackrock inc told bloomberg television i d be a little bit cautious here citigroup s andrew hollenhorst and veronica clark added that traders appeared to be misjudging powell s remarks we read chair powell s press conference as more hawkish than the market s interpretation they said adding that inflation readings excluding food and energy will push the fed to hike more aggressively than they or markets anticipate all eyes were now on the release of second quarter growth data that was due on thursday after a 1 6 per cent contraction in the previous three months another negative reading would put the economy into a technical recession an expected phone call between us president joe biden and his chinese counterpart xi jinping will also be high on the agenda for investors as the world s superpowers try to navigate a period of rising tensions updates on us tariffs and taiwan will be among the main areas of focus oil prices rose after data showed a big drop in us stockpiles while powell s comments on the economy eased recession concerns and the weaker dollar made the commodity cheaper for buyers with other currencies
engagements by chidi amuta on the matter of ensuring national security by all means necessary i accept being called a hawk but on the concomitant cautious fear that bad things could happen to the nation if our defenses are lax i will accept the title of coward in short a nation is entitled to deploy maximum force to ensure its continued sovereignty while constantly looking out to protect its citizens from those forces that do not wish both government and people well taken together this is the contradiction that now defines our security imperative nothing better gives our situation more urgency than the clear consistent threat on the security of abuja life limbs and the very state are now at risk as the national capital is daily assaulted by an undisguised enemy force and yet the embarrassing laxity of our defense and security forces in response to this existential threat dictates that we prepare for the worst and hope for the best in the last couple of weeks an enemy we are used to casually dismissing as a bunch of bandits has consistently targeted abuja without fear of any contradiction the forces of insecurity have coalesced into an enemy with a concerted strategic focus the target of this adversary is clearly and unambiguously the sovereign heart of the nigerian state i am convinced that some evil force is out to hoist its nasty flag and shout a familiar bad slogan somewhere in he heart of abuja only in the last fortnight iswap terrorists have stormed and breached the kuje medium security prison and freed an indeterminate number of inmates these includd over 60 dangerous boko haram combatants an operation that reportedly involved over 200 iswap operatives on motorbikes and which lasted a few hours has merely been explained away by an untidy exchange of blames and excuses by those paid to secure that facility an embarrassed president buari visited the broken prison and demanded a report on why our intelligence set up woefully failed to prevent the attack soon afterwards alarms by some institutions in abuja about imminent terrorist attacks have produced evidence that the enemy we fear to name is very much at the door an elite brigade of guards patrol in the reported area of the abuja law school yielded a bloody ambush that has claimed the lives of a number of soldiers of the presidential guards unit if the well trained and armed guards of the president cannot survive an attack by thi enemy force what chance is there for the ordinary abuja resident meanwhile a reported siege of a federal government high school in a neighborhood of abuja has alarmed school authorities into asking parents to evacuate their children from the school in a reflex over reaction authorities of the federal capital authority have ordered a shut down of any number of private and public schools in and around abuja as a preventive measure there is no word as to for how long these unforeseen closures will last i shtere a level of intelligence available to the officials ordering these closured that is not available to either commonsense or the public as if that was not enough only last thursday evening a roving unit of terrorists attacked an army checkpoint around zuma rock on the busy abuja kaduna highway casualty figures remain hazy and conflicting predictably these sporadic attacks in and around abuja have created an understandable atmosphere of fear among the populace understandably the president has taken some feeble action he has met with his secueity council the national security adviser has briefed a frightened and unsettled nation about steps being taken to tame terrorists and in particular defend abuja in an unusually candid admission the nsa admitted that nigerians have become weary of the security situation and the numerous official reassurances by his admission the public has incrementally lost confidence in the ability of the state to protect and defend the citizenry thereby making self help and personal protection an increasingly attractive option mr monguno revealed that defense and security authorities are working on a new set of strategies to contain and combat the insecurity in the nation after seven years of buhari s anti corruption and maximum security administration the army has quickly reshuffled its commanders as if the mere moving of personnel and military furniture will translate into a fundamental strategic refocusing or tactical review of the old methods that have woefully failed us in the last seven years under a president with a military background clearly the political leadership of the nation has been vastly deficient mr buhari has serially fallen short in the enormous powers which the nigerian constitution give him as commander in chief moreso for a president who was elected partly because he has a military background that was hoped would equip him to deal with the insecurity that preceded his ascendancy however given the present critical stage of the threat to national security it would be a disservice to the nation for politicians to aggravate what is already and incendiary moment therefore the six week ultimatum given the president to fix the insecueity or face impeachment is an irresponsible political gambit it is at best a cheap political blackmail with an intent to frighten an insecure president with a history of epic incompetence at worst the threat by senators of the opposition pdp has an inbuilt extortionist undertone that is familiar in nigeria s murky political culture of corruption and unbridled mercantilism it is bad business to try and extort money out of a desperate national security emergency call my alert on the threat to abuja baseless scare mongering if you like but i see a clear strategic purpose in the pattern of recent attacks on facilities in and around abuja it ought to interest a perceptive public however that the government has never given the adversary a name it is in fact the terrorists themselves who strike installations like the kuje prison and reveal unapologetically through vivid videos that they are iswap the government has been reluctant to admit either boko haram or iswap as the enemy against which they are fighting the government just tags the attacks the handiwork of terrorists and moves on the progressive advance of the enemy forces is by no means haphazard or just opportunistic what we are witnessing is a clear purposive and directed movement of hostile actions even in an asymmetrical fashion which is typical of jihadist guerilla tactics but the direction is obvious it is governed by the territorial ambition of a movement intent on controlling a strategic swathe of territory from the sahel to the larger west african gulf of guinea oceanfront nigeria is central to that calculation on account of its population and resource base it has also become more attractive in recent times on account of the proven serial failures of the institutions of state and the weakness of national defense and security to stoutly defend the nation s sovereignty some analysts have pointed at signs of collusion between elements in nigeria s security forces and the enabling financiers of boko haram and iswap some have seen signs of infiltration of intelligence sources and outright complicity between guardians of state security and defence and the enemy forces leading to ease of some of the operations no one is certain that these suspicions are either true or totally false what we can see is a clear purposive enlargement of the theatre of these attacks in the direction of abuja as the centre of power in nigeria what started out in borno state has spread throughout the entire north east it has strayed into the north west and descended on the north central zone in the north west zone it has targeted kaduna as the military industrial nerve centre of the nation and the last line of defense for abuja it has successfully tested the nerves of the nigerian defence academy by killing and abducting some of its officers right on the campus the enemy briefly knocked out the kaduna airport by invading its perimeters and abducting some airport workers thereby briefly closing the airport to many commercial airlines it has made the abuja kaduna highway untenable as a route for normal civil traffic the enemy has severally attacked the rail link between abuja and kaduna and has knocked it out of the national civil transportation grid it has taken out the rail link on the abuja kaduna corridor while its rolling stock is marooned meanwhile the chinese loan that funded the rail line is gathering interest and charges while the project is returning zero revenue government has remained silent on when the rail link will reopen and yet we remain silent on the identity and purpose of this enemy the iswap boko haram coalition forces have similarly zeroed in on states adjoining abuja in niger state for instance the terrorists have taken over whole local governments and are exacting tributes rents and levies from local populations it attacked a miners in shiroro and killed over 30 soldiers and policemen that dared to challenge their abduction of chinese miners in the same week an advance contingent of presidential staff on their way to president buhari s home town of daura were attacked and a couple of them injured a deliberate targeting of the president as the ultimate symbol of our national sovereignty cn only mean one thing an arrow in the heart of the nigerian nation those intent on diminishing the urgency and import of the obvious threat to abuja and nigeria s sovereignty need to learn from recent jihadist takeovers and disruptions of nations in recent times the dramatic fall of kabul to the forces of the taliban proceeded in similar fashion at first the taliban forces were concentrated far in the provinces far away from the capital through a series of lightning raids and coordinated but sporadic attacks on major strategic routes to kabul they stunned both the government in kabul as well as its supporting us military backers all that american training air power hardware logistics and communications backing were neutralized overnight taliban operatives who had effectively infiltrated the intelligence and defense architecture of the state merely streamed into an already softened and besieged kabul america retreated in stampede almost like in saigon on april 30 1975 all that sophisticated arsenal was reduced to a huge scrap yard of useless military technology that no one could use all the generals with their fancy titles epaulets and shiny medals were reduced to a horde of scampering cowards on the run many of them had long been in the payroll of both the americans and the taliban simultaneously that lesson ought to be instructive to those paid to guard the secrets of nigeria s security and defence in today s unfolding engagement there may still be some residual professional muscle left in our military to confront our security nightmare but the political interpretation of the crisis has bred a doctrinal anarchy and confusion of terminologies which is not helping those whose business it is to worry about nigeria s insecurity the political leadership has finally agreed that the power base of the state is confronted by a terrorist onslaught it took a while to officially pronounce the iswap boko haram coalition a terrorist undertaking but even that is hardly the whole truth by the strict characterization of terrorism we are not dealing with mere sporadic terrorists terrorists strike at the soft underbelly of society s complacent zones to disturb the peace violently distort the norm and frighten the innocent terrorists storm train stations airports convert air planes into kamikaze missiles blow up restaurants mosques churches night clubs and other places where society takes normalcy and tranquility for granted these are the favorite targets of determined terrorists as a rule terrorists do not take territory or seek sovereignty over any place peoples or things they bomb shoot or stab and instill horror through sudden violent acts thereafter they move on hoping not to be caught but leaving an unmistakable message through blood and tears their aim is to shock us all into an awareness of a cause or a cultural injury the aim is to provoke the question why the hope is that the quest for answers to that question will lead to some justice or atonement of an original injustice terrorists carry no maps or compasses to do so would make their operations predictable all terrorists are unhinged agents of the devil with neither direction nor compass in some cases they decorate their violence with a sectarian creed in order to keep their followership and attract new devotees sectarian terrorism is best rooted out by political means from its creedal source let us make no mistake about it in nigeria we are not confronted by transactional bandits merely out to collect loose cash to assuage their socio economic deprivation and flee the trade after making enough money of course there are criminal bandit elements in our mix of sundry trouble makers but those ones merely frighten innocent people take hostages rape women demand ransom and sometimes storm schools transit buses trains and isolated motorists banditry is bad violent entrepreneurship gone out of control but the majority of those we call bandits are recruits of the iswap boko haram enterprise the ransoms collected by bandits go to swell the war chest of the larger jihadist enterprise criminal banditry is easy to root out take out the gangster chieftains and you are likely to exterminate the ring but systemic jihadist banditry has an almost limitless pool of recruits and is therefore self renewing nigeria s more strategic insecurity is therefore a local off shoot and subset of the larger isis global jihadist terrorist network in its sahelian iteration isis has metamorphosed into iswap boko haram which has swallowed up boko haram and other isolated local chapters that is why it became necessary and urgent for iswap to exterminate abubakar shekau and the leadership of boko haram it has territorial ambition it has political and strategic purpose it has a sectarian dressing it has a geo political design its operations have a strategic compass and political map what is unfolding in nigeria especially the virtual siege on abuja are the manifestations of these more concerted purposes and designs

reposted from socialist project july 28 2022 the return of high inflation after the global pandemic poses a major political and analytical challenge for labour and the left on top of cuts to real wages resulting from the wide gap between inflation and pay high and rising inflation has led central banks including the bank of canada to hike interest rates sharply this is raising the debt servicing costs of households businesses and governments and making new borrowing more expensive if and as interest rates result in slowing economic growth and a possible recession unemployment will rise poverty will increase and the squeeze on wages will intensify workers are being made to pay through inflation the cost of the pandemic which could have been financed through a wealth tax the international monetary fund imf is already forecasting rising unemployment and stalled growth in the major advanced economies and china while calling for tough monetary policy to deal with inflation many economists and conservative pundits are calling on governments to cut spending so as to offset the rising cost of serving public debt already inadequate public and private investments to deal with the climate crisis and the affordable housing crisis will likely be reduced and postponed high inflation followed by high unemployment as in the 1920s and 1930s in germany high inflation accompanied and followed by high unemployment may fuel the rise of the far right in canada in the 1980s high inflation plus high unemployment stagflation set the stage for the rise of neoliberal economics fiscal austerity the rise in precarious unemployment and a frontal attack on labour in response the left has understandably attacked the turn toward contractionary monetary policy as damaging and even worse than the underlying disease of inflation see stanford seccareccia and tooze while this is warranted we also need a major re thinking of macro economic and especially monetary policy as sam gindin has argued we must also reflect on how to rebuild the left and the labour movement in the context of a new economic and social crisis caused in part by labour s long standing weaknesses the fight to maintain working class living standards must be informed by the development of an alternative to neoliberalism the current inflation surge as many on the left as well as more mainstream economists and even central banks have argued the recent increase in inflation is mainly due not to too much demand in the economy but to reduced supply interrupted supply chains and shifts in the composition of demand due to the pandemic were recently exacerbated by high energy and commodity prices particularly in the wake of the war in ukraine stanford some of these factors may be transitory it would appear that many major companies with some market power have opportunistically boosted prices and profits and caused profit driven inflation though it is unclear why they did not exercise such power earlier as the left has strenuously argued rising inflation to date has been driven much more by higher profits than by higher wages and workers will and should seek to maintain real wages that said central banks are tightening monetary policy not because wages are rising rapidly but because they fear a wage price spiral similar to that of the 1970s see tooze they are acting preemptively hoping to slow the economy just enough to bring inflation back to pre pandemic levels the target rate of 2 in the case of canada they are however seemingly prepared to inflict a serious recession if they deem it to be necessary central banks believe that there is a trade off between inflation and unemployment the so called phillips curve such that higher unemployment will reduce inflation mainly through a squeeze on wages they think that the precise trade off varies and is not known precisely but is influenced above all by the bargaining power of labour set by the unionisation rate the degree of centralization of collective bargaining labour militancy unemployment benefits the minimum wage and other factors influencing the labour market milton friedman explicitly argued that unemployment should not be allowed to fall below the so called natural rate in order to achieve low and stable inflation monetary policy made by an independent central bank to maintain low inflation has been a central plank of the entire neoliberal economic agenda it has made macro economic management a seemingly technical issue and relatively side lined fiscal policy which involves inherently political debates over distributional issues and the composition of government spending today it is unlikely that a major recession will be needed to bring inflation back to pre pandemic levels given the continued weakness of labour and the strong deflationary pressures continuing to arise from global economic integration and unregulated international capital flows that said central banks are concerned that fiscal measures to fight the pandemic and demographic factors the retirement of the baby boomers have resulted in low unemployment and some tentative signs of a revival of the labour movement especially in the united states left keynesian economists in the tradition of kalecki would broadly agree that there is indeed a trade off between inflation and unemployment determined by the relative bargaining power of capital and labour within a capitalist economy see seccareccia they argue that some level of unemployment and slack in the job market is needed within the context of capitalism to discipline labour and to maintain profitability a profit squeeze induced by a rising wage share will limit business investment and undermine confidence capitalist control of the investment process thus largely constrains central banks to privilege low and stable inflation over the goal of low or full employment this is explicitly the case in canada where the central bank has only one goal to achieve the inflation target but still true of countries such as the united states which give central banks a somewhat broader mandate left keynesians argue that full employment and stable inflation could and should be maintained mainly through fiscal policy that is changes to government spending and taxes and ultimately by socialising the investment process this entails not just a major increase in public sector investment as a share of the economy but also expanded public ownership especially of the financial sector and large firms the high costs of the 1970s anti inflation turn in the late 1970s the volcker squeeze in the united states echoed in canada in the early 1980s brought down inflation from double digit levels at the cost of a deep recession and very high unemployment which seems to have more or less permanently reduced the bargaining power of labour interest rates eventually fell in line with lower inflation in the 1990s and 2000s but central banks deliberately maintained some slack in the economy to contain any inflationary pressures that experience demonstrated that monetary policy can indeed control inflation albeit at high economic and social costs most progressive economists argued that the strong emphasis of central banks on achieving and then maintaining low and stable inflation in the neoliberal era limited potential economic growth led to stagnant real wages and a shift in national income from wages to profits and helped fuel rising income and wealth inequality a broader political economy perspective would reference the failure of the labour movement and the left to fight back against tight monetary and fiscal policy maintain bargaining power in the workplace and make the case for much greater public control of investment during the so called great moderation of the 1990s and 2000s there was an extended recession free period of low interest rates steady though not spectacular growth and low and stable inflation unemployment fell from the very high levels of the early 1980s but real wages stagnated through much of the 1980s and 1990s and there was a marked rise in more precarious forms of work fine tuning ups and downs in the economy through monetary policy seemed to work and mainstream economists largely dismissed the need for fiscal policy that period came to an end with the global financial crisis and great recession of 2008 when governments rescued the banks and the entire global financial system through major injections of capital and fought a global downturn and fast rising unemployment by increasing government deficits and debt in the united states and europe central banks resorted to quantitative easing creating new money to lower both short and long term interest rates unfortunately fiscal stimulus was abandoned prematurely in favour of austerity but governments once again turned to fiscal stimulus and extraordinary monetary measures to fight the new global slump caused by the pandemic in 2020 while loose and exceptional monetary policies have now kept interest rates at low levels for more than two decades and have played a role in keeping unemployment at bay they have had important negative effects these must be taken into account by the left as noted monetary policy and central bank independence serves to depoliticize economic policy making cheap credit combined with financial deregulation has helped finance all kinds of speculative activities from housing bubbles such as that preceding the 2008 crisis to frothy stock markets to the exponential growth of the financial sector to mergers corporations have used cheap credit to finance share buy backs and large dividend payouts benefiting corporate insiders and shareholders and fuelling income and wealth inequality low interest rates have however not noticeably raised the level of real business investment in line with a rising profit share of national income low interest rates in combination with weak growth of real wages have also fuelled a huge rise in household debt even more so in canada than in the united states investment in housing has been a major factor in economic growth but over inflated house prices now pose a major threat to financial stability cheap consumer credit has also artificially maintained the living standards of ordinary working families as well as the excessive consumption of the very affluent alternatives to monetary policy and austerity monetary policy is a poor tool for fighting inflation the key problem is that central banks rely almost exclusively upon a single tool the interest rate higher rates impact negatively on business and public investment which we need and not just on financial speculation and asset price inflation they work against the compelling need to invest more rather than less to fight the climate crisis and to build affordable housing the federal government should and can ensure that financing costs for the needed energy transition as well as affordable housing are cushioned from higher interest rates we should expand public investment banks like the export development corporation and create new ones to extend low cost credit and or equity to desired productive investments these banks could be financed in part by the bank of canada subject to agreements between the bank and the federal government there should effectively be a sliding scale of interest rates manipulated by the federal government and the bank of canada to maintain a reasonably low inflation rate while protecting and promoting essential investments further we need to expand credit controls and regulations to limit flows of capital to low priority purposes we already impose some conditions such as minimum down payments and maximum debt servicing costs on home mortgage lending and borrowing but do not adequately regulate corporate borrowing while governments do monitor bank lending to the corporate sector the dominant assumption is that it is up to private financial institutions rather than the state to assess and assume risks let alone look at criteria other than risk adjusted rates of return on top of these measures impacting on financing costs of new investment the federal government should cushion the impact of inflation on lower income families by increasing tax credits such as the gst credit financed by taxes on excess corporate profits and wealth interest rates on credit cards should be reduced and regulated total borrowing for consumption can be lowered without hurting ordinary working families there is also a case to be made for selective price controls on key commodities such as energy where there is strong evidence of excess profits and damaging speculation however broader price controls would be very strongly resisted by employers if they did not also cover wages the central point is that it is not enough for the left just to oppose higher interest rates we need to greatly expand the role of fiscal policy relative to monetary policy and address inflation while also promoting low unemployment needed new investments decent wages and a much fairer distribution of income and wealth

when the president the treasury secretary and other biden administration officials insisted this week that the american economy is not currently in a recession they were mocked for weaseling out of bad news on a technicality the commerce department announced on thursday that the broadest measure of economic activity gross domestic product fell for a second quarter in a row meeting a widely held though unofficial definition of recession it is true as the biden folks argued that the nation s official recession arbiter the national bureau of economic research has yet to call one because it relies on many more signals still it sure sounded as if the biden team was splitting hairs over the past few days though i ve spent more time than is healthy listening to c e o s expound on their businesses during quarterly corporate earnings calls what can i say i m a sucker for a good time and i was surprised by what i heard the c e o s convinced me that the biden people not to mention jay powell the chair of the federal reserve who also said this week that a recession has probably not yet begun have a point the economy is in a really weird place there are definitely signs of trouble yet at some of the biggest companies in the country especially in the tech industry business is hardly all glum and even at companies that are struggling the numbers aren t nearly as bad as investors had feared at the start of the week i told my editor i d be writing about how the tech industry might be facing one of its worst slowdowns in two decades by the end of the week i found myself backing off anything so dramatic yes some companies are facing unusually difficult times business models are blowing up competition is heating up regulators are getting tougher hiring is slowing down workers are being asked to do more with less and all that s just at facebook but there are also signs that some huge businesses are ably navigating tougher times or in a label adopted by so many c e o s that i wondered if they agreed on it in a secret meeting a challenging macroeconomic environment consider some of the brightest spots qualcomm the chip making giant reported that despite that challenging macroeconomic environment profits grew more than 50 percent over last year because of strong sales of its processors used in phones and automobiles ford reported that hefty sales of its suvs and crossovers pushed its adjusted earnings before taxes and interest to more than triple from a year ago meanwhile visa mastercard and american express said americans are still spending as though there s no tomorrow we re seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending vasant prabhu visa s chief financial officer told investors many on wall street had been especially worried about results from the behemoths of big tech apple microsoft amazon and alphabet and meta the parent companies of google and of facebook these are among the most valuable american companies and they soared during the pandemic but this year big tech s growth has slowed and its stock prices have been crushed dan ives an analyst at wedbush securities who has been bullish on the tech giants said that sentiment among tech investors was the most negative he s seen since 2009 then on tuesday microsoft and alphabet released their numbers and turned the narrative around alphabet said its revenue grew by 13 percent over last year lower than usual for a money printing machine like google but not much less than analysts had been expecting and better than many had feared ives said google s not too bad results suggested that the online advertising market was holding up microsoft s results were also lower than analysts had been expecting but investors were still thrilled by them especially the 40 percent growth in microsoft s cloud services business because microsoft s core business is in providing tech services to large companies its strong cloud number shed a positive light on the entire economy ives said that was probably one of the most important data points in years for the tech sector he told me on wednesday meta put out what for it are some pretty dismal numbers among other things for the first time the company posted a drop in quarterly revenue from the same period a year ago but expectations had been very low for facebook the company s stock plummeted this year after it reported that apple s new privacy features have hampered its ability to collect data on users it has also faced persistent competition from tiktok and because mark zuckerberg facebook s founder and chief executive is spending billions to pivot the company from social networking to the metaverse the still in development virtual realm that he believes will one day be at the center of our computing experience its future looks more than a little cloudy but there was light even in meta s grim report zuckerberg said that reels the company s competitor of tiktok is gaining in popularity with users and with advertisers its user numbers have also held up meta has been dealing with so much bad news this week the federal trade commission announced that it would sue to block the company from purchasing a small virtual reality start up that expectations could hardly fall lower the street was expecting just an absolute legendary disaster ives said but compared with the expected hurricane of terrible earnings facebook s numbers were more like a little rainstorm he said after the markets closed on thursday amazon and apple reported their quarterly numbers guess what they re also mostly crushing it amazon said its cloud business grew by 33 percent over last year apple s c e o told cnbc that the company expects revenue to accelerate next quarter this year i argued that despite recent slowdowns the reign of big tech was just beginning as the economy softened over the course of the year i began to doubt my bold prediction but now i m redoubling tech giants like the rest of the economy may soon face tougher times but amazon apple microsoft google and even facebook are weathering difficult times much better than expected big tech isn t going away anytime soon the new york

now this is a rare beast the asus zenfone 9 is a small phone with a large battery and a powerful chipset it really is a beast in our review it outperformed the exynos powered galaxy s22 sd 8 gen 1 powered xiaomi 12 and others this was in performance mode and the phone can t last long at full throttle but asus new vapor chamber cooling system handled the snapdragon 8 gen 1 chipset better than expected the zenfone 9 measures 146 6 x 68 2 x 9 5mm and weighs 165g for comparison the galaxy s22 is 146 x 70 6 x 7 6mm and 167g though that is with a battery that is 600mah smaller the iphone 13 mini is 131 5 x 64 2 x 7 7mm and 141g so the zenfone isn t a mini but it is about as small as android flagships get we know there are tiny androids but they seriously compromise on features the zenfone has an ip rating gorilla glass victus 120hz display with always on mode up to 16gb of ram a large 4 300mah battery with decently fast 30w charging 0 100 in over an hour in our tests plus a pair of good quality speakers tuned by dirac speaking of audio there is a 3 5mm headphone jack which most phones skip and there is a 10 band equalizer to boot plus there are plenty of settings for charging gaming and so on so you can tweak the device to your liking this feels more like an enthusiast phone than a middle of the road offering zenfone is the mass market series from asus the zenfone 9 has some flaws however for starters we would have appreciated a microsd slot the 128 256gb storage will probably be enough for most but it would have been another advantage over mainstream models the software support is the biggest black mark on the phone however asus has only committed to two major os updates and android 13 is around the corner and at least two years of security patches that s not a lot considering the 700 800 price tag and that the software on the phone is mostly stock android with some asus magic sprinkled on top the samsung galaxy s22 800 850 will receive four os upgrades and five years of security patches that s better than google s pixel 6 3 upgrades 5 years of patches and much better than the pixel 6a which is more comparable in terms of size but only gets 3 years of patches instead of 5 the s22 not as fast as the zenfone and it is no match in terms of battery life but it does have a 3x telephoto camera instead of relying on zoom from the main sensor the zenfone is chunkier 9 1mm vs 7 6mm and even though we liked the back material we feel that all the writing and decals belong on the rog series not here as for the pixel 6 600 650 it is a good deal larger so it doesn t make for a great comparison the pixel 6a 450 460 is closer to the mark its oled panel lacks a high refresh rate mode and it only has gorilla glass 3 protection the phone as a whole is rated ip67 it does use the same tensor chipset as the flagship pixels but the main camera is a small old 12mp sensor that has to rely on google s processing magic to get decent shots samsung galaxy s22 5g google pixel 6a the sony xperia 5 iv will probably be the most direct competitor but that doesn t exist yet so let s look at the mark 3 instead 800 900 it s the same width 68mm which we think matters more than the extra centimeter of height this one does have a 120hz display a microsd slot and a 12mp telephoto camera with two focal lengths offering 3x and 4 4x magnification the large 4 500mah battery didn t last as long as the zenfone 100h vs 108h endurance but that is with the older snapdragon 888 chipset sony isn t great with updates either so it can t hold that over asus sony xperia 5 iii if you want a proper mini phone with high end features the apple iphone 13 mini 700 800 is just about the only option it forgoes luxuries like a hrr display or a telephoto camera and according to rumors there will be no iphone 14 mini to right those wrongs also being small means that its battery life isn t great 75h endurance that said all iphones from late 2016 or newer are happily running the latest ios apple iphone 13 mini the asus zenfone 9 will be available in europe hong kong and taiwan soon coming to north america japan indonesia and parts of south america a few weeks after that you can already read our review and don t miss our video review if you want more details on the pros and cons alright time to vote will you buy a zenfone 9 or will you go for something else ps if you re having trouble voting using the poll widget above try casting your vote here
a woman wheels a cart with her purchases out of a walmart on nov 18 2020 in derry n h on monday july 25 2022 walmart inc lowered its profit outlook for the second quarter and the full year citing surging inflation on basics like food that is forcing shoppers to cut back on discretionary items particularly clothing that carry higher profit margins ap photo charles krupa file in recent days executives from the biggest tech retail and consumer products companies all attempted to address questions about the state of the economy which has teetered on the brink of a recession it s complicated in silicon valley profits at tech companies like google and apple generally beat expectations but executives said there are signs of some niche slowing in consumer spending consumer products giant procter gamble said it is expecting a tougher 2023 although it s still raising prices mastercard said spending was steady among the wealthy but slowing among lower income customers meanwhile both walmart and best buy warned that when they report earnings in august it will be worse than expected in large part because of changes in consumer habits we re seeing strong growth said amazon chief financial officer brian olsavsky but we re cognizant things could change quickly four times a year the biggest publicly traded companies report how much money they re making or losing in addition to future outlooks those reports provide helpful snapshots of how consumers are spending a key metric for predicting economic performance but much like the government economic indicators reported this past week including a dip in gross domestic product and a slight bump in consumer spending companies earnings are showing that the u s economy is in a weird spot people are still spending their money but inflation means more of it is going to gas and necessities and less to categories like clothing and electronics unemployment remains low but some companies are slowing hiring and a few are beginning to lay people off outright the federal reserve again raised rates this past week in an attempt to make it harder for people to borrow more money and keep spending something aimed at slowing inflation and stabilizing the economy but it s a delicate balance as some companies are already reporting warning signs as high inflation has continued and consumer sentiment has deteriorated customer demand within the consumer electronics industry has softened best buy chief executive corie barry said in a statement wednesday echoing comments two days earlier from walmart chief executive doug mcmillon that food and fuel prices are cutting into people s ability to buy clothing and other goods those dynamics hint that americans are beginning to be careful about what they spend their money on thomas combs a 52 year old small business owner who lives in dallas said he s completely changed the way he spends money including by cutting back on treats like gourmet coffee and ice cream he said repairing his car has also gotten more expensive and he knows how difficult it would be to upgrade his car or move to a different house i don t like seeing corporations having record earnings the last couple of quarters then to be told of supply chain problems or refining or whatever is to blame for higher consumer prices combs said you grow pessimistic but realize you have to roll with it if you want to survive in today s america the biggest tech companies reported numbers that were less pessimistic than wall street had feared and the stock prices of apple amazon google and microsoft all rose after their earnings reports came out coupled with big profits for oil companies because of soaring gas prices the results helped drive the s p 500 a collection of the biggest corporations stock prices to its best month since november 2020 people were nervous there was some sort of bombshell lurking and it never showed tom essaye president of sevens report research said of tech earnings for now we sort of dodged a bullet but that didn t stop the tech company executives from engaging in some hand wringing apple accessories like watches and home device posted lower sales because of supply issues and the macroeconomic environment chief executive tim cook said thursday he added however i m not an economist and pointed out sales of the company s all important iphone were still strong apple customers tend to be middle and higher income and early adopters said consumer tech analyst carolina milanesi meaning the company is less likely to be hard hit by the uncertain economy the main message is if apple does start to feel softness that means really bad news for everybody else she said that would mean the rest of market would contract more on tuesday google chief financial officer ruth porat said some advertisers pulled back on buying google ads but its two biggest customer groups travel and retail still experienced growth we use the term uncertainty because we do think that s the best way to characterize what we re seeing porat said amazon reported results that beat expectations and the company said consumer demand was still strong but the company also said it would be more careful with hiring amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post after reporting that it had overextend itself on pandemic hiring last quarter the company said thursday that the staffing issue had largely been corrected through attrition by may looking into 2023 olsavsky said the company plans to continue to limit expansion in warehousing and logistics to better align with expected customer demand there isn t a wholesale drop in consumer spending said edward jones analyst brian yarbrough but rather mixed results in different areas at walmart where many lower income americans shop customers are prioritizing their grocery budget over extras and the retailer is preparing for that major companies reported a mix of positive and negative earnings results pfizer beat expectations on the back of its coronavirus vaccine and covid 19 treatment drug paxlovid southwest airlines said demand was strong and revenue would be higher in the third quarter than what it was even before the pandemic ups shares dropped after the shipping company missed expectations for how many parcels it would carry in the quarter general motors also fell blaming parts shortages for its inability to sell as many cars as it had wanted to consumer spending still rose in june but much of that was because things cost more and wages aren t growing as fast so people are cutting into their savings when doing their shopping according to data released friday by the government s bureau of economic analysis some categories like clothing and electronics are down and people are putting a higher proportion of their money toward housing food and gas the biggest companies in america selling billions of dollars of goods and services every week have a keen insight into how the economy is faring some of them are openly saying that consumers have cut back on spending because of high prices and economic concerns shopify the canadian e commerce company that became a 170 billion behemoth during the pandemic but has seen growth plummet as people return to in store shopping said tuesday it would fire 10 of its workforce the firm had bet that the surge in online shopping as people were forced to stay home to avoid covid 19 would fundamentally change how the retail industry works but was now seeing that e commerce growth has settled back to normal levels chief executive tobi lütke said in a blog post on the company s website it s now clear that bet didn t pay off lütke said other big tech companies slowed hiring as well and told employees to expect to do more with fewer resources google ceo sundar pichai told workers earlier this month that sunnier days were over in the company s quarterly public conference call this past week porat said the hiring slowdown would be more pronounced in 2023 signaling the company believes a downturn could last longer than just a few months amazon may also reduce hiring in its tech and engineering divisions if a significant economic downturn takes place we will continue to add head count olsavsky said but we re being very mindful of the economic conditions that could present itself some americans are saying it s a new normal shannon villa a 32 year old amazon warehouse worker who lives in birmingham ala said he s been careful with expenses acknowledges he has three kids and a mortgage but still managed to take a few trips

right it takes quite long time for airlines and airports to recruit train and get security clearance for their staff so it ll be few months before the the main crunch points are over mhm my friend advertisement europe hasn t been this cheap for americans in decades share copy link copy if you re an american visiting italy greece or spain this summer after a travel hiatus during the pandemic you re in luck meals hotels and tours are more affordable in dollars than they ve been in two decades what s happening the euro has slumped to about 1 03 plunging more than 8 against the u s dollar year to date it s now trading at its lowest level since late 2002 most analysts don t think it s bottomed out yet predictions are flying around that it could even reach parity in which one dollar can be swapped for one euro related video above post pandemic airport chaos hits europe travelers i m bearish on the euro until i see a headline that tells me global growth is going to pick up in a big way nomura strategist jordan rochester told me he thinks the euro will hit parity by the end of august breaking it down what s good for american tourists is tough on european businesses that need to buy energy raw materials and components priced in dollars the rising cost of imports could continue to boost prices across the 19 countries that use the euro where annual inflation jumped to a record high of 8 6 in june what s triggering the sell off of the euro the second most used currency in the world analysts point to a few factors the first is the economic outlook recession fears are rising globally but europe s proximity to the war in ukraine and its historic reliance on russia to meet its energy needs has made it more vulnerable than the united states natural gas prices in europe are at their highest level since march russia has cut flows of gas to europe and the major nord stream pipeline is about to undergo maintenance energy workers in norway have just gone on strike threatening further supply constraints we have an upcoming winter crisis for the euro zone and i expect energy prices will remain very strong rochester said the euro tends to perform poorly when risk appetite among investors pulls back another issue is trade germany just reported a rare monthly trade deficit a sign that high energy prices are weighing on manufacturers in europe s export powerhouse a weaker euro then becomes necessary to make the bloc s exports more competitive europe has also been behind the united states in raising interest rates though the european central bank expects to begin hiking this month that means investors are more likely to park their money in the united states where they can net better returns as interest rates climb there are concerns that bond markets in countries with high debt loads like italy and greece could come under strain the ecb has said it will work to prevent what it refers to as fragmentation but it remains a risk traders are monitoring closely clients are very concerned about all things european societe generale strategist kit juckes said tuesday germany s trade data yesterday went down badly and the sense that the current account surplus is being battered by energy prices is widely spread add in worries about fragmentation and fear that the global economy is turning south and it s hard to get even slightly upbeat about the euro it s bezos vs the white house vs inflationdecades high inflation has the white house s attention as it tries to assure americans that it s taking price increases seriously that s ramped up finger pointing at corporate america which the biden administration says is making the problem worse my message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices at the pump is simple this is a time of war and global peril president joe biden tweeted over the holiday weekend bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you re paying for the product and do it now that sparked an outcry from amazon founder jeff bezos who has been increasingly outspoken on twitter ouch inflation is far too important a problem for the white house to keep making statements like this he tweeted in response it s either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics veteran venture capitalist bill gurley also jumped into the fray he said he totally agreed with bezos pointing to the past three hundred years of economic research and understanding the white house pushed back on the criticism oil prices have dropped by about 15 over the past month but prices at the pump have barely come down that s not basic market dynamics it s a market that is failing the american consumer press secretary karine jean pierre said on twitter but i guess it s not surprising that you think oil and gas companies using market power to reap record profits at the expense of the american people is the way our economy is supposed to work checking the numbers u s oil prices have pulled back over the past month as recession fears have come to the fore west texas intermediate futures the benchmark were last trading at about 108 50 per barrel compared to over 118 50 a month ago that 10 difference is smaller than the white house s number yet it s true there hasn t been overwhelming relief at the pump the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is 4 80 one month ago it was 4 85 compared to 3 13 one year ago is that the result of price gouging perhaps in select cases but the biggest drivers of fuel prices right now are elevated demand and limited supply particularly of gas and diesel that s the result of disruptions from the pandemic the war in ukraine and the arrival of summer driving season in the northern hemisphere lack of investment in refining capacity is also exacerbating the issue 380 oil jpmorgan sees a scenario where that s possibleshortly after russia invaded ukraine global oil prices surged above 139 a barrel they were last trading below 113 but strategists at jpmorgan chase see a possible scenario in which stratospheric 380 crude could be on the cards making recent gains look puny by comparison step back last week g7 leaders agreed to hash out a plan to cap the price of russian oil this would allow the country s discounted barrels to keep hitting the market but reduce moscow s revenue details are still being nailed down but in theory to receive insurance from western companies for their cargoes customers like china and india would agree to pay only 50 to 60 per barrel that would curb income for the kremlin which has estimated the price of its export barrels will top 80 by the end of 2022 but jpmorgan s team including strategist natasha kaneva warns that russia could retaliate by intentionally curbing oil output as it s done with natural gas that would send prices through the roof if it slashed production by 3 million barrels per day the bank forecasts prices could jump to 190 per barrel in a worst case scenario of a cut of 5 million barrels per day prices could hit 380 if the geopolitical situation requires it now appears more likely that export cuts could be used as leverage policy tool in our view kaneva and colleagues wrote this month
itâ s been another positive week for markets in europe with investors taking comfort from earnings numbers that have by and large been better than expected despite concerns about the growth outlook europe the gains seen this month have offered a welcome respite while the belief that central banks may have to pare back the number of rate hikes they can deliver is also helping pushing yields sharply lower and improving the attractiveness of stocks in general the ftse 100 has seen a strong end to the week pushing above the 7 400 for the first time since early june helped by a strong performance from the banks and the mining sector natwest group offered a positive pick me up for the banks today as well as the taxpayer as it announced an interim dividend of 3 5p as well as a 16 8p special dividend after reporting a solid set of h1 numbers with the government still owning a 48 1 stake in the bank today s announcement is likely to be very welcome attributable profit to shareholders rose to just over â 1bn pushing h1 profits up to â 1 89bn as net interest margins improved from 2 46 in q1 to 2 72 in q2 taking h1 nim to 2 59 with other banks starting to add back into their impairment funds due to the rising cost of living natwest appears to be running counter to this adding back â 54m during the first half it was notable that the retail side of the business did see h1 impairments of â 26m however this was more than offset by addbacks in other parts of the business net loans to customers rose to â 188 7bn from â 184 7bn in q1 and up by â 6 5bn in the first half of the year â 5 9bn of this was by way of mortgages with lending evenly split between q1 and q2 with the remaining â 600m being made up of credit card and loan balances customer deposits increased to â 190 5bn despite all the various travel problems being encountered across the world british airways owner iag managed to see a return to profit in q2 helping briefly to push the shares to a six week high as rising travel numbers helped to push the airline back into the black a modest â 293m profit helped to take a bite out of an h1 operating loss of â 438m this is welcome news at a time when a lot of questions have been asked about the sustainability of the airlineâ s finances after 2 years of losses that have been in the billions iag said it has access to over â 9bn in cash up by â 1 2bn since december last year while net debt was down â 688m to â 10 98bn h1 total revenue came in at â 9 35bn with iag saying that it hopes that q3 capacity to be 80 in q3 and 85 in q4 a reduction of 5 from previous guidance due to the challenges at heathrow which has caused the airline to cancel hundreds of flights astrazenecashares have slipped back despite raising its forecasts for 2022 on the back of rising sales of its various covid treatments h1 revenues rose 48 to 22 16bn with the main boost being the integration of alexion helping to boost the numbers guidance for total revenue for the year was raised to a low 20 increase up from a high teenâ s denominator while core eps was left unchanged largely due to higher r d spend intertek shares are also lower after announcing a 9 5 increase in h1 revenues and a 4 rise in adjusted operating profit of â 217 3m the company however said that its full year target margin was expected to be slightly below 2021 levels the company also announced the acquisition of clean energy associates for an undisclosed sum and which provides assurance services to solar energy markets us us markets have continued to push higher after yesterdayâ s strong finish and on course for their best month since november 2020 when the announcement of a covid vaccine turbocharged markets â this shift in sentiment has not only been helped by what markets perceive as a dovish fed pivot but also a positive response to the numbers from amazon and apple which both beat expectations after hours while a lot of people have pushed back on the narrative of a fed pivot the fact that so many people hate this rally suggests it might have some legs the big test will come over the weekend or next week when fed policymakers will be allowed to have their say on tuesday we get to hear from st louis fed president james bullard as well as charles evans of the chicago fed when amazon reported its q1 numbers it posted a 3 8bn net loss due to a 7 6bn write down on its stake in rivian while also guiding lower on q2 revenues yesterday we saw yet another q2 loss this time due to a 3 9bn write down and primarily for the same reason however sales beat expectations coming in at 121 1bn with the decision to raise prices on prime not having a negative effect revenues here rose 14 to 8 7bn despite the second quarterly loss in a row the shares rallied strongly after hours after amazon guided higher for q3 with estimates for sales of between 125bn to 130bn there were also other bright spots in the q2 numbers as aws posted another record quarter of 19 74bn while operating margins came in at 2 7 well above expectations of 1 65 for q3 amazon said that operating income was likely to be affected unfavourably because of a strong us dollar there is also evidence that costs are starting to level out as operating expenses came in at 117 9bn which was below expectations with amazon shedding over 100k employees during the quarter mainly through attrition in its warehouse network appleâ s q3 numbers were eagerly awaited after they took the decision to offer discounts in china on its highest spec iphone 13 which raised more than a few eyebrows a few days ago and raised the prospect that more discounting could be coming in markets that are starting to struggle on the numbers themselves q3 revenues came in at 83bn pretty much on the money while profits came in at 1 20c a share a slight beat when broken down the picture was mixed with only the iphone and ipad products beating expectations on revenues and only the iphone showing any revenue growth from last year iphone revenues came in at 40 67bn while the ipad saw 7 22bn mac revenue fell over 1bn short at 7 38bn as did wearables and home accessories which came in at just under 8 1bn services revenue did show strong gains from last year but came in below expectations at 19 6bn by region both greater china and japan saw a decline in sales which raises the question as to whether we could also see discounting extended to japan having seen apple already do it for china apple didnâ t offer any guidance in line continuing a trend that has been in place for the last two years us oil giants exxonmobil and chevron have followed in the footsteps of shell in reporting record profits due to the sharp increases in oil and gas prices in a sign that the streaming space is becoming ever more challenging as the cost of everything goes up us streaming company roku shares have slumped sharply after missing on q2 revenues and downgrading their estimates for q3 this revenue downgrade only serves to sharpen the focus on the likes of netflix paramount global and disney and their scrap for market share talk about being between a roku and a hard place intel shares have also come under pressure after the company slashed its sales and profits guidance on the back of a slowdown in pc sales delays in the rollout of a server product appears to have hurt the business as q2 revenues fell 22 to 15 3bn â â â â â fx weâ ve seen some decent moves on fx today with the japanese yen hitting a one month high against the us dollar before losing ground as the greenback rebounded on the back of this afternoon s better than expected us economic data â â the euro was unable to benefit from the better than expected q2 gdp numbers from france italy and spain while the german economy stagnated itâ s entirely possible that the former three benefitted from a tourism boost suggesting that q3 could also be resilient however its hard to escape the conclusion that this is probably as good as it gets for all of them as we head into the autumn eu cpi presented a fresh headache for the ecb after rising to another record high for july to 8 9 with core prices rising to 4 â the pound has also slipped back after june mortgage approvals slowed to their weakest in two years at 63 7k while consumer credit jumped sharply to â 1 8bn raising concerns that consumers are going into debt in order to get by as monthly bills increase in size commodities crude oil prices have continued to gain ground with brent prices hitting a three week high above 110 a barrel and on course for their second successive weekly gain with an opec meeting next week there must be a concern amongst members of the cartel that at current prices we could start to see demand destruction even with the various disruptions caused by the war in ukraine gold prices hit three week highs today before retreating after the latest us pce inflation data came in above expectations at 4 8 the stronger than

this is the summer of the ick an ick is a point at which your initial attraction to a person flips into a feeling of disgust the causes are many and various but once someone gives you the ick all desire is killed you only want to get away you cannot ignore an ick despite your better judgment it is an unconscious gut reaction picking up on a cellular incompatibility by which i don t mean they have an android phone i felt a chill of recognition when i first heard the phrase i immediately related it to my friends who had all been using it for ages one of them told me she got the ick off a boy who didn t use pillowcases another from one who wore a lime green shirt another friend for the sake of privacy we ll call her icarus has experienced it many times including once at the prado in madrid with her then boyfriend we were looking at a painting of a fat little bacchanalian nymph baby i realised it was the spitting image of him she says we broke up shortly after but i couldn t tell him why icks strike me as a horror story how can the laws of attraction contain such perversity i ve noticed how sometimes it is the very quality we were first attracted to in a person that can flip like this whether a physical quirk their dance moves or their laugh what once was cute can become unbearable how do you get over an ick should you even try is there any guarantee it won t happen after say 30 years of marriage these questions and more are being repeated in living rooms across the country sometimes inspired by say the wrong shoes or a weird metallic smell some by love island a reality show where the ick is king quick cultural history the phrase getting the ick was actually coined for an episode of ally mcbeal in which ally tried to date the biscuit an early noughties sex and the city episode the ick factor carried the torch for a while yet ickiness entered the popular lexicon after it became a stock phrase on the island based reality show priya gopaldas got the ick on a date with brett staniland because he was boring and didn t flirt enough you probably read about it in the lrb for a time i immersed myself i scrolled through instagram and tiktok where users share their idiosyncratic turn offs under hashtags like theickisreal and theickchallenge in their hundreds of thousands as i did i began to compile an unofficial taxonomy the most obvious category was bodily i saw his bumcrack she pulled down her mask to kiss me rather than taking it off these closely correspond to the emotion of disgust a safeguard against contamination there were icks associated with obnoxious behaviours or beliefs he votes tory he s rude to waiters avoidant attachment styles showed up in complaints that he texts back too quickly he told his friends about us yet the most prevalent category was also the weirdest look up dumbest icks you won t be disappointed when he sits on a bar stool and his legs dangle seeing him struggle to find the end of the sellotape seeing him pull out his railcard when asked by the train attendant the litany of humiliation is more fine grained than observational comedy it felt like a new form one with the attentiveness of poetry to intangible indignities hard to explain impossible to justify immediately resonant when he commands alexa to do something and she ignores him when he can t open the ketchup sachet and has to use his teeth when he uses the menu card to pick out the chocolate he wants intriguingly some people undergo elective ickiness choosing to think of someone they fancy in undignified situations they do this to take the shine off anyone who does not reciprocate their feelings as an emotional hack it s brilliant imagine him trying to find a specific emoji but he can t and gives up because he s feeling discouraged imagine him eating spaghetti all red bits around his mouth imagine him trying to pat a dog but the second before his hand reaches the dog goes away she remembered swerving a boy after he giggled at one of her jokes she s not proud of it not everyone agrees that the phenomenon is real at a picnic my friend james tells me his theory that an ick is a self created lightning rod for other dissatisfactions in the relationship that haven t yet come to the surface i believe in them they re awful and there s nothing you can do about them chimes in his girlfriend she s never felt it for him though she adds he hasn t either he replies looking at her they kiss for fully a minute even though i m right there it s certainly arguable that situations don t give us the ick only people if i really fancied someone i m pretty sure they could tell me they want to dress up as eva braun while sitting on the toilet i d probably be into it it s all in the eye of the beholder i think about hugh grant in the film notting hill trying to break into a private garden before falling on his arse and saying whoopsie daisy twice that is the definition of an ick but not to julia roberts or any sane person it s one of the most charming moments ever filmed i got a text it was icarus who remembered swerving a boy after he giggled at one of her jokes she s not proud of it it was a sort of childlike titter my vagina immediately sealed over she admits this is perverse as she spends all her time making people laugh her reaction doesn t even agree with her politics i m worried it makes me sound like a binary gender stereotypes witch i privately recount all the times she s made me laugh have i ever tee heed it set me thinking about the politics of the ick the politicks for instance are they gendered the examples on social media are overwhelmingly posted by women complaining about men but culturally the behaviour has as often been associated with captious boy men like chandler from friends jerry seinfeld rejected women on a weekly basis for having man hands being too tanned talking too high or low eating peas one at a time i suspect the current trend is apolitical a move away from the dominant dating rhetoric of toxicity red flags and problematic behaviour icks are self consciously trivial and while humiliating for the ick giver hardly reflect well on the receiver either there s fallibility on all sides this is what i find so touching about the infinite list of icks we all put our underwear on one leg at a time some of us fall over while we do it do you really want to be with someone who doesn t show their railcard when asked by the guard if you break up with someone because they scream on a rollercoaster who s the loser for balance i should point out that there are videos posted by men about the things women do that give them the ick they re funny too one of them was when a girl is called amy jones it s just a boring name while they were funny scrolling the infinite list of icks also made me sad when the top of the bus is packed and he has to go back downstairs his hands were small he said rawr normally i love things that are sad and funny but it was time to delve deeper understand what was going on here he used an umbrella most of us are unheroic occasional failures some of whom keep a little trolley coin on their keyring the ick is a projection of our own shame through criticism says jo nicholl a psychotherapist specialising in relationships who hosts the love maps podcast we tell ourselves the other person is childish unsophisticated and without style because that s what we are aware of in ourselves and cannot bear it makes sense the close observational skills of the posts demonstrate a super vigilance towards embarrassment a thousand ways to be lame graceless and not fit in how easy it is to get it wrong according to nicholl this mostly shows up in the early stages of a relationship because that s when we are most vigilant scanning for flaws in our partner second guessing the criticism of our peers social media unsurprisingly amplifies this concern with how we appear to others our tragic vanity and distance from perfection when he takes a selfie and you see the reflection in the glasses nicholl also lays a fair share of the blame at the gates of love island s casa amor they re incredibly immature on that island with not fully formed brains but for people who are predisposed to pernickety little turnings away and not proud of it what is there to be done surely the experience is too visceral to overturn you can absolutely get over an ick because it s coming from you says nicholl the medicine is not easy ick is short for sick she reminds me it s baby talk suggesting a childish engagement with adult relationships rather than treating an unexpected revulsion as an immediate deal breaker we could get curious about it what are our associations what do we feel it s telling us a story about ourselves and it will serve us to understand what that story is fun reminder it s unprocessed low self worth so no one gives you the ick you do it to yourself it is your infantilisation your fear of the animal part your smallness your ugliness but there i go again i don t mean you i mean me we are all critical all the time even if we never voice it but that s not all there is to people and it s not the better part as for emotional hacks it s better to feel the pain of someone not fancying you back honestly to honour your heart s choice without fouling them disappointment is a condition of being alive and not a minor one if you do find someone you like who feels the same way do what you can to guard that tiny intangible flame here s the advice treat an ick as a relational junction you can turn left and keep looking for the elusive perfect other who completes us or you can turn terrified towards real intimacy with a human being accepting that attraction waxes and wanes like the phases of the moon because love of perfection is no love at all that s never where it shows up thank god most of us are unheroic occasional failures some of whom keep a little trolley coin on their keyring our projects are necessarily small our little caretakings pathetic hedges against catastrophes we cannot control i just can t look at icks in the same way now i know what they are before i stop scrolling i do one final search turning up the hashtag reverseicks the same attention to emotional detail but in the service of feelings far more hopeful them doing something to annoy you then running away while you chase them reading a book together and they get closer to you to see the words him letting you write on his hand we are what we pay attention to it is hard emotional maturity is like the worst i ve come up with a little poem to help if you get the ick a few weeks in they re probably going straight to the bin if your stomach is turned after a couple of years consider having compassion for the failing creature who has pledged their time and body to you failing creature that you are compassion for yourself your rage that you will not have all the things you wanted on this earth and patience for the consoling knowledge that you can have enough and be enough i m not very good at rhymes oh that s a deal breaker screw you and your poetry judgmentalism i dump you first what is the ick we are masters of post rationalisation psychotherapist philippa perry explains how this can affect our relationships human beings are story tellers over thousands of years we have evolved with our language and our storytelling we hate not knowing and we invent stories to explain the unexplainable stories bond us together as populations whether they are the histories that bind entire nations for example religions or creationist accounts or at a much more personal level the theories we exchange in a gossipy way around the water cooler to explain why someone behaves the why they do there are lots of things we don t know even about ourselves but we rarely dig deep within ourselves to explore these things instead we prefer to settle on an instant explanation when we experience feelings of disgust or suddenly going off someone we won t tolerate not knowing why we just know which is why our clever brains then come up with an explanation i just noticed his arms were ridiculously long i could never have lived with those arms we don t feel we are making these things up they feel real to us but we are making them up we are doing what some psychotherapists call post rationalisation roger sperry was an american neuropsychologist and neurobiologist who was awarded a nobel prize for his split brain research in 1981 one of the things he discovered was that when the corpus callosum the large bundle of more than 200m myelinated nerve fibres that connects the two hemispheres of the brain permitting communication between the right and left sides is cut which was then the only cure for some forms of severe epilepsy you were able to give the right side of the brain a message or a command such as get up and walk around the room by introducing it to the left ear or the left eye the right brain controls the left side of the body if you then asked the left side of the brain why the subject had got up and walked about the room the person would always come up with a perfectly reasonable explanation such as i thought someone had knocked on the door or i wanted to get a drink the subject never said i got up because you are experimenting on me and told me to do some weird stuff sperry s research proved that we always come up with a story to justify our actions and i think this can be applied to our feelings too we will always come up with something to explain what we feel in short human beings are masters in the art of post rationalisation and what we need to do to evolve is learn to sit with not knowing the reason for a feeling but that can be very tricky i ll let you know when i ve mastered it pick of the icks here s a few of our favourites when they split the bill to the penny when they hold the remote up high to change the tv channel when they bite the fork while eating when they hold a fish in a photo when they shazam a song from the back seat when they wait for the shower to warm up when the waiter says they ve run out of what they want so they have to find something else on the menu when they chase a pingpong ball when they repeat a joke because they think nobody has heard it when they run with a rucksack when they walk angrily in flip flops when they own a pencil case when they chase a piece of paper in the wind when they clap when the plane lands when they mix up their they re and there

capitalize on its efforts with an inaugural fintech summit that will attract up to 400 bankers and startups it hasn t always been like that the initiative got little respect in the early days an article depicting its struggles to land downtown on main street its main offices today noted the technology park where it was then housed was home to startup companies with scant operations or revenue that are renting space there weren t many reasons to pay attention in the early days the venture center in its first year had no money no staff and no offices the venture center itself is a great example of the entrepreneur journey little rock regional chamber of commerce president and chief executive officer jay chesshir recalls we were bootstrapping it just like an entrepreneur would bootstrap a company the venture center traces its roots back to 2005 when the chamber began to drum up support to create a research and technology park which today is the little rock technology park a 38 000 square foot space on main street that houses the venture center s operations legislation to create the tech park was passed in 2007 and in 2011 little rock voters helped fund it with 22 million from sales tax proceeds the venture center s unassuming beginnings turned around when fis inc fidelity national information services jumped in with financial support in 2016 after an initial effort to entice another local company failed gary norcross chief executive officer of fis which started in 1968 as systematics inc in little rock is a university of arkansas grad who began work with the company as a management trainee we have such a proud heritage of being a part of little rock and part of arkansas and that is something we don t take lightly norcross said in 2015 when he was keynote speaker at the chamber s annual meeting the company s support led to development of the fis fintech accelerator a 12 week bootcamp where bankers and financial services executives engage in hands on sessions that help refine the products and services fintech startups are developing similarly the independent community bankers of america forged a partnership with the venture center in 2020 to create the icba thinktech accelerator which brings in startups to pitch and hone products specifically for the community banking sector the center has branched out to offer local programs and events to the central arkansas community including an accelerator in partnership with the chamber that is limited to area startups banking boost the banking team at stephens inc has increased price targets

the us economy contracted for a second straight quarter between april and june according to official data released thursday adding fuel to recession fears and creating a headache for president joe biden ahead of midterm elections gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0 9 percent in the second quarter following a bigger drop in the first three months of the year according to the commerce department while not the official definition two quarters of negative growth is commonly viewed as a strong signal that a recession is underway and a downturn in the world s largest economy would have global consequences as well as domestic political costs biden insisted that the us economy is on the right path despite the slowdown touting the strong labor market that doesn t sound like a recession to me he said in remarks at the white house noting unemployment at near record lows and more than a million jobs created in the latest quarter but his critics are sure to seize on the report as proof of the veteran democrat s mismanagement after a 1 6 percent decline in the first three months of the year the report said the slowdown in the latest quarter was largely due to drops in government spending at all levels in private investment on goods including autos and on residential buildings despite an increase in exports but personal consumption expenditures pce continued to increase though at a slower rate than the prior quarter the data showed still american families continue to feel the bite from sky high inflation as a result of supply chain snarls due to covid 19 lockdowns as well as the fallout from russia s war in ukraine which has sent food and fuel prices soaring consumer prices topped nine percent in june the highest in more than four decades and the gdp data showed another key inflation measure the pce price index rose a still high 7 1 percent in the latest three months the same as in the january march period but gas prices at the pump have fallen 74 cents since hitting a record of more than 5 a gallon in mid june the us central bank has been raising interest rates aggressively with the latest big hike on wednesday to try to cool the economy and tamp down price pressures it s no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the federal reserve acts to bring down inflation biden said in a statement shortly after the gdp report was released but even as we face historic global challenges we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure he said recession debate it would be highly unusual for an economy still adding jobs at a rapid pace and with near record low unemployment to fall into recession even so many economists say the discussion of a downturn is more a matter of when not if that poses a major political headache for the president who has seen his approval ratings plummet in recent months the government just announced what every american has been feeling for nearly a year we are in a recession house republican leader kevin mccarthy said on twitter democrats would rather redefine a recession than restore a healthy economy but fed chair jerome powell agreed with biden and other economists who say the gdp figures are inconsistent with other strong data powell on wednesday said he does not think the country is currently in a recession because there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well treasury secretary janet yellen said thursday there was a path to lower inflation without triggering an uptick in joblessness though she acknowledged numerous risks to the economic outlook mike fratantoni chief economist of the mortgage bankers association was among those who echoed powell s view saying the ongoing strength in the job market and other signs of growth make it unlikely that this will be categorized as a recession powell also said it is possible to cool price pressures without causing a downturn or a big jump in joblessness although he acknowledged the path to threading that needle is narrowing but economist mohamed el erian said on twitter that the data point to deepening stagflation and flashing red recession risk that impression may be the one that sticks in the minds of investors and consumers wall street was initially not happy with the data but stocks rebounded and ended the day with solid gains of more than one percent afp

this past week in the midst of many competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced by powell s little known institution the fed is the latest washington power center trying to smile for its closeup caught in the bright glare of contemporary media attention like the supreme court which has been barricaded behind new fencing since it overturned the federal protection for abortion rights the fed governors have preferred to exercise their extraordinary authority quietly in near anonymity the same could be said for top decisionmakers at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and others responsible for fighting the covid and monkeypox viruses scientists such as dr anthony fauci have become household names and symbols praised as saviors and condemned as tyrants the curtain has even been drawn back on the constitution based oddity known as the electoral college an assembly of 538 actual persons who meet at a specified interval every four years and elect the president normally a routine exercise noticed by few the electoral college has become another focal point in the current congressional investigation of former president trump s efforts to stay in office after losing the 2020 election that particular investigation has even pierced some of the murkiness of the secret service which cannot account for the loss of critical text messages during the jan 6 attack on the capitol all these institutions are usually run by individuals who operate with little public notice and speak in the code of their own professional expertise each agency has its unwritten protocols which have minimal oversight and scant public knowledge and they have an extraordinary level of authority while their top officials have been appointed by a president at some point they all operate with remarkable independence thereafter the special case of the fed secretive as many parts of the government may be there are moments when any may be subject to exposure this past week it was showtime for the fed powell was on tv to read out a number set by an internal committee of the board a committee he also chairs it is called the federal open market committee and it votes on the federal funds rate which governs the cost of loans between financial institutions the fomc consists of the seven presidentially appointed governors of the federal reserve and five from among the 12 presidents of the regional federal reserve banks new york boston philadelphia richmond cleveland atlanta chicago st louis minneapolis dallas kansas city and san francisco the image has long been that of a crusty collection of aging white males who tend to be conservative financiers the current board however has come to look a good deal more like the country the seven presidentially appointed members include the recently confirmed vice chair lael brainard and two other women two of the seven are african americans both appointed by president biden in partisan terms three are republicans including powell and four are democrats powell was originally appointed as a fed governor by president obama in 2012 reappointed by him in 2014 and elevated to chairman by trump in 2018 he was re appointed as chairman this year by biden who has now appointed or re appointed five of the seven members of the board this week the change in the federal funds rate the number the nation was waiting to hear came in at 75 as in 75 basis points or three quarters of one percent it was instantly fed into countless computer programs and repeated endlessly in the media all over the world it moved the financial markets globally in real time and the remarks powell read from his notes on old fashioned paper this week actually cheered some investors and helped the stock market indices to their best 3 day rally in months and the s p 500 to its best month since 2020 the federal funds rate can also determine the fate of individual businesses and the direction of entire industries not to mention the trajectories of presidents and their political parties powell made clear the fomc s intent was to restrain the effects of inflation which last month came in at an annualized rate of more than 9 as has been widely noted that was the highest in four decades this week another number the personal consumption expenditures price index pce came in hotter than expected pointing to the likelihood our current inflation is already in double digit territory the other number which got far more attention was this week s gross domestic product reading for june it showed the economy grew in nominal dollars in the first six months of the year but actually shrank by a little less than a percentage point when the numbers are adjusted for inflation that made for the second three month period in a row with such a reading the shrinkage for the first quarter of the year had been 1 6 percent that met one common definition for a recession although not the one preferred by most economists the moment vs the momentum after his announcement this week powell also read comments suggesting more rate hikes would be likely but not automatic he noted that the latest increase the fourth this year brought the benchmark as high as 2 5 a hefty move considering that the fed s rate had been in effect zero an extreme reached twice in recent history the first was in 2009 in the so called great recession the second in the recession of 2020 2021 the followed the onset of covid powell stuck around onstage answering reporters questions about recession the chairman made it clear he did not see a recession at the moment due to strong production and sales numbers and the continuing strength of hiring in the job market the unemployment rate is a strikingly low 3 6 as of june powell may well be right about the moment but he knows that s not the same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm elections for generations still in the complex economic and political environment of our post covid world it is possible that past experiences are less than perfect predictors the performance of equity markets such as the s p 500 late in the week was taken as evidence the economic picture might be brighter than imagined the hope is that the fastest rate hikes since fed chairman paul volcker s reign of terror began in 1979 can have the desired effect without anything approaching the same degree of collateral damage there may be no such thing as a perfect soft landing but powell at this point can at least hope for what he calls softish a storied past the fed is now 109 years old a creation of the federal reserve act of 1913 during what we now call the progressive era president woodrow wilson and his first session of congress had the rather idealistic notion of removing certain key economic decisions from the pressures of politics and the markets its initial purpose was to manage the money supply maintain value and prevent the kind of panics that had periodically plagued the economy in the 1800s since world war ii however it has become increasingly imperative for the fed to also mind levels of unemployment in making its calculations this dual mandate has complicated fed operations ever since and powell alluded to it this week powell is the 16th person to chair the fed and the latest to struggle with those decisions and pressures while some have been more successful than others all have been caught in the crossfire of criticism while in the job and especially after leaving it some who were hailed as heroes in their tenure have subsequently borne blame for bad things that happened later alan greenspan was dubbed an economic maestro by some journalists and one biographer for his 18 years as charman 1987 2006 a period when even sharp increases in the federal funds rate often had relatively manageable consequences but after he retired greenspan was faulted by some for the rapid rise in home valuations and alternative debt instruments that led to the crash of 2008 and the great recession that followed reagan stuck with the medicine and its medicine man volcker who chaired the fed from the fateful summer of 1979 until greenspan took over has been lionized as the man who beat double digit inflation appointed by president jimmy carter at a point when inflation had reached nearly 14 volcker immediately set about persuading the board of his day that drastic measures were mandatory at the time the resulting inflationary psychology was so deeply embedded that almost everyone despaired at purging it wrote financial journalist robert samuelson in his book the great inflation and its aftermath in 2008 only the unexpectedly savage recession of 1981 82 when unemployment peaked at nearly 11 percent succeeded in doing so that savage recession had already begun by the summer of 1981 when volcker and his board continued raising the federal funds rate past 20 volcker was not cooling the economy so much as strangling it even before that recession struck with full force the stagflation of the 1970s had proved too much for carter while other issues mattered in carter s loss to republican ronald reagan in the 1980 election economics had set the stage reagan stuck by the medicine and the medicine man volcker and his board raised the federal funds rate as high as 20 in 1981 srre enough republicans suffered losses around the country in the midterms of 1982 especially in governorships but reagan s working majority of republicans and conservative democrats in congress survived largely intact he reappointed volcker the following year as the medicine continued to prove effective against the underlying disease widely vilified as the man who brought on double digit joblessness in the early 1980s volcker had the satisfaction of seeing both the unemployment number and the inflation rate beaten back down into low single digits during his second term as chairman he retired but returned to advise the policymakers dealing with the wall street crisis in 2008 copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
the recent record setting heatwave should serve as an alarming reminder that climate change is already threatening our communities our infrastructure and businesses in massachusetts the current projections for rising temperatures and extreme heat demand urgent action in greater boston in the absence of federal action on climate legislation we are fortunate to have policymakers in city and state governments as well as the business community who understand the need for the commonwealth to pass aggressive and achievable buildings policies to continue our role as a national climate leader buildings are the number one source of emissions in boston and the second largest source of emissions statewide so decarbonizing our building stock is essential to achieving the climate commitments of a net zero economy by 2050 cambridge breaks from peers municipalities like boston and cambridge are taking actions to reduce emissions from large existing buildings the city of boston signed an updated building emissions reduction and disclosure ordinance or berdo 2 0 into law in october 2021 requiring existing buildings to reduce emissions every five years with the goal of reaching net zero by 2050 a better city was grateful to partner with the city of boston in the development of the berdo 2 0 and we believe it is an aggressive but achievable policy that targets our largest emitters while also protecting our most vulnerable communities meanwhile members of the cambridge city council are proposing an update to their building energy use and disclosure ordinance beudo with the target of making sure existing buildings reach net zero by 2035 this approach runs counter to the work of their own office of community development and beudo stakeholders as well as utilities own net zero by 2050 timeline this advanced timeline and process is not something a better city can support based on the technological and workforce development challenges discovered in our work for berdo 2 0 in boston hopefully we can find a workable compromise with the cambridge city council that ensures better alignment and consistency across emission standards and then build on this for all the building policies across the commonwealth local fossil fuel bans a bad idea at the state level the department of energy resources continues to update the state s current stretch energy code and develop a specialized municipal opt in stretch energy code consistent with the climate bill passed 2021 these codes along with an update to the base building code will become effective in january 2023 within the state house the legislature recently passed a new bill to encourage the clean energy and offshore wind sectors this legislation contains beneficial language that develops a new reporting mechanism for existing large buildings over 20 000 square feet consistent with the threshold under berdo 2 0 and an earlier iteration of berdo that focused on reporting and disclosure as of this writing it was unclear whether gov charlie baker would veto a concerning section of the bill allowing 10 municipalities to ban the use of fossil fuels in new developments either way this proposal never should have made it to his desk such ideas effectively create a fourth building code for developers to comply with separate from updates to the state stretch energy code currently being finalized a better city has asked the governor to veto this specific proposal as it does not specify how it aligns with the state s other building codes and provides no clarification of the energy grid s capacity to support an increase in electricity demand from fully electrified buildings setting new rules for 10 of what would likely be the state s wealthiest and most well resourced municipalities would likely exacerbate inequities by forcing lower income neighborhoods to support fossil fuel infrastructure and carry an increased energy burden collaboration necessary to move forward building owners developers and tenants deserve consistency across building policies to justify needed investments in deep energy retrofits and building decarbonization initiatives as our downtowns businesses and regional economy continues to rebound from the economic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic misaligned and patchwork building policies can confuse and stall developers leading to even greater delays increased costs in construction and potentially discourage new investment in this region city and state agencies alike must continue to proactively work with the real estate and development communities to develop aligned and consistent building polices while also exploring necessary technological innovations and transitional financing strategies like carbon offsets to promote carbon sequestration and carbon removal technology or a climate bank that could fund decarbonization initiatives across capital budget cycles collaboration between utilities and the public sector is also essential to modernize the grid and to increase renewable energy development that delivers the needed green energy capacity that leads to our emission reduction commitments while we hope the federal government changes course and rises up to this challenge massachusetts can move forward on these smart consistent approaches toward building emission reduction and energy use policies if we continue on this path massachusetts can achieve a cost effective transition to a decarbonized economy and we can help to address our most pressing climate challenges rick dimino is ceo of a better city

economies are all about balance but right now the global economy is out of whack covid 19 and russia s invasion of ukraine are unsettling economies around the world by increasing the prices of goods and services the flow on effects of the pandemic and war have combined with the individual circumstances of different countries to influence inflation and here in australia it has resulted in inflation reaching 6 1 per cent a high not reached for two decades inflation has hit a high this century australia economist conrad liveris said an inflation rate of about two to three per cent would be ideal as that level results in steady growth in an economy and wages that s the reserve bank of australia s target we want that because it helps economic growth he said it s when it gets out of control that things go backwards or even higher like what we ve got in australia at the moment mr liveris said as wages are not rising at that same level as inflation the cost of living becomes a lot harder to manage is a fourth consecutive rate rise on the cards for australia in a bid to curb inflation the reserve bank has been hiking its cash rate which influences how banks set their interest rates the consensus of financial market economists is for the rba to raise the cash rate for the fourth time in a row by half a percentage point to 1 85 per cent a half a percentage point increase also known as a 50 basis point rate increase will see the average mortgage holder on a variable interest rate paying an extra 610 per month to service their loan compared to four months ago inflation in the g20 runs from 78 6 per cent to 2 3 per cent united states of america american president joe biden is hoping new legislation his government is backing will curb escalating inflation inflation rose to 9 1 per cent in the usa in june of 2022 the highest since november 1981 the inflation reduction act is wide ranging covering changes to healthcare and taxes and encompassing measures aimed at addressing climate change americans are experiencing much of the same issues around the price of groceries and fuel as in australia but to a greater extent for them it s issues with supply from china and and fuel it s the household staples for them that s really causing these sorts of issues and it s just going it s causing you know distinct pain mr liveris said americans are feeling the pinch when shopping for everyday items source aap seth perlman ap he said the level of government stimulus in the us was higher than in australia which played a part in inflation the government s doing a lot of investment into different projects primarily infrastructure and providing some government handouts and that s causing pressure on prices as well mr liveris said but it s not always the best thing because when you give people 500 they go out and spend it immediately and businesses are pretty good at recognising that so they put up their prices to meet that it s the same when you give a large group of people rental assistance landlords put up their price for rent turkey while the turkish statistical institute has said the country s inflation rate accelerated for the 13th consecutive month to 78 6 per cent in june of 2022 mr liveris said given the way the turkish government had been operating he would be hesitant about any data released by the country on inflation rates with people in turkey struggling to afford just a portion of the grocery items they would previously have purchased for their household it is obvious though that the current level of inflation in the country is above and beyond most of turkey s g20 counterparts mr liveris said the high inflation in turkey has been pushed up as a direct result of the country s lack of independence between institutions and the government on the instructions of president recep tayyip erdoğan rather than increasing interest rates in an attempt to counter inflation the country has instead lowered interest rates erdogan has voiced beliefs that high interest rates push prices higher the opposite of conventional economic belief and has fired central bankers who have raised rates to bring inflation under control prices can rise faster when there s a geographical distance that needs to be navigated conrad liveris new zealand new zealand began feeling the pinch from inflation ahead of australians forcing some to consider a move across the ditch to australia in the june quarter new zealand recorded a 7 3 per cent increase in the inflation rate slightly higher than what economists had forecast in day to day life this has seen the cost of fruit and vegetables rise by 18 per cent in the past year and increased housing costs wellington has been ranked as one of the world s least affordable cities in the world to buy a house and rents have increased by 12 per cent in the past year new zealanders are having to combat the rising cost of living along with the inflation rate at the highest it has been since 1990 credit phil walter getty images the reserve bank of new zealand has implemented six consecutive rises in interest rates and economists are warning there could be a further three increases mr liveris said the remoteness of new zealand as a country is the likely influence of it having a slightly higher inflation rate than australia because it s further away from places it s actually a harder location to get to and so you ve got to put in greater effort so prices can rise faster when there s a geographical distance that needs to be navigated japan japan is seeing some of the lowest inflation rates compared to other developed economies with the latest annual inflation rate at 2 4 per cent in june that s pretty healthy that s kind of where you d want it but saying that japan has quite a complex economy with very high levels of government debt mr liveris said japan s inflation rate has been steady source aap sopa images sipa usa they have an issue called stagflation and they ve had it for decades which is by basically where things are kind of just really stable and still world bank president david malpass has warned the global economy could fall into stagflation

reach of most but that doesn t mean you can t dream below jonathan driver helps pipe in some additional fantasy fuel in an exclusive forbes interview he waxes philosophical about his life ladyburn and everything william grant sons tell us about your career in the industry and how you eventually got involved with ladyburn jonathan driver i ve been involved in various roles in scotch whisky since the 1980s from that time i have had the privilege of observing this fascinating industry of collectible whiskies rise as it has over the years the growth of the single malt market and the interest in rarity and uniqueness grew out of a wine literate consumer base as wealth has been created over recent years there has been a parallel growth of collectable single malt whisky for the last two decades i have been involved specifically in the private client business which included being part of the founding team of whyte mackay s avant garde private clients business which expanded its reach to asian european and north american collecting networks what made that so avant garde jonathan driver at this point there was a sea change we were looking differently at the rare and the unique in whisky to the point where single malt parcels that had not been able to be commercialized historically now became attractive within weeks of joining william grant sons to set up the private clients division i was tasting stocks from old rare and unique whisky stocks from the family archive released for sale to private clients i had never tasted ladyburn before it was evident that this was exceptional but we had such limited stocks what makes ladyburn such a special distillery and where did it get that unique name from jonathan driver ladyburn occupies a remarkable place in the history of whisky it marks the inflection point in whisky manifesting two styles of whisky premodern and modern ladyburn epitomises the bravery of the grant family in building the distillery of the future the two brothers charles and sandy joint managing directors and their uncle eric lloyd roberts chairman and mentor to his two nephews it was a vanguard project building a distillery like no other its beautiful and efficient mechanization a pantheon of modernity by the mid 1970s a radical revision of capacity was needed and the business was forced to make a choice ladyburn or the balvenie ladyburn s sacrifice allowed balvenie to fulfill its destiny after only operating from 1966 until 1975 ladyburn closed and no trace remains the ladyburn stills went to the balvenie and the learnings from ladyburn informed the rebuilding of glenfiddich in the 1970s in automotive terms ladyburn was a true concept car name derives from the small river lady burn which runs into the sea just north of where the distillery was located if they were making distillate this incredible why did they ever shutter in the first place jonathan driver ladyburn was technologically advanced and played a key role in the development of single malt scotch whisky leading the category through experimentation however due to changing tastes and trends favoring vodka at this time along with economic challenges of the 1970s including the oil crisis many distilleries shut down in the 1980s what became known as the whisky loch afflicted the industry in the 1970s and 1980s where too much whisky was produced in comparison to waning demand caused by the growing popularity of other spirits ladyburn was one of the first distilleries to close in 1975 the decision was purely commercial focusing on capacity and the market landscape was the distillery mothballed at first or just immediately dissembled jonathan driver the distillery was immediately dismantled with assets transferred within the group it was a difficult family decision due to the distinct lack of confidence in the market at the time what can we say about the grain sourcing and barrel sourcing of these particular expressions and how they play a role in the ultimate flavour of the liquid jonathan driver there are no records on specific grain sourcing as it is forensically retained today and no records of specific cask sourcing either the casks would have been purchased through specialist brokers of the time and the majority of casks bought by william grant sons in this period were european oak it is significant that the casks sourced to house distillate in 1966 were all european oak casks and therefore bring that early 20th century perhaps even late 19th century wood influence william grant sons private clients division how much stock is left of ladyburn after this how many barrels in total approximately and how many more releases can we look forward to in the future jonathan driver the situation is constantly changing due to evaporation and influence of the wood we have a small parcel of ladyburn 1966 1973 and 1974 there is nothing in intervening years there is only a finite quantity of casks and ladyburn liquid left and stocks are dwindling fast the current release is ladyburn 1966 edition two which is available exclusively through the private client channels talk about the substantial differences between the first and second releases jonathan driver the distillates of the time were powerfully influenced by the wood european oak in this instance there are nuances from cask to cask across all the tasting notes there are small differences playing to a maturation led style ladyburn one and ladyburn two share the same character with extreme time in the wood drawing out the following nuances ladyburn one has a linseed nose with a more astringent style it has dark chocolate notes but carries the patina of age that you only ever find in extremely rare and old whiskies ladyburn two has a christmas cake note it s sweeter with darker fruit and spice this is a big dark rich extraordinary wood driven aroma and wood notes the newest release is packaged very differently from how we ve grown accustomed to seeing ultra premium scotch releases tell us about the thought that went into that and are these products actively being marketed to a different clientele than typical ultra rare scotches jonathan driver the ladyburn edition triptych series is a uniquely labelled art and whisky collectors set from one of the shortest lived distilleries in history edition two is a 55 year old whisky bottled in 2021 paired with sought after photography by norman parkinson celebrating the pioneering fashion and spirit of transformation of the 1960s as revealed in parkinson s works and ladyburn whisky rarely seen works from david bailey edition one pioneering photography and norman parkinson edition two transforming fashion each bring ladyburn whisky to the fore as a cultural artifact the third edition will lead on design designed to be displayed like a work of art the dark mahogany coloured ultra rare ladyburn 1966 is bottled in unique artist labelled decanters each carefully curated to align with the ideas of transformation and boldness that characterised the 1960s ladyburn was only in operation for nine years between 1966 and 1975 yet this brief pioneering period spans the two decades that transformed the future of scotch whisky the triptych is a family whilst each release has its own story and personality they are designed to sit together in the manner of an art collection
this past week in the midst of many competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced by powell s little known institution the fed is the latest washington power center trying to smile for its closeup caught in the bright glare of contemporary media attention like the supreme court which has been barricaded behind new fencing since it overturned the federal protection for abortion rights the fed governors have preferred to exercise their extraordinary authority quietly in near anonymity the same could be said for top decisionmakers at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and others responsible for fighting the covid and monkeypox viruses scientists such as dr anthony fauci have become household names and symbols praised as saviors and condemned as tyrants the curtain has even been drawn back on the constitution based oddity known as the electoral college an assembly of 538 actual persons who meet at a specified interval every four years and elect the president normally a routine exercise noticed by few the electoral college has become another focal point in the current congressional investigation of former president trump s efforts to stay in office after losing the 2020 election that particular investigation has even pierced some of the murkiness of the secret service which cannot account for the loss of critical text messages during the jan 6 attack on the capitol all these institutions are usually run by individuals who operate with little public notice and speak in the code of their own professional expertise each agency has its unwritten protocols which have minimal oversight and scant public knowledge and they have an extraordinary level of authority while their top officials have been appointed by a president at some point they all operate with remarkable independence thereafter the special case of the fed secretive as many parts of the government may be there are moments when any may be subject to exposure this past week it was showtime for the fed powell was on tv to read out a number set by an internal committee of the board a committee he also chairs it is called the federal open market committee and it votes on the federal funds rate which governs the cost of loans between financial institutions the fomc consists of the seven presidentially appointed governors of the federal reserve and five from among the 12 presidents of the regional federal reserve banks new york boston philadelphia richmond cleveland atlanta chicago st louis minneapolis dallas kansas city and san francisco the image has long been that of a crusty collection of aging white males who tend to be conservative financiers the current board however has come to look a good deal more like the country the seven presidentially appointed members include the recently confirmed vice chair lael brainard and two other women two of the seven are african americans both appointed by president biden in partisan terms three are republicans including powell and four are democrats powell was originally appointed as a fed governor by president obama in 2012 reappointed by him in 2014 and elevated to chairman by trump in 2018 he was re appointed as chairman this year by biden who has now appointed or re appointed five of the seven members of the board this week the change in the federal funds rate the number the nation was waiting to hear came in at 75 as in 75 basis points or three quarters of one percent it was instantly fed into countless computer programs and repeated endlessly in the media all over the world it moved the financial markets globally in real time and the remarks powell read from his notes on old fashioned paper this week actually cheered some investors and helped the stock market indices to their best 3 day rally in months and the s p 500 to its best month since 2020 the federal funds rate can also determine the fate of individual businesses and the direction of entire industries not to mention the trajectories of presidents and their political parties powell made clear the fomc s intent was to restrain the effects of inflation which last month came in at an annualized rate of more than 9 as has been widely noted that was the highest in four decades this week another number the personal consumption expenditures price index pce came in hotter than expected pointing to the likelihood our current inflation is already in double digit territory the other number which got far more attention was this week s gross domestic product reading for june it showed the economy grew in nominal dollars in the first six months of the year but actually shrank by a little less than a percentage point when the numbers are adjusted for inflation that made for the second three month period in a row with such a reading the shrinkage for the first quarter of the year had been 1 6 percent that met one common definition for a recession although not the one preferred by most economists the moment vs the momentum after his announcement this week powell also read comments suggesting more rate hikes would be likely but not automatic he noted that the latest increase the fourth this year brought the benchmark as high as 2 5 a hefty move considering that the fed s rate had been in effect zero an extreme reached twice in recent history the first was in 2009 in the so called great recession the second in the recession of 2020 2021 the followed the onset of covid powell stuck around onstage answering reporters questions about recession the chairman made it clear he did not see a recession at the moment due to strong production and sales numbers and the continuing strength of hiring in the job market the unemployment rate is a strikingly low 3 6 as of june powell may well be right about the moment but he knows that s not the same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm elections for generations still in the complex economic and political environment of our post covid world it is possible that past experiences are less than perfect predictors the performance of equity markets such as the s p 500 late in the week was taken as evidence the economic picture might be brighter than imagined the hope is that the fastest rate hikes since fed chairman paul volcker s reign of terror began in 1979 can have the desired effect without anything approaching the same degree of collateral damage there may be no such thing as a perfect soft landing but powell at this point can at least hope for what he calls softish a storied past the fed is now 109 years old a creation of the federal reserve act of 1913 during what we now call the progressive era president woodrow wilson and his first session of congress had the rather idealistic notion of removing certain key economic decisions from the pressures of politics and the markets its initial purpose was to manage the money supply maintain value and prevent the kind of panics that had periodically plagued the economy in the 1800s since world war ii however it has become increasingly imperative for the fed to also mind levels of unemployment in making its calculations this dual mandate has complicated fed operations ever since and powell alluded to it this week powell is the 16th person to chair the fed and the latest to struggle with those decisions and pressures while some have been more successful than others all have been caught in the crossfire of criticism while in the job and especially after leaving it some who were hailed as heroes in their tenure have subsequently borne blame for bad things that happened later alan greenspan was dubbed an economic maestro by some journalists and one biographer for his 18 years as charman 1987 2006 a period when even sharp increases in the federal funds rate often had relatively manageable consequences but after he retired greenspan was faulted by some for the rapid rise in home valuations and alternative debt instruments that led to the crash of 2008 and the great recession that followed reagan stuck with the medicine and its medicine man volcker who chaired the fed from the fateful summer of 1979 until greenspan took over has been lionized as the man who beat double digit inflation appointed by president jimmy carter at a point when inflation had reached nearly 14 volcker immediately set about persuading the board of his day that drastic measures were mandatory at the time the resulting inflationary psychology was so deeply embedded that almost everyone despaired at purging it wrote financial journalist robert samuelson in his book the great inflation and its aftermath in 2008 only the unexpectedly savage recession of 1981 82 when unemployment peaked at nearly 11 percent succeeded in doing so that savage recession had already begun by the summer of 1981 when volcker and his board continued raising the federal funds rate past 20 volcker was not cooling the economy so much as strangling it even before that recession struck with full force the stagflation of the 1970s had proved too much for carter while other issues mattered in carter s loss to republican ronald reagan in the 1980 election economics had set the stage reagan stuck by the medicine and the medicine man volcker and his board raised the federal funds rate as high as 20 in 1981 srre enough republicans suffered losses around the country in the midterms of 1982 especially in governorships but reagan s working majority of republicans and conservative democrats in congress survived largely intact he reappointed volcker the following year as the medicine continued to prove effective against the underlying disease widely vilified as the man who brought on double digit joblessness in the early 1980s volcker had the satisfaction of seeing both the unemployment number and the inflation rate beaten back down into low single digits during his second term as chairman he retired but returned to advise the policymakers dealing with the wall street crisis in 2008 copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
standing around the campfire at bradbury mountain state park on a recent summer evening i shielded my eyes from the smoke as i tried to decide whether to lift the lid on the pot for our dinner to check if the water was boiling so i could finally add the macaroni on the one hand i risked letting the heat escape on the other hand i was hungry that evening as we attempted to produce a nutritious filling dinner in the out of doors my mom and i encountered more than our fair share of setbacks but i felt better about our efforts after talking with elaine taylor a volunteer support specialist at the girl scouts of maine mistakes are part of it she reassured me about campfire cooking when you think about it camping is an adventure and it makes sense sometimes campfire cooking is too since that night i ve come to understand that campfire cooking is really about balancing hypervigilance around safety with experimentation around taste taylor gave me tips and tricks for avoiding that all consuming storm cloud of rumbling stomachs and short tempers that can invade a campsite at a moment s notice especially after a long day of summertime adventuring camp food then and now my earliest memories of camping are of scavenging around campsites with friends for the perfect kindling and marshmallow roasting sticks my mom playing the guitar my dad applying bug spray and of course the campfire crackling and glowing at dusk when i was growing up no camping packing list was complete without a large pot plastic bowls biodegradable soap and a sponge and if we were really prepared a cooler of ingredients for dinners over the camp stove or fire advertisement two weeks ago my mom loaded the same familiar staples into the car and met me in pownal for an impromptu one night only mother daughter camping trip i drove there straight from work and arrived tired hungry and still dressed in my work clothes mom had packed our ancient coleman camping stove but we quickly realized we d brought the wrong fuel the only thing we had that didn t require cooking was an apple and some chips clearly if we wanted dinner we d have to switch gears so starting with old newspaper as kindling another reason to subscribe to the portland press herald we built a log cabin style fire think lincoln logs and we were off after we d got the fire going we set our pots up on a grate and boiled water for rice and for annie s mac and cheese in another pan we sautéed vegetables and chickpeas with tikka masala sauce cooked on the fire and without a lid the curry developed a deliciously smoky taste i doubt i d be able to replicate at home but minus that culinary bonus you can cook many of the same dishes on a campfire as you might in your own kitchen as long as you have patience and good music to help you pass the time while you wait for the water to boil in the end my mom and i were successful in feeding our growling bellies and creating a colorful meal still i leapt at taylor s offer to get some campfire cooking lessons from some real pros local girl scout volunteers never a girl scout myself though a big fan of girl scout cookies i was eager to learn their secrets step by step sitting in taylor s backyard with girl scouts of maine adult education volunteer heather perry taylor and taylor s daughter and granddaughter girl scout addison goulette i understood firsthand the communal lure of a campfire and its significance to taylor who has volunteered with girl scouts for 34 years as she helped her granddaughter wrap pillsbury dough around a wooden stick to form a dough boy she turned to me and said that in her family the classic campfire treat is a rite of passage advertisement campfire cooking is embedded both in tradition and necessity as dawn walker elders adult learning manager of the girl scouts of maine put it about the necessity part of the occasion when we spoke before the backyard demonstration you re going to be outside you re going to get hungry walker elders teaches workshops on campfire cooking and other outdoors skills to both kids and adults it s really a fun hands on workshop whether you re seven years old or you re 57 years old because everybody likes to make food and everybody likes to eat good stuff campfire cooking may seem daunting to the inexperienced but it helps if you break it down into steps step one according to the girl scouts is practice before going on their first camping trip young scouts practice building fires by constructing their own edible campfires from candy and pretzels taylor recommends all first time campfire cooks practice actual fire building in their backyard before finding themselves in the same spot as my mom and i at a campsite very hungry and ad libbing step two is figuring out how you re going cook your meal and more specifically in what options include dutch ovens or box ovens made from cardboard boxes and tinfoil or you can just throw a foil wrapped hobo pack directly into the fire step three is twofold practice creativity and patience advertisement when it comes to creativity walker elders actually encourages ad libbing the method if you can call it that has even worked its way into her favorite campfire cooking recipe stone soup remember the folk tale in the story a hungry wanderer arrives in a village but the villagers won t give him anything to eat so he builds a fire and starts cooking a pot of water with nothing but a stone in it he offers to share his dinner with the curious villagers but first cleverly persuades them to add to it one by one the villagers bring a bit of this and a bit of that to add to the pot eventually everybody shares the tasty soup the story of stone soup is also an easy campfire cooking entry point in walker elder s recipe you and your camping friends each bring a can of vegetables or another ingredient that can go into the pot to create an easy one pot meal incidentally here s another thing i ve learned about campfire cooking it s about compromise this is especially the case if you re making a one pot meal you just can t give everyone their own thing taylor said the girl scouts were great but can you really call yourself a maine campfire expert without some guidance from a certified maine guide tami rogers has been a certified guide for 24 years and has taught countless campfire cooking workshops she was eager to talk but the logistics were challenging as she was deep in the woods with no cell reception when we finally managed to connect rogers too touched on the theme of ad libbing a few years ago with her young granddaughter on a canoeing camping trip rogers tried to cook one of the girl s favorite campfire meals mac and cheese oops she d forgotten the crackers to go on top instead rogers sprinkled on the only crunchy snack on hand goldfish she s 13 now and that s the only way she likes the mac and cheese now is with goldfish on top rogers said safety and serendipity sometimes it isn t the cook who decides how to rescue a meal walker elders recalled a time she hunkered down in tents with a girl scout troop as a thunderstorm rumbled in when the storm finally passed and the troop emerged from their tents they realized they d left their baked potatoes in the coals as they d raced for shelter advertisement those were the best tasting potatoes we ve ever had walker elders said after that the girls always wanted to have baked potatoes cooked in the coals even though i don t think they all remember that it was during a lightning storm that we had done it the first time like storms dry weather also affects campfire cooking in that campers must beware of the risk of forest fires they just really need to be mindful rogers said of the weather of campsite and park rules restricting fires and of their own potential impacts on the tinderbox environment those same hot dry sunny days also have an impact on the humans doing the cooking when we set up in taylor s backyard it was 90 degrees and very humid once we got the fire going it was sweltering interestingly humidity can prolong cooking times i learned studying the weather forecasts before you go camping can help you figure out your cooking action plan food cooks most quickly when the weather is hot with low humidity and a light breeze taylor said cooking over a campfire is a skill it s harder than managing a portable camp stove and doing it well requires practice practice practice taylor said and learning i never get the chance to do as much camping as girl scouts have built into their schedule but with their insights i ve worked on the learning part and am wishing i can find some time to practice practice practice mama liz improvised chickpea curry serves 2 4 depending on how hungry advertisement 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 3 scallions chopped 1 2 red pepper chopped 1 can of chickpeas with pull tab top drained 1 2 jar of patak s tikka masala sauce or similar simmr sauce 1 cup spinach or any other leafy greens give your cast iron skillet time to heat up over the fire saute the scallions and peppers in the olive oil until soft add the chickpeas and the sauce once the mixture simmers add the

i hate volatility which is why i generally favor boring investments with big dividend yields that s exactly why i own reits the broader market has fallen prey to a bear with the s p 500 index dropping by as much as 20 from its recent peak in 2022 it is hard to watch stocks fall since it generally means your net worth is declining that s why i focus more attention on dividends than i do on stock prices and if you like dividends as i do one of the best places to find them is in real estate investment trusts reits here are three reasons why even as the market plunges i continue to love my reits 1 a mental diversion a stock price is nothing more than a number that goes up and down in an often irrational manner all day long if you pay too much attention to stock prices you will give yourself an upset stomach they can t be predicted over short periods and the gyrations really don t hold all that much informational value in my opinion this is why i prefer to pay attention to dividends which represent a tangible return on my investment reits have to pay out 90 of their taxable income to retain reit status and avoid corporate level taxes they are dividend machines when i track my portfolio through the month i m really just counting the dollars that i ve been paid in dividends like a mini midas i suppose dividends tend to be fairly stable over time so it isn t particularly exciting i do dividend reinvest so i m happy to collect a few more dollars with each new quarter and in the rare situation where there is a dividend cut i know that i have some research to do in fairness to myself i monitor company performance quarterly so i m usually aware of the risk of a cut before one takes place the point is i m not watching the value of my holdings on a day to day basis so the ups and downs of the market don t get to me and that helps me stay invested through both bull and bear markets 2 a basic business while the dividend focused nature of reits fits well with my dividend focused investment approach that s not the only reason i like them another big factor is that i understand the reit business model reits i own like w p carey wpc 1 75 realty income simon property group and federal realty frt 1 69 own properties and lease them out to tenants it s not rocket science there are basic factors that you need to understand like occupancy how much of the portfolio is rented out and property type dynamics malls are different from shopping centers which are different from stand alone retail properties for example among others but those are not hard to get a handle on in fact listen to a single conference call from a reit you are watching and you ll probably understand the basics of the business simple is good in my investing world and reits are pretty simple all that said don t underestimate the value of that when the world around you is getting increasingly complicated this last bull bear cycle has been particularly interesting on this front given the rise and now fall of things like meme stocks blank check companies and companies that seemed hot during the early days of the pandemic but have since imploded as pandemic driven demand for their services ebbs 3 the dividend safety net i m not retired yet but my end goal is to reinvest dividends until i m ready to retire then i can turn on the income stream and live off of my dividends leaving my savings untouched with reits like realty income and federal realty falling into the dividend aristocrat and dividend king categories respectively w p carey is on the verge of being an aristocrat i m confident i ll have a reliable base of passive income this concept is not an unusual approach at all but it comes with another little benefit that most people don t consider in the worst case scenario the income i m generating from dividend paying stocks like reits can be used to pay my bills today if i need to that s not ideal of course but if i were suddenly to be out of work i know that i have income that i can rely on so reits are a bit part of that safety net for me given that they tend to pay out material dividends that said there are negatives to reit income in that you have to pay taxes on reit dividends as if it were earned income but i m ok with that given that reit dividends avoid corporate level taxes and if i need the income well i ll just be happy to have quarterly or monthly in the case of realty income dividend checks coming in during a rough patch in my life 4 some reit names i like my favorite reit is probably w p carey it has a diversified portfolio spread across the industrial warehouse office retail and self storage sectors on top of that around 37 of rents come from outside the united states and it has increased its dividend every year since its initial public offing in 1998 it is as close to a one stop shop reit as you can get in my opinion another name worth a deep dive for dividend lovers like me is federal realty the reit owns strip malls and mixed use developments it focuses on owning well positioned assets in highly desirable markets opting for quality over quantity in a portfolio with just around 100 properties development and redevelopment are key focus areas as it looks to keep its portfolio relevant with lessees and consumers that said federal realty s claim to fame is that at 54 years and counting this dividend king has the longest streak of annual dividend increases in the reit sector an investment for a bear market or not the big takeaway here however is that buying reits is not a bear market tactic for me it is simply a core part of my long term dividend focused investment approach the reit dividends i collect help me muddle through hard times both emotionally and financially they are as close to a perfect investment vehicle as i can probably find on wall street this is why i buy them in both bull markets and bear markets and why you might want to as well
even during a recession one way to protect your investment portfolio is to buy and hodl bitcoin right now there s a lot of nervous crypto money on the sidelines waiting for the white house to tell us whether we are in a recession but guess what scared money don t make money recession fears surrounding bitcoin btc 5 15 are overblown in fact bitcoin is the first thing i m buying if we enter a recession because it still seems like the best long term store of value to me and the single best way to protect my financial future that being said we re in uncharted territory here at the end of the day nobody really knows how bitcoin will perform during a long lasting recession because the cryptocurrency has never experienced a long lasting recession before remember bitcoin only came into existence in 2009 in the aftermath of the previous economic recession of 2007 09 that might explain a lot of the fud fear uncertainty and doubt in the marketplace right now here are three good reasons why i m going to load up on bitcoin during a recession bitcoin remains a safe haven for crypto investors this is simply investment 101 during any economic downturn you move into safe haven assets in the stock market it means shifting into recession resistant stocks like utilities healthcare companies or consumer staples after all even if economic activity dries up your neighbor loses their job and companies start going bankrupt you can still be assured that companies churning out consumer staples or charging you for electricity are going to make money now apply this same logic to the crypto market people are going to exit risky volatile cryptos in favor of crypto names they recognize and right now bitcoin is the biggest most trusted name out there even if people sell off a big chunk of their crypto holdings en masse to generate cash they aren t going to get rid of their bitcoin holdings if there is one crypto that people hodl crypto lingo for hold for the long term it s bitcoin btc is massively diversified on a global basis when people talk about an economic recession they are primarily talking about one in the u s and are specifically focusing on the u s economy the u s federal reserve and the full faith and credit of the u s treasury they are probably also thinking about u s gas prices employment figures and economic data but taking a u s centric view when it comes to bitcoin is myopic by design bitcoin is a truly global cryptocurrency outside the control of any third party intermediary it is just as easy for someone in new york city to buy bitcoin as it is for someone in nigeria therefore holding bitcoin is a wager on the fate of the entire global economy not just the u s economy yes the u s might be down for a few quarters but there s plenty of economic activity taking place elsewhere around the globe the only way bitcoin fails is if the entire globe sinks under the weight of a massive apocalyptic economic collapse future staying power btc was literally formed in the aftermath of the financial crisis and has shown its staying power for more than a decade even during the pandemic when stores and businesses shut down bitcoin increased in value giving people stimulus checks and then forcing them to stay home all day actually encouraged the formation of an entirely new cryptocurrency investing class the people who said they d never go back to their old jobs because they could make more money and have more free time by investing in crypto what makes bitcoin so unique is that it is decentralized and largely out of the control of any one individual or organization bitcoin founder the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto was a special type of genius in recognizing the problem of letting narrow minded bureaucrats or politicians control your economic destiny that gives me a lot of confidence that bitcoin will hold its value during a recession right now i m loading up on btc and holding on for dear life
when it comes to alliances in washington few are as unlikely as the common ground the democratic socialist senator bernie sanders briefly found with the heritage foundation and americans for prosperity two architects of conservative policies across the united states yet that is what happened this week when sanders a vermont independent who caucuses with the democrats made a lonely and unsuccessful stand against a 280bn bill funding scientific research and controversially giving computer chip manufacturers financial incentives to build more production in the united states one that rightwing groups also encouraged lawmakers to make the question we should be asking is this should american taxpayers provide the microchip industry with a blank check of over 76bn at a time when semiconductor companies are making tens of billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages i think the answer to that question should be a resounding no sanders said during a monday speech on the senate floor the senator s objections ultimately amounted to naught the bill passed congress on thursday and joe biden is expected to soon sign it but the episode underscores the tensions that arise when washington moves to help an industry facing tough times in this case the stricken businesses were semiconductor makers who are struggling to keep up with demand and fearful of the threat from ascendant chinese industry the left in this country has generally sort of failed to recognize the importance of capital investment at the same time they re sort of complaining about companies not investing in america they haven t actually supported the companies that do invest in america said michael mandel chief economist and vice president of the progressive policy institute thinktank my personal view is that capital investment is absolutely essential and anything we can do to get more investment in this country is a plus for workers and a plus for consumers dubbed the chips and science act the measure represents washington s response to the shortage of semiconductors that began during the pandemic and has snarled the assembly lines of us industries while helping drive up inflation the bill would offer computer chip manufacturers 52 7bn in incentives to build factories in the united states as well as 24 3bn in tax breaks the proposal has taken a tortuous path to passage with the senate first approving a version of it last year before the idea was caught up in the legislative logjam that struck biden s agenda in the closing months of 2021 but unlike some of what the democratic president hoped to get out of congress many republicans supported the concept of helping the semiconductor industry particularly because it was seen as an effort to counter china which has heavily invested in its own microchip industry view image in fullscreen nancy pelosi holds up the chips act after its passage through congress photograph drew angerer getty images and while the us ally taiwan is one of the biggest manufacturers of computer chips globally another motivation for chips is concern about what would happen to its supply if beijing moves against the island in july the commerce secretary gina raimondo and defense secretary lloyd austin wrote a letter to the democratic and republican leaders in congress saying that the measure was critical for our national security mike pompeo a former secretary of state under the republican president donald trump made an unlikely contribution to calls for its passage congress must pass the chips act for both our national and economic security we have to become less dependent on china for critical technologies and this is how we do it he tweeted as the house of representatives was considering it but some of the most influential conservative groups in washington didn t buy in the answer to the malevolent ambitions is not spending billions of dollars to help fortune 500 companies with no guarantee those dollars won t end up supporting these companies business operations in china the heritage foundation president kevin roberts said in a statement additionally the act s 250bn price tag will contribute to record inflation and increase the already historic cost of living for working and middle class americans americans for prosperity which was funded by the conservative industrialists charles koch and his late brother david who are well known for their work promoting climate change denialism sees the bill as corporate welfare the united states didn t become the strongest and most prosperous society in the history of mankind by emulating the chinese government s central planning and we shouldn t start now the group s vice president of government affairs akash chougule said if we want to see more american investment the us government needs to stay out of the way the effort ultimately failed with 24 republicans voting for chips in the house and 17 republicans in the senate along with almost all democrats while sanders voted against it none of his usual allies in that chamber or the house joined him in opposition it wasn t just the biden administration that lawmakers were hearing from semiconductor firms invested heavily in lobbying to make the bill become law with bloomberg reporting major manufacturers spent 19 6m in just the first half of this year after 15 8m in the same period of 2021 particularly vocal was intel which has announced a 20bn investment in two new semiconductor factories in ohio but amid the chips act delay in june the company announced those plans could be pushed back or curtailed without the funding my message to our congressional leaders is hey if i m not done with the job i don t get to go home neither should you do not go home for august recess until you have passed the chips act because i and others in the industries will make investment decisions do you want those investments in the us intel s chief executive pat gelsinger said in an interview on cnbc get the job done ro khanna a california democrat who sponsored a bill that was a precursor to chips denied that the legislation was corporate welfare saying there were guardrails in its text to stop corporations from using the funds for their own enrichment instead he likened it to a return of 1940s era industrial policy in which the government makes investments in industries deemed strategically important i think there s understandable concern about corporate welfare but corporate welfare is different than the fdr model of mobilizing for production he said referring to the democratic president franklin delano roosevelt who led the country through most of the second world war he envisioned chips as a template for future efforts that could boost green technologies such as electric vehicles and solar and wind energy i think it s a first step for how we continue to industrialize america how we bring our production back how we reduce our trade deficits i absolutely think this should be a model khanna said and the commerce department should enforce this so none of the money is going to stock buybacks that it is going to building factories

this past week in the midst of many competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced by powell s little known institution the fed is the latest washington power center trying to smile for its closeup caught in the bright glare of contemporary media attention like the supreme court which has been barricaded behind new fencing since it overturned the federal protection for abortion rights the fed governors have preferred to exercise their extraordinary authority quietly in near anonymity the same could be said for top decisionmakers at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and others responsible for fighting the covid and monkeypox viruses scientists such as dr anthony fauci have become household names and symbols praised as saviors and condemned as tyrants the curtain has even been drawn back on the constitution based oddity known as the electoral college an assembly of 538 actual persons who meet at a specified interval every four years and elect the president normally a routine exercise noticed by few the electoral college has become another focal point in the current congressional investigation of former president trump s efforts to stay in office after losing the 2020 election that particular investigation has even pierced some of the murkiness of the secret service which cannot account for the loss of critical text messages during the jan 6 attack on the capitol all these institutions are usually run by individuals who operate with little public notice and speak in the code of their own professional expertise each agency has its unwritten protocols which have minimal oversight and scant public knowledge and they have an extraordinary level of authority while their top officials have been appointed by a president at some point they all operate with remarkable independence thereafter the special case of the fed secretive as many parts of the government may be there are moments when any may be subject to exposure this past week it was showtime for the fed powell was on tv to read out a number set by an internal committee of the board a committee he also chairs it is called the federal open market committee and it votes on the federal funds rate which governs the cost of loans between financial institutions the fomc consists of the seven presidentially appointed governors of the federal reserve and five from among the 12 presidents of the regional federal reserve banks new york boston philadelphia richmond cleveland atlanta chicago st louis minneapolis dallas kansas city and san francisco the image has long been that of a crusty collection of aging white males who tend to be conservative financiers the current board however has come to look a good deal more like the country the seven presidentially appointed members include the recently confirmed vice chair lael brainard and two other women two of the seven are african americans both appointed by president biden in partisan terms three are republicans including powell and four are democrats powell was originally appointed as a fed governor by president obama in 2012 reappointed by him in 2014 and elevated to chairman by trump in 2018 he was re appointed as chairman this year by biden who has now appointed or re appointed five of the seven members of the board this week the change in the federal funds rate the number the nation was waiting to hear came in at 75 as in 75 basis points or three quarters of one percent it was instantly fed into countless computer programs and repeated endlessly in the media all over the world it moved the financial markets globally in real time and the remarks powell read from his notes on old fashioned paper this week actually cheered some investors and helped the stock market indices to their best 3 day rally in months and the s p 500 to its best month since 2020 the federal funds rate can also determine the fate of individual businesses and the direction of entire industries not to mention the trajectories of presidents and their political parties powell made clear the fomc s intent was to restrain the effects of inflation which last month came in at an annualized rate of more than 9 as has been widely noted that was the highest in four decades this week another number the personal consumption expenditures price index pce came in hotter than expected pointing to the likelihood our current inflation is already in double digit territory the other number which got far more attention was this week s gross domestic product reading for june it showed the economy grew in nominal dollars in the first six months of the year but actually shrank by a little less than a percentage point when the numbers are adjusted for inflation that made for the second three month period in a row with such a reading the shrinkage for the first quarter of the year had been 1 6 percent that met one common definition for a recession although not the one preferred by most economists the moment vs the momentum after his announcement this week powell also read comments suggesting more rate hikes would be likely but not automatic he noted that the latest increase the fourth this year brought the benchmark as high as 2 5 a hefty move considering that the fed s rate had been in effect zero an extreme reached twice in recent history the first was in 2009 in the so called great recession the second in the recession of 2020 2021 the followed the onset of covid powell stuck around onstage answering reporters questions about recession the chairman made it clear he did not see a recession at the moment due to strong production and sales numbers and the continuing strength of hiring in the job market the unemployment rate is a strikingly low 3 6 as of june powell may well be right about the moment but he knows that s not the same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm elections for generations still in the complex economic and political environment of our post covid world it is possible that past experiences are less than perfect predictors the performance of equity markets such as the s p 500 late in the week was taken as evidence the economic picture might be brighter than imagined the hope is that the fastest rate hikes since fed chairman paul volcker s reign of terror began in 1979 can have the desired effect without anything approaching the same degree of collateral damage there may be no such thing as a perfect soft landing but powell at this point can at least hope for what he calls softish a storied past the fed is now 109 years old a creation of the federal reserve act of 1913 during what we now call the progressive era president

this fall we will remember the five year anniversary of the oct 1 shooting it does not feel like five years when i close my eyes i can still see and feel it vividly going to a concession stand hearing jason aldean onstage and enjoying an incredible concert and then i hear the sound that i will never forget thousands of rounds of gunfire and bullets raining down on us endlessly i remember what it felt like to run for my life trying to find somewhere anywhere to hide as people around me were struck and fell i remember hearing the sirens of the first responders arriving while the gunman continued to spray bullets from 30 stories in the sky i survived that night but unfortunately the rampage of gun violence has continued across our country just this year from buffalo to uvalde to highland park the carnage of gun violence has affected every community in america and made what should be the safest places in the country grocery stores elementary schools fourth of july parades battlefields and graveyards even for those who survive without physical injuries the mental toll is unimaginable for all except those who have experienced it themselves when a person is hit by bullets from an ar 15 their bodies explode in parkland uvalde highland park and las vegas first responders doctors and survivors have shared the horror that they witnessed that trauma for survivors reverberates in your mind and scares your soul forever you can learn to manage it but it never leaves you in the years since my own night of terror i have made it my mission to pass meaningful gun safety measures to keep our families and communities safe since 2018 we have banned bump stocks like those used by the oct 1 shooter enacted safe storage and passed a ban on untraceable ghost guns but even with the victories we have achieved in nevada gun violence continues to grow because it is a national problem that requires national leadership thankfully president joe biden vice president kamala harris and congressional leadership stepped up and enacted the first meaningful gun safety measure in nearly 30 years this bipartisan bill funds crisis intervention including red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and to others it closes the boyfriend loophole so people who assault their girlfriend or boyfriend can t buy or own a gun it requires people 21 and under to undergo enhanced background checks and it provides historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country especially the trauma experienced by survivors of gun violence with this meaningful action biden has proven that he is committed to working with gun violence survivors to keep our country and communities safe there is work still to be done but americans should know that for the first time in nearly two generations we have finally taken a first national step to make our families safer sandra jauregui is an assemblywoman representing district 41 back to top

it s over an era of ever rising house prices stimulated by cheap money is coming to an end central banks created a colossal real estate boom and soon they will have to cope with the consequences of the bubble being pricked in china it is already happening banks in the world s second biggest economy are under orders to bail out property developers so they can complete unfinished projects mortgage boycotts are on the rise because people are unsurprisingly unhappy about paying home loans for properties they are unable to occupy sales of new properties have plunged and new housing starts have almost halved compared with pre pandemic levels spelling problems for heavily indebted property companies the banks they have borrowed from and the wider economy the property sector accounts for about 20 of china s gross domestic product rising house prices are already a thing of the past the us economy contracted for a second successive quarter in the three months to june and one factor was a rapidly slowing property market in the two years from the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020 american house prices have soared rising by 20 in the year to may but the market is cooling fast with the average price of new homes dropping sharply in june view image in fullscreen the housing market is cooling in the us photograph mike blake reuters britain appears to be bucking the trend according to figures from the halifax the country s biggest mortgage lender house prices are rising at an annual rate of 13 the highest in almost two decades here too the picture is changing last week the office for national statistics published data for housing affordability based on the ratio of property prices to average earnings in scotland and wales the ratio was 5 5 and 6 0 respectively below peaks reached at the time of the 2007 09 global financial crisis in england the ratio was 8 7 the highest since the series began in 1999 within england there were regional variations in newcastle upon tyne the cost of an average home was 12 times the annual income of someone in the lowest 10 income bracket in london it was 40 times and it is almost certainly higher now the ons figures cover the period up to march 2021 and since then house prices have comfortably outstripped wages there comes a point where housing simply becomes too expensive for potential buyers but a prolonged period of ultra low interest rates means it has taken time to arrive at this reality checkpoint central banks have made the unaffordable affordable by ensuring monthly mortgage repayments remain low that has been true around the world which is why from new york to vancouver from zurich to sydney from stockholm to paris the trend in house prices has been relentlessly upwards until now at least central banks in the west are aggressively raising interest rates making mortgages more expensive even before the us federal reserve last week announced a second successive 0 75 point increase in official borrowing costs a new borrower taking out a 30 year fixed home loan was paying a rate of about 5 5 double that of a year earlier that increase explains why fewer americans are buying new homes and why prices are coming down the toxic mix for house prices is rising interest rates collapsing growth and higher unemployment in the uk the bank of england reduced interest rates to 0 1 at the start of the pandemic and left them at that level for almost two years that allowed homebuyers to take out fixed term mortgages at extremely competitive rates which reached a trough of 1 4 last autumn but since december last year the bank has been tightening policy and those mortgages will rise when fixed terms run out average home loan rates are now 2 9 central banks say the highest inflation in decades means they have no choice but to tighten policy but they are doing so at a time when major economies are either falling into recession or heading that way the toxic mix for house prices is rising interest rates collapsing growth and higher unemployment of those only the last is missing but if the winter is as grim as policymakers expect then it is only a matter of time before dole queues lengthen last week the international monetary fund published forecasts for the global economy that were decidedly grim noting that all three main growth engines the us china and the eurozone were stalling the fund said risks were heavily skewed to the downside according to the imf there have been only five years in the past half century when the global economy has grown by less than 2 1974 1981 1982 2009 and 2020 a complete stop to russian gas supplies to europe stubbornly high inflation or a debt crisis were among the factors that might result in 2023 joining that list a global housing crash would guarantee that it does sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk that s not to say there aren t good reasons for wanting a purging of property market excess rocketing housing prices discriminate against the young and the poor lead to the misallocation of capital into unproductive assets and add to demographic pressures by discouraging couples from having children however central banks are trying to finesse a soft landing in which the downturn is short and shallow and the increase in unemployment is sufficient to ease upward pressure on wages but still modest a house price crash is not part of the plan because it would ensure a hard landing there is no appetite for a repeat of 2007 when the us subprime mortgage crisis triggered the near collapse of the global banking system and led to the last big recession before the one caused by the pandemic that is why the chinese government is trying to shore up property developers and why western central banks may stop raising interest rates sooner than financial markets expect we ve been here before

this past week in the midst of many competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced

anonymity the same could be said for top decisionmakers at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and others responsible for fighting the covid and monkeypox viruses

quarters of one percent it was instantly fed into countless computer programs and repeated endlessly in the media all over the world it moved the financial markets globally in real time and the

first quarter of the year had been 1 6 percent that met one common definition for a recession although not the one preferred by most economists the moment vs the momentum after his announcement this week powell also read comments suggesting more rate hikes would be likely but not automatic he noted that the latest increase the fourth this year brought the benchmark as high as 2 5 a hefty move

same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm elections for generations still in the complex economic and political environment of our post covid world it is possible that past experiences are less than perfect predictors the performance of equity markets such as the s p 500 late in the week was taken as evidence the economic picture might be brighter than imagined the hope is that the fastest rate hikes since fed chairman paul volcker s reign of terror began in 1979 can have the desired effect without anything approaching the same degree of collateral damage there may be no such thing as a perfect soft landing but powell at this point can at least hope for what he calls softish a storied past the fed is now 109 years old a creation of the federal reserve act of 1913 during what we now call the progressive era president

the us federal reserve is aiming its powerful firehose at the living room but it s the forest that s ablaze as a result people may drown even as their house catches fire this about sums up the sorry state of inflation fighting in america on wednesday the fed america s central bank raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point and signaled more rate increases to come perhaps as soon as september this followed a quarter point increase in march another half a point in may and three quarters of a point in june on thursday the commerce department announced that the us economy had shrunk for the second quarter in a row while not technically a recession economists in and out of the white house have spent much of the last several days deconstructing the word recession there s no question but that the us economy is slowing this to put it mildly makes no sense inflation has broken out all over the world the consequence of pent up demand from more than two years of pandemic and of limited supplies of everything from computer chips to wheat due to difficulties getting the world economy up and running add in putin s war in ukraine driving up world energy and food prices and china s lockdowns against covid and you get a perfect conflagration that s not all big corporations are busily raising their prices because consumers have so little choice corporations are using inflation as cover prices at the gas pump have drifted down a bit in the last month but are still eye popping here in california i m paying more than 6 a gallon at the same time big oil has hit a gusher exxon just reported second quarter profits of 17 9bn more than three times what it earned a year ago chevron s profit more than tripled to 11 6bn the two giant american oil companies aren t pouring their profits back into energy green or otherwise they re buying back their shares of stock to reward investors and executives or consider giant corporations selling consumer staples such as proctor gamble maker of everything from gillette razors to tide detergent on friday p g reported another quarter of rising profits despite the increasing costs of raw materials and transportation how did it manage this feat by raising its prices even more meanwhile half of the recent rise in grocery prices is from beef pork and poultry just four large conglomerates control these markets and they ve been coordinating their price increases to score large profits here again using inflation as an excuse if markets were competitive companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers but they re raising prices even as they rake in record profits the fed s firehose is hitting none of this meanwhile we re told not to worry because the labor market is doing just fine rubbish there are two aspects to the labor market jobs and wages the number of jobs has been increasing nicely let s hope this continues but hourly wages have plummeted when adjusted for inflation if the fed keeps raising interest rates even if the national economy avoids an official recession most workers will fall even further behind the living standards of nearly everyone who borrows money are already dropping because of the fed s rate hikes the average rate on credit card debt has reached 17 25 up from 16 34 in march before the fed began raising interest rates rates on student loans car loans and mortgages are also rising the government should use a firehose better aimed at the conflagration which won t so badly burden the bottom 80 for starters impose a temporary windfall profits tax on big oil on giant sellers of consumer staples and on big ag this would reduce their incentive to engage in price gouging bolder antitrust enforcement even the threat to block mergers and break up giant companies could also reduce their ardor to raise prices if congress refuses to allow the government to use its bargaining power to reduce the prices of pharmaceuticals big pharma is a good candidate for temporary price controls fdr controlled prices via executive order finally higher taxes on the wealthy such as democrats seem finally ready to enact will help dampen total demand thereby dousing some of the inflation fire the fed s single tool for fire fighting interest rate increases is aimed in the wrong direction it s hitting working people rather than corporations responsible for most price increases over and above the rising costs of global supplies we need to fight rising prices not working people

when he caught covid i never normally do it but i got down on my knees and prayed he told a newspaper in 2020 within 30 seconds i had lifted my vibration and do you know what the symptoms and the fear went away clearly some celebrities faith runs deeper than others one whose devotion extends beyond praying to be delivered from flu like symptoms is model miranda kerr 39 sandwiched between an instagram post about her trip to disneyland and another celebrating her five year marriage to evan spiegel is a 20 minute video reel in which she treats her 13 5 million followers to a chat with her dear friend priest john macnutt in a regular slot which kerr brands spiritual sunday church can be daunting so some may try it safely online first what does faith mean to you as a wife a mother and a businesswoman asks macnutt my journey began as a little girl when my grandmother would read the bible to me kerr replies she would say that god lifts the veil from your eyes when it s time to understand him kerr then shares details of her grandmother s prayer about sunbeams and light which she now reads to her three children unfortunately the exact words are unclear due to kerr s erratic internet connection a harsh reminder that in the world of online spirituality any service is only as good as your service provider kerr s spiritual sunday concludes with her playing a short burst of the beatles all you need is love to which you could add and reliable wifi to which she and the priest appear to dance or at least sway along to judging by the comments and 22k likes her followers are ecstatic i have been suffering from depression but this session gave me energy and pushed me to move on says one where did you get your blue dress asks another it s easy to mock christianity has always been a soft target how else would the term bible basher have come about yet for many online worship has been a genuine lifeline particularly during the pandemic my local church in north london has observed an uptick of people coming through the doors who were first introduced to its services online thanks to covid it s very possible that these people have sampled church for precisely the reason that they could do so safely online without crossing the threshold says the reverend mark wakefield for those of us used to church it s easy to forget how daunting it can be what should i wear what s expected of me how will i know what to do online services negate these concerns while it s tempting to label the actions of the celebrity celestial crew such as when chris pratt who found religion as a teen posted pictures showing he is now so devoted to christianity that he once built a cross in his garden to celebrate easter as virtue signalling most of them are too consistent and heartfelt in their messaging for this accusation to be valid whether thanking god in every awards acceptance speech is good for their brand is a moot point but if the kardashians doing a prayer circle before shows encourages someone to explore their faith where s the harm we live in challenging times little wonder that people are looking for help guidance and enlightenment in spiritual form even if

same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm

competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced by powell s little known institution the fed is the latest washington power center trying to smile for its closeup caught in the bright glare of contemporary media attention like the supreme court which has been barricaded

municipal officials in montgomery county are starting work on the establishment of a housing stock that they have discussed for some time as part of efforts to try to improve affordability in one of southwest virginia s most expensive real estate pockets matt hanratty assistant to the blacksburg town manager and project point man said work is starting on the conversion of the units that will be part of the community land trust that they have discussed for months the trust is technically starting with zero units but we are in the process of ramping that up significantly hanratty wrote in an email this past week we are currently working on converting five existing units into units and those units would technically be the first clt units there will also be additional new units created hanratty said the nonprofit community housing partners which is part of the land trust agreement with blacksburg and montgomery county is working on creating units through the stroubles ridge development off of merrimac road he also said the town has committed 4 million in federal american rescue plan funds with the intention to create many more land trust units over the next few years overall the goal is to try and scale up the clt as quickly as possible he wrote the recent movement on the trust comes after the blacksburg town council and montgomery county board of supervisors formally approved what is called the new river home trust as well as the operating support agreement between the two localities and chp the land trust which officials say will create a permanent affordable housing stock is one measure that has been pursued to try to alleviate a problem many in the area say has effectively kept a section of the local workforce from living in certain parts of montgomery county blacksburg has long been one of the priciest real estate markets in western virginia but town officials say the issue worsened due to a national housing boom that started during the pandemic one data point local officials shared earlier this year during the land trust talks was a year by year comparison of average home sale prices during the pandemic the average sales price in montgomery county in 2021 was 315 680 an increase of 8 8 from 2020 for blacksburg specifically that average figure was 384 474 up 5 1 from 2020 the land trust local officials have said would aim to ease first time homebuyers entry into the market particularly those considered to be earning lower incomes or who have certain cost burdens under the trust a nonprofit owns the land on which a separately owned house is located blacksburg officials have said the homeowner and nonprofit have a lease that gives the former the exclusive rights to use the land a trust places a cap on how much a home within the program can appreciate instead of relying on typical factors such as sales of similar properties and current market trends the value would be based on income growth in the area for example a home with an original market value of 300 000 would have a purchase price of 200 000 due to the aid of a 100 000 subsidy that could come from grants or other forms of outside funding as explained in a video posted earlier this year the resale price of that 200 000 home a decade later would top out at 252 000 due the restrictions set by the trust that maximum resale price was determined by calculating the growth of those earning 80 of the area median income during that 10 year period with the home s original purchase price that percentage of the area median income in montgomery county grew by 26 from 2010 to 2020 according to the clip next steps with the trust involve setting up an oversight committee in the near future with montgomery county and chp as well as working with the nonprofit to finalize the ground lease and finalize the process to create the units hanratty said we are starting conversations with chp to this effect later this week to get all of that started and get more into the details hanratty wrote in the recent email we haven t worked through a detailed timeline yet with chp but our goal is to hopefully have everything up and running by the end of the calendar year chp well known in the area for its affordable housing developments will serve as the lead entity and manage the trust operations according to the agreement the agreement between the three entities calls on the municipalities to provide funding to help ensure the financial sustainability of the land trust a presentation from earlier this year showed annual costs will be based on the number of units for example blacksburg and the county will each need to contribute 85 000 for 10 units according to figures that were part of the presentation
standing around the campfire at bradbury mountain state park on a recent summer evening i shielded my eyes from the smoke as i tried to decide whether to lift the lid on the pot for our dinner to check if the water was boiling so i could finally add the macaroni on the one hand i risked letting the heat escape on the other hand i was hungry that evening as we attempted to produce a nutritious filling dinner in the out of doors my mom and i encountered more than our fair share of setbacks but i felt better about our efforts after talking with elaine taylor a volunteer support specialist at the girl scouts of maine mistakes are part of it she reassured me about campfire cooking when you think about it camping is an adventure and it makes sense sometimes campfire cooking is too since that night i ve come to understand that campfire cooking is really about balancing hypervigilance around safety with experimentation around taste taylor gave me tips and tricks for avoiding that all consuming storm cloud of rumbling stomachs and short tempers that can invade a campsite at a moment s notice especially after a long day of summertime adventuring camp food then and now my earliest memories of camping are of scavenging around campsites with friends for the perfect kindling and marshmallow roasting sticks my mom playing the guitar my dad applying bug spray and of course the campfire crackling and glowing at dusk when i was growing up no camping packing list was complete without a large pot plastic bowls biodegradable soap and a sponge and if we were really prepared a cooler of ingredients for dinners over the camp stove or fire advertisement two weeks ago my mom loaded the same familiar staples into the car and met me in pownal for an impromptu one night only mother daughter camping trip i drove there straight from work and arrived tired hungry and still dressed in my work clothes mom had packed our ancient coleman camping stove but we quickly realized we d brought the wrong fuel the only thing we had that didn t require cooking was an apple and some chips clearly if we wanted dinner we d have to switch gears so starting with old newspaper as kindling another reason to subscribe to the portland press herald we built a log cabin style fire think lincoln logs and we were off after we d got the fire going we set our pots up on a grate and boiled water for rice and for annie s mac and cheese in another pan we sautéed vegetables and chickpeas with tikka masala sauce cooked on the fire and without a lid the curry developed a deliciously smoky taste i doubt i d be able to replicate at home but minus that culinary bonus you can cook many of the same dishes on a campfire as you might in your own kitchen as long as you have patience and good music to help you pass the time while you wait for the water to boil in the end my mom and i were successful in feeding our growling bellies and creating a colorful meal still i leapt at taylor s offer to get some campfire cooking lessons from some real pros local girl scout volunteers never a girl scout myself though a big fan of girl scout cookies i was eager to learn their secrets step by step sitting in taylor s backyard with girl scouts of maine adult education volunteer heather perry taylor and taylor s daughter and granddaughter girl scout addison goulette i understood firsthand the communal lure of a campfire and its significance to taylor who has volunteered with girl scouts for 34 years as she helped her granddaughter wrap pillsbury dough around a wooden stick to form a dough boy she turned to me and said that in her family the classic campfire treat is a rite of passage advertisement campfire cooking is embedded both in tradition and necessity as dawn walker elders adult learning manager of the girl scouts of maine put it about the necessity part of the occasion when we spoke before the backyard demonstration you re going to be outside you re going to get hungry walker elders teaches workshops on campfire cooking and other outdoors skills to both kids and adults it s really a fun hands on workshop whether you re seven years old or you re 57 years old because everybody likes to make food and everybody likes to eat good stuff campfire cooking may seem daunting to the inexperienced but it helps if you break it down into steps step one according to the girl scouts is practice before going on their first camping trip young scouts practice building fires by constructing their own edible campfires from candy and pretzels taylor recommends all first time campfire cooks practice actual fire building in their backyard before finding themselves in the same spot as my mom and i at a campsite very hungry and ad libbing step two is figuring out how you re going cook your meal and more specifically in what options include dutch ovens or box ovens made from cardboard boxes and tinfoil or you can just throw a foil wrapped hobo pack directly into the fire step three is twofold practice creativity and patience advertisement when it comes to creativity walker elders actually encourages ad libbing the method if you can call it that has even worked its way into her favorite campfire cooking recipe stone soup remember the folk tale in the story a hungry wanderer arrives in a village but the villagers won t give him anything to eat so he builds a fire and starts cooking a pot of water with nothing but a stone in it he offers to share his dinner with the curious villagers but first cleverly persuades them to add to it one by one the villagers bring a bit of this and a bit of that to add to the pot eventually everybody shares the tasty soup the story of stone soup is also an easy campfire cooking entry point in walker elder s recipe you and your camping friends each bring a can of vegetables or another ingredient that can go into the pot to create an easy one pot meal incidentally here s another thing i ve learned about campfire cooking it s about compromise this is especially the case if you re making a one pot meal you just can t give everyone their own thing taylor said the girl scouts were great but can you really call yourself a maine campfire expert without some guidance from a certified maine guide tami rogers has been a certified guide for 24 years and has taught countless campfire cooking workshops she was eager to talk but the logistics were challenging as she was deep in the woods with no cell reception when we finally managed to connect rogers too touched on the theme of ad libbing a few years ago with her young granddaughter on a canoeing camping trip rogers tried to cook one of the girl s favorite campfire meals mac and cheese oops she d forgotten the crackers to go on top instead rogers sprinkled on the only crunchy snack on hand goldfish she s 13 now and that s the only way she likes the mac and cheese now is with goldfish on top rogers said safety and serendipity sometimes it isn t the cook who decides how to rescue a meal walker elders recalled a time she hunkered down in tents with a girl scout troop as a thunderstorm rumbled in when the storm finally passed and the troop emerged from their tents they realized they d left their baked potatoes in the coals as they d raced for shelter advertisement those were the best tasting potatoes we ve ever had walker elders said after that the girls always wanted to have baked potatoes cooked in the coals even though i don t think they all remember that it was during a lightning storm that we had done it the first time like storms dry weather also affects campfire cooking in that campers must beware of the risk of forest fires they just really need to be mindful rogers said of the weather of campsite and park rules restricting fires and of their own potential impacts on the tinderbox environment those same hot dry sunny days also have an impact on the humans doing the cooking when we set up in taylor s backyard it was 90 degrees and very humid once we got the fire going it was sweltering interestingly humidity can prolong cooking times i learned studying the weather forecasts before you go camping can help you figure out your cooking action plan food cooks most quickly when the weather is hot with low humidity and a light breeze taylor said cooking over a campfire is a skill it s harder than managing a portable camp stove and doing it well requires practice practice practice taylor said and learning i never get the chance to do as much camping as girl scouts have built into their schedule but with their insights i ve worked on the learning part and am wishing i can find some time to practice practice practice mama liz improvised chickpea curry serves 2 4 depending on how hungry advertisement 1

brycia james istock unreleased via getty images investment conclusion the cheesecake factory nasdaq cake reported mixed f2q2022 financial results despite the surge in covid 19 cases pent up customer demand for experiential dining sustained off premise sales and significant improvement in staffing levels resulted in substantial growth in revenues and same store sales associated with all three of the companyâ s brands on a year over year basis and compared to f2q2019 in addition annualized average unit volumes associated with the cheesecake factory restaurants in particular expanded to 12 3 million relative to the 11 7 million linked to the first quarter however although cake raised menu prices during the period margins across the board contracted compared to the previous yearâ s same quarter driven by inflationary pressures related to energy prices commodity costs dairy and produce and hourly wages the firm opened two restaurants during the second quarter one each associated with north italia and the frc concepts over upcoming quarters despite an expected downturn in discretionary spending we anticipate that the sales momentum experienced by cakeâ s brands during recent quarters will be sustained as on average the companyâ s customers earn 100k and are affluent and highly educated in addition restaurants across all of the firmâ s concepts are located in highly prized real estate in economically upscale districts further sales are likely to be favorably impacted by menu innovation expected to be rolled out early in the third quarter comprised of the summer menu and a new cheesecake variety a classic basque cheesecake which is crustless with a burnt top and a creamy custard like center and served with berries and fresh cream with regard to margins we anticipate sequential expansion and expect the figure to advance to pre pandemic levels based on revenue leverage due to lower fixed costs dollar of sales a potential menu price hike continual improvement in front line staffing levels decrease in commodity costs and stabilizing hourly wages at the restaurant level and better economies of scale associated with advertising the digital platform and administrative expenses at the corporate level in addition given that the company is continually buying back shares every quarter we expect some decline in the number of outstanding shares for the year considering the above described factors earnings and free cash flows are likely to increase on a year over year basis for fy2022 in our judgment cake plans on launching 15 new restaurants across its concepts over the year management expects revenues for f3q2022 of between 785 million and 805 million reflecting a year over year increase of 5 3 from the midpoint of the estimate and in a range of 3 32 billion to 3 37 billion for fy2022 indicating an annualized growth of 14 from the midpoint of the projection longer term the company has committed to 7 annual net new unit development comprised of 1 to 3 year over year increase in the the cheesecake factory footprint 20 annual growth in the number of north italia restaurants and between 15 to 20 expansion in the frc concepts restaurant base every year including that of flower child incremental revenues from the launch of new stores will be supported by comparable sales growth through menu innovation the continued uptrend in off premise sales and loyalty programs associated with all of cakeâ s brands which we expect to be rolled out in the near future as a flow through of revenue expansion and economies of scale related to corporate spending the digital platform and advertising leverage at the restaurant and corporate levels will kick in reflecting in higher margins which in turn will ensure surges in profits and free cash flows over an elongated time horizon considering that f2q2022 results have only improved our confidence that cake is likely to meet and exceed our conservative 10 year normalized revenue growth rate of 6 and 10 year straight lined operating cash flows margin of 10 7 we remain bullish on the stock therefore weâ re maintaining our 1 year price target of 71 share for cake reiterate buy rating please go through our initiation report â the cheesecake factory undervalued with little downside risk over the medium termâ and associated notes for our long term opinion on the stock key takeaways from the second quarter f2q2022 results summary for the quarter revenues came in at 833 million 8 3 compared with f2q2021 below consensus estimates of 838 million and earnings per share were 0 50 vs 0 31 during the prior yearâ s same quarter missing analyst projections of 0 78 in addition comparable sales at the cheesecake factory and north italia restaurants increased by 4 7 and 12 relative to f2q2021 net income for the period was 25 7 million reflecting a decline of 24 compared to the previous yearâ s same quarter cake generated 54 million in operating cash flows over the period economic recession impact likely to be muted as per management cake prospered during the fiscal downturn of 2007 2008 exiting the period with improved sales and margins overall the effect was mixed between territories with regions demonstrating declines of between 1 to 20 the result is not surprising as the firmâ s clientele has always skewed affluent and well educated in addition cakeâ s restaurants are typically located in affluent neighborhoods nevertheless the company plans on leaning on value deals the rewards program and promotions to mitigate any repercussions of a possible recession over upcoming months the strategy will be to launch an additional menu with lower priced items reintroduce promotions on cheesecakes and delivery orders that appeared to appeal to customers during the pandemic and launch the loyalty program which will position cake with opportunities to appeal to customers through rewards for frequent ordering and through predictive selling that tailors promotions based on guests prior purchasing history in addition that the menu prices range from 5 to 30 and that portion sizes are typically large enough to support sharing among guests are other elements that could likely encourage customers to dine at cake even if discretionary spending declines further statistical data demonstrates that consumers typically save for experiential dining occasions during economic downturns forgoing visits to quick service restaurants in anticipation of dining at table service restaurants moreover given that unit economics favor cake compared to its closest competitors the white table cloth independent full service mom and pop restaurants the company appears to be insulated for the most part from a major impact in case a financial crisis were to unfold overall simply based on the significant value proposition cakeâ s concepts provide guests in form of great food at reasonable prices and excellent customer service its restaurants are likely to sustain a majority of their foot traffic during a potential economic decline in our opinion additional concepts firing on all cylinders during the second quarter north italiaâ s comparable sales expanded by 12 versus f2q2021 and by 22 compared to f2q2019 with annualized average unit volumes associated with mature locations accelerating to 9 million in addition driven somewhat by periodic price hikes to offset inflationary trends the brandâ s restaurant margins were 13 overall and 16 4 at its mature restaurants similarly frc concepts experienced substantial advance in its top line and bottom line performance during the second quarter the group including flower child generated average weekly sales of 116 000 in total north italia and the frc conceptsâ restaurants accounted for 147 million in sales over f2q2022 frc concepts launched its first fly bye restaurant featuring detroit style enhanced stretch pizzas and crispy chicken in phoenix arizona a couple of weeks ago with sales for the first two weeks exceeding expectations cake plans on opening an additional fly bye location towards the back half of the year the concept started as a pop up ghost kitchen at one of frc concepts culinary drop off locations during the earlier stages of the pandemic and began to enjoy significant customer demand right out of the gate in addition cake appeared bullish on future prospects associated with flower child management indicated that the firm is working on plans to accelerate footprint growth including strategies to launch into new markets fill key leadership positions and leverage the supply chain to optimize restaurant level margins overall given the growth in revenues and profits over recent quarters associated with the frc concepts fueled for the most part by flower child restaurants we are satisfied with the brandâ s progress and believe the group is well positioned for continued success accelerated new unit development remains on track with significant resources available to cake including 195 million in cash and equivalents as well as additional capital from a revolving credit facility management indicated that a possible economic downturn is unlikely to impact the rapid footprint growth plans guided to earlier although the pace of development might moderate due to commodity cost inflation labor shortage and supply chain restrictions cake believes the 7 annual footprint growth target is achievable for fy2023 in that regard it is noteworthy that the firm currently has more active construction sites that ever in its history indicating a significant number of new restaurant openings over the next couple of years for fy2022 cake has set a new unit development target of 15 restaurants comprised of five the cheesecake factory locations including one out licensed international restaurant four north italia locations and seven the frc concepts locations including three flower child locations cakeâ s brands are one of a kind and rapidly monetizing the customer demand associated with their restaurants appears prudent therefore we are glad that management intends to take advantage of any upcoming economic downturn by securing highest quality real estate at discounted prices with a view to maximize shareholder returns balance sheet remains strong at the end of f2q2022 the company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 195 million and long term debt of 475 million on its balance sheet cake can borrow an additional 238 million to fund operations under a revolving credit facility it has available given its funding position we believe that the firm is well equipped to operate efficiently and execute on its considerable footprint growth targets during the second quarter cake repurchased 360k shares for a sum of 10 9 million in addition the company declared a dividend of 0 27 share for the period bottom line cake is on the cusp of a breakout based on business trends associated with its brands we expect runaway growth in the firmâ s revenues and earnings over the next three to five years in addition even if a recession were to materialize during the next several quarters we believe that although demand might somewhat moderate due to macroeconomic conditions based on the strong customer appeal cakeâ s brands enjoy its restaurants are likely to outperform the competition overall there is a disconnect between the current market value of the companyâ s shares and its intrinsic value determined by the future value of its three restaurant chains therefore we suggest investors view pullbacks in cakeâ s stock due to market volatility as an opportunity to dollar cost average down on shares to generate almost guaranteed significant returns on capital

tropical exterior colors beckon like a street fruit salad public art tells the community s story and inside the san ysidro branch library an array of books technology work spaces and events engages the community with the emphasis on preparing young visitors for a rapidly changing world completed in 2019 the library marks a turning point this striking contemporary building provides a concentrated burst of optimism in a place where the daily news often has to do with the challenges of being at the binational border twenty minutes northeast the skyline hills branch library which opened in 2016 in the skyline paradise hills neighborhood is another example of how an eye catching library becomes a landmark to symbolize a community s aspirations where san ysidro s branch is a well proportioned assemblage of colorful boxes skyline hills is a sleek angular monochromatic structure with knife edge corners and a swooping roofline when misty jones was appointed san diego s public library director in 2014 architect rob quigley s flagship san diego central library had just opened after being in the works for a couple decades it s a milestone that signifies the city s commitment to arts culture and iconic architecture meanwhile these two branches had been stalled for years due to usual obstacles such as finding funds and identifying sites a big part of jones mission was to move them forward advertisement jones is all about getting to know a community in order to learn what it needs in a library each branch is the culmination of a multi year effort to build consensus among citizens community leaders librarians city planners and elected officials various sites and existing buildings were considered and rejected along the way citizens provided essential input in both san ysidro and skyline hills jones said they helped choose from among three different design proposals and she believes the libraries will become anchor points that provide a renewed sense of community this year the branches are coming to life again following two years of covid children teens parents and seniors are using them not only for books and reading but for all sorts of activities that provide social interaction education and pure fun the buzz of young people provides especially strong evidence that if you provide a cool alternative to other less healthy diversions perhaps they will come both libraries have plenty of books displayed on long rows of shelves in high ceilinged reading rooms san ysidro includes a good selection in spanish while skyline hills stocks books in tagalog for its filipino population but beyond books these libraries offer a marked contrast to the branches many of us recall from childhood in my case a tiny adorable building that resembled a gingerbread house and had a sweet librarian eager to show us the latest children s books today s best libraries exemplified by this pair are architecturally stunning destinations for all sorts of learning and activity they feature dozens of public computer terminals and reliable wi fi maker spaces are rooms equipped with tools to harness creativity and high tech craft there are 3d printers from tiny yodas to jewelry and sublimation printers images you apply to cups t shirts and other items software for processing photos and video or designing digital images even sewing machines often used by neighborhood women who supplement their incomes with cottage industries the skyline hills library at 7900 paradise valley road in san diego opened in 2016 courtesy photo by dirk sutro identical in size at 15 000 square feet the two branches couldn t be more different in their architecture san ysidro s library is situated on beyer boulevard close to several schools near the san diego trolley station within view of the hills of tijuana it s only a few blocks off san ysidro boulevard where gas stations currency exchanges and other businesses advertise their prices in pesos and many cars and trucks have mexican license plates the library is also near several public schools residents wanted a contemporary design not nostalgia they did not want the mission style of their old library said the branch s architect ernesto vasquez of sva architects the old branch circa 1924 is nearby and repurposed as a teen center sva s architecture calls to mind the designs of mexican architects luis barragán and ricardo legoretta who designed the chula vista library opened in 1995 intense colors vasquez said reflect the vibrant texture of the community from fashion to food to art so does the public art by de la torre brothers in the form of large square panels on the exterior that resemble mexican papel picado perforated paper decorations as well as two tall columns between the lobby and front desk the columns are covered with back lit transparencies of images from local history and various literature and they are bridged by a beam of cantera stone bearing european and mesoamerican motifs inside the library wall graphics and vivid hues animate the spaces along with red reading chairs and carpeting of muted grays and reds in a soft pattern that resembles weathered wood in addition to various meeting and study rooms and staff offices the san ysidro branch has a large community events space with a wide bank of glass doors that opens to a garden courtyard the library has hosted quinceañeras along with visits by sparkles the clown and the zovargo mobile zoo to promote children s reading the courtyard also serves as an outdoor theater with a pristine white wall doubling as a screen where san ysidro s building bursts with color skyline hills designed by little diversified architectural consulting has a sleek industrial aesthetic with its curved exterior walls uplifted roofline and muted tones the architecture plays off sweeping vistas that surround it especially to the east where the scenery includes tawny hills and peaks such as mount miguel this soaring aesthetic is enhanced with public art by gail simpson and aristotle georgiades in the form of aluminum sculptures mounted on exterior walls and suspended around interior ceiling lights that depict flying creatures such as birds butterflies and moths the winged art creates a sense of flow and movement branch librarian azalea ebbay notes that one hanging piece evokes moths attracted to a light bulb an apt metaphor for the library s mission thoughtful lighting is key to this building thanks to tall banks of glass and prismatic skylights that disperse daylight interior spaces are flooded with natural light that is good for reading and minimizes electrical bills both branches get high marks for green design and engineering san ysidro earned a gold leed leadership in environmental and energy design rating from the u s green building council while skyline hills is rated leed silver platinum is the highest the ratings are based on considerations such as impact on climate change human health water resources biodiversity natural resources and supporting the green economy skyline hills incorporates eco hq active chilled beams long narrow metal inserts integrated into the high ceilings to condition the air and cool the building efficiently and quietly the two libraries also benefit from thoughtful drought tolerant landscapes softening the edges of the skyline hills building the landscape plan includes plants ranging from fan palms to red berried toyon red bottlebrush yellow cat s claw and tall gray and green grasses it s a far cry from the standard lawns and hedges around branch libraries of yesteryear today the city of san diego s library system includes 36 libraries and the county of san diego oversees 33 more we re kind of in this funding whirlwind said jones who recently attended the groundbreaking for a 26 million branch in pacific highlands ranch near del mar expansion of the ocean beach library received 4 5 million in state funding in early july and plans are moving ahead for a 24 million 25 000 square foot flagship library in san carlos and a 20 million branch in oak park in san ysidro and skyline hills the libraries are big breakthroughs for their communities architectural landmarks that infuse a new sense of pride they also make a solid case that even in this techno millennium books still have a place skyline hills attracted 24 360 visitors and circulated 10 595 books through the first six months of this year while san ysidro had 23 810 visitors it expects 55 000 a year and circulated 15 942 books one of the coolest library initiatives is my 1st library card where smiling children pose for pictures with their new cards all sorts of these photos are posted online and what better way to send a message that a lifelong love of books and reading can begin early sutro writes about architecture and design he is the author of the guidebook san diego architecture as well as university of california san diego an architectural guide he wrote a column about architecture for the san diego edition of the los angeles times back in the day and has also covered architecture for a variety of design publications

this past week in the midst of many competing events the nation s news aware and money savvy cohorts gave their undivided attention to a professorial looking fellow calmly reading from a piece of paper the bespectacled reader was jerome powell who bears a weighty title as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve bank while he is unknown to most americans his economic power is sometimes said to rival that of the president himself and while few voters may be thinking of powell as they go to the polls in november all will be coping with economic conditions strongly influenced by powell s little known institution the fed is the latest washington power center trying to smile for its closeup caught in the bright glare of contemporary media attention like the supreme court which has been barricaded behind new fencing since it overturned the federal protection for abortion rights the fed governors have preferred to exercise their extraordinary authority quietly in near anonymity the same could be said for top decision makers at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and others responsible for fighting the covid and monkeypox viruses scientists such as dr anthony fauci have become household names and symbols praised as saviors and condemned as tyrants the curtain has even been drawn back on the constitution based oddity known as the electoral college an assembly of 535 actual persons who meet at a specified interval every four years and elect the president normally a routine exercise noticed by few the electoral college has become another focal point in the current congressional investigation of former president trump s efforts to stay in office after losing the 2020 election that particular investigation has even pierced some of the murkiness of the secret service which cannot account for the loss of critical text messages during the jan 6 attack on the capitol all these institutions are usually run by individuals who operate with little public notice and speak in the code of their own professional expertise each agency has its unwritten protocols which have minimal oversight and scant public knowledge and they have an extraordinary level of authority while their top officials have been appointed by a president at some point they all operate with remarkable independence thereafter the special case of the fed secretive as many parts of the government may be there are moments when any may be subject to exposure this past week it was showtime for the fed powell was on tv to read out a number set by an internal committee of the board a committee he also chairs it is called the federal open market committee and it votes on the federal funds rate which governs the cost of loans between financial institutions the fomc consists of the seven presidentially appointed governors of the federal reserve and five from among the 12 presidents of the regional federal reserve banks new york boston philadelphia richmond cleveland atlanta chicago st louis minneapolis dallas kansas city and san francisco the image has long been that of a crusty collection of aging white males who tend to be conservative financiers the current board however has come to look a good deal more like the country the seven presidentially appointed members include the recently confirmed vice chair lael brainard and two other women two of the seven are african americans both appointed by president biden in partisan terms three are republicans including powell and four are democrats three were appointed or re appointed by trump four by biden this week the change in the federal funds rate the number the nation was waiting to hear came in at 75 as in 75 basis points or three quarters of one percent it was instantly fed into countless computer programs and repeated endlessly in the media all over the world it moved the financial markets globally in real time and the remarks powell read from his notes on an old fashioned paper this week actually cheered some investors and helped the stock market indices to their best 3 day rally in months and the s p 500 to its best month since 2020 the federal funds rate can also determine the fate of individual businesses and the direction of entire industries not to mention the trajectories of presidents and their political parties powell made clear the fomc s intent was to restrain the effects of inflation which last month came in at an annualized rate of more than 9 as has been widely noted that was the highest in four decades this week another number the personal consumption expenditures price index pce came in hotter than expected pointing to the likelihood our current inflation is already in double digit territory the other number which got far more attention was this week s gross domestic product reading for june it showed the economy grew in nominal dollars in the first six months of the year but actually shrank by a little less than a percentage point when the numbers are adjusted for inflation that made for the second three month period in a row with such a reading the shrinkage for the first quarter of the year had been 1 6 percent that met one common definition for a recession although not the one preferred by most economists the moment vs the momentum after his announcement this week powell also read comments suggesting more rate hikes would be likely but not automatic he noted that the latest increase the fourth this year brought the benchmark as high as 2 5 a hefty move considering that the fed s rate had been in effect zero an extreme reached twice in recent history the first was in 2009 in the so called great recession the second in the recession of 2020 2021 that followed the onset of covid powell stuck around onstage answering reporters questions about recession the chairman made it clear he did not see a recession at the moment due to strong production and sales numbers and the continuing strength of hiring in the job market the unemployment rate is a strikingly low 3 6 as of june powell may well be right about the moment but he knows that s not the same as the momentum his own policies contemplate pushing the economy toward if not into a recession that is how those policies seek to break the inflationary cycle politically the obvious takeaway from such a moment would be that people struggling with higher prices might soon be working fewer hours or losing their jobs entirely and the consequences of that have been pretty clear in midterm elections for generations still in the complex economic and political environment of our post covid world it is possible that past experiences are less than perfect predictors the performance of equity markets such as the s p 500 late in the week was taken as evidence the economic picture might be brighter than imagined the hope is that the fastest rate hikes since fed chairman paul volcker s reign of terror began in 1979 can have the desired effect without anything approaching the same degree of collateral damage there may be no such thing as a perfect soft landing but powell at this point can at least hope for what he calls softish a storied past the fed is now 109 years old a creation of the federal reserve act of 1913 during what we now call the progressive era president woodrow wilson and his first session of congress had the rather idealistic notion of removing certain key economic decisions from the pressures of politics and the markets its initial purpose was to manage the money supply maintain value and prevent the kind of panics that had periodically plagued the economy in the 1800s since world war ii however it has become increasingly imperative for the fed to also mind levels of unemployment in making its calculations this dual mandate has complicated fed operations ever since and powell alluded to it this week powell is the 16th person to chair the fed and the latest to struggle with those decisions and pressures while some have been more successful than others all have been caught in the crossfire of criticism while on the job and especially after leaving it some who were hailed as heroes in their tenure have subsequently borne blame for bad things that happened later alan greenspan was dubbed an economic maestro by some journalists and one biographer for his 18 years as chairman 1987 2006 a period when even sharp increases in the federal funds rate often had relatively manageable consequences but after he retired greenspan was faulted by some for the rapid rise in home valuations and alternative debt instruments that led to the crash of 2008 and the great recession that followed reagan stuck with the medicine and its medicine man volcker who chaired the fed from the fateful summer of 1979 until greenspan took over has been lionized as the man who beat double digit inflation appointed by president jimmy carter at a point when inflation had reached nearly 14 volcker immediately set about persuading the board of his day that drastic measures were mandatory at the time the resulting inflationary psychology was so deeply embedded that almost everyone despaired at purging it wrote financial journalist robert samuelson in his book the great inflation and its aftermath in 2008 only the unexpectedly savage recession of 1981 82 when unemployment peaked at nearly 11 percent succeeded in doing so that savage recession had already begun by the summer of 1981 when volcker and his board continued raising the federal funds rate past 20 volcker was not cooling the economy so much as strangling it even before that recession struck with full force the stagflation of the 1970s had proved too much for carter while other issues mattered in carter s loss to republican ronald reagan in the 1980 election economics had set the stage reagan stuck by the medicine and the medicine man volcker and his board raised the federal funds rate as high as 20 in 1981 sure enough republicans suffered losses around the country in the midterms of 1982 especially in governorships but reagan s working majority of republicans and conservative democrats in congress survived largely intact he reappointed volcker the following year as the medicine continued to prove effective against the underlying disease widely vilified as the man who brought on double digit joblessness in the early 1980s volcker had the satisfaction of seeing both the unemployment number and the inflation rate beaten back down into low single digits during his second term as chairman he
