you have got to be kidding me one would think that people would know better than to panic buy anything i figured that was one of the biggest lessons learned from the early days of the covid 19 pandemic but apparently not now that we are experiencing yet another wave of covid with the delta variant spreading across the country people have once again started panic buying toilet paper according to kcbd get our free mobile app you talk about the ultimate vicious cycle that spirals out of control quickly irrational people begin to panic when they see the sharp rise in covid cases and immediately run out and start buying as much toilet paper as possible of course rational people don t like wiping their asses with their hands so whenever they hear that the shelves are quickly emptying at stores around town they re forced to go and stock up on toilet paper and next thing you know we have a shortage i haven t been to any grocery or big box stores here in wichita falls over the last few days so i can t tell you whether or not it s going on here but thankfully many of the retailers in town have put caps in place limiting the amount of hygiene supplies people can purchase to help curb the problem it s also being reported that toilet paper producers have increased production to keep up with the spike in demand so hopefully we won t have to deal with bare shelves for long or preferably not at all in the meantime we can all do our part by not buying 200 rolls of toilet paper at a time because if you need 200 rolls of toilet paper for a 10 day quarantine you probably should ve paid your doctor a visit a long time ago keep reading see 25 natural ways to boost your immune system

press kabul afghanistan ap the united nations stockpiles of food in afghanistan could run out this month a senior official warned wednesday threatening to add a hunger crisis to the challenges facing the country s new taliban rulers as they try to restore stability after decades of war about one third of the country s population of 38 million doesn t know if they will have a meal every day according to ramiz alakbarov the u n s humanitarian chief in afghanistan the u n s world food program has brought in food and distributed it to tens of thousands of people in recent weeks but with winter approaching and a drought ongoing at least 200 million is needed urgently to be able to continue to feed the most vulnerable afghans he said œby the end of september the stocks which the world food program has in the country will be out ť alakbarov told reporters at a virtual news conference œwe will not be able to provide those essential food items because we ll be out of stocks ť earlier u n officials said that of the 1 3 billion needed for overall aid efforts only 39 has been received the taliban who seized control of the country ahead of the withdrawal of american forces this week now must govern a nation that relies heavily on international aid and is in the midst of a worsening economic crisis in addition to the concerns about food supplies civil servants haven t been paid in months and the local currency is losing value most of afghanistan s foreign reserves are held abroad and currently frozen khalid payenda afghanistan s former acting finance minister on wednesday detailed a country existing in a dangerously fragile state speaking at georgetown university in washington payenda said the afghan currency had yet to crash because money exchanges had been shuttered but its value could plunge by more than 100 said payenda who described former afghan president ashraf ghani as withdrawn and paranoid ahead of the taliban takeover œi think the war had a toll on his psyche and he saw everything with suspicion ť payenda said part of the chaos reflects the speed at which the taliban took control of the country with payenda saying he thought the prior government could have been sustained for two or three more years because of commitments by international donors œi did not expect it to be this quickly ť payenda said œnobody actually did ť mohammad sharif a shopkeeper in the capital of kabul said shops and markets there have supplies but a major concern is rising food prices œif the situation continues like this and there is no government to control the prices that will cause so many problems for local people ť he said in the wake of the u s pullout many afghans are anxiously waiting to see how the taliban will rule when they were last in power before being driven out by the u s led invasion in 2001 they imposed draconian restrictions refusing to allow girls to go to school largely confining women to their homes and banning television music and even photography but more recently their leaders have sought to project a more moderate image schools have reopened to boys and girls though taliban officials have said they will study separately women are out on the streets wearing islamic headscarves as they always have rather than the all encompassing burqa the taliban required in the past the president of the united nations security council said wednesday that œthe real litmus test ť for the new taliban government will be how it treats women and girls ambassador geraldine byrne nason of ireland which holds the council s rotating presidency said the protection and promotion of human rights for women œmust be at the very heart of our collective response to the crisis ť the challenges the taliban face in reviving the economy could give western nations leverage as they push the group to fulfill a pledge to form an inclusive government and guarantee women s rights the taliban say they want to have good relations with other countries including the united states many afghans fear the taliban won t make good on those pledges and are concerned that the nation s economic situation holds little opportunity tens of thousands sought to flee the country as a result in a harrowing airlift but thousands who had worked with the u s and its allies as well as up to 200 americans remained in the country after the efforts ended with the last u s troops flying out of kabul international airport just before midnight monday president joe biden later defended his handling of the chaotic withdrawal and evacuation efforts which saw spasms of violence including a suicide bombing last week that killed 13 american service members and 169 afghans he said it was inevitable that the final departure from two decades of war would be difficult he said he remains committed to getting the americans left behind out if they want the taliban have said they will allow people with legal documents to travel freely but it remains to be seen whether any commercial airlines will be willing to offer service bilal karimi an official member in the taliban spokesman s office said wednesday that a team of turkish and qatari technicians arrived in kabul to help get the airport up and running again alakbarov the u n humanitarian official said the united nations is asking for access to the airport so it can deliver food and other supplies directly to the capital the taliban also have to contend with the threat from the islamic state group which is far more radical and claimed responsibility for the bombing at the airport the taliban have pledged they won t allow afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries a key u s demand since the militants once harbored the al qaida leaders who orchestrated the 9 11 attacks in the wake of last week s bombing american officials said drone strikes targeted the islamic state group s affiliate in afghanistan and biden vowed to keep up airstrikes army gen mark milley

labor day is here so this show is about labor in america our beloved workforce especially the middle income blue collar folks who literally have made this country great they make our businesses work they produce our goods and services they are also the brave military people who defend our nation and our freedom in all parts of the world american workers built this country and today even though they are often ignored by the current administration these working men and women of all colors are the heart and soul of america they built this country they defend the country and their values remain the bulwark of our country the first u s labor day was september 5 1882 i was there it was a beautiful day by 1894 congress passed an act making the first monday in september of each year a federal holiday president grover cleveland signed it into law cleveland by the way who was a free trader a firm supporter of the gold standard and a slayer of excess government spending is one of my favorite presidents sally pipes this labor day celebrate america s job creators as well as our workforce here in 2021 labor day should not be confused with labor unions the peak unionization rate in the u s was in 1954 at 28 of total employment as of the end of last year that was only 9 6 private sector unions have fallen to only 6 government unions which is really what drives today s union movement is holding at about 35 i ve always had a soft spot for private sector unions today they re mostly hard hat construction workers energy pipelines telecom and elsewhere jeff rhodes on labor day it s workers we honor not the unions that exploit them some of the great early leaders of the private company unions people like samuel gompers and then way later george meaney lane kirkland james hoffa these were great patriots strong anti communists in their day they bargained for higher wages and benefits but they did not hate business for the most part labor leaders after world war ii were conservative democrats with strong family values church goers and they knew that if the businesses went bankrupt their jobs would be lost today it s the government unions that run the democratic party especially the teachers union but also many others they dislike the private sector and free enterprise in the main they hate business they have gone completely woke and really formed the backbone of the far left progressive wing of the democratic party which is the driving force in today s democratic party it s too bad it has to be this way but it is this way these government unions live off the public taxpayers trough they love more government spending to line their pockets and cheer higher and higher taxes on the very geese that lay their golden eggs because without successful taxpayers i e men and women in business ordinary middle class blue collar folks these government union people wouldn t get paid think of it i have big beefs with this crowd but none bigger than my beef with the teachers unions their behavior in the last few years has been abominable labor day brings focus to economy declining union membership they don t want to teach they just want to get paid they mock the towns and school boards and parent groups that are meant to run our education system they oppose school choice charter schools religious schools and home schools because they know they can t compete with them they threw temper tantrums during the pandemic every time it seemed the public was going to force them to actually teach in the classroom they re still complaining and following non scientific ideas that are all about politics not health and then when they do teach they teach crazy things like critical race theory based on crazy anti historical ideas that our founders and any other white people is a perforce white supremacist they re teaching kids the wrong history the wrong values they re teaching discrimination as a solution to what they perceive as discrimination they teach racism as the answer to all our problems that is nonsense i suppose they re going to have to be part of labor day but i wish they weren t but meanwhile the bigger picture regarding america s 154 million workers is not good i m very glad they re going back to work as the economy has opened up and the unemployment rate is down to 5 4 residents in one state getting another round of stimulus checks that s wonderful but right now the whole thrust of the biden administration s economic and social policies is anti work their 6 trillion spending package massive across the board tax hikes huge central planning regulatory burdens great society type government welfare dependency bankrupting medicare attempts to force unionization wherever the federal government touches the economy which is virtually every nook and cranny their disregard for the benefits of legal immigration and clear borders to protect us all this is all about redistribution there s not one iota of job creation or growth or prosperity in these biden plans in fact groups like the tax foundation the university of pennsylvania wharton economic model and the nam rice university models show that the biden go woke go broke plan will lose millions of jobs while depressing gdp and sinking our capital stock cisa fbi issue ransomware warning for labor day other holidays if this stuff goes through the stock market will suffer enormously along with the economy ironically the government unions and the teachers who hate free enterprise business are among the biggest beneficiaries of the booming stock market and the corporate profits behind it their pension funds are roughly 70 invested in stocks this crowd loves big government socialism they hate free enterprise capitalism but they are living off the gains from that very free market capitalist system here s a basic formulation that the bidens and their left wing allies do not understand higher taxes on business and investment and foreign commerce and inheritance will lead to lower profits lower profits lead to lower wages lower profits also lead to lower spending on business equipment and technology less worker training and lower family incomes profits are the mother s milk of stocks and the lifeblood of the economy tax them away as per the woke bidens and you are devastating the economy and its workforce here on labor day i feel like repeating that america is about our unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that pursuit of happiness includes the virtue of work not welfare that pursuit of happiness includes rewarding success not punishing it that pursuit of happiness includes an equal opportunity at the starting line of life s endeavors but not equality at the finish line to that finish line we are guided by our god given talents to work to prosper to protect our families to protect our country i believe the old time labor leaders would agree with most of what i ve said not all but most unfortunately today s government union leaders and the biden administration they support probably don t agree with a single word i ve said get fox business on the go by clicking here so you know what folks i m going to invest my optimism in the good common sense of our immensely practical and much smarter than you think middle class blue collar old fashioned workforce they ve brought us this far with a few glitches here and there but somehow they managed to pull us through even though they seem to never get credit for it as a confirmed optimist i m going to bet on them again and when it comes to thinking about labor day it is they who i think of first and foremost this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the september 1 2021 edition of kudlow

you have got to be kidding me one would think that people would know better than to panic buy anything i figured that was one of the biggest lessons learned from the early days of the covid 19 pandemic but apparently not now that we are experiencing yet another wave of covid with the delta variant spreading across the country people have once again started panic buying toilet paper according to kcbd get our free mobile app get our free mobile app you talk about the ultimate vicious cycle that spirals out of control quickly irrational people begin to panic when they see the sharp rise in covid cases and immediately run out and start buying as much toilet paper as possible of course rational people don t like wiping their asses with their hands so whenever they hear that the shelves are quickly emptying at stores around town they re forced to go and stock up on toilet paper and next thing you know we have a shortage i haven t been to any grocery or big box stores here in wichita falls over the last few days so i can t tell you whether or not it s going on here but thankfully many of the retailers in town have put caps in place limiting the amount of hygiene supplies people can purchase to help curb the problem it s also being reported that toilet paper producers have increased production to keep up with the spike in demand so hopefully we won t have to deal with bare shelves for long or preferably not at all in the meantime we can all do our part by not buying 200 rolls of toilet paper at a time because if you need 200 rolls of toilet paper for a 10 day quarantine you probably should ve paid your doctor a visit a long time ago keep reading see 25 natural ways to boost your immune system

within the last two weeks a group of plaintiffs attorneys have filed derivative lawsuits in u s federal court in new york against three separate special purpose acquisition companies spacs pershing square tontine holdings psth go acquisition corp go and e merge technology acquisition corp e merge and certain directors and sponsors affiliated with the spacs on behalf of serial plaintiff george assad plaintiff s counsel notably includes former sec commissioner and current nyu law professor robert jackson as well as yale university law professor john morley the lawsuits allege among other things that the spacs are unregistered investment companies as defined in the investment company act of 1940 the ica while the size and prominence of psth and the novel complexities of the now abandoned business combination between psth and universal music group b v made psth a tempting target for the plaintiffs bar the similar lawsuits against go and e merge suggest a broader challenge to certain structural components of spacs the lawsuits allege that psth go and e merge and by implication the other 400 spacs presently seeking a business combination as well as any other company that raises a significant amount of capital relative to its other assets are investment companies under section 3 a 1 a of the ica because since their ipos investing in securities is basically the only thing that the companies have ever done with their assets the psth and e merge complaints also allege that certain personnel of the spac sponsors are acting as unregistered investment advisers under the investment advisers act of 1940 the iaa by advising on potential business combinations the lawsuits challenge the structure of spacs including the arrangement by which spac sponsors generally obtain class b shares equal to approximately 20 of a spac s post ipo outstanding equity which convert into class a shares upon completion of a business combination the lawsuits contend that the class b structure which was disclosed in the charters and prospectuses for each of the spacs is unreasonable and less than transparent on the basis of these allegations the complaints seek a declaratory judgment that the spacs are investment companies under the ica a declaratory judgment that the sponsor personnel are investment advisors in the case of psth and e merge an order that certain elements of such sponsors and certain of their directors equity in the spacs be rescinded as violations of the ica and disgorgement of allegedly excessive fees paid by the spacs although these lawsuits are receiving significant attention aided by the prominence of bill ackman and psth and the fact that plaintiffs counsel includes a former sec commissioner they rest on a misguided premise that conventional spacs are investment companies under the ica to be deemed an investment company under section 3 a 1 a of the ica a company must do more than merely invest in securities investing in securities must be the company s primary business the primary business of spacs however is to identify and consummate a business combination with one or more operating companies within a specified period of time this purpose is prominently disclosed on the cover page of every spac s ipo prospectus for example go s prospectus states that it is a blank check company newly incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities go further clarifies that it does not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale or plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor rather its business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post transaction business or assets for the long term although spacs park the proceeds from their ipos into trust accounts to be invested in short term treasuries and qualifying money market funds each spac s ipo prospectus states i that the trust account is intended as a holding place for the funds pending either the completion of an initial business combination or the failure to complete a business combination within a limited period of time typically 18 24 months ii that public investors may elect not to remain invested with the combined company and redeem their shares in exchange for the return of their initial 10 00 investment plus interest and iii that the offering is not intended for investors seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities the premise of the lawsuits is also contrary to the sec s long time interpretation of the ica s definition of investment company of the more than 1 000 spac ipos that have been reviewed by the sec over the past two decades none has been deemed to be subject to the ica although the sec s interpretations do not bind the courts absent a dramatic break with this regulatory precedent and a rejection of the plain reading of the ica it is unlikely that courts will find that a spac seeking to consummate a traditional business combination with an operating company will be subject to the ica a number of leading law firms have also publicly announced their disagreement with the lawsuits targeting spacs as unregistered

the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the fund s distribution policy distributions may be paid in part or in full from net investment income realized capital gains and by returning capital or a combination thereof to the extent that the fund has estimated that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income additionally a return of capital is not taxable rather it reduces a shareholder s tax basis in his or her shares of the fund thereby increasing the shareholder s potential gain or reducing its potential loss on the subsequent sale of those shares the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19 a notice are only estimates based on book earnings are likely to change over time and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the entirety of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund intends to send you a form 1099 div for the calendar year that will instruct you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes this quarterly distribution reflects the fund s current distribution policy to provide shareholders with a relatively stable cash flow per share there is no guarantee that the fund s current distribution policy will reduce or eliminate the fund s market price discount to its net asset value nav per share if any and the fund s trustees have no fiduciary duty to take action or to consider taking any action to narrow any such discount the distribution policy may be amended suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice about the fund the fund is a closed end fund with the primary investment objective of seeking high current income capital appreciation is a secondary objective the fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing under normal circumstances at least 50 of its total assets in income generating equity securities from time to time shares of the fund may trade at a premium to nav or a discount to nav during such periods when the fund s nav per share is above the market price there may be an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of the fund at a discount to their underlying value the fund s premium or discount to nav may vary over time and shares of the fund may subsequently be worth more or less than their original cost shares of closed end funds frequently trade at a discount from their nav this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund s nav has decreased in the past and may decrease in the future as a result of its investment activities and other events neither the investment manager nor the fund can predict whether shares of the fund will trade at below or above nav the risk of holding shares of the fund that might trade at a discount is more pronounced for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time after acquiring them because for those investors realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon the existence of a premium or discount than upon portfolio performance the shares of the fund are designed primarily for long term investors and should not be considered a vehicle for trading purposes the nav of the fund s shares typically will fluctuate with price changes of the fund s portfolio securities and these fluctuations are likely to be greater in the case of a fund which uses leverage as the fund may from time to time in the event that shares of the fund trade at a premium to nav there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease or that the shares of the fund will not trade at a discount to nav thereafter the market price for the fund is based on supply and demand which fluctuates daily based on many factors such as economic conditions and global events investor sentiment and security specific factors there is no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be attained past performance is no guarantee of future results you should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing the fund

the u s justice department is readying a second monopoly lawsuit against google over the internet search giant s digital advertising business according to a report adding to the legal challenges facing the tech giant the justice department sued google in october 2020 accusing the 1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals a trial which is expected to be extremely lengthy has been set for september 2023 on wednesday bloomberg news reported that the justice department is preparing a second suit accusing the company of abusing its position as the preeminent search engine a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment google is to be faced with a second antitrust lawsuit according to a bloomberg report the first justice department case was filed in october 2020 asked about the report google responded in an email that its advertising technologies help websites and apps fund their content enable small businesses to grow and protect users from exploitative privacy practices and bad ad experiences the october 2020 lawsuit at a glance the department of justice lawsuit claims that google is breaching the sherman act by unfairly locking up portions of the market there are three facets to how the government claims it does this 1 dominating search engine space google through both its deals placing its search engine above others on devices and through public interest in it accounts for 80 percent of every internet search in the us in 2020 it accounted for 94 of all mobile searches in the us 2 monetizing its dominance through ads google monetizes the amount people use it with ads which generate around 40billion in revenue every year 3 spending its billions to cement its dominance with exclusionary deals with the money it makes through ads google pays companies like apple lg and others to block out any of its competitors from having their search engine preferred on devices among the deals is one with apple google is the default on safari on iphones and it s also the default on siri the deal amounts to up to a fifth of apple s worldwide income which last year would have been around 11billion advertisement in july a lawsuit by 38 u s states and territories accuses google of abusing its market power in an effort to make its search engine as dominant inside cars tvs and speakers as it is in phones the lawsuit reads google has employed anticompetitive tactics to diminish and disincentivize competition in android app distribution google has not only targeted potentially competing app stores but also has ensured that app developers themselves have no reasonable choice but to distribute their apps through the google play store it added google requires that some apps use the company s payment tools and give google as much as 30 of digital goods sales the lawsuit reads that google also requires all app developers that sell content through the google play store to sell any digital in app content through google play billing google now stringently enforces this tie by preventing apps distributed through the google play store from using directing consumers to or even informing consumers about alternative payment processing options that may provide lower prices the lawsuit also alleges that google has steadily expanded its illegal tie regarding payments to music and video streaming services effective september 2021 subscription streaming services for music and video which google previously exempted must either submit to google s tie or deny consumers the ability to purchase subscriptions from their android apps the lawsuit reads the lawsuit added google s comparable streaming services will gain an enormous competitive advantage moreover the non google payment processors that these services currently use will be forced out of the in app payment iap market as to these services this was consolidated with the federal lawsuit texas backed by other states then filed a separate lawsuit against google accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business merrick garland the attorney general is leading a justice department that president joe biden has urged to be aggressive in challenging big tech sundar pichai the ceo of google is pictured in january 2020 his company insists that they are not a monopoly but people simply use his search engine and products because they work google s svp of global affairs kent walker responded to the federal lawsuit and said it was trivially easy to change an internet browser he said that the justice department was deeply flawed he picked apart the government s lawsuit by subject starting with the laws it is trying to claim google is breaking calling them dubious and saying it was trivially easy to change your internet browser this isn t the dial up 1990s when changing services was slow and difficult and often required you to buy and install software with a cd rom walker said this lawsuit claims that americans aren t sophisticated enough to do this but we know that s not true he said the doj is invoking the sherman act which is designed to stop businesses from blocking competitors from the market it claims that google s exclusionary partnerships with companies like apple and others mean no other search engines have the opportunity to compete at all because google makes by far the most money through monetizing its search engine and therefore has the most to spend placing its ads the others are likely never to be considered for placement on the devices eleven republican attorneys general have signed on to it google denies this claiming their competitors are welcome to go after the contracts the department s complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make google search easily available to people yes like countless other businesses we pay to promote our services just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at the end of a row or on a shelf at eye level for digital services when you first buy a device it has a kind of home screen eye level shelf the sherman act forbids nefarious dealings to establish or maintain a monopoly to stifle competition a 144 page lawsuit filed by 36 states and the district of columbia in u s district court for the northern district of california it claims google violated the sherman act the federal law prohibiting monopolistic business practices the sherman act forbids nefarious dealings to establish or maintain a monopoly by restraining free competition the act was famously used in 1911 to break up standard oil and again in 1982 to split up at t s monopoly known colloquially as ma bell in 2001 microsoft survived a sherman act suit settling with the doj without breaking up advertisement on mobile that shelf is controlled by apple as well as companies like at t verizon samsung and lg on desktop computers that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by microsoft so we negotiate agreements with many of those companies for eye level shelf space but let s be clear our competitors are readily available too if you want to use them our agreements with apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software other search engines including microsoft s bing compete with us for these agreements and our agreements have passed repeated antitrust reviews walker said the company s contract with apple for example uses google s product because it is the best and that yahoo and bing can also pay to have their search engines feature predominantly changing your search engine in safari is easy on desktop one click and you re presented with a range of options apple s iphone makes it simple to change your settings and use alternative search engines in safari and it s even easier in ios14 where you can add widgets from different providers or swipe on the home screen to search walker wrote google is not preloaded onto microsoft which uses its own search engine bing walker goes on to say the bigger point is that people don t use google because they have to they use it because they choose to reuters reported in march that google s plan to block cookies a popular web tracking tool concerns u s justice department investigators who have been asking ad industry executives whether that would hobble smaller rivals in july joe biden announced that he plans to nominate jonathan kanter as head of the justice departments antitrust division as the administration aims to crack down on big tech kanter has been a longtime foe of google and as a lawyer pushed his clients to sue the company and other big tech giants for antitrust his nomination came less than two weeks after biden signed an executive order designed to promote competition and crack down on huge companies dominating the market president joe biden announced his nomination of jonathan kanter to serve as the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division at the department of justice in july the biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise tim wu for the national economic council and lina khan to be a commissioner at the federal trade commission if confirmed by the senate kanter would join khan and wu as the most senior officials charged with taking on these firms khan and wu already have a track record of pushing for tougher regulations of these companies kanter who previously worked for paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison llp and two other big law firms would take the reins of the justice department s antitrust division amid calls for tougher antitrust enforcement especially with regard to four big tech platforms google facebook amazon and apple in a statement the white house said kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience the biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise tim wu for the national economic council and lina khan to be a commissioner at the federal trade commission throughout his career kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy he is currently a partner at the kanter law group llp which is a boutique antitrust law firm that advocates in favor of federal and state antitrust law enforcement kanter according to bloomberg was one of the first advocates for aggressive antitrust action against tech companies in 2016 he criticized antitrust officials for failing to bring monopoly cases against big tech companies including amazon antitrust enforcement is barely on life support he said at the time when was the last time you can remember a major antitrust agency bringing a monopolization case the reason you can t remember it is because they haven t done it democrats especially from the progressive wing of the party cheered biden s choice jonathan kanter s nomination to lead the justice department s antitrust division is tremendous news for workers and consumers tweeted sen elizabeth warren he s been a leader in the fight to check consolidated corporate power and strengthen competition in our markets rep david cicilline tweeted once again president biden is following through on his promise to fight for working families and create an economy that works for everyone jonathan kanter is absolutely the right person to take on corporate monopolies and lead the antitrust division at this critical moment in a joint statement with house judiciary chairman jerry nadler he and cicilline added make no mistake kanter is absolutely the right person for this job at this moment rep

austin texas texans age 21 and older can carry handguns without a license or training starting wednesday despite opposition from instructors who teach people how to be responsible shooters legislation signed by gov greg abbott eliminates the requirement for texas residents to obtain a license to carry handguns raul camacho chief firearms instructor at safety measures llc and 50 other experts urged lawmakers to vote against the bill camacho said he believes training helps reduce the main reasons for gun accidents which he said are ignorance and carelessness to have people less educated on the laws less educated on the actual firearm and how to use it and have no basic training whatsoever he said it s a recipe for disaster before today texas residents could only obtain a license to carry a handgun after completing a four hour course by a licensed instructor and demonstrating basic shooting ability by firing at a target another gun related bill signed by the governor allows school marshals and hotel guests to carry guns supporters of the new law have said it will allow texans to better defend themselves in public and abolish what they see as barriers to the constitutional right to bear arms camacho said that argument about restoring gun owners rights doesn t make sense to him restore what rights you know you can carry a long gun a shotgun in public without a license you can carry your handgun in your vehicle have it in your home he said people s rights were never taken away texas already has at least 1 6 million handgun license holders it also has been the site of several mass shootings including at an el paso walmart a church in sutherland springs and a high school outside houston source texas news service

the 3 5 trillion tax hike being pushed by president biden and congressional democrats would be the largest tax increase since 1968 in nominal dollars biden s 3 5 trillion tax increase would be the largest in history but even when comparing this tax as a percentage of the economy this tax hike would be the largest in more than 50 years while democrats claim this tax increase will fall on the rich the proposal will raise taxes on small businesses and working families some of the tax increases proposed by biden and democrats include 1 raising the federal corporate income tax to 28 percent after accounting for state corporate taxes biden would give the u s a 32 percent corporate rate a tax rate significantly higher than communist china s 25 percent tax rate this tax increase will harm working families as a significant portion of this tax is borne by workers in the form of lower wages and lost jobs this is not a point of contention in a 2017 report stephen entin of the tax foundation found that 70 of corporate taxes are borne by labor other economists argue that anywhere from 20 to 50 to even 100 of the tax hits workers it will also harm families by increasing the costs of household goods and services a 2020 study by the national bureau of economic research found that 31 of the corporate tax falls on consumers this tax increase won t just hit large businesses one million c corporations are classified as small employers defined by the small business administration as any independent business with fewer than 500 employees a corporate tax increase will also threaten the life savings of families by reducing the value of publicly traded stocks in brokerage accounts or in 401 k s individual investors opened 10 million new brokerage accounts in 2020 and at least 53 of households own stock in addition 80 million to 100 million people have a 401 k and 46 4 million households have an individual retirement account voters do not want the united states to have a higher corporate tax than china according to polling conducted by harrisx after voters were informed that china has a 25 percent corporate rate they were asked at what level should the us set the corporate tax rate among all respondents the median answer was 21 percent 2 retroactive tax increases on capital gains and dividends president biden has proposed doubling the capital gains tax rate under biden the average top capital gains rate will be 48 8 percent after state taxes in biden s proposed budget it is assumed that the capital gains tax hike took effect in late april making it a retroactive tax the retroactive nature of this tax would cause anxiety and uncertainty ultimately leading to severe economic damage people make financial plans based on existing or expected policy this tax imposes double taxation on corporate income first businesses pay the corporate income tax on their earnings second the investor pays the capital gains tax on dividends received or stocks when they are sold this double taxation discourages savings suppresses productivity and discourages investment ultimately this tax hike will threaten business creation business expansion entrepreneurship and jobs and wages biden s capital gains tax hike could also reduce retirement savings as part of his tax hike biden would double the tax rate on carried interest capital gains this will harm private equity investors including the 165 public pension funds representing 20 million public sector workers biden s tax hikes could even reduce federal revenues in the short term because the tax only applies when a taxpayer sells the asset a high capital gains rate discourages individuals from selling in order to delay having to pay the tax historically when the capital gains tax was cut revenue increased when the capital gains tax is low investment increases stock prices increase and revenue goes up the inverse is of course true 3 creating a second death tax by repealing step up in basis democrats are proposing the creation of a second death tax by repealing step up in basis this will impose the capital gains tax which biden has proposed raising to 43 4 percent on the unrealized gains of every asset owned by a taxpayer when they die and will be imposed in addition to the existing 40 percent death tax repeal of step up in basis will create new complexity for many taxpayers including family owned businesses it will force predominantly family owned businesses to downsize and liquidate assets leading to fewer jobs lower wages and reduced gdp in fact 78 percent of small business owners say that democrats repeal of step up in basis would have crippling consequences for small businesses according to a survey recently released by the sbe council as noted by the ernst and young study repeal of step up in basis will increase the cost of capital and discourage new investment this negative economic impact will cost 80 000 jobs each year for the first ten years increasing to 100 000 jobs each year thereafter one third of the tax will also fall on american workers in the form of lower wages repealing step up in basis has already been tried and failed in 1976 congress eliminated stepped up basis but it was so complicated and unworkable it was repealed in 1980 before it took effect 4 increasing the top income tax rate to 39 6 percent this tax increase will hit small business that are organized as sole proprietorships llcs partnerships and s corporations these pass through entities pay taxes through the individual side of the tax code of the 26 million businesses in 2014 95 percent were pass throughs pass through businesses also account for 55 2 percent or 65 7 million of all private sector workers more than half of all pass through income would be taxed at this new higher rate a significant portion of business income is paid through the individual side of the tax code as noted in a senate finance committee report in 2016 only 42 percent of net business income in the united states was earned by corporations down from 78 3 percent in 1980 5 imposing a 15 percent minimum tax on book income this tax increase will create a new minimum tax on american businesses and disallow important bipartisan credits and deductions that help promote job creation and economic growth the left routinely disparages businesses that lower their federal income tax liability through the use of credits and deductions falsely arguing that these businesses are using tax loopholes in reality these businesses are using a number important bipartisan tax provisions like research and development tax credits full business expensing and the deduction for net operating losses for instance in 2009 speaker pelosi hailed legislation expanding nols arguing the provision helps businesses succeed and hire new people similarly president obama pushed to expand full business expensing arguing it would be a strong incentive to increase investment 6 imposing global tax hikes that will make american business uncompetitive democrats have proposed several international tax increases on american businesses they want to modify the global intangible low taxed income gilti regime and impose a global minimum tax on american businesses of up to 26 25 percent this would be significantly higher than the 15 percent global minimum tax rate that biden treasury secretary janet yellen is pushing to get adopted by the g 20 and the oecd this will impose double taxation on american businesses and make it difficult for them to compete against foreign companies under biden s plan an american business operating in the united kingdom will face british taxes and then american taxes by comparison a british business operating in the u s will only pay u s taxes because the uk has a territorial system that only taxes income earned in that country in addition to higher taxes on american businesses this new tax would be calculated on a country by country basis creating significant new tax complexity for american businesses democrats also want to repeal the deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii if this tax increase goes into effect it will ship american intellectual property and jobs overseas creating long term economic damage to the country this proposal would undermine american competitiveness and benefit foreign countries like china that provide extensive and generous tax credits and subsidies to incentivize ip as it stands the u s already provides relatively modest tax benefits to ip in comparison to the generous tax subsidies provided by many foreign countries in fact according to a 2020 study by the information technology innovation foundation the u s ranks 24th out of 34 comparable countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd of the four member brics brazil russia india and china china also recently enacted a 200 percent super deduction for eligible research and development expenses and has a preferential 15 percent tax rate for high tech enterprises with a covid wracked economy and rampant inflation the last thing america needs now is an enormous tax increase

wwema window governmental policy and the impacts on construction costs by allen walker there are a few current governmental policies that have impacted the construction cost of water and wastewater infrastructure over the last several years some are older policies that were established many years ago and some are newer policies that were implemented to help u s manufacturers compete in these markets against foreign manufacturers there is some discussion now in washington to implement more policies such as 15 minimum wage and revisions to the made in america requirements for purchases using federal money both direct and indirect the intent of this conversation is not to take a pro or con position on these policies but to inform the reader about how current policies and potential future policies are impacting construction costs in the water and wastewater infrastructure market to begin this conversation one must remember that the federal government has a number of funding programs that municipalities can apply to for low interest loans grants and partial forgiveness of loans usda rural utility service and drinking water and clean water state revolving fund srf monies are examples of such funding programs that are available for water and wastewater improvement projects if a municipality gets some of this funding there are certain requirements or protocols that must be adhered to when the project is built examples of these protocols are paying workers at rates established by the davis bacon act for various trades and buying products that meet the american iron and steel ais requirements as outlined by congress in the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 direct federal procurement is governed by the 1933 buy american act baa and its subsequent amendments the takeaway from the above is that the various payment and purchasing protocols are in general adding construction costs to the project that some smaller utilities will have to repay over time in some cases the added costs are driving smaller utilities away from badly needed assistance from federal programs while larger utilities may not be as impacted to the same degree as small utilities because they have several sources of funding including a larger ratepayer base and access to the bond market but they will be impacted nonetheless however the impact of these requirements will be greatest on those utilities least likely to have the resources to comply with them there are ongoing discussions in washington to increase the minimum wage and to modify the buy american act and potentially expand the american iron and steel provisions for the srfs for those who deal with direct federal procurement you are strongly encouraged to review and comment on the proposed changes to the baa that were published in the federal register on july 30 2021 comments are due by september 28 2021 and a public meeting is scheduled for august 26 2021 in addition the senate passed the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act on august 10 2021 that expands not only buy american act requirements but also greatly expands domestic content requirements for indirect federal funding such as that received by u s epa for the srf and wifia programs rather than the list of covered iron and steel products that we have complied with over the last seven years the bill seeks to expand iron and steel requirements to all manufactured goods such as pumps motors filtration and membrane systems as well as impose a percent of domestic content on all manufactured products at a minimum if such legislation is successful expect to see potentially significant changes to the ais compliance for water infrastructure improvement projects using federal dollars the latent impact of this will be to drive construction costs up and further exacerbate an already challenged supply chain serious questions also remain as to whether the water sector will even be able to compete with sectors such as roads bridges and transit for the finite iron and steel capacity currently available in the u s the end result of this is that the utility ratepayers water customers will have to pay higher rates for their water and sewer bills there are certainly potential benefits for u s workers and u s manufacturers at the root of these changes which are good goals however there does need to be a recognition by the policymakers that nothing is free and that if no further thought is given to these changes the ratepayers or customers of these utilities will eventually pay the higher cost for these changes if they can even source the products and technologies they need to continue to protect public health and the environment what additional actions could be considered some ideas are to increase the portion of grant vs loan in the federal funding extend the loan periods out a few more years or agree to keep the interest rate on these federal loans at the lowest rates possible at the time of the loan if you are not familiar with these loan programs it s useful to know the srf loans are designed to be self sustaining the utility pays back the loan and interest to the srf and generates growth or at the least attempts to maintain a certain principal value in the loan that other utilities can use over time you can also assume that grant money and forgiveness loan portions mean exactly that it is money given to the project construction cost that is not required to be repaid by the borrower these grant and forgiveness loan vehicles are offered to the utilities most in need such as ones that are recognizing a declining population rate and may struggle to cover the costs of badly needed infrastructure upgrades with the collection rates from the existing customer base washington should attentively listen to a wide range of folks in the infrastructure market also known as stakeholders to make sure that with all the proposed legislation being considered there is not too much of a negative impact on the ratepayer the proposed ideas for infrastructure bills minimum wage bills and buy american bills should have some connected dots so that one bill by itself doesn t impact another bill to the point the community needing an infrastructure upgrade cannot afford it while the likely influx of new money and the recognition of the special needs of particularly small utilities is greatly appreciated let s make sure expanded federal requirements and more strings attached to the money doesn t make it untenable for the water sector the goal here is to get infrastructure moving people back to work at well paying jobs and to continue to ensure the u s leadership role in protecting public health and the environment let s not construct barriers that keep those goals from being achieved allen walker is a senior sales engineer with templeton and associates engineering sales he is also the chair of the wwema manufacturers representative council and is a

notification of sources of distribution statement pursuant to section 19 a of the investment company act of 1940 millbrook ny accesswire september 1 2021 a quarterly distribution of 0 25 per share was declared today by dividend and income fund otc pink dnif net asset value symbol xdnix the fund payable september 28 2021 to shareholders of record as of september 16 2021 ex dividend date september 15 2021 under u s tax rules applicable to the fund the amount and character of distributable income for each tax year can be finally determined only as of the end of the fund s tax year however under section 19 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended 1940 act and related rules the fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders the information provided herein does not represent information for tax reporting purposes earnings and profits on a tax basis may differ this notice discloses information on the sources of the distribution as required by section 19 a of the 1940 act as of september 1 2021 and based on the fund s results and estimates for the current quarter the current distribution of 0 25 per share would include approximately 25 75 and 0 from net investment income capital gains and return of capital respectively shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the fund s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the fund s distribution policy distributions may be paid in part or in full from net investment income realized capital gains and by returning capital or a combination thereof to the extent that the fund has estimated that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income additionally a return of capital is not taxable rather it reduces a shareholder s tax basis in his or her shares of the fund thereby increasing the shareholder s potential gain or reducing its potential loss on the subsequent sale of those shares the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19 a notice are only estimates based on book earnings are likely to change over time and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the entirety of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund intends to send you a form 1099 div for the calendar year that will instruct you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes this quarterly distribution reflects the fund s current distribution policy to provide shareholders with a relatively stable cash flow per share there is no guarantee that the fund s current distribution policy will reduce or eliminate the fund s market price discount to its net asset value nav per share if any and the fund s trustees have no fiduciary duty to take action or to consider taking any action to narrow any such discount the distribution policy may be amended suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice about the fund the fund is a closed end fund with the primary investment objective of seeking high current income capital appreciation is a secondary objective the fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing under normal circumstances at least 50 of its total assets in income generating equity securities from time to time shares of the fund may trade at a premium to nav or a discount to nav during such periods when the fund s nav per share is above the market price there may be an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of the fund at a discount to their underlying value the fund s premium or discount to nav may vary over time and shares of the fund may subsequently be worth more or less than their original cost shares of closed end funds frequently trade at a discount from their nav this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund s nav has decreased in the past and may decrease in the future as a result of its investment activities and other events neither the investment manager nor the fund can predict whether shares of the fund will trade at below or above nav the risk of holding shares of the fund that might trade at a discount is more pronounced for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time after acquiring them because for those investors realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon the existence of a premium or discount than upon portfolio performance the shares of the fund are designed primarily for long term investors and should not be considered a vehicle for trading purposes the nav of the fund s shares typically will fluctuate with price changes of the fund s portfolio securities and these fluctuations are likely to be greater in the case of a fund which uses leverage as the fund may from time to time in the event that shares of the fund trade at a premium to nav there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease or that the shares of the fund will not trade at a discount to nav thereafter the market price for the fund is based on supply and demand which fluctuates daily based on many factors such as economic conditions and global events investor sentiment and security specific factors there is no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be attained past performance is no guarantee of future results you should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing the fund

company among other things the petition stated that the detailed analysis of the western blots shows a series of anomalies that are suggestive of systematic data manipulation and misrepresentation it also stated that the methodology for studies about simufilam s effects in experiments conducted on postmortem human brain tissue defies logic and the data presented again have hallmarks of manipulation the petition further stated that after initial analyses of phase 2b trials found that simufilam was ineffective in improving the primary biomarkers endpoint cassava had these samples analyzed again and this time reported that simufilam rapidly and robustly improved a wide array of biomarkers and the reanalysis shows signs of data anomalies or manipulation on august 25 2021 before

the uk s broadcasting watchdog called attempts to silence mailonline columnist mr morgan a chilling restriction on freedom of expression after the duchess of sussex was among a wave of people who complained that his questioning of her account of royal racism and suicidal thoughts was harmful and offensive to viewers following the announcement however itv revealed they have no current plans to invite him to present good morning britain with one source saying piers decided to leave we accepted his decision the sun said that good morning britain bosses viewed there being a slim to no chance that mr morgan would return to the itv show which he quit in the aftermath of the coverage of meghan and harry s oprah interview which ofcom went on to investigate it remains to be seen if other hosting roles at the network could be made available speaking about losing his gmb job yesterday after the ofcom decision mr morgan said i didn t want to lose my job in the first place but i only really want to work for someone who supports freedom of speech and free expression and i felt frankly that itv let me down and let their viewers down petitions to have mr morgan reinstated in his gmb role are still being signed with three different appeals on change org reaching a collective total of 264 201 signatures executives at itv are currently hunting for a potential permanent replacement

leaving itv s flagship breakfast show has accelerated since he was found not to have breach ofcom s broadcasting code speaking to the sun he slammed the duchess of sussex as the queen of woke and described her as a whiny forked tongued actress mr morgan said the woke brigade think they can vilify shame silence and get fired anyone who has an opinion they don t like meghan markle is the queen of this culture who personally sought to have me lose my job and succeeded why are she and prince harry entitled to have their opinion but i m not entitled to mine questions remained last night over whether there is still a slim chance that piers morgan could return to host good morning britain after he was triumphantly cleared of breaching broadcasting rules by ofcom for comments he made in a debate over harry and meghan s oprah interview on march 8 pictured more than 57 000 people including meghan contacted the regulator after the former good morning britain presenter said he didn t

beresford before quitting the programme hours later after refusing to apologise he immediately hit back at itv s statement for ignoring the central thrust of ofcom s conclusion stating that he was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account he said yesterday hmmm itv have just put out a statement saying i only won the ofcom case against princess pinocchio because my colleagues expressed different opinions to mine that s not what the ofcom report says in its conclusion i suggest itv reads it again itv s left leaning former guardian chief ceo dame carolyn mccall is also under pressure to explain why she forced him out in march hours after the duchess of sussex complained to her directly and allegedly demanded his head on a plate mr morgan said in his column piers morgan s itv colleagues and a string of respected broadcasters yesterday hailed ofcom s ruling confirming his right to free speech after the watchdog dismissed 57 000 complaints about his criticism of meghan markle senior british journalists have declared that the judgment meant a pillar of our freedom in the uk had been reinforced mr morgan wrote in a mailonline column yesterday i m delighted that ofcom has so emphatically supported my right to disbelieve the duke and duchess of sussex s incendiary claims to oprah winfrey many of which have since been proved to be untrue this is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for princess pinocchios in light of this decision do i get my job back he added in his column i was reliably informed recently that meghan markle wrote directly to my itv boss dame carolyn mccall the night before i was forced out demanding my head on a plate apparently she stressed that she was writing to dame carolyn personally because they were both women and mothers a nauseating playing of the gender and maternity card if ever there was one what has the world come to when a whiny fork tongued actress can dictate who presents a morning television news programme ofcom yesterday found no rules were breached and backed mr morgan s right to rigorously challenge the duchess s account of suffering suicidal thoughts and claims she experienced racism at the hands of the royal family the decision has led to a flurry of calls demanding he is given his job back with fans using the hashtag bringbackpiers claiming the show is dying a slow death without him in complete vindication for the journalist 56 ofcom ruled mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account and in a damning indictment of his former bosses and the 50 000 plus people who complained the watchdog found the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience piers morgan ofcom s vindication of me is a resounding victory for freedom of speech mr morgan immediately hit back at itv s statement for ignoring the central thrust of ofcom s conclusion amid calls for him to be reinstated on their flagship gmb programme broadcasters praised ofcom s decision and said the ruling protects freedom of speech in britain and the ability of presenters to be sceptical about claims made by the rich and powerful overall ofcom considered that there is a high public interest value in broadcasting open and frank discussions about race and racism as long as they comply with the code we also considered that the interview between the duke and duchess of sussex and oprah winfrey contained serious allegations and it was legitimate for this programme to discuss and scrutinise those claims mr morgan insisted he would continue to lead the charge against insidious cancel culture reports the sun what ofcom said about the complaints about piers morgan and gmb what ofcom said about allegations that piers morgan s opinions about meghan markle s oprah interview were harmful and offensive the interview between the duke and duchess of sussex and oprah winfrey contained serious allegations and it was legitimate for this programme to discuss and scrutinise those claims including their veracity ofcom is clear that consistent with freedom of expression mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account the code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive and for broadcasters to include these in their programming the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience however in instances where such viewpoints carry a potential for harm or offence it is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that adequate protection from harm and sufficient context is provided among the other 57 000 complaints not upheld by ofcom were the programme incited hatred and racism comments made by piers morgan were not duly impartial susanna reid did not do enough to challenge mr morgan s views mr morgan was only giving his opinion which is a right under freedom of expression the content misrepresented facts by selectively showing newspaper front pages mr morgan mocked the american accent which is offensive the combative tone of the programme was not suitably scheduled for child viewers advertisement he told the newspaper this is a woman who smeared the royal family when prince philip was ill in hospital and later died she is a woman who has caused the queen appalling extra aggravation as she buried her husband and for me to be accused of being racist for simply disbelieving two people who we now know said many untrue things in that oprah interview is outrageous absolutely nothing i ve ever said about meghan markle has anything to do with the colour of her skin that slur made me very angry this cancel culture is a form of fascism that has to end i intend to continue leading the campaign against this insidious cancel culture and to promote freedom of speech and freedom of expression mr morgan also said the number of job offers he has received accelerated after his comments about the duchess of sussex were found not to have breached ofcom s broadcasting code speaking outside his home following the broadcasting watchdog s ruling on good morning britain he said i have had loads of offers and they have accelerated in the last 10 hours as you can imagine and i will take my free speech campaign around the world and all i require is to have an employer who believes in it as passionately as i do morgan said the rise in good morning britain s ratings during his stint on the programme means he is a valuable commodity adding i m considering some very interesting offers right now and i will make a decision quite soon this is a landmark ruling by ofcom today this is ofcom saying i and any other broadcaster is entitled to say to a public figure i don t believe you because if they had gone the other way and said i had to believe meghan markle even when she was lying where does that leave us with government ministers who i was challenging during the pandemic reacting to yesterday s ruling which will infuriate the sussexes itv news royal editor chris ship who appeared on one of the shows that attracted 57 000 complaints tweeted so what does itv do about piers morgan s job at good morning britain now ofcom has cleared him and the tv network of a breach of the broadcasting code mr morgan s

doing a splendid job standing up for freedom of speech and presenters right to be sceptical of the rich and powerful mailonline journalist and gb news host dan wootton said piers morgan rightly cleared by ofcom freedom of speech wins the day and woke itv ruined their own hit breakfast show in the process wouldn t want to be harry waking up next to meghan in montecito in the morning when she picks up her phone but in its statement yesterday itv claimed that it was its editorial decisions that led to the ruling that good morning britain was not in breach of the broadcasting code over piers

provided which was key in mitigating against the potential for harm and offence which could have been caused by piers morgan s comments it is because of the programme s editorial decisions and the opposing views which were forcefully expressed by other presenters and guests that the programme did not breach ofcom s rules but mr morgan has dismissed itv s reasoning and tweeted hmmm itv have just put out a statement saying i only won the ofcom case against princess pinocchio because my colleagues expressed different opinions to mine that s not what the ofcom report says in its conclusion i suggest itv reads it again within 48 hours of the oprah interview on march 7 this year mr morgan was forced to quit gmb after he refused to apologise for his honestly held opinions costing itv around 790 000 viewers and millions more in advertising revenue with the ratings gap between gmb and rival bbc breakfast still growing on the day piers quit gmb was in the lead other complainants to ofcom

restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience mr morgan this evening took to instagram to share a quote from prime minister winston churchill he wrote everyone is in favour of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some people s idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone else says anything back that is an outrage in what is being hailed as a victory for free speech wednesday s ofcom report found the interview between the duke and duchess of sussex and oprah winfrey contained serious allegations and it was legitimate for good morning britain to discuss and scrutinise those claims including their veracity piers morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to

the audience royal biographer angela levin author of 2018 book harry conversations with the prince said yesterday marvellous result from ofcom that harry and meghan s interview with oprah can be criticised upbeat for freedom of expression i also wonder if piers morgan will get his job back royal expert robert jobson said well done piers morgan on the ofcom decision a victory for common sense and free speech one tory mp welcomed the decision and said it is a question of free speech he shouldn t be censored for what he says i think the views he expresses many people in the country would probably agree with it is common sense you don t have to like what he says but he has a right to say it they added i would be extremely nervous if a regulator was stopping people on tv saying what they thought this morning s ruling is highly damaging and embarrassing to itv who face questions over its failure to protect the free speech of its star presenter who quit 48 hours later after the former suits actress complained directly to chief executive carolyn mccall who ordered him to apologise the duchess of sussex told tens of millions of people that an unnamed royal was racist towards archie said kate middleton made her cry in a row over bridesmaids dresses and accused buckingham palace of ignoring her pleas for help when she was pregnant and suicidal human rights lawyer pours scorn on omid scobie s claim that ofcom could have breached the human rights act royal author omid scobie s suggestion that ofcom could have broken the human rights act by clearing piers morgan over his comments about meghan markle was yesterday dismissed by a legal expert the watchdog found good morning britain was not in breach of its code after mr morgan said that he didn t believe a word of what meghan told oprah winfrey but mr scobie said he questioned the decision because freedom of expression under the 1998 act is subject to the restriction of protection of health or morals however a human rights barrister insisted mr morgan is not a public authority so is not himself bound by the human rights act and therefore cannot have breached it adam wagner of doughty street chambers in london added that ofcom had not breached its duties under the act after it gave a detailed and reasoned response mr scobie who co authored prince harry and meghan s biography finding freedom is a trusted media contact of the sussexes and often defends them in the public eye mr scobie tweeted last night under article 10 of the human rights act 1998 freedom of speech ensures everyone in uk has the right to freedom of expression but it is not absolute that freedom can also be subject to laws and formalities conditions restrictions necessary in a democratic society one of those restrictions is protection of health or morals which makes me question ofcom s decision while everyone should be free to express opinion on public figures discrediting a person s mental health issues on tv reinforced a dangerous stigma and put others at risk replying to a comment by one of his 71 000 followers mr scobie later added it sets a worrying precedent for ofcom to be giving the nod to this kind of commentary advertisement in the hours after the interview aired in the us which exploded harry and meghan s relationship with the royal family mr morgan told good morning britain viewers i m sorry i don t believe a word she says i wouldn t believe her if she read me a weather report the fact she has expressed an onslaught against our royal family is contemptible and on her claims she told palace officials she didn t want to be alive anymore piers asked who did you go to what did they say mr morgan also said on the breakfast news show whose ratings he transformed during his six years as presenter that meghan had scripted in discussions on mental health and race that could be played against the royal family at the time of the interview the times reported that palace staff had accused meghan of being a bully mr morgan said her camp immediately said they can t be believed those victims can t be believed and yet we re supposed to believe everything meghan markle now says about her own terrible ordeal of bullying and racism and all the rest of it you can t have it both ways we re not allowed to believe the apparent victims of her own bullying but we have to believe everything she says more than 57 000 viewers complained to ofcom after the presenter s gave his view on meghan s performance hours later itv executive kevin lygo is said to have told off piers before the channel s chief executive ms mccall the former boss of the left wing guardian newspaper sided with the duchess in a public statement and said i completely believe what she said the following day he then shocked viewers by walking off camera during a heated on air row with weatherman alex beresford who accused him of unfairly trashing meghan piers quit the programme hours later mr morgan is understood to have again been ordered to apologise but he refused and quit instead saying he had the right to tell viewers his honestly held opinions and declaring freedom of speech is a hill i m happy to die on ofcom s ruling said mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account the code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive and for broadcasters to include these in their programming the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience overall ofcom considered that there is a high public interest value in broadcasting open and frank discussions about race and racism as long as they comply with the code as set out above we also considered that the interview between the duke and duchess of sussex and oprah winfrey contained serious allegations and it was legitimate for this programme to discuss and scrutinise those claims the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience ofcom is clear that consistent with freedom of expression mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account piers morgan said his win was a resounding victory for free speech and asked if he would be getting his gmb job back fans have urged itv to do the right thing and get the star back on their show mr morgan s former co host susanna reid retweeted the ofcom result yesterday in tacit support of her friend ms reid left yesterday and itv royal editor chris ship right were also cited in yesterday s report as challenging mr morgan and giving context in the debate on the oprah interview how piers morgan was forced off gmb after his criticism of meghan and harry s oprah interview sunday march 7 2021 1am gmt harry and meghan s interview with oprah winfrey is broadcast rocking the royal family with allegations of racism towards archie claims they ignored the duchess of sussex s suicidal feelings and that they were cut off financially by prince charles monday march 8 6am hours after the broadcast in the us piers morgan hosted good morning britain reacting to the show he said this is a two hour trashathon of our royal family of the monarchy and everything our queen has worked so hard for and it s all been done while prince philip lies in hospital they trash everybody they basically make out our royal family are a bunch of white supremacists by this race bombshell they didn t name any which one it was they just throw it out there so it could be anybody well you better say it fast who did you go to what did they say to you i m sorry i don t believe a word she said meghan markle i wouldn t believe it if she read me weather report the fact that she s fired up this onslaught against our royal family i think is contemptible he said 9pm millions in the uk watch the show when it is shown on itv who paid 1million to broadcast it tuesday march 9 8am piers morgan storms off the good morning britain set live on air after the show s weatherman alex beresford accused him of unfairly trashing meghan markle they had been discussing the sussexes bombshell interview with oprah where the couple accused the royal family of racism morgan stood up and said ok i m done with this sorry you can trash me mate but not on my own show see you later as the gmb host marched off beresford persisted you know what that s diabolical behaviour that s pathetic after a hasty ad break morgan returned and said what we need to do alex is talk to each other in a civilised manner given we work on the same show on the same team you launching into a pretty personally derogatory monologue on one of your colleagues probably isn t one of the best ways to go about it 1pm tv boss carolyn mccall publicly refused to deny piers morgan could lose his job on good morning britain over his comments about meghan markle she said we are dealing with that as we speak dame carolyn also threw her support behind meghan as she completely believe what she said about her mental health 6pm piers morgan quits good morning britain with immediate effect having refused to apologise because of freedom of speech advertisement the episode on march 8 became the most complained about moment in the watchdog s history with more than 50 000 people complaining and later it emerged that meghan had made a formal complaint to itv about morgan morgan s comments were criticised by mental health charity mind and ofcom has said a significant number of the complaints claimed his remarks could potentially dissuade viewers experiencing suicidal thoughts of their own from seeking help for fear of not being believed or taken seriously viewers accused mr morgan of harmful rhetoric that made a mockery of suicide and of belittling the duchess of sussex s personal account of experiences of racism but on wednesday the regulator announced that the programme had not breached the broadcasting code in a 26 page decision summary ofcom said that the programme contained statements about suicide and mental health which could be harmful and highly offensive but that there was sufficient challenge to provide adequate protection and context to its viewers it continued we also considered that the comments about race in the programme could have been potentially highly offensive but that the comments were sufficiently contextualised therefore our decision is that the programme did not breach the ofcom broadcasting code mr morgan no longer works on gmb having quit the itv show on the evening of march 9 shortly after ofcom launched its investigation under its harm and offence rules his departure was announced by itv s director of television kevin lygo since then good morning britain s ratings have plunged as the show has failed to find a replacement host with a string of stand in appearances the ruling by ofcom puts ceo carolyn mccall formerly of the left wing guardian newspaper under pressure to explain why she did not stick by mr morgan a decision which has cost the station millions the report covers good morning britain s shows on the mornings of march 8 and 9 which were presented by mr morgan and co host susanna reid with the first episode coming hours after the oprah interview with the sussexes aired it focuses heavily on part of the opening discussion from march 8 in which the hosts play a clip of meghan talking about having suicidal thoughts in the cbs interview which also aired on itv later the duchess of sussex tells oprah i just didn t want to be alive anymore that these suicidal thoughts were very very clear and i needed to go somewhere to get help going back to the studio for reaction mr morgan responded to the clip saying i don t believe a word she says meghan markle i wouldn t believe it if she read me the weather report ms reid hit back at mr morgan saying well that s a pretty unsympathetic reaction to someone who has expressed those thoughts adding that the comments could not be brushed over ofcom said mr morgan appeared to disbelieve what meghan had said on having suicidal thoughts adding that they had concerns audience members may have been discouraged from seeking help about their mental health however in their ruling the regulator said mr morgan s opinion was clearly challenged in interventions by ms reid and itv s royal editor chris ship itv faces backlash after ofcom cleared piers morgan for his criticism of meghan markle s oprah interview as calls grow for presenter to return to gmb woke bosses at itv were criticised last night after ofcom ruled piers morgan did not breach its broadcasting code with his criticism of meghan markle the regulator cleared mr morgan over his comments about the duchess of sussex which sparked more than 50 000 complaints following her oprah winfrey interview and itv were accused of ruining their own hit breakfast show six months after the row in march which saw him quit the programme after six years others said it was very disappointing that meghan made itv roll over with one phone call after she made a formal complaint about the broadcast viewers called on itv to bring back piers urging them to see sense and do the right thing while mailonline columnist dan wootton led criticism of the channel he said yesterday piers morgan rightly cleared by ofcom freedom of speech wins the day and woke itv ruined their own hit breakfast show in the process wouldn t want to be harry waking up next to meghan in montecito in the morning when she picks up her phone former sun editor kelvin mackenzie said great news for piers morgan as ofcom clear him over his meghan truths on gmb he told it like it is bloody nose for ceo carolyn mccall who forced him out well said ofcom for backing free speech presenter india willoughby added at the end of the day piers morgan was right the fact meghan markup made itv roll over with one phone call very disappointing toby young of the free speech union told talkradio yesterday the idea that anyone who criticises meghan markle must be racist and that any criticism of her is a form of racism is just ridiculous ofcom said it approached itv for a comment on their preliminary view that the show was not in breach of the code but the corporation declined to comment advertisement in concluding remarks ofcom added we were particularly concerned about mr morgan s approach to such an important and serious issue and his apparent disregard for the seriousness of anyone expressing suicidal thoughts had it not been for the extensive challenge offered throughout the programme by ms reid and mr ship we would have been seriously concerned ofcom said yesterday that piers morgan s comments on the duchess of sussex s interview with oprah winfrey were potentially harmful and offensive but ruled good morning britain was not in breach the broadcasting code an ofcom spokesman said this was a finely balanced decision mr morgan s comments were potentially harmful and offensive to viewers and we recognise the strong public reaction to them but we also took full account of freedom of expression under our rules broadcasters can include controversial opinions as part of legitimate debate in the public interest and the strong challenge to mr morgan from other contributors provided important context for viewers nonetheless we ve reminded itv to take greater care around content discussing mental health and suicide in future itv might consider the use of timely warnings or signposting of support services to ensure viewers are properly protected ofcom also received 802 messages that expressed support for mr morgan and objected to his removal from good morning britain ofcom added that they approached itv for a comment on their preliminary view that the programme was not in breach of the code but the corporation declined to comment mr morgan however gave a personal response to the preliminary decision saying that views that had the potential to be offensive also had the potential not to be and it would not be right for ofcom to shut down alternative points of view he added it was perfectly reasonable for a journalist to ask a question regarding discussions in bi racial families about the skin colour of an unborn child in an appropriate context a reference to harry and meghan s claim that one royal asked how dark their child s skin would be within days of mr morgan quitting the show nearly 200 000 people had signed petitions demanding he be reinstated to his presenter role mr morgan responded to the soaring petitions on twitter writing that although the support came as a pleasant surprise he would not be returning to gmb it later emerged that ms markle had herself made a formal complaint to ofcom about the tv host after he dismissed her account of suffering suicidal thoughts and experiencing racism at the hands of the royal family the interview in which she made the claims to interviewer oprah winfrey received 4 398 complaints paul farmer chief executive of the mental health charity mind which had previously criticised mr morgan s comments said yesterday today s ruling by ofcom found that although good morning britain was not in breach of its broadcasting rules piers morgan s comments during the programme were potentially harmful and offensive to viewers ofcom s ruling also stated the need for broadcasters to take particular care over how mental health as a subject is presented to audiences so as not to convey a message that sharing experiences of poor mental health could be met with disbelief derision or a lack of sympathy since mr morgan s departure good morning britain s ratings have plunged as the show has failed to find a successful replacement host with a string of stand in appearances piers morgan ofcom s vindication of me is a resounding victory for freedom of speech and a resounding defeat for princess pinocchios who think we should all be compelled to believe every fork tongued word they say now do i get my gmb job back everyone is in favour of free speech said winston churchill but some people s idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone else says anything back that is an outrage he could have been talking about prince harry and his wife meghan markle two people who think they have both the right to drop endless incendiary unsubstantiated bombshells about their family and the right to censor and silence anyone who dares to disbelieve or challenge them back in march the duke and duchess of sussex spent two hours spray gunning the royals to oprah winfrey in an explosive interview on prime time us television they claimed a member of the royal family had been racist about their son archie and that their little boy had been banned from being a prince because of his skin colour back in march the duke and duchess of sussex spent two hours spray gunning the royals to oprah winfrey in an explosive interview on prime time us television writes piers morgan hours later on gmb piers said he didn t believe a word meghan markle said triggering furious protest from her fans of the couple yesterday ofcom announced that they had rejected all the complaints against piers meghan also claimed that she told several senior palace officials she was feeling suicidal but they told her she couldn t have any treatment because it would be bad for the royal brand oh and she stated as fact that she and harry secretly got married three days before their official wedding in a private ceremony conducted by the archbishop of canterbury on itv s good morning britain a few hours later i said i didn t believe a word meghan markle said this triggered a furious protest from fans of the couple who accused me of being a racist callous misogynist who was belittling meghan s lived experience of mental health and racism but it was simpler than that i just didn t believe her not least because it was immediately established that some of her more outlandish claims like the secret wedding and archie s princely ban were provable nonsense as the furore grew a record number of 57 000 people including meghan markle herself complained about me to the uk tv government regulator ofcom itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall responded by saying that she believed meghan s mental health claims and i was then told by my employers to either apologise for what i had said or leave the show with immediate effect i decided to leave as i explained in an article for the mail on sunday several weeks later i wasn t going to apologise for disbelieving meghan markle because the truth is that i don t believe meghan markle and in a free democratic society i should be allowed not to believe someone and to say that i don t believe them that surely is the very essence of freedom of speech if i said i now believed meghan i would be lying to the audience the very thing i ve accused her of doing yesterday in a stunning verdict ofcom announced that they agreed with this argument and rejected every single complaint against me their report is lengthy and detailed but in the end it came down to an unequivocal and emphatic endorsement of my right to an opinion ofcom is clear that consistent with freedom of expression mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account they declared adding that their broadcasting code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive and for broadcasters to include these in their programming it concluded the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience chilling wow ironically i would imagine that word will prompt a very chilly reaction from the self satisfied sussexes as they slurp kale smoothies in their california mansion over breakfast this morning make no mistake this is a watershed moment in the battle for free speech if ofcom had found against me that would have signalled the end of every uk tv journalist s right to express any honestly held opinion on air lest it upset the likes of meghan markle the whole point of journalism is surely to question and challenge statements from public figures particularly when no actual evidence is produced to support them five months on from my sudden departure from gmb at least 17 of meghan and harry s claims in the oprah interview have now been shown to be false or disingenuous the whole point of journalism is surely to question and challenge statements from public figures particularly when no actual evidence is produced to support them writes piers the poor old archbishop of canterbury was even forced to publicly deny he d conducted a secret marriage ceremony because that would have been a criminal offence and he might have been sent to prison for it more pertinently none of the couple s most sensational and damaging statements about racism and mental health have yet been supported by a shred of evidence amid furious denials from the royal family so my observation that i didn t believe meghan markle is looking stronger by the day and for the record i still don t believe her but that s not really the point this is not about me or meghan markle it s about free speech and the right to have an opinion we now live in a woke ravaged era where it s become a punishable offence to say what you really think about almost anything for fear that someone somewhere will be offended this insidious cancel culture as it s been termed represents the most serious threat to democracy in my lifetime people all over the world are being shamed vilified and even fired from their jobs for expressing an opinion that the woke brigade don t like every day social media platforms like twitter and facebook explode with self righteous judgements handed down by the court of woke public opinion and the consequence is that debate is being destroyed at the altar of political correctness in a way that would have churchill turning in his grave this was a man who fought off the freedom muzzling nazis for god s sake yet now people calling themselves liberal are behaving like the worst kind of fascists that s why this ofcom ruling matters so much it was preposterous that i had to leave a job i loved because i didn t believe a demonstrable liar but it happened because the corporate world has been cowed into surrendering to the woke mob whenever it bays for blood i was reliably informed recently that meghan markle wrote directly to my itv boss dame carolyn mccall the night before i was forced out demanding my head on a plate apparently she stressed that she was writing to dame carolyn personally because they were both women and mothers a nauseating playing of the gender and maternity card if ever there was one what has the world come to when a whiny fork tongued actress can dictate who presents a morning television news programme so yes i m obviously delighted that ofcom has supported my right to disbelieve the sussexes lurid claims against the royal family many of which have failed to stand up to even a scintilla of basic scrutiny of the kind that a woefully enabling oprah should have conducted this is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for princess pinocchios as ofcom determined to have restricted my right to disbelieve her and harry would have been chilling and when meghan and harry whose unofficially authorised biography is titled finding freedom lick their failed censorship wounds yesterday i suggest they heed the words of george orwell if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear just one question remains does this mean i get my job back ofcom s ruling in full prince harry lectures world on sharing vaccines from his montecito mansion telling gq awards news and social media misinformation creates vaccine hesitancy hours after losing ofcom bid to censure piers morgan who was in the audience byjacob thorburn for mailonline prince harry has blamed those who peddle in lies and fear in the news and social media for vaccine hesitancy during a surprise virtual appearance at the gq awards the duke of sussex 36 delivered a chiding speech urging governments to do more to vaccinate poorer countries warning until every community can access the vaccine and until every community is connected to trustworthy information about the vaccine then we are all at risk speaking from his montecito mansion more than 5 00 miles away the beleaguered prince lectured his star studded london audience on media misinformation and the importance of sharing vaccines harry later presented the heroes of the year award to professor dame sarah gilbert professor catherine green and the team behind the oxford astrazeneca vaccine at wednesday evening s gq awards in london in attendance was piers morgan who yesterday won a resounding victory for free speech after regulator ofcom ruled he had not broken the broadcasting code for his comments on the duchess of sussex following her bombshell oprah interview mr morgan s itv colleagues and a string of respected broadcasters today hailed ofcom s ruling confirming his right to free speech after the watchdog dismissed 57 000 complaints about his criticism of meghan markle senior british journalists have declared that the judgment meant a pillar of our freedom in the uk had been reinforced the duke of sussex speaking at a surprise virtual appearance at the gq awards at the tate modern in london delivered a lecturing speech urging governments to do more to vaccinate poorer countries prince harry blamed those who peddle lies and fear in the news and on social media for vaccine hesitancy his comments come hours after piers morgan who was in the audience at the gq awards in london won a resounding victory for free speech prince harry said as people sit in the room with you tonight more than a third of the global population has received at least one dose of the vaccine that s more than five billion shots given around the world so far it sounds like a major accomplishment and in many ways it is but there is a huge disparity between who can and cannot access the vaccine less than 2 of people in the developing world have received a single dose at this point and many of the healthcare workers are still not vaccinated we cannot move forward together unless we address this imbalance as one at the same time families around the world are being overwhelmed by masses of misinformation across news media and social media where those who peddle in lies and fear are creating vaccine hesitancy which in turn leads to divided communities and eroding trust this is a system we need to break if we are to overcome covid 19 and the risk of new variants harry hailed the team behind the oxford astrazeneca vaccine who received the heroes of the year award as heroes of the highest order who have done their part they are our nation s pride and we are deeply indebted to their service for the rest of us including global governments pharmaceutical leaders and heads of business we have to keep doing our part he said that must include sharing vaccine science and supporting and empowering developing countries with more flexibility where you are born should not affect your ability to survive when the drugs and know how exist to keep you alive and well mr morgan s itv colleagues and a string of respected broadcasters today hailed ofcom s ruling confirming his right to free speech after the watchdog dismissed 57 000 complaints about his criticism of meghan markle s oprah interview above piers morgan and good morning britain have been cleared of breaching broadcasting standards over a heated debate about harry and meghan s oprah interview where he said that he didn t believe a word she says on march 8 pictured within 48 hours of the oprah interview on march 7 this year mr morgan was forced to quit gmb after he refused to apologise for his honestly held opinions costing itv around 790 000 viewers and millions more in advertising revenue with the ratings gap between gmb and rival bbc breakfast still growing on the day piers quit gmb was in the lead other complainants to ofcom accused piers of failing to be duly impartial misrepresenting facts and mocking meghan s american accent complaints that his views on gmb on march 8 and march 9 were unsuitable for children were also thrown out the uk s broadcasting watchdog this morning called attempts to silence the mailonline columnist a chilling restriction on freedom of expression after the duchess of sussex was among a wave of people who complained that his questioning of her account of royal racism and suicidal thoughts was harmful and offensive to viewers ofcom today found no rules were breached and backed mr morgan s right to rigorously challenge the duchess s account of suffering suicidal thoughts and claims she experienced racism at the hands of the royal family the decision has led to a flurry of calls demanding he is given his job back with fans using the hashtag bringbackpiers claiming the show is dying a slow death without him in complete vindication for the journalist 56 ofcom ruled mr morgan was entitled to say he disbelieved the duke and duchess of sussex s allegations and to hold and express strong views that rigorously challenged their account and in a damning indictment of his former bosses and the 50 000 plus people who complained the watchdog found the restriction of such views would in our view be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience speaking to the sun mr morgan slammed the duchess of sussex as the queen of woke and described her as a whiny forked tounge actress mr morgan said the woke brigade think they can vilify shame silence and get fired anyone who has an opinion they don t like meghan markle is the queen of this culture who personally sought to have me lose my job and succeeded why are she and prince harry entitled to have their opinion but i m not entitled to mine mr morgan immediately hit back at itv s statement for ignoring the central thrust of ofcom s conclusion amid calls for him to be reinstated on their flagship gmb programme the ruling by ofcom puts ceo carolyn mccall formerly of the left wing guardian newspaper under pressure to explain why she did not stick by mr morgan a decision which has cost the station millions meghan markle reportedly wrote directly to itv boss dame carolyn mccall the night before mr morgan was forced out demanding his head on a plate he wrote in his mailonline column

a number of pseudo left tendencies are promoting a deal hatched between chile s unions the parliamentary left and the multinational retail chain owned by the billionaire solari family as an historic and unprecedented victory it is nothing of the sort some 189 supermarket workers in the northern mining region of atacama went on strike on june 7 after negotiations with supermarket chain tottus broke down earlier in march by the middle of august out of sheer desperation several workers initiated a hunger strike after their demands for basic minimal improvements safety conditions and minor salary increases were sidelined and ignored for months these workers are among the most exploited with a salary of between 260 000 us 336 and 280 000 us 362 pesos per month the incomes of the predominantly female staff do not even meet the poverty level minimum wage their basic demands included a four percent salary increase and a top up in meal and transportation allowances that would raise the current 3 500 pesos us 4 51 to 9 000 pesos us 11 61 in addition to a one off payment of 500 000 pesos us 645 for each worker to end the conflict the industrial action which lasted 83 days was shut down when the socialist party governor of atacama the ex christian democrat and now social green regionalist federation frvs deputy for atacama jaime mulet and the stalinist frente amplio presidential front man gabriel boríc intervened all were full of self congratulation the governor of atacama miguel vargas correa claimed a good agreement has been reached we are very happy very proud to have contributed a grain of sand in this process we have helped to reach a good agreement that satisfies the interests of the workers and also reflects the company s opinion he especially praised the head of the union priscilla fernández whose effort has been commendable as had the leaders of this organization who have carried the name of the workers in the atacama region the union president in turn patted the governor on the back i am proud of the governor a person like him deserves where he is that he got involved out of the blue and tried to solve and mediate and get to the heart of the company he did not want his people suffering in the region it is admirable very admirable not just anyone does that the stalinist communist party chimed that the agreement undoubtedly represented a precedent in the history of the union struggle in chile while the most sycophantic defenders of the union bureaucracy s maneuvering was a pseudo left group known as the socialist workers movement mst the mst is one of three organizations in chile the other two being the revolutionary workers party ptr and the international workers movement mit that falsely claim to be trotskyist but in reality draw their inspiration from the unprincipled and national opportunist politics of morenoism a latin american variant of pabloism this political tendency has been characterized by its unabashed glorification of bourgeois and petty bourgeois nationalism guerrillaism and the national reformist bureaucracies e g the union apparatus as the path towards socialism morenoism has principally sought to straitjacket the working class to these tried and tested institutions of latin american capitalism under the tweet great triumph of the tottus cipiapó sic vallenar union strike the mst went into ecstasy because the supermarket chain owners entered into an agreement accepted the meager demands and did not lay off any workers this tremendous victory is the product of the heroic struggle of the union and its president priscilla it trumpeted we salute this triumph with the deepest embrace of struggle great union tottus copiapó vallenar up with those who fight without mobilization there is no change this was not a victory for the working class quite the contrary the real precedent established in the tottus dispute was the union s further integration into the state amid the resurgence of the class struggle the multi national retail chain falabella of which tottus is a subsidiary employs 96 000 workers in chile colombia peru uruguay brazil and mexico down from 104 000 in 2019 and 113 000 in 2017 this past june the chain closed its whole operation in argentina destroying at least 800 jobs in the federal capital and in the provinces of buenos aires córdoba mendoza rosario and san juan although no total figure has been released nonetheless the retail giant did not close the doors of its hundreds of other department stores home improvement depots supermarket chains and banking offices during the coronavirus pandemic despite several of its super exploited workers contracting and dying of covid 19 in its 2021 first quarter consolidated financial results falabella reported a

value of approximately us 19 5b is majority controlled by five families with a combined net worth of more than us 10 billion these stark figures don t just point to the unbridgeable social chasm between bourgeois and proletarians they also present falabella workers with all the objective reasons to unify across the continent in a common struggle to demand a safe working environment proper protective equipment substantial increases in wages and better conditions and an end to job losses and store closures they also need to turn to sections of workers in chile and internationally who in the last months have been involved in industrial action to protect lives and improve conditions this includes miners teachers health workers public servants auto and auto parts workers and other workers facing similar experiences yet the union bureaucracy did everything in its power to keep the dispute isolated from the rest of the working class while appealing to members of parliament constituents from the constitutional convention the labor directorate and other state authorities to come to the rescue and help shut down the strike the state intervention was ramped up after three workers began a hunger strike out of sheer desperation fernández the president of the union solicited the support of a gamut of so called left officials who used the platform for purely electoral motivations the union board first met with constituents of the chile digno pact who in a communiqué claimed to be in solidarity with the strikers and to emphatically support their demands but committed themselves to nothing the union leadership also met with broad front frente amplio congressman and former student leader gorgio jackson from democratic revolution rd and closely aligned to pseudo left candidate gabriel boric and greens regionalist deputy jaime mulet who also happens to campaign for boric workers today are victims of a society and of a legal model with labor relations that is absolutely unfair and concentrates wealth this must be changed exhorted mulet before plugging boric s campaign we are doing everything we can within our reach with the commitment to become government with boric to make fundamental changes that today are absolutely necessary finally on the day before the settlement the union bureaucrats met with boric himself after he made the perfunctory statement about workers asking for elementary dignity he gave a campaign spiel promising to head a government of the workers our future government is going to be with the demand of the workers and the labor legislation has to be in defense precisely of those who generate the wealth in chile that is our commitment today the fraud that the tottus agreement was an unprecedented victory as promoted by the morenoites and the stalinists should be treated with contempt without invalidating the courageous stand of the 189 tottus retail workers it must be stated frankly that the union apparatus transformed the strike into an election campaign stunt nor is that their worst crime for the last 22 months the corporatist unions demonstrated their subservience and loyalty to management and the government by helping to keep non essential retail open despite the global pandemic and they did nothing to oppose the furloughing or laying off of thousands of workers this has been the well trodden path of the parliamentary left the stalinist communist party frente amplio and the corporatist trade unions ever since the return to civilian rule they have maintained tripartite arrangements working simultaneously with business and with past center left coalition governments just as they have today assisted the incumbent right wing presidency of sebastian piñera in opposition to the unprincipled politics of the morenoites the international committee of the fourth international calls on workers to break with the corporatist trade union apparatus stalinism the frente amplio and the rest of the pseudo left organizations that seek to tie them to the bourgeois state in their place it calls on workers to develop independent democratic and militant rank and file organizations of workers in factories schools and workplaces on an international scale as new organs of struggle it is to this end that the international committee of the fourth international icfi which publishes the world socialist web site has initiated the building of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees

improve over the next year down from 50 in july and 67 in march see graph below retail sales fell 1 1 in july compared to june ex autos one of the most volatile sectors sales were down 0 4 retail sales data reflects sales for 13 major types of retailers and is a good measure of inflationary pressures in the economy after the july federal reserve meeting fed chair powell publicly expressed concern about the impact of the delta variant on the economic recovery the fed s primary tasks are controlling inflation the pace is gradually easing and promoting a stable labor market through monetary policy despite the high rate of delta variant infections weekly jobless claims fell to a new pandemic low for the week ending august 13th declining four weeks in a row and are down more than 50 since january however let us not forget there are still 10 2 million unfilled jobs in the u s the fed has signaled over the last few months that they are likely to begin tapering securities purchases monetary stimulus by the end of this year will the delta variant continue to spread at a level that will derail those plans as a trader for many years i was trained to see the downside of things however there is a new upside in the delta variant picture all covid 19 vaccinations have been available through federal emergency status the vaccines were not fda approved today the pfizer vaccine received full fda approval moderna and j j will follow suit within a short period employers who have been hesitant to require vaccines may now feel that they are on higher moral ground and mandate vaccinations for their employees hopefully individuals waiting for official fda approval to get vaccinated will take the plunge and get the shot not everyone will get vaccinated but let s hope this approval and the ones to follow raises the number of new vaccinations significantly enough to get the virus under control kpi s of interest united states ism purchasing managers index pmi united

tradingeconomics com cmegroup com deborah brown c e o ddb advisory services impact on supply chains the united states and other advanced economies have been vigilant in getting 50 and 40 respectively of their populations vaccinated this vaccination diligence has paid off in the form of robust economic recovery the recovery was also made possible through gradually improving supply chains worldwide recent research is validating my observations with my clients across several industrial sectors i am hearing that the rate of price increases is declining material availability has improved fewer employees are leaving and they can fill more vacant positions the concern is that most of our supply chains are reliant on emerging market economies these economies lag behind the us and other advanced economies in vaccination penetration with an average of 20 of their populations vaccinated because of the low vaccination rates the covid 19 delta variant is wreaking economic havoc requiring more lockdowns and social distancing these measures have a direct effect by closing factories logistic networks and ports our supply chains will likely suffer if emerging economies are unable to reverse their vaccination deficiencies i m not suggesting we will fall off a cliff however recovery to supply chains will be three steps forward with one or two steps backward for the next fifteen to eighteen months art koch akmc llc

one sure sign that capitalism is rapidly heading for an economic crash of historic proportions is the regularity in which increasingly desperate articles are appearing in the financial pages of the bourgeois press last week the daily telegraph carried an article by allister heath headlined four mega trends that condemn the west to irreversible decline which warned that support for capitalism is dwindling amongst workers and especially youth this week the telegraph s chief economic writer jeremy warner joined in with a warning don t discount a stock market crash warner points to the complete political crisis engulfing us president joe biden following the complete humiliation of american imperialism in afghanistan while noting that political humiliation is not enough in itself to derail the us economic or stock market locomotive despite all the political and health crises in the us where coronavirus is raging virtually unchecked and 8 million workers are unemployed the stock market has soared to unprecedented highs throughout the bankers and speculators are seemingly oblivious of the crisis unfolding as they drive up share prices into the stratosphere but as warner says what all crashes have in common however is an overheating economy together with a prolonged period of easy credit that has driven asset prices to unsustainable levels in a nutshell all the money printing with which the central banks in the us uk and europe have flooded the capitalist world has been used by the bankers and speculators to drive up the share prices of companies and industries that in reality make little or no profit why are the stock market investors so cavalier about the danger of it all collapsing in a crash simply because as far as they are concerned it is heads they win tails they win too in other words if the economy collapses they are assured that the central banks will pile in and bail them out with even more free money just as they did after the banks collapsed after the 2008 world banking crash in fact the one thing that really scares the billionaire speculators is that this seemingly never ending supply of worthless paper money might be cut off every time the us federal reserve bank or the bank of england have hinted at ending the money printing or pushing up interest rates the stock markets have crashed as investors flee for their lives only to return when assured that the cheap money they can borrow to increase their fortunes will carry on this has created a massive crisis for the central banks carry on printing worthless trillions of currencies driving up huge national debts and inevitably sparking a massive inflationary surge or cut back the supply and see stock markets crash overnight either option leads to an economic crash unprecedented in the history of capitalism it is this reality that is causing such an outpouring of articles warning that capitalism has reached the end of the road the only way out for capitalism was outlined in a further article in the telegraph last weekend by matthew lynn headed recovery depends on killing off more zombie companies lynn advocates creative destruction in other words let the crisis rip through uk and the weak companies that exist entirely on debt go to the wall along with their workers in fact it is officially estimated that one in five companies in the uk have existed as zombies kept going by government covid support and the furlough schemes when furlough ends at the end of the month with these loans having to be repaid thousands of companies will go bust overnight and millions of workers will be thrown on the scrapheap being forced to live off starvation levels of benefit this means that directly ahead as the capitalist crisis intensifies the class struggle will explode as workers are faced with fighting mass sackings massive wage cuts and closures of hundreds of plants this will pose the immediate issue of organising a general strike to bring down the tories and go forward to a workers government and socialism the only way forward for workers across the world is to put this bankrupt capitalist system out of its misery with the victory of the socialist revolution
