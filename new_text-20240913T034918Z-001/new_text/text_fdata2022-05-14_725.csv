year ago the good friday week gave us some startling news from the bureau of labor statistics which reported that inflation hit a 40 year high of 8 5 percent as fuel and food prices skyrocket the u n food and agriculture organization s food price index hit record levels for three months in a row according to chicago based stonex dairy group up 34 percent from a year ago the february jump alone was up by 12 6 percent largest single month rise ever says stonex these are prices as high as seen since the last major food crisis in 2008 and 2011 and while this is not exactly fresh news it is an unfolding story food price inﬂation on this scale can lead to famine for less developed countries political instability mass migrations and ultimately commodity market volatility speaking in the april 18 dairy radio now program broker dave kurzawski said food and fuel is the big difference between today and 1981 core inflation which is everything but food and fuel was only up three tenths of 1 percent he said which is the slowest increase since last september kurzawski said overall core inflation on an annualized basis is up about 6 5 percent which is well above the fed s desire of 2 5 percent so we re missing the mark it seems reasonable to see government cut spending they should have done that a while ago and it has to raise interest rates and do it with vigor inflation is here to stay he believes we will see demand issues but offered some hope stating that the crude oil price has pretty much surrendered most if not all of its gains since the start of the russian ukraine war and there are other markets doing something similar he admits inflation is not going away overnight but said it s interesting to note that while there was a burst of price increases across many of these markets courtesy russia ukraine those markets are starting to calm down on those fears stonex adds developed nations may not face the brunt of the food insecurity that potentially lay ahead but higher food prices are on the way what we don t know is the myriad of implications this will have on dairy demand while some products retail processed cheese for example might fare better than others we believe more and more that the seemingly one sided supply side story for the past six months will have stiff competition from growing demand side implications going forward on a brighter note the april 8 dairy and food market analyst reports foodservice sales are hovering near pre pandemic levels the latest data from opentable shows seated diners down just 8 percent from 2019 this is a

bette midler sparked outrage on friday by responding to the nationwide shortage of baby formula with the message try breastfeeeding it s free and available on demand the tweet sent by midler 76 was immediately met with a wall of criticism from figures as diverse as stephen miller donald trump s hardline speechwriter and john oliver s executive producer in response to midler s tweet many pointed out that a significant percentage of women are unable to breastfeed despite their best attempts one lactation consultant and author diana cassar uhl put the figure at 12 15 percent of all mothers others noted that some babies have specific dietary conditions and do not respond well to breastmilk others still pointed out that tens of thousands of babies are adopted and others born via surrogates and gay men who comprise a huge faction of midler s fan base were also angered by midler s remark highlighting that a gay male couple wouldn t be able to breastfeed their baby or toddler tim carvell the executive producer of last week tonight with john oliver tweeted imagine having a large gay fanbase many of whom are raising kids in two dad households and thinking this is a good suggestion miller the staunchly loyal trump aide tweeted in response to midler what a profoundly offensive ignorant statement there are countless reasons why breastfeeding is not an option for many mothers too many to get into here and if you ve been using formula you can t just flip a switch not to mention millions of babies with milk food allergies bette midler 76 is seen in december at the kennedy center honors on friday she sparked anger by saying the baby formula shortage could be averted if women breastfed their babies as many pointed out it was not a simple solution ilyse hogue president of the progressive social change campaign purpose tweeted bette respectfully this is a very bad take i had twins i didn t produce enough milk for both without formula i would have had to have chosen which one got to eat to say nothing of kids that get separated from the birth mothers very young one replied i love you bette but this is not okay i fought to breastfeed my son he kept losing weight despite my best efforts including lactation experts it was emotional and heartbroken i felt like a failure and at 3 months switched to formula because of the stress it put on me and my son another joked no biggie bette says just get a wet nurse never mind they charge 1000 per week and that s something working families cannot afford especially in a time where everything costs more nationwide supplies of baby formula are at 43 percent with some states such as tennessee delaware and texas reporting that their out of stock level is running as high as 54 percent the problem was spurred by a february shutdown of one of america s largest baby formula producers in michigan after the facility was found to be contaminated and two babies died after consuming the products although the factory insists the bacteria in their factory did not contribute to the infants death the shutdown exacerbated shortages and supply chain issues already caused by the pandemic and it highlighted the strong monopoly of baby formula with 98 percent produced within the united states and three companies controlling over 90 percent of the supply many products from europe cannot be imported despite being produced to a higher standard in many ingredients because they do not have the fda required labelling on the packaging shelves are pictured empty of baby formula in new york city on friday midler however doubled down people are piling on because of former tweet she said no shame if you can t breastfeed but if you can are somehow convinced that your own milk isn t as good as a scientifically researched product that s something else again the monopoly news is news to me tho no lie wetnurses she also said she had confidence in president joe biden to find a solution elise stefanik the republican house conference chair tweeted that biden has no plan in response midler then retweeted a comment from podcast host brian tyler cohen aside from the fact that you want to starve babies and accuse anyone who disagrees with you of being a pedophile joe biden actually does have a plan said cohen it s right here you are lying he attached a link to the white house s factsheet from thursday detailing the steps they were taking to get the problem under control biden on friday lashed out at critics as he defended his administration s actions to relieve the infant formula shortage that has panicked parents worried about feeding their babies if we d been better mind readers i guess we could have biden said when asked if his administration should have acted sooner biden was speaking at an event on community policing and said he would only speak on that topic before somewhat grumpily conceding to talk about formula shortages i ll answer the baby from the question because all of a sudden it s on the front page of every newspaper he said the president predicted it would only be a matter of weeks or less for there to be more formula on the shelves we re going to be in a matter of weeks or less getting significantly where more formula is on shelves he said biden said his administration was working hard on the matter and had nothing more urgent on its plate this is a process we working very very hard there s nothing more urgent we re working on that right now and i think we re really making some significant progress he said his comments came after the food and drug administration said the baby formula shortage should improve dramatically in weeks commissioner dr robert califf said the agency will announce plans next week detailing how manufacturers and suppliers abroad will be able to import their products into the united states as well as new options for u s companies the fda is aiming for a streamlined process that will get more products on u s shelves while meeting safety quality and labeling standards he said the 4 billion u s baby formula market is dominated by domestic producers with imports limited and subject to high tariffs we believe these and other ongoing efforts will help dramatically improve the supply in the u s in a matter of weeks califf wrote on twitter our data indicates that in stock rates in retail stores are stabilizing but we continue to work around the clock to further increase availability president joe biden lashed out at critics as he defended his administration s actions to relieve the infant formula shortage meanwhile the house oversight committee is launching an investigation into the baby formula shortage and demanding records and information from four of the largest manufacturers the national formula shortage poses a threat to the health and economic security of infants and families in communities across the country particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health inequities including food insecurity democratic chairwoman carolyn maloney of new york wrote in letters to abbott nutrition mead johnson nutrition nestle usa and perrigo first obtained by abc news the oversight committee is the investigative arm of congress and broad authority to probe a variety of issues the panel is looking into the price gouging around infant formula and the steps the companies are taking to address the shortages also maloney specifically asked chris calamari chairman of abbott nutrition for information about the recall of its formula after several babies were hospitalized and two died from a rare bacterial infection in some of its product maloney wants answers to her questions along with a briefing from the companies by may 26 baby formula boss warns crisis will last all year as biden claims it will be eased in weeks and only mind reader could see it coming despite shortages beginning last july the head of one of the four companies that control 90 percent of the u s market for baby formula has warned that the shortages nationwide could last until the end of the year as president joe biden s critics mocked his claim that only a mind reader could have predicted the current crisis on friday ceo of formula giant perrigo murray kessler told reuters he expects shortages and heightened demand to last for the balance of the year kessler said their factories in ohio and vermont are running at 115 percent capacity to compensate for chicago based abbott s shutdown but added that supplies would remain erratic for the remainder of 2022 we have stepped up and are killing ourselves to do everything we can kessler said at the request of the fda perrigo is focusing on four items the store brand versions of similac pro sensitive and pro advance and enfamil gentle ease and infant kessler said the company added that it is making other formulas as well it also has a smaller business making some national formula brands including bobbie murray kessler head of formula giant perrigo has warned shortages of baby food could last throughout 2022 the closure of abbott s infant formula plant in sturgis michigan exacerbated national pandemic related shortages leading to empty shelves in big box stores and supermarkets and panicked parents abbott s brands include similac formulas perrigo is working with retailers including walmart and target corp so they get something each week kessler said retailers allocations are based on an average of what the retailers received prior to this crisis he said meanwhile president biden has sparked fury after claiming that the issue could be sorted within weeks the same as what the fda has previously said without offering further unique detail on how he plans to tackle the issue he was also accused of being glib after telling reporters friday that he d have needed psychic powers to predict the crisis despite alarm bells sounding as far back as summer 2021 the nationwide out of stock level has been consistently above 10 percent since august and in january this year the wall street journal warned of an impending problem brian deese director of the national economic council said on friday morning that the white house had been urging states to take action to combat the issue in february after the shortage was exacerbated by a february 17 recall of some products produced by abbott laboratories and a shutdown of one of their plants joe biden on friday claimed that no one could have predicted the current shortage of baby formula despite his own national economic council chief saying on friday morning that they asked states to do more in february we actually gave states the guidance on using flexibility the day after this recall happened in february he told cnn s kaitlin collins yet biden on friday insisted no one could have predicted the crisis which has seen desperate parents go from store to store trying to find the urgently needed formula the president was hosting an event about community policing when he was asked about the baby formula situation he said he would only answer questions on policing before somewhat reluctantly

biden defends administration s response on baby formula shortage cnn president joe biden on friday defended the white house s response to a months long shortage of infant formula in the united states and dismissed the idea that his administration should have acted sooner saying they moved as quickly as a problem became apparent to us following remarks in the white house rose garden biden pushed back when asked if the administration should have reacted faster to shortages of baby formula nationwide telling cnn s jeremy diamond if we d been better mind readers i guess we could have the president later said resolving the issue requires that the federal government move with caution as well as speed adding that it was important to make sure what we re getting is in fact first rate product the biden administration announced additional efforts to address the shortage this week but american stores have had a hard time keeping baby formula in stock for months due to a recall inflation and supply chain problems manufacturers have said they are producing at full capacity but it s not enough to keep up with current demand us grocery store shelves had even less infant formula last week than they had the week before according to a new report from datasembly a real time data tracking agency that gauges how much product is available new administration actions the biden administration on friday announced several moves that are aimed at addressing the burden of the shortage after white house press secretary jen psaki on thursday struggled to answer what the administration s guidance is for a concerned parent who cannot find formula to feed their baby she announced friday that the us department of health and human services has launched a new website to assist parents searching for infant formula amid national supply shortages individuals can visit hhs gov formula which psaki said will provide resources and places that parents can go to obtain formula including contacts with companies food banks and health care providers psaki seemed to suggest that the website was created in recent days amid growing concerns we wanted to make information readily available and accessible to people but prior to that period of time we had not seen obviously what we ve seen over the last few days psaki added us food and drug administration commissioner dr robert califf also said that the fda is working around the clock to get more formula to shelves and will announce plans next week to streamline formula imports though the commissioner didn t indicate exactly when formula stock would return to normal he wrote that the new and ongoing steps will help dramatically improve the supply in the u s in a matter of weeks califf also said that the fda is continuing to work with existing manufacturers to increase production fda data he said on twitter indicates that in stock rates in retail stores are stabilizing but we continue to work around the clock to further increase availability the moves come after the white house on thursday unveiled a series of limited steps to address the shortage including importing more formula from overseas urging states to allow government nutritional assistance recipients more flexibility in the varieties of infant formula they can buy and calling on the federal trade commission and states attorneys general to crack down on price gouging by manufacturers administration officials have noted that production has increased since the massive february recall of formula produced by abbott nutrition exacerbated the current problem on friday a white house spokesperson said abbott committed to providing critical flexibility to states through the end of august in response to a letter sent by agricultural secretary tom vilsack this means that families on special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or wic can purchase any available product in the months to come and states and retailers can plan ahead as they work to keep their stocks shelved and most importantly provide certainty for families the spokesperson said abbott said the company is directing supply from a production facility in ireland to serve wic families it also said that it was working with the us department of agricitsir formula similac is not available abbott is the exclusive supplier of baby formula to about half the infants enrolled in wic the rebates may not be helpful however in situations where all products are out of stock or if a baby can t easily switch to another product abbott said it was working to increase formula supplies across the board by stepping up production at other facilities additionally the company says it is offering more and more generous coupons so that consumers can purchase its products at a discounted price invoking the defense production act under consideration white house chief of staff ron klain told a member of congress this week that the white house is absolutely and strongly considering having president joe biden invoke the defense production act to address the urgent baby formula shortage problem plaguing the country virginia democratic rep abigail spanberger told cnn friday morning that she spoke with klain twice in the last two days to discuss the shortage saying that klain told her the white house views using the law as potentially a really important step the possibility of deploying the defense production act which allows the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production to address the formula issue was one of the many things they discussed spanberger said i think the white house absolutely understands the severity and the urgency of the issue spanberger said but until there s more food on the shelves i am not satisfied spanberger said that she and klain also discussed the fact that invoking the law may provide a longer term solution but would not be the quickest way to get baby formula back on shelves we talked through the fact that the dpa while potentially a really important thing for them to consider spanberger said may not be as fast as just loading up planes and ensuring that baby food from the netherlands or other european partners can get here quickly i think the white house absolutely understands the severity and the urgency of the issue spanberger added but until there s more food on the shelves i am not satisfied white house press secretary jen psaki said friday that using the dpa to address the domestic baby formula shortage remains under consideration so right now of course we re keeping that option under consideration but our focus primarily is on twofold one is increasing supply and the other is making it readily available psaki told reporters in the white house press briefing white house refuses to call the shortage a crisis or nail down a timeline though they ve expressed optimism about increased production levels biden officials have repeatedly declined in recent days to predict when store shelves will return to normal on friday kate bedingfield the white house communications director told cnn s kate bolduan that she could not indicate when the shortage will end i m not going to stand here and tell your audience that i can give you a hard timeline that i can t give you she told bolduan when pressed several times on when parents can expect a return to more formula on store shelves we are being candid about moving as quickly as possible and we are relentlessly focused on this bedingfield also refused to call the shortage a crisis well i don t think it s about a label i think it s about addressing directly the need that families all across the country have she said listen i m a mom i have two young kids i m not terribly far removed from the days of feeding my kids with formula i know and the president knows how stressful this is for families across the country shortages spark congressional hearings house speaker nancy pelosi on friday outlined the house s plans next week to deal with the shortage in a letter to fellow house members she wrote that the house will bring up on suspension a bill to grant emergency authority to the wic program to address supply chain disruptions and recalls the house appropriations committee she said will bring to the floor an emergency supplemental appropriation to immediately address the infant formula shortage at least three house committees have announced this week they are looking into the issue a spokesperson told cnn that the house committee on oversight and reform on friday morning sent letters to four separate companies that produce baby formula requesting information about the supply chain issues a house energy and commerce committee spokesperson announced a hearing on baby formula for may 25 and told cnn they plan to call representatives from the fda and abbott a major baby formula producer to testify and the appropriations committee will also hold two hearings related to the shortages including one next week with califf on the fda s 2023 budget request and oversight of infant formula the committee s chairwoman connecticut democratic rep rosa delauro told cnn she believes the fda dragged their feet in addressing problems with abbott nutrition but that she doesn t blame the biden administration for the shortage abbott nutrition has been a bad actor produced a contaminated product she said they had a whistleblower s report that went to the fda in october the whistleblower was not interviewed until december and then the recall happened in february senate health education labor and pensions committee chair patty murray pennsylvania democratic sen bob casey and 30 senate democrats sent a letter to the president of the infant nutrition council of america calling on infant formula manufacturers to make every effort possible to get parents and families the formula they need to feed their kids

straightforward the federal reserve did it the u s s central bank is raising interest rates in order to fight inflation and has in the process sent tremors all throughout the markets that s partly

percent since it topped out on jan 3 the nasdaq tech index has fallen about 25 percent for the year that s not quite on par with the great stock market crashes of yore the s p 500 declined by more than half in 2008 for instance while the nasdaq tumbled 78 percent in the dotcom bust of the early 2000s it s also important to keep in mind that the stock market dips all the time there have been several cases where the s p dropped 15 percent or more before mostly recovering or even finishing higher for the year advertisement still we re in the midst a serious fall investors traditionally say it s a bear market once stocks tumble 20 percent from their last peak the s p 500 is getting close to there and the nasdaq is well past it then there s crypto bitcoin s price has fallen by more than half since last fall from about 67 000 in november to 47 000 in march to around 30 000 as when this story was published the total value of all digital currencies has similarly plummeted the cryptoland rollercoaster hath crashed and this is all the fed s fault advertisement fault is a slightly loaded word but yes the federal reserve is the key factor here which i guess in my overextended movie metaphor would make chair jerome powell a teenager with supernatural powers burning down the party everybody pause to manifest that disturbing image in their heads ok onward advertisement advertisement the fed is aggressively raising interest rates to curb inflation which is running at 40 year highs this month it hiked by half a percentage point its biggest single increase in 22 years at the same time the central bank is allowing its giant stash of government bonds to shrink you might have heard this described as running down its balance sheet a move that should also push up long term interest rates and tighten credit all of this is quite bad for stocks and other assets that involve some risk like bitcoin if you look at corporate earnings reports and forecasts big companies are actually doing pretty well there have been some high profile disappointments such as netflix but overall more companies are exceeding their estimates than last year they re getting pummeled for things beyond their control ok but why exactly are higher interest rates bad for stocks advertisement advertisement advertisement well like i said some of it is just a product of the math that investors use to value companies care to elaborate of course when interest rates go up so do the returns on low risk assets like government bonds that makes higher risk assets like stocks less attractive in comparison so their prices tend to drop that s the simple version a sidenote sometimes you ll hear people say things like when rates rise people sell stocks and buy bonds but that s an oversimplification and not really what s happening now bonds have been selling off too now to get a little more in the weeds let s say you were a stock market analyst at a bank and your boss told you to go figure out how valuable google really is if you were feeling very proper and traditional you might break out what s called a discounted cash flow model which calculates how much a company s future profits are worth to investors today advertisement advertisement step one would be to guess how much money google might make in the future probably a lot in step two you d have to account for the fact that time really is worth money to investors profits that lay way out in the future are worth less to a company s shareholders than profits that are earned today because collecting them requires locking up capital and skipping other investment opportunities advertisement to account for that you d subtract out what s known as a discount rate which reflects how much your clients could make if they just parked their money somewhere safe like treasury bonds instead of gambling on the long term viability of targeted search engine ads and youtube spots you d then throw in a few more steps run the numbers and get a reasonable stock price advertisement the important thing to remember is that when interest rates go up so do the returns on safe assets like government debt as a result discount rates go up too and stocks start look like a worse deal in the eyes of equities analysts and investors yielding excel spreadsheets ergo their prices drop now obviously this is not how the market always works in the real world because the real world is insane retail investors trying to overcome their pandemic boredom by trading options on robinhood and scrounging for stock tips on reddit were not doing careful net present value calculations while piling into gamestop or posting diamond hands memes while amc seesawed for that matter the hedge funds and other pros aren t always breaking out a dcf model when they want to assess surveys suggest that more often they re using measures like price to earnings ratios to figure out what s a good deal or maybe they re a hedge funders trading on momentum or by algorithm or something there are lots of strategies out there advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement aside from all that predicting future profits can be a very subjective exercise especially if the company in question is a money losing tech firm like uber with a great narrative but murky path to profitability but professionals very frequently do some version of this math when picking stocks to make sure a company s share price makes at least a little bit of sense so while higher rates don t always cause stocks to drop there are a lot of factors that determine where the market ends up they do weigh on prices they re especially problematic for risky stocks where investors are betting on lots of future growth since their profits are further away and more affected by discount math advertisement are there any simpler reasons higher interest rates might be bad for stocks that you ve glossed over if borrowing money gets more expensive it might cut into companies profits down the line but that honestly doesn t seem to be the major issue right now so now that we ve taken this uh delightful trip through corporate finance how else is the fed messing up my portfolio sure one of the key reasons stock prices went nuts over the past few years is that there was just a ton of cash sloshing around or as investors like to say there was a lot of liquidity in the market just imagine a big winding river of dollars looking for places to flow such was finance in 2020 and 2021 advertisement advertisement for that we can thank the easy money policies the fed pursued in response to the coronavirus crisis which led it to slash short term rates to zero and buy massive amounts of bonds in order push down longer term rates the tactic known as quantitative easing or qe advertisement since interest rates were so low and investors couldn t make much money by parking their cash in safe stuff like government debt or high grade corporate debt they started turning to much more speculative assets that offered the hope of a jackpot or at least decent returns hence they poured their capital into stocks and laid down some bets on crypto among other novelties now the fed is throwing all of that into reverse instead of quantitative easing it has turned to quantitative tightening by letting its big hoard of bonds shrink as a result there s less money or liquidity to go around and some of those crazy stock prices are finally deflating a bit the river of money is drying up advertisement another way to think about things though is that the stock market is just kind of going back to normal after an unusual run the s p 500 has averaged a 9 4 percent annual return over the past 50 years in comparison it averaged a 24 percent annual return over the last three years we were probably bound for some mean reversion once the fed tightened credit and by some measures stock valuations are still pretty high compared to historic norms advertisement advertisement aside from all that everybody s worried that the fed is going raise rates so high that it will start a recession which would be bad for stocks among other things a recession no bueno i mean nobody really knows if or when a recession is coming and i m not going to play economic forecaster but the bottom line is that at least since the 1950s the federal reserve has never managed to bring down inflation as high as it is today without plunging the economy into a downturn there have been times where it raised rates pre emptively to head off inflation and didn t cause a recession but it hasn t ever accomplished what it s trying to do today advertisement advertisement and powell who was just confirmed for his second term as fed chair has signaled that he might be willing to push the economy toward recession if that s what it takes in an interview with marketplace this week he admitted that the fed might not be able to achieve a soft landing i e quell inflation without bringing down the economy for reasons it can t control but he s determined to get consumer prices under control regardless advertisement our goal of course is to get inflation back down to 2 without having the economy go into recession or to put it this way with the labor market remaining fairly strong powell said that s what we re trying to achieve i think the one thing we really cannot do is to fail to restore price stability though nothing in the economy works the economy doesn t work for anybody without price stability well that s nerve racking advertisement it is it s kind of a finance cliche to say that investors are fretting about uncertainty but that s part of what seems to be going on it s a big event every time new inflation numbers come out because if they re high it means the fed may have to hike rates faster and higher which would be worse for stocks and the economy but if inflation falls a bit in the coming months then the fed won t have to be as aggressive what s a little odd about this situation is that at the moment the economy still seems pretty ok other than 8 3 percent inflation ticking everyone off employment is high and even if job growth has slowed a bit in the last couple months it s still going relatively strong gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter but that was mostly because things like business inventories and imports the core of the economy consumer spending kept rising and most economists seem to think we ll grow overall this year but with the fed tightening people are jittery so should i be angry at the fed advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement eh powell co have a hard job they kept rates low at the height of the pandemic because the economy was fragile which was almost certainly the right move but one side effect was that it may have allowed some crazy bubbles to form they ve also had to deal with absurd curveballs like a war in ukraine that s sent energy costs soaring one fair criticism is that it should have maybe started tightening monetary policy earlier to start taming inflation sooner if they had they might not be considering drastic action now but it s had to say for sure what about biden did he screw up honestly i just don t have the heart to talk about the white house right now advertisement ok but now tell me why tech stocks and crytpo are getting hammered worst think about this way as we discussed higher interest rates and tight credit are worst for risky companies with profits that are way out in the future that describes a lot of tech firms uber loses money right now shopify loses money zillow loses money investors are willing to tolerate that and content themselves imagining a bright future of fat margins when cash is cheap but not so much when money suddenly costs money it doesn t help that some of these companies big ideas also just aren t panning out zillow had a big plan to automate home flipping that turned into an expensive flop advertisement a more boring issue is that a lot of the top tech companies make large amounts of money overseas right now the dollar is getting more expensive thanks in part to higher interest rates which reduces the value of foreign profits as for crypto the thing to realize about bitcoin and its brethren is that a lot of major investors basically decided to treat them like extremely extremely speculative stocks a way to get in on the edge of what silicon valley was up to now that extremely speculative stocks have lost their sheen a lot of those big money players are pulling out to reduce their exposure to risk also crypto gamestop and other internetty obsessions a big boost from retail investors who decided to use their stimulus checks on day trading obviously there haven t been any stimmies in a while all right but the market had a good day friday does that mean the carnage might be over eh you know how horror movies work you think the villain s dead then a bloody hand shoots out of the grave

bring volatility to the category and continues to be one of the most affected products in the market the shortages were prompted in part by the shutdown of a key production facility in michigan this year the plant owned by abbott nutrition has been the subject of an fda and cdc investigation following reports of contaminated formula that was linked to the deaths of at least two infants abbott

founder of the organization said the need for baby formula has always been there but the pandemic and shortage made it worse the need hasn t changed she said what the shortage of formula has done is

newborn from lexington north carolina valdes said she is currently breastfeeding her newborn while using baby formula during her last trip to the store she said it was just discouraging to see the shelves empty she added that she eventually was able to find baby formula however she was limited to two due to the store s policy she said relies on supplemental income from special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic which limits her purchases to what her baby needs as a result she is not able to purchase some of the baby formula that is left on the bare shelves due to wics requirements she added it s really scary and nerve wrecking to know that there might not be what she needs or her formula and i think about the mothers who are just using formula just as their main source of their children s nutrition it s really scary and heartbreaking honestly said valdes because local doctors do not recommend parents to use homemade baby formula for their babies valdes said she s left wondering what other options are out there for families it honestly makes me anxious very anxious worried about what the future will hold with the formula and how i will be able to access that for my baby she said risks of homemade baby formula the american academy of pediatrics strongly advises against using homemade baby formula calling it unsafe the academy also cautions against diluting formula to make it last longer which will not meet infants nutritional needs dr ellie erickson general pediatrician at duke university said i do not recommend using homemade formula as an option for feeding your baby if you ve been unable to find formula on your own she added baby formula is well regulated many people took to social media and shared the older generation has used homemade formula wxii 12 news asked erickson about these statements these older formulas while they were what was available at the time were probably not the most nutritionally optimal ways to feed babies at that time and were still unsafe at that time as well she responded erickson said up until six months of age the babies kidneys are not maturely developed if babies take in too much water she said it can drop the sodium in their blood to dangerous levels if homemade formula were high in water and too low in other salts and electrolytes again it could lead to hypometria causing seizure or death erickson shared the following advice to guide parents do not use home recipes for making your own formula and do not dilute the formula in any way other than is on the package instructions as these practices can have severe and at times fatal consequences for the infant it is safe to transition from one brand of formula to another however if your infant is on a special formula for a medical condition speak with your baby s doctor and or a pediatric nutritionist before making any substitutions some parts of the world have better supplies than others so consider your resources for safely ordering and shipping from a trusted source do not purchase breastmilk or infant formula on the internet from anyone or any source that you are not familiar with and can completely trust when feeding your infant place only the amount that your baby will eat in the bottle to not waste any of your supply if your infant is around six months of age talk with your baby s doctor about the timing and appropriateness of introducing solid foods
san francisco when elon musk tweeted friday that his deal to buy twitter was on hold as he looked into the extent of twitter s bot problem he was poking an open wound at the social media company twitter s challenges with bots and fake accounts have been around as long as the 16 year old platform in 2016 a russian troll farm used more than 50 000 bots to try to sway the outcome of the presidential election and twitter executives have promised to fix the issue but even as experts agree with the company that it s made significant progress in eliminating more fake and spam accounts than ever they say artificial intelligence advances are spinning up new ones that are ever harder to detect none of that should have been a surprise for musk who tweeted that he was pausing the deal pending details supporting calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 of users he later said he was still committed to the 44 billion takeover and some investors said they thought musk was angling for a lower price that would not weigh as heavily on the tesla shares he has pledged as loan collateral advertisement musk was referring to a twitter regulatory filing this month that said false or spam accounts constituted fewer than 5 percent of its 229 million daily active users the number is hardly new twitter has been giving the same estimate for years even though critics and experts have said they believe the company is lowballing the actual number of such accounts that 5 percent is a very opportune and chosen metric said a former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity tonot alienate a former employer they didn t want it to be big but also not small because then they could get caught in a lie twitter declined to comment for this story a person familiar with the acquisition negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters said the negotiations were proceeding as usual despite musk s claims of a hold the person said requests to learn more about spam and fake accounts were routine for a potential acquirer of a social media business advertisement twitter s history with spam goes as far back as its 2013 public offering when it disclosed the risk of automated accounts a problem faced by all social media companies facebook has also estimated that fake profiles account for about 5 percent of its user base for years people wanting to manipulate public opinion could buy hundreds of fake accounts to pump up a celebrity or a product s standing but the problem took a grave turn in 2016 when russian operatives from the internet research agency sowed disinformation about the election to millions of people in favor of then presidential candidate donald trump on twitter facebook youtube and other platforms the russia controversy which culminated with congressional hearings in 2017 prompted twitter to crack down by 2018 the company had launched an initiative called healthy conversations and was culling more than a million fake accounts a day from its platform the washington post reported at the time advertisement to tackle the problem internally twitter engineers launched an internal initiative called operation megaphone in which they bought hundreds of fake accounts and studied their behavior you grab a species and find others that behave like that species said a person familiar with the internal effort speaking on the condition of anonymity to freely describe it the person said they thought the 5 percent was probably an underestimate you re making predications based on what you ve observed but you don t know what you don t know critics have argued that twitter has an incentive to downplay the number of fake accounts on its platform and that the bot problem is far worse than the company admits the company also allows some automation of accounts such as news aggregators that pass along articles about specific topics or weather reports at set times or postings of photos every hour twitter does not include automated accounts in its calculations of daily active users because those accounts do not view advertising and it argues that all social media services have some amount of spam and fake accounts advertisement but the 5 percent number has long raised eyebrows among outside researchers who conduct deep studies of behavior on the platform around critical issues including public health and politics whether it was covid or many elections studies in the u s and other countries or around various movies we see way more than that number of bots said kathleen carley a computer science professor at carnegie mellon who directs the university s center for the computational analysis of social and organizational systems in all of the different studies we have done collectively the number of bots ranges we have seen as low as 5 percent and we have seen as high as 35 percent carley said the proportion of bots tends to be much higher on topics where there is a clear financial goal such as promoting a product or a stock or a clear political goal such as electing a candidate or encouraging distrust and division advertisement there are also very different types of bots including basic promotional spam nation state accounts and amplifiers for commercial hire rapidly developing technology allows geopolitical forces to seem more human peppering their comments with personal asides and to try to manipulate the flow of group conversations and opinions as an example carley said some pro ukraine bots were engaging in dialogue with groups normally focused on other issues to try to build coalitions supporting ukrainian goals the number of bot technologies has gone up and the cost of creating a bot has gone down she said outsiders said it was very difficult for them to produce a good estimate of bot traffic with the limited help twitter provides to research efforts when we use our botometer tool to evaluate a group of accounts the result is a spectrum ranging from very humanlike to very bot like said kaicheng yang a doctoral student at indiana university advertisement in between are the so called cyborgs controlled both by humans and software we will always mistake bots for humans and humans for bots no matter where we draw the line twitter gives some researchers access to a giant number of tweets known inside the company as the fire hose for its immense volume and speed but even that does not have the clues that would make identifying bots easier such as the email addresses and phone numbers associated with the accounts behind each tweet pretty much every effort outside of twitter to detect botness is fatally flawed said alex stamos the former facebook security chief who leads the stanford internet observatory twitter itself does not do nearly as much as it could to hunt down and eliminate bots two former employees told the post but two other former employees told the post that after 2018 the company acted far more aggressively advertisement some of the people speculated that financial incentives motivate twitter to not find them if the company identifies more bots and removes them the number of monetizable daily average users would go down the amount it could charge for advertising would also decline and the stock price would follow as it did after twitter confirmed a big cull to the post in 2018 the company uses a number of programs to seek out and block automated commercial accounts but they are most effective at catching the obvious spammers such as those that register hundreds of new accounts on the same day from the same device the former employees said to produce its quarterly bot estimate the company looks at a sample of millions of tweets but that is a tiny percentage of the total and they are from a wide spectrum not the hot button issues that draw the most spam and the most viewer impressions advertisement they honestly don t know the former employee said there was

sacramento calif ap california gov gavin newsom on friday pledged to use the state s record breaking 300 billion budget including an unprecedented nearly 100 billion surplus to future proof the state from the impacts of a volatile midterm election cycle that he fears will undermine abortion access gun safety and privacy protections across the country the first term governor of the nation s most populous state and a potential democratic presidential candidate used his budget presentation on friday to prop up his progressive credentials while attacking his rivals in conservative states he trumpeted major increases in spending on health care education child care and the environment while also pledging to spend 125 million to make it easier for women to get abortions in california including those from other states with the u s supreme court poised to possibly overturn roe v wade next month newsom pointed to a sign displaying california s lower covid 19 death rate compared to the republican led states of florida texas and arizona all of which are expected to further restrict or outlaw abortions if the court overturns roe newsom instituted the nation s first statewide coronavirus stay home order and many credit his aggressive actions throughout the pandemic with saving lives critics say he overreached and worsened the economic harm if you re pro life how the hell is this possible newsom said of the higher death rates in the three states that used a more hands off approach during the pandemic spare me their mantra on being pro life they don t deserve that status the sign at newsom s presentation referred to how california compared to the most populous states texas is no 2 followed by florida but arizona is no 14 the no 4 state is democratic led strongly in favor of abortion rights new york whose covid death rate is higher than texas and comparable to florida bryan griffin deputy press secretary for florida gov ron desantis disputed newsom s assertion arguing that in an appropriately adjusted format florida has fared about as well as california with covid but still preserved the personal liberties of its citizens and didn t destroy a litany of small businesses in the process california s projected 97 5 billion budget surplus is unlike anything seen before at the state level and is fueled by soaring tax revenue it is larger than the entire operating budgets of nearly every other state the unceasing flow of tax money prompted california republicans who don t have enough numbers in the state legislature to have much influence to complain about high taxes reducing quality of life he did not propose any permanent tax relief to deal with a worsening affordability crisis exacerbated by his policies said republican vince fong vice chair of the assembly budget committee the governor may not want to acknowledge it but california is in crisis and his budget is unsustainable newsom said the surging revenues are a sign of how well a number of people are doing in this economy and a reflection of the concentration of wealth and success in the hands of a few roughly half of california s income tax collections come from the top 1 of earners who have fared well during the pandemic that system makes the state more vulnerable than others to the booms and busts of the economy capital gains the increase in value of assets such as stocks and other investments where most wealthy people derive their wealth accounted for 9 7 of california s personal income that s the second highest ever recorded behind the year 2000 that was just before the dot com bubble burst and ushered in a recession the newsom administration said that could be a sign the economy is about to slow down again also citing uncertainties caused by the war in ukraine supply chain issues and recent actions by the federal reserve to combat runaway inflation it projects capital gains revenue will drop by 22 next year newsom s proposal would leave the state with 37 1 billion in reserves while using nearly all of its surplus on things that are not recurring expenses one of his biggest proposals is to return 18 1 billion to taxpayers in the form of tax rebates and programs that offer assistance with rent utility bills and health insurance premiums with gas prices reaching a record high in march newsom has suggested suspending the state tax on diesel fuel offering rebates of up to 800 for every person with registered vehicles in the state and spending 750 million to give everyone free rides on public transportation for three months but that proposal has gone nowhere in the state legislature where democratic leaders favor of a narrower relief package that would only target low to moderate income families newsom insisted the two sides will come to an agreement to get checks out later this year republicans argue the state should instead temporarily suspend its gas tax which at 51 1 cents per gallon is the highest in the nation the governor is living in an election year fantasyland if he believes promises of debit cards and rebates in the fall will provide relief now senate republican leader scott wilk said newsom s budget presentation comes as the state is in the throes of a deepening drought and as state energy officials warn of possible power shortages during the summer when air conditioning is at its peak the governor has called for people to cut their water use by 15 but consumption went up dramatically in march newsom wants to spend more money to encourage conservation provide loans to struggling drinking water systems and boost water recycling it includes 75 million for grants to farms and businesses hurt by drought meanwhile he s calling for 5 billion to create a 5 000 megawatt strategic reserve of energy to help the state avoid blackouts one megawatt can power 750 to 1 000 homes newsom s budget document included limited details on how that reserve would be built but he has indicated he s open to the possibility of keeping the diablo canyon nuclear facility online past its planned closure in 2025 as well as some gas fired power plants that are set to retire the budget plan must be approved by the legislature and takes effect july 1

person decided to waive due diligence when he agreed to buy twitter on april 25 in an effort to get the san francisco based company to accept his best and final offer this could make it harder for him to argue that twitter somehow misled him since musk inked his deal to acquire twitter technology stocks have plunged amid investor concerns over inflation and a potential economic slowdown the spread between the offer price and the value of twitter shares had widened in recent days implying less than a 50 chance of completion as investors speculated that the downturn would prompt musk to walk away

advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content under the terms of musk s contract with twitter he is entitled to ask the company for information on its operations following the signing of the deal but this is meant to help him prepare for his ownership of twitter not to carry out due diligence and reopen negotiations twitter is planning no immediate action against musk as a result of musk s comment people familiar with the matter said the company considered the comment disparaging and a violation of the terms of their deal contract but was encouraged by musk subsequently tweeting he was committing to the acquisition the sources added musk came to twitter s office for a meeting on may 6 as part of the transaction planning process a twitter spokesperson said twitter s chief executive parag agrawal also weighed in tweeting while i expect the deal to close we need to be prepared for all scenarios on thursday agrawal announced leadership changes and a hiring freeze while i expect the deal to close we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what s right for twitter i m accountable for leading and operating twitter and our

estimated number of spam accounts on the microblogging site has held steady below 5 since 2013 according to regulatory filings from twitter prompting some analysts to question why musk was raising it now this 5 metric has been out for some time he clearly would have already seen it so it may well be more part of the strategy to lower the price said susannah streeter an analyst at hargreaves

distracted as tesla s chief executive and that he may have to sell more tesla shares to fund the deal advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there is plenty of precedent for a potential renegotiation of the price following a market downturn several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock for example french retailer lvmh threatened to walk away from a deal with tiffany co the u s jewelry retailer agreed to lower the price by 425 million to 15 8 billion acquirers seeking a get out sometimes turn to material adverse effect clauses in their merger agreement arguing the target company has been significantly damaged recommended from editorial musk says he prefers less divisive candidate than trump in 2024 elon musk says he would reverse twitter ban on donald trump musk twitter sued by shareholder over 44 billion takeover but the language in the twitter deal agreement as in many recent mergers does not allow musk to walk away because of a deteriorating business environment such as a drop in demand for advertising or because twitter s shares have plunged musk is contractually obligated to pay twitter a 1 billion break up fee if he does not complete the deal but the contract also contains a specific performance clause that a judge can cite to force musk to complete the deal advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in practice acquirers who lose a specific performance case are almost never forced to complete an acquisition and typically negotiate a monetary settlement with their targets defeat the bots musk has said that if he buys twitter he will defeat the spam bots or die trying and has blamed the company s reliance on advertising for why it has let spam bots proliferate he has also been critical of twitter s moderation policy and has said he wants twitter s algorithm to prioritize tweets to be public earlier this week musk said he would reverse twitter s ban on former u s president donald trump when he buys the social media platform signaling his intention to cut moderation trump who started a rival social media app called truth social took to his platform on friday to weigh in there is no way elon musk is going to buy twitter at such a ridiculous price especially since realizing it is a company largely based on bots or spam accounts trump wrote in a post adding that his site is much

james s brady press briefing room 1 18 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone okay it would not be a briefing without some special guests so i have some with me today today president biden is welcoming mayors chiefs of police a county commissioner and a community violence intervention expert to the white house to talk about how the rescue plan is providing historic levels of support to make our communities safer the president will encourage even more communities to use rescue plan funding to invite more to invest more in fighting violent crime and to deploy american rescue plan funding to make our communities safer as quickly as possible as we head into summer as we announced earlier today over 10 billion has been spent or committed already on public safety through the rescue plan including by over 300 communities and more than half of the states the money is being put to use keeping cops on the beat for community policing investing in mental health and substance use disor substance use disorder services crisis responders community violence intervention and other programs to address the causes of crime and ease the burden on police these are stories from across the country about how this money is already making a difference and we wanted you to hear about it directly from the leaders on the frontlines first is mayor quinton lucas of kansas city missouri who has leveraged rescue plan money to avoid public safety layoffs and has used it to invest 10 million for new police technology because of the fiscal space provided by the rescue plan kansas city is also working to hire 150 new police officers mayor lucas was elected in 2018 and previously served on the city council next is police chief james white of the detroit police department together with mayor duggan chief white has used over 110 million from the rescue plan to invest in body cameras new gunshot detection technology and 30 million for enhanced police patrols among other strategies chief white is a veteran of over two decades at the detroit police department and since he was sworn in last year and with the help of the rescue plan detroit has recorded an 18 percent decrease in homicides compared to the previous year they ll each speak briefly will take some questions they ll have to go to meet with the president which is a good reason so i will turn that over to turn it over to mayor lucas thank you so much mayor lucas thank you so much and it s an honor to be with you all today i m here to discuss public safety not just in kansas city but in many of america s cities if we think back just a few years we had a challenge of tight budgets and rising crime the american rescue plan has filled an important and vital gap for us in kansas city if not for the american rescue plan officers would have lost their jobs salaries would have been frozen and our city would have become more dangerous instead we have been able to invest in a number of vital and important areas first of all we ve heard much discussion in recent years about community policing there is no community policing without the police the american rescue plan funds have allowed us to invest in more police officers and not only more police officers but salary increases so that we can make sure that we are recruiting and importantly retaining good officers in kansas city in addition to that communications technology in kansas city of 10 million from the american rescue plan allows us to invest in so many deferred technology areas so we can continue to be smart about how we solve crime keep our officers safe as they re looking to solve crime and importantly make sure that we re spending those additional funds in areas like recruiting in areas like intervention as a mayor i ve had the chance not just to have experiences with my own police department but i ve done ride alongs in los angeles baltimore washington and a number of other american cities in each of those you re hearing from people and mayors and leaders that are saying that this support has been key in terms of making our city safer and making sure that everyone in our community has police officers but has police officers who have the time and have the opportunity to get involved in our neighborhoods each and every day so i thank the president for giving us this opportunity with the american rescue plan i look forward to our conversation this afternoon where we ll continue to talk about how we can work together police politicians so many other folks in washington in terms of making sure our city sta stays safer rather as we go into the summer thank you so much chief white good afternoon everyone james white detroit police chief i took the role of police chief in detroit june 1st of last year after serving 24 years in the city of detroit having gone through bankruptcy in detroit retiring to take a job with the state and then coming back to lead this great department of some of the hardest working men and women in law enforcement certainly a humbling and honoring experience for me coming back and recognizing what s happening in our country with law enforcement police chiefs and police departments have to be innovative you cannot arrest your way out of crime there has to be community services community programming mental health support and a number of other different programs having been an assistant chief at a time when detroit went through bankruptcy and knowing what that felt like i d much rather be the chief when there s the type of investment that we see from the american rescue plan for cities like detroit it s enabled us to do a number of different things number one put officers in high areas of crime put officers around our city where we are looking at statistically gun violence being higher in those areas than in other areas in our city but in addition it s to provide our officers with state of the art training being able to develop training protocols based on best practices and use our training facility and bring it up to standards that are necessary in this day and age in law enforcement making sure that our officers are are best equipped to deal with the programming and the issues that we re seeing in our community one of the most exciting programs that we have is our crisis intervention training and our crisis intervention cars when i took this role we had crisis intervention officers in three of our precincts i m happy to say that today as a result of this american rescue plan dollars we re able to put it in six of our precincts and by the end of the year we re hopeful that we ll be in all 12 precincts and what that does for us is provide a very specific layer of safety not just for the officers but for the citizens who are in mental health crisis by having a trained mental health professional in that car with a trained officer who is trained in mental health intervention recognizing what they re looking at recognizing what they re dealing with when they come upon someone who is in crisis and perhaps engaging in violent or erratic behavior having those trained officers is an incredible layer of success and layer of equipment that we just did not have prior to this and one last thing is the training facility and the opportunity to recruit right now in policing recruiting is difficult and having a state of the art training facility and recruiting opportunity has been instrumental in what we re trying to accomplish in our city so with that thank you ms psaki all right go ahead q thank you mayor it is good to see you again a missouri general assembly just passed a bill just now that increases the percentage of kansas city s budget that needs to be spent on policing what s your reaction to the bill but more importantly what s your reaction to them passing it while you re here on this very topic mayor lucas i think it s always important to have locally driven solutions to local problems i think that s why the american rescue plan was so helpful money coming directly to cities and to states so we could solve public safety problems i do not think necessarily that someone in outstate missouri has better answers for policing than somebody in the core of kansas city and what we ve been able to do both with american rescue plan funding and our collaboration with folks at the state and federal level is come to solutions like more officers that my friends in the legislature and the governor are asking for and so i do not support anything that takes away our ability to work with our local police department and neighborhood leaders in terms of how we get to better solutions for violent crime ms psaki zolan q this this administration has often described talked about funding the police as crucial to not just lowering crime but also for police reform i heard you talk about crisis intervention training but did any of the arp investments that you allocated also go towards implicit bias training or programs that require diversifying the rank and file or active bystander training anything that specifically goes towards accountability or oversight chief white yeah i ll take that and so in detroit we re in the process right now of building out just hired a diversity equity and inclusion director we re constantly looking at our policies it s enabled me to incorporate a number of different components of diversity equity and inclusion which we already have but just expanding out and recognizing that we can make improvements and we ve been able to do that q did that come from arp funds mr white it what it came from was the the fact that we did not lose money or we didn t have a budgetary shortfall so we were able to do some things without losing the dollars if we did not have the money q but that s essentially like one you re talking about a coordinator somebody that s hired on to chief white you re talking about really a process because for us it s for all of our officers there s a number of there s a coordinator and then there s a programming from that coordinator that goes out department wide q and do you see that as kind of the main method of accountability when it comes to arp investments mr white no q or a program that enforces accountability mr white no i mean that s just one of many you know when we talk about community engagement we can t fight crime without our communities communities have to have trust they have to believe in police officers and certainly this is a time where police trust is super important and so when you talk about transparency in policing that s that s what these training opportunities provide us to to look at best practices to be innovative and to work on transparency with community ms psaki last one brian q thank you just to follow up on that a bit going forward in your community and other communities like yours what do you think is the most needed underfunded need that you have going forward mayor lucas among everything laughter q yeah among everything we were just talking about mayor lucas in terms of community trust q yes mayor lucas you know i think there was a reason that both of us have talked about recruiting and retaining officers we want officers that actually have the time to be engaged in communities time to actually interact with neighborhoods time to get known by people in the neighborhood in most cities in america you re not catching people say we want to get rid of all the police in fact i ve caught very few people who have said that they said they want the way they interact with police to be different they want somebody who has time to do community interaction that s why these investments in my opinion are so important because then you build up community trust which helps you solve crime it helps you actually build the relationships that you need to long term and so there s not a single kind of magic program that i think works in terms of getting to any of these issues it s instead making sure that you re investing somewhat holistically in police departments having enough officers that you can address things like having an event at the community center making sure there are people that are following up in neighborhoods making sure that you have social workers in departments which many of us have and that s where these funds i think are largely helping us invest in areas where without them we d be laying off police officers cutting social programs cutting everything that s actually needed to get people to trust the police more ms psaki do you have one more zeke q yeah ms psaki go ahead q thank you we re sitting here and violent crime gun crime in particular across the country is at an elevated level heading into the summer you talked about the risk there when you go in to meet with the president in a few minutes is there any specific requests that you have from him from the federal government for resources or tools that your department your city need heading into the summer chief white sure i mean certainly you know we we re only one part of the judicial process right i mean we make the arrests there s our courts the prosecutor s office you know we have a number of different needs and then there s the intersection of crime with mental illness and then we certainly recognize that you know we have a literacy problem in our country and so there are a number of different factors that drive crime by the time someone commits a crime there s a number of failed systems that has caused that to happen so we we re not going to simply arrest our last person and solve the problem we have to do a lot of work so i ll be talking about those types of investments community support which we ve been able to do with our ceasefire detroit and provide those community programming because i think that s super important mental health is super important engaging the courts at a high level is super important and certainly supporting police officers and making sure that they re properly trained in some of the areas that we ve talked about today ms psaki thank you mayor lucas and chief white mayor lucas thanks so much chief white thank you ms psaki for joining us really appreciate it okay oh here i don t want you to here you go i m sorry okay okay i just have a couple more toppers for all of you i m just really getting it all in on the last day here with the toppers for everybody the president spoke earlier today with abu dhabi ruler mohammed bin zayid al nahyan to convey condolences on the passing of uae president khalifa bin zayed the two leaders agreed to honor sheikh khalifa s memory by continuing to strengthen ties between the governments and people of the united states and the uae i also wanted to provide an update on infant formula and where we are and some updates on steps that we have taken yesterday we announced a slate of actions to increase safe infant formula supply following abbott s voluntary recall the president also spoke to major retailers and manufacturers to hear about what they are doing and what they need to help increase availability one of the top issues the very top issue they asked us to act on was getting states to increase wic flexibility so they can get more formula on the shelves faster basically how it works now is each state has a contract with a manufacturer whether it s abbott or any of the other manufacturers and they want flexibility so that they can if you have if you use wic and you get wic assistance you can purchase any kind of infant formula this afternoon secretary vilsack sent a letter to all states urging them to adopt all pes possible flexibilities in the wic program that is actually a step we d encourage them to do the day following the recall back in february but some states took the step and other states did not take the step at the time so this is an extra urging to do that he directed all states to review their practices and the agricultural department is reaching out to states throughout the day building on months of conversations and next week usda will follow up on the letter and calls to provide states with help to issue waivers that s what helps obviously consumers people who have wic who are rec recipients and they go to the store what we re also doing at the same time to help create this flexibility that these manu or these supply these store retailers asked for is today abbott also committed to provide critical flexibility to states through the end of august in the form of rebates and that means that these states can plan ahead and they can purchase supply ahead from a range of manufacturers not just the ones that they have contracts with this means that families on wic can purchase any available product in the months to come through august and states and retailers can plan ahead as i noted the fda also just issued a statement about importing formula from abroad they the fda committed to providing additional information early next week that will facilitate importation to get more product on u s store shelves as soon as possible and last we recognize that parents have a lot of questions mary asked about this yesterday i think mj asked about this too about where to go and who to call if they cannot obtain formula right now hhs has just launched a new webpage that provides resources and places that parents can go to obtain formula including contacts with companies food banks healthcare providers you can find this at hhs gov formula this work is far from over and in the days ahead you ll hear about new actions we re taking to increase safe infant formula we ll give you a week ahead on sunday the president will deliver remarks honoring the law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in

south korea for his first trip to asia as president karine and the team will have more to announce early next week and national security advisor jake sullivan will join the briefing on monday to preview the trip last thing i wanted to just say so i have one more topper you know this is my last briefing q no ms psaki it is brian and i wanted to start with a series of thank yous and i promised myself i wasn t going to get emotional whew okay thank you i want to say thank you to the president and the first lady they entrusted me in serving in this role for the last 15 months and i ve talked about this a little bit before but during my first conversation with them which was in november of 2020 after the election i was very nervous when i went to see them in delaware and really what we talked about for the majority of our conversation was the importance of returning integrity respect and civility to the white house the small sliver of my job here in engaging with all of you that does not mean that we haven t let our irish side show mine and the president s as well from time to time i recognize that but on my best days and as i look back i hope i followed the example of integrity and grace that they have set for all of us and do set for all of us every day and i m incredibly grateful to them i have i m not going to get everyone here but i want to thank there s a biden family that has extended and expanded far beyond the biden named family and that includes people who have worked with the president and for the president for many years ron anita bruce cedric kate jod donilon ricchetti susan deese jake evan annie elizabeth alexander there s so many others and the reason i mention them is because part of my job or anyone s job in this role is to represent and talk about the policies of and the work of any administration they have integrity grit commitment to trying even on the hardest days and worst days to make the world better for the american people and i am very grateful to them now i m not going to cry about the press team whew okay laughs thank you to the press team many of them are here some of them are not here because they re taking much needed days off it has nothing to do with me personally i promise but you all know a lot of them for those who don t know them they are incredibly tough smart hardworking and deeply deeply good human beings deeply good public servants and you know people always ask me and i m sure you guys get asked this too about whether washington is rotten you know whether everybody is corrupt here and you know nothing good happens and we all just argue with each other and i having done this job believe the absolute opposite is true because i have worked with and engaged with all of these incredible people across the administration and this amazing team many of whom are here that i get to work with every day and i as i said about karine last week these people are already the stars of the team but they re going to be shining stars in the future and i ll miss them a lot okay whew i promised myself i was going to keep it together i m not this is the last part of this i want to thank all of you in this room you have challenged me you have pushed me you have debated me and at times we have disagreed that is democracy in action that is it working without accountability without debate government is not as strong and you all play an incredibly pivotal role thank you for what you do thank you for making me better and most importantly thank you for the work every day you do to make this country stronger and i am very grateful to all of you as well so thank you for your role and to the role of your colleagues here and around the world okay with that zeke go ahead q cross talk by reporters q thank you jen and we wish you well and we hope you enjoy q cross talk by reporters ms psaki can i do one more thank you because my husband is here and i think anybody who is married with kids knows that without a remarkable spouse you would never be able to do it i know many of you have kids i m just looking at ashley ed mary so many mj and he has not only been a supporter an advocate of mine but he is an incredible partner and dad and i wouldn t be here without him okay go ahead now let s talk about serious issues go ahead q i have a suggestion q thanks jen could you you talked brian deese talked a little q why don t you take questions from across the room jen i have a suggestion to give on your last press briefing q brian deese this morning inaudible and he suggested that the administration had been aware of the q why don t you take questions from across the room q he suggested the administration has been aware of this formula shortage for q because that s what you have not been able to do for the past 15 months q some months now is there a reason why the administration waited until this week once the issue was in the public in the limelight to take some of these actions that you had discussed or particularly that website those are resources that people might have benefitted from greatly over the last several weeks and months ms psaki well zeke we have not waited to take action so what we have done since the day after the recall was announced we actually took steps working with these producers and working with states to ensure both one we were pushing states and encouraging them to expand flexibility as it relates to wic which is again the biggest ask of most people we talk to and then we ve been working with manufacturers and that has resulted in gerber increasing production by 50 percent ricketts increasing production by 30 percent and over the last four weeks more production of formula than there was in the four weeks prior and in comparison with last year this is all work that has been underway for the last several several months since this recall was enacted on the website this is a website we saw the need of course over the last 24 hours as people had questions and they needed more information we wanted to make it readily available and accessible to people but prior to that period of time we had not seen obviously what we ve seen over the last few days q has on a different topic did the president see and the white house have any reaction the disturbing images out of israel this morning of israeli police beating mourners of the al jazeera journalist and american citizen shireen abu akleh including they briefly dropped the casket does the white house have any response and is the president taking any action in response ms psaki well i would first that we have all seen those images they re obviously deeply disturbing we this is a day where we should all be marking including everyone there the memory of a remarkable journalist who lost her life we know that there is with the disturbing footage from the funeral procession today in jerusalem we regret the intrusion into what should have been a peaceful procession we ve urged respect for the funeral procession the mourners and the family at this sensitive time we re also in close touch with israeli and palestinian authorities have been and obviously will continue to be especially given the images we ve seen today we re not currently involved in any of the investigation but we are working to bridge cooperation and available to provide assistance as needed q and just finally is there a reason why the president s meeting with king abdullah this morning was not open to the press usually the president s meetings with foreign leaders are open to take some questions ms psaki understand completely it s a private meeting it wasn t meant to be a bilateral of discussion they ve known each other for some time go ahead q thank you q jen can i ask you a question from the back q back on the issue of the formula shortage q jen can i ask you a question from the back q simon please stop q i understand but you know q simon please show some respect to everyone else in the room thank you q for 15 months you have inaudible q jen on the issue of formula thank you sir q and i m saying that for the sake of equity we inaudible q first of all thank you for your service and thank you to your husband for his service as well on the issue of formula q cross talk by reporters q i think if anything this crisis has reminded everyone ms psaki simon if you could respect your colleagues and media and reporters in here that would be greatly appreciated q no the biggest the biggest disrespect is not to have a question for 15 months ms psaki go ahead mary q thank you if anything this q that s why i m asking you q sir please q if you can spread the questions inaudible q if anything this has reminded i think the entire country and the world that this is not a q then all of us in the back inaudible q luxury item but an essential q cross talk by reporters q not today not today not today q thank you formula is not a luxury item it is an essential it is something that families across the country rely on is this such a valuable commodity that the president thinks that we need some kind of backstop some ability to surge in the way that we do for other essential items perhaps even some kind of stockpile ms psaki well i would say there have been discussion and some members of congress have raised questions say of the defense production act which that would be something which is on the table we ve not made a decision about but would be would help address issues over the long term what we are doing here is we re trying to be to ensure that states and others can plan over the long term as in the coming months but it is it is certainly you know a reminder that not only do we need to continue to work closely with manufacturers continue to work closely with retailers and providers but ensure that everybody knows what they can do to get access over the longer term but i m not there s not a discussion of a stockpile what we need to do is ensure we are addressing any issues in the supply chain and addressing any issues with speeding up manufacturing q you mentioned that the defense production act and forgive me if i m not understanding how this works but ms psaki sure q but how would that actually work because you say you re exploring it but it seems that the issue here is really not having enough manufacturing capacity so is it really a matter of just looking for other sites that can produce this ms psaki well that s exactly right mary and so the reason why it would have a longer term impact is because their production of manu of baby formula is so specialized and so specific that you can t just use the defense production act to say to a company that produces something else produce baby formula it just doesn t work that way exactly that is something that could be a consideration over the longer term and certainly there are ways that the defense production act has been used in other industries right as it relates to a chemical that is needed or a specific tool or part that is needed so right now of course we re keeping that option under consideration but our focus primarily is twofold one is increasing supply making and the other is making it readily available and obviously production is working with these manufacturers and also imports making sure we re making more baby formula available through imports and then making it readily available the biggest step we can take is this wic flexibility component which obviously we took two steps not just pushing states but also working with abbott to ensure they re providing a rebate for longer term planning q and just lastly you said that the fda is going to have more on easing imports and some of those steps next week but does the president believe that parents should be allowed to buy formula directly from abroad ms psaki well there have been difficult there have been limitations on this because of course we have a very high level of you know fda approval processes to ensure that we have the best formula that is safe for babies and of course whatever formula would be imported would meet those standards but we think the best steps we can take is to work with abbott and abbott has a responsibility here too to work closely with the fda and doing the steps that are necessary to get back and operational online we have a great deal of manufacturing capacity here in the united states that s less the issue the issue is obviously this was a recall in february that as a reminder was done because there in there was a factory in michigan that had tainted formula that killed two babies but we have a range of manufacturing capacity here so this import step would be not forever or necessarily even long term it s just to address the current need go ahead q thank you jen and thank you for your work here the last ms psaki thank you q 16 months you said yesterday that the united states would support sweden and finland s application to nato turkey is a current nato member and the president of turkey is saying that they would not his country would not look positively on that what is the u s reaction to that and will the u s intervene on the nordic countries behalf ms psaki yeah so we are working to clarify turkey s position we would refer you to the turkish government for more information on their views i think there s no question and you ve seen this from the public statements of a number of nato leaders that there is broad support from nato member countries in finland and sweden s you know desire or interest stated interest in applying to join nato but we are continuing to work with turkey and i would point you to their representatives q also any white house reaction to elon musk saying today that his deal to buy twitter is on hold while getting information on fake bot accounts ms psaki yes i would say this is a transaction a potential transaction i guess we can call it at this point from a private investor and we don t have any comment on private transactions our views broadly speaking on the role of social media platforms and the need for reforms certainly still stands but but right now it s a it s a reported view of a transaction of a private investor go ahead ed q thank you jen for what i m told is episode 224 of the briefing ms psaki yes that is true q thank you for doing this as you ve done ms psaki has time gone as quickly for you laughter q i haven t been here for all the episodes ms psaki that s true you ve been here for a lot of them q a few things back to the murder of shireen abu akleh i m curious does the president himself plan to speak with her family given especially in part that she is an american citizen ms psaki we have obviously reached out and engaged through national security officials with her family i don t have any calls to predict or preview at this point in time but if that does happen we d of course make that information available to all of you q and does the president have any plans to speak with the israeli government directly about the death and the ongoing investigation ms psaki well certainly we have been engaged with them and have offered support and if they need specific support from us we will provide that but i don t have any calls to predict at this point in time q and then two quick ones on immigration there could be a ruling today in federal court on the future of title 42 and whether or not it gets delayed beyond the may 23rd deadline can you give us a status report on ongoing preparations for the end of it should that deadline hold and how they might change if they get delayed by a quarter ms psaki well the preparations have been ongoing led by the department of homeland security and secretary mayorkas as we ve talked about in the past he has outlined a plan that he has been preparing since last fall to ensure we re increasing capacity at the border that we are taking steps to ensure that we are prepared for the lifting of title 42 those are proceeding obviously i m not going to prejudge a court ruling that hasn t quite happened yet and what it will mean or prejudge what the department of justice may do in response i m sure there ll be more discussion about that if and when they rule today q and one other you may remember last fall there were questions about court cases brought by families that were separated at the border and at the time the white house said if it saves taxpayer dollars and puts the disastrous history of the previous administration s use of zero tolerance and family separation behind us the president is perfectly comfortable with the department of justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation a cbs news review of court records published this week however finds that the justice department is actually seeking to dismiss all lawsuits filed by migrant families requesting compensation over the separations during the trump years just curious how do the justice department s moves to dismiss those cases line up with what was said here last fall and the overall commitment to bringing justice to these people and is the administration willing to return to the negotiating table to try to forge some kind of a settlement with them since the president among others has called that policy criminal ms psaki it was and the president believes it was horrific and inhumane and our sta our statement made last fall stands now these are negotiations and discussions being led by the department of justice i don t have any confirmation of that report i d certainly point you to them for the status of any discussions with the families go ahead q thanks jen and thank you for always taking my questions ms psaki of course jacqui q happy to catch your last briefing thank you from all of us so you must have some information on baby formula from these manufacturers from the discussions that the president has been having the administration has been saying that more formula has been produced in the last four weeks than the four weeks preceding the recall and the shutdown so what is the best sense of a timeline for parents on how long is this going to be an issue and when in stock rates are going to get better ms psaki well we there s a couple of issues at play here jacqui and this is a really important question but it s hard for us to make an assessment from here what we re seeing is that the supply shortages are re can be regional and sometimes they can rotate and sometimes the issue at play here is that bigger man manufa or bigger retailers have a have a more streamlined process for stocking the shelves than smaller retailers now a lot of people go to stores in their community to go buy baby formula and it may just be that there s a bit of a delay in stocking some of those shelves it is certainly a good sign and a positive sign that here has been this increased production from these other retailers and our hope is also that because there s going to be more flexibility with wic in the ability of wic recipients to purchase different kinds of formula enabling many people who are maybe waiting for their states to make that decision and also that states will have this rebate opportunity it will provide the incentive to further provide flexibility that will also help and of course imports so we re working to not just address we ve been working to address for months but we re working to make this to ensure that there is greater supply consistent supply on the shelves as long as possible now what we know and i know from feeding formula to two kids is that typically you have one formula that you give your kid right and so the challenge here is also for parents when they re reliant on one formula and maybe it is maybe their child has certain needs because they re sensitive to dairy products or other products and so the other part of this that we re trying to address is providing these resources so that if people have questions about what kind of formula they can take as an alternative like the ones that will be imported are not necessarily formulas that people know but there may be ones that are parallel to the formulas that people are taking or giving to their children so we are working on every lever here to expedite addressing this and to ensure that when people go when mothers go to the grocery stores in the coming weeks that they will see a shelf stocked q and i did just go through the hhs website that you guys put out one of the suggestions for emergency situations would be to call your pediatrician see if they have in store samples or or in office office samples or go to a local food pantry clearly you ve outlined this as you know there s going to be a range sort of timelines depending on where you live in the country and where you shop but say for big box stores i mean the walmarts and giants and krogers can you give us sort of a ballpark window for just realistically how many weeks or months this parents are going to be having trouble finding it or in stock rates would get would start to improve ms psaki well let me first say that the reason we suggest calling peop your pediatrician is because of this question i just touched on because when you re feeding your child formula typically they don t recommend changing formula necessarily but there are ways to do it and if your child has specific needs or is intolerant to certain ingredients a pediatrician can help advise on that but obviously there are a lot of other resources through public health sites as well i would say for the bo big bigger retailers you know some of whom the president spoke with yesterday their number one biggest ask was the flexibility on wic and their feeling was that that would help them take steps given the increased supply of these other manufacturers to help stock the shelves more quickly q so you guys aren t comfortable giving any sort of ballpark window of time basically ms psaki as quickly as possible is our objective jacqui but it s going to be different store to store q okay and then one more on the also on baby formula it seems like when there s a crisis you often call on the ftc to look at price gouging i recall this administration doing that with gas prices it didn t seem to really bring down gas prices and did not increase supply how is it going to be different this time around with baby formula and how quickly are they going to be cracking down on people who are reporting and not what are the ramifications when are we going to see that play out ms psaki well the ftc is an independent agency so by us calling for them to look at price gouging they obviously haven t taken a step on oil companies otherwise you would be fully aware of it but it is something that we can all watch even as non economists and even as non oil experts when the price of oil goes down the price of gas should go down and that is not what we have seen consistently i would say as it relates to baby formula what we know is that we are certainly seeing and we have seen hoarding happen and so we are looking for you know that to be looked into and we think that s an issue where if there s caps and this is something we have been working to institute on the number of containers that can be purchased that will help but also we re we are we are taking every step we can to ensure that that is tracked and that can be addressed if needed to in the pool of doing everything we can to address this go ahead q jen thanks for your service and thanks for delivering on your commitment to return the daily briefing all of us in this room are grateful for that i want to ask if i can about crime that the president is going to be addressing a little bit later we had one of the mayors and one of the police chiefs here a short time ago beyond directing dollars can you sort of detail the level of concern with this administration about bail reform right now and about some district attorneys being too lenient in their prosecution of criminals and i guess beyond that what other points of leverage do you have to encourage stronger prosecution efforts or any efforts to change that ms psaki well i would say first on bail reform on the president on the campaign trail the president said that cash bail has become the modern day debtor s prison no one should be held just because they are poor and a person who is dangerous but has the money to pay bail shouldn t have a get out of jail card that continues to be his view what we see is some there are a couple of big issues as it relates to crime we ve seen we ve inherited from the previous administration the largest year over year jump in murders in record history in 2020 our focus from here has been putting more cops on the beat you heard the police chief talk about that through the american rescue plan backed up by more federal agents to take violent crime off the streets cracking down on firearm traffickers 77 percent of violent crime in the last assessment of data we have is a result is with is with guns to get illegal guns off of our streets and stemming the flow of ghost guns something the president has taken a number of actions on and investing through the arp and community programs to prevent crime by interrupting disputes before they spill into violence i will note and you heard you heard the police chief just talk about this but in cities like detroit and houston who have both used rescue plan funds to invest in fighting crime we ve seen declines in certain categories because our view and the president s view is if you fund and have more cops on the beat working with communities that is going to help address this issue i d also note that as it relates to guns which is a huge concern of ours since last summer we obviously initiated these and announced these doj led strike forces they re an integral part of the president s plan to keep our community safe and as i noted 77 percent of homicides committed in 2020 the last year we had data were done with a firearm since the launch last summer the doj strike force has already seized 5 100 and one of the steps that can be taken is of course to confirm steve dettelbach a very qualified person to lead the bureau of alcohol tobacco and arms and the president has also called for an additional 30 billion in new funding in his 2023 budget to fight crime and that is a step that he is hopeful there will be bipartisan support for q there s a lot of questions in the room so i ll limit mine to two today the other one is about asean that s here what commitments has the president secured from the leaders of asean to condemn russia ms psaki well there will be a communiqué that comes out later this evening i know communiqués are very exciting to everyone but there will be interest q talk about the unique challenge inaudible ms psaki i m certain in this one i will say you know ukraine and russia would not typically be a major topic of discussion at asean right you all have covered them before you visited you ve traveled to cover asean summits and it certainly will be a topic of discussion and was last night and will continue to be today so there will be a broad discussion of ukraine and russia the united states in these meetings we ll continue to lay out our approach to russia s unjustified and illegal war we believe the asean leaders are very interested to hear more about our approach both where things stand and in terms of the next steps we extep expect that the leaders statement will also have a reference to ukraine in it as well but that is still being finalized in the coming hours go ahead q will president biden address the abortion rally tomorrow ms psaki he has no plans to address the rally tomorrow q and separately does he have any plans to meet with abortion advocates rights advocates at the white house here ms psaki we are very engaged with women s rights advocates abortion advocates and other advocates as well as members of senate members of the senate and members of congress i would note that this is an issue that is much broader than abortion advocates they are of course marching in the streets and having their voices heard and peacefully protesting and we respect the right to peacefully protest but two thirds of the country does not want roe to be overturned so this is an issue that we are engaged very broadly with across the spectrum about what steps we are considering what steps we have the capacity to do and what we would do if the final opinion looks like the draft that was leaked last week q the families of americans detained in iran have appealed directly to the president for help in getting them out they re not they don t seem to have much faith in or hope that the nuclear negotiations are going along fast so is he is he receptive of that is there an effort ongoing to free those people ms psaki there is an ongoing effort led by our negotiating team from the state department to bring every american home who is detained or held in a country and wants to be of course home with their families it has always been a separate channel than the iran nuclear negotiation talks it is not in the same channel but certainly the president is committed to and will do everything possible to bring americans home who are detained in iran go ahead q a question on brittney griner does the white house have a response on her detention being extended ms psaki yeah there was a report on that this morning so i would say first that while we don t have a comment on this specific development i would just reiterate that the russian system wrongfully detained ms griner we take our responsibility to assist u s citizens seriously and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for all u s citizens when they are subject to legal processes overseas now because the state department recategorized her as wrongfully detained it means that our special presidential envoy for hostage affairs it s quite a title but a well deserved one is going to be overseeing this case and leading the effort because it s a deliberative process and we know from experience of bringing other americans home we re just not going to detail what those efforts look like at this point in time q and last question you said that the president won t participate in any of the activities tomorrow will anyone from the administration take part in either protest tomorrow here in d c ms psaki as an official representative from the government i will let you know if there s someone that we have officially representing i m certain that people in their private time will participate and attend go ahead q as we sit here there doesn t look to be a lot of appetite right now for more covid funding in congress there have been warnings of course from the white house about what that will mean are you able to say what the plan b is if there is no funding is there money in the couch cushions to order the stuff that you say they re not going to be able to order or when can you give us an update on when things will start running out in the coming months ms psaki sure well well i would say there is no plan b while there is you know a limited amount of funding that we have to work with it s very limited and it will require us making tough choices about what remaining tests treatments and vaccines we can get we are continuing to work the phones hold briefings make our case publicly of course as you noted and we are having bipartisan bicameral discussions about why we need this funding what the consequences will be if we do not have it and those are significant i mean obviously more americans will die needlessly which is the biggest heartbreaking issue we re going to exhaust our treatment supply we ll lose out to other tr countries on promising new treatments this is one of the biggest components that is of concern to the president and all of us because as you know how we ve approached this to date is we have ordered ahead so that we are first in line and we have the supply needed when there is a better booster or when there is a better vaccine or a vaccine that will treat specific variants and we are putting ourselves essentially at the back of the line without this funding yesterday there was a we hosted a global summit we requested 5 billion for funding for to help continue to be the arsenal of vaccines in the world we will no longer be able to provide that funding we also will be unable to maintain our supply of covid tests and we will be unable to ensure that there will be an an a never you know an ongoing supply of free treatments for families across the country q is it possible that you ll cut short previous orders to either either because you can t pay for them or because you want to reallocate the money ms psaki we will have to end programs and some of that will feel abrupt q can i pivot and ask a little bit about you know the about the baby formula challenge right now everyone s 401 k s are not looking hot at the moment or maybe i m speaking for myself laughter consumer sentiment today hit a fresh low since 2011 at its lowest point and inflation of course is high gas prices are surging again there s a sense right now that you know that there s a lot of challenges in the economy in the u s what do you say to voters who are frustrated by that and in particular those who voted for this president because he sort of promised to be a sort of capable steward in contract to the previous president since that was sort of the pitch he made to voters ms psaki well i think first we would say to families we understand there are challenges you re dealing with every day costs are too high it is too expensive to fill up your gas tank food is too expensive at the store and our focus right now is on taking every step possible to address those issues we know that the president that the big driver of this is the was the pandemic and the impact on supply chains and the and then the uptick in the pandemic with delta last summer then we had an additional challenge as you ve noted some of these but with the invasion of ukraine by russia which drove up energy prices and that is the biggest driver of inflationary costs at this point in time now we saw a downtick a bit earlier this week but what we would also say to families is one we are at record economic growth the unemployment rate is 3 6 percent we re seeing encouraging business investment those are all good signs what our focus is on is doing everything we can to lower costs and that includes a range of steps the president has taken just over the last couple of weeks making sure we re lowering the price of high speed internet giving farmers the tools and resources they need to boost production we re also he led the release of a million barrels of oil through the strategic petroleum reserve issued a waiver for e15 gasoline so thousands of gas stations in the midwest could have an additional 10 cents cheaper option at the pump fix the family glitch he is mindful and focused on doing everything he can to give people breathing room and lower costs and what we d sel say to americans also is look at the alternative we all acknowledge inflation and cost is a challenging issue what is the republicans what are they presenting as the option q is he frustrated by this i mean he likes to say the buck stops with him you know is he things aren t working is he frustrated with the circumstance is he frustrated with his team is he frustrated he hasn t been able to get it under control ms psaki i would say when you ve served as the president has as vice president for eight years you re pretty clear eyed about the fact that leading the country means that the buck stops with you and that every challenge we face is on your desk and he s very aware of that go ahead q yeah you ve said that some states have not done this wic waiver which ones ms psaki laughs i can see if we can get you a rundown that was not meant to be a naming and shaming there are some states that just didn t take that step when the recall was happened and we encouraged them to do that in february so today is an opportunity for the secretary of agriculture to say now is the time to do this if you want to make sure that people in your state who benefit from wic are getting helped this is the way to do it q okay congresswoman elise stefanik and she tweeted something i will read to you but several other republican politicians have also gone along this line she says joe biden continues to put america last by shipping pallets of baby formula to the southern border as american families face empty shelves she says this is unacceptable do you have a response to that ms psaki well we do like facts here so let me just give you a little sense of the facts on this one there s something called the flores statemen settlement which she may or may not be aware of that s been in place since 1997 it requires adequate food and elsewhere specifies age appropriateness hence formula for kids under the age of one cbp is following the law that law that has been in place and been followed by the way by the past every administration since 1997 so this has been a law in the united states for a quarter century it s been followed by every administration and on but i would also note that we also think it s morally the right thing to do you know and this is a difference from the last administration it is the law but we believe that when children and babies or babies i should say are crossing the border with a family member that providing them formula formula is morally right and so we certainly support the implementation of it q if i could just one last question the governors of colorado and massachusetts have sent a letter to the president urging him to urge the fda to hurry up and consider moderna s application for a vaccine for children under the age of five would the president do such a thing does the administration have any view on the apparent delay in consideration of that vaccine ms psaki i would say the parents in here have a view and we all are very eager to bring our children and get them vaccinated who are under the age of five but science this is the president s view most importantly moves at the pace of science the fda is the gold standard for a reason and we want to ensure that when those vaccines are available when we are taking our kids bribing them if needed to get their shots that it is safe and we know it s safe go ahead q jen ms psaki i ll come back i m sorry about that go i ll come back to you go ahead ashley q as you know the anniversary of george floyd s killing is a little over a week away as a candidate president biden embraced some of the messages about police reform and later he even promised george floyd s family that he would get something done on the issue but now police reform has failed in congress there s no executive order and today he s basically asking cities to pump money into police departments what is the administration s message for people who had hoped the biden administration would actually significantly reform policing ms psaki well first i would say he s actively considering a police reform executive order and has every intention of doing that it just takes some time i understand that since it was a version of it came out into the public which happens back in january it feels like a long time but these take a long time there s a legal review a policy review and he has every intention of doing that we actually paused because there was bipartisan negotiations happening and obviously that was always the preference because that would make it more permanent i would say that it s not just about pumping funding into police departments it s about ensuring that there are enough cops on the beat to crack down on violent crime to crack down on illegal guns that are the cause of 77 percent of crimes across the country and what he s also done and the department of justice has also done is implemented federal steps like bans on chokeholds and other steps that the president would certainly like to see you know implemented across the country and a part of federal law so he is going to continue to support the funding of police he hopes republicans will join him in supporting his budget now they did not support the 10 billion he announced today because they voted against the american rescue plan and he is but he is also supports accountability and a police reform executive order will be a part of that q and pivoting briefly what advice do you have for karine as she prepares to step into your role q that you can say in public laughter ms psaki i can i can say we re very transparent here brian laughter you know i would say that some of the lessons i ve learned that i would i would tell anyone including karine obviously we ve had many discussions about this would be one you know the best the most important job that you have in this in this role i think tied with another one but i ll get to the point is to project convey the positions the policies the views of the president of the united states and every opportunity you have to speak with him to engage with him to ask him questions oftentimes i will tell you they are questions that you all have asked me in the briefing room or otherwise it will make you better equipped and even more effective because our job is to speak on his behalf the second thing i would say and in my heart i m a bit of a policy nerd but i would tell this to anyone is that the more you know about policy issues and the more you can go in depth on it and spend time digging pushing and questioning the policy teams the better able you will be to answer tough questions to answer the 12th question and hopefully provide information to the public and the last thing i would say is that it can be repetitive in here from time to time laughter that s not a critique you are all doing your jobs but in the age of social media always provide the context and all the details because you never want to be a meme with one line that would be my inaudible but otherwise be yourself and karine as i said last week is going to bring her own magic her brilliance her style to this briefing room and always for anyone who comes after karine me or karine it s to continue to make it better and do better for the president and the and the american people q very tiny follow up on that ms psaki yes q should we expect that under karine there will still be daily briefings ms psaki i will let her speak to that ms jean pierre yes laughter ms psaki but yes that is the plan go ahead q thank you thank you jen the 10 billion that s being announced today where does the president and the white house kind of is does the president see that as something to kind of celebrate when i look at the original pool and i realize it s an initial tranche of 350 billion and i know there s different kind of competing priorities here i m wondering if the white house sees today as sort of another call to action to states to spend even more on police departments ms psaki that s part of it q or is this kind of saying is he impressed by that they ve already spent all this money ms psaki well i would say part of it is he thinks it s important that it has been spent and he has seen we have seen the impact of it in some states you know that i mentioned detroit and houston for example but part of it is also about the need to spend more we know 245 billion is what s been spent to date so there is more funding left from the american rescue plan package and certainly he thinks keeping communities safe making sure police departments have the resources they need is an important way to spend the money q i just have a quick clarification on the dpa too you said the administration is considering the dpa for to ramp up manufacturing ms psaki it s one of the options under consideration sure q i think there s two titles under dpa one would prioritize contracts and say companies you need to develop this another would allow the federal government to distribute loans to distribute actual money to companies so that they can ramp up manufacturing is the administration considering that provi title of dpa to actually give money ms psaki there s also options beyond that about the use of specific to use there s a range of ways you can use dpa so i don t have specifics about how it might be used i would say that we are already working and we have been working with manufacturers to increase production so that is already effectively happening and the challenge which i mentioned before with baby formula is that you you know it s it s complex and you can t just say to a manufacturing facility that makes cereal you need to make baby formula now so it s a bit challenging and different in that regard but it is an option there are a range of utilities and ways you can use it and it remains under consideration q you said it s already happening title it s already happening title 3 is already happening ms psaki no no no we re already working with manufacturers to increase production so that s one of the part the aspects or one of the ways to use dpa but we re already doing that effectively so that was the point i was making go ahead q hey jen thank you the fda commissioner a little while ago said that the he intends to announce plans next week to help streamline the import of baby formula into the u s is there anything you can preview for us on that front and maybe explain some of the hurdles that currently exist that this process would be fixing ms psaki sure well right now every kind of baby formula that s made in other countries is not allowed to be imported here necessarily so it s it s cutting red tape and easing those restrictions now as i noted a little bit earlier what that may mean is that when moms go to the grocery store they may see a form of baby formula that they have not seen before and they may have questions about what that is and can i feed it to my baby that s why we have a range of resources and hotlines that people can call to get those questions answered but overall what it s trying to do is provide more supply so that there can be a range of options and a range of supply on shelves so that mothers don t have to fear not being able to have formula to feed their children q and i know you said that the administration has been on top of this issue since this issue emerged with the abbott plant back in february and you ve been working on this issue since then so can you explain why something like this in terms of streamlining the import of products wasn t done sooner wasn t done before parents arrived at the supermarket to find empty shelves ms psaki well we we ex we believe that part of what s happening right now is that there was supply that a lot of the larger retailers had and it was kind of six to eight weeks where they had that supply and they haven t been able to restock it quickly enough but we would not be where we are with gerber increasing production by 50 percent or reckitt increasing production by 30 percent had we not been working on this from the beginning and i would note that what the retailer said yesterday they need the most is these this flexibility on wic because that s where they see the challenge is coming up so that is actually something we did the day after and something that you know we re continuing to push states to do q is there more you think you could have done sooner ms psaki well look hindsight is always 20 20 but i would say that we what s important to note as much as this wasn t being reported on because people were not seeing shortages at the stores as much we did there was an announced recall back in february right and there were steps we have been taking every single day since then the f with the fda in the lead to help address any potential shortage q and lastly just a quick follow up on your comments about the images we saw in israel today you said that you just called these images deeply disturbing of israeli police beating mourners who were carrying this casket you said that we regret the intrusion do you condemn these actions by israeli forces and do you believe that they had any justification for actually beating these mourners and these pallbearers as we saw in these images ms psaki i think when we said they were disturbing we obviously were not were not justifying them q but were condemning them ms psaki but i think i will leave my comments at what i said go ahead q thank you jen i wanted to ask two quick policy questions here on the house floor earlier today the democratic majority leader steny hoyer said quote it is unfortunate that in a time of war that we spend all the time blaming our own president just a clarification it s not the white house s belief that we re at war or we re engaged in any kind of conflict ms psaki i think he s i did not see the full context of his comments what i m betting he was referring to was the war happening in ukraine with russia that obviously the u s has a stake in given the amount of military humanitarian economic assistance we ve provided and as i ve said before of course the ukrainians deserve the greatest accolades for their bravery and their courage but the american people also deserve a lot of gratitude for their sacrifices and their support of this war q and then one more the president supports the women s health protection act which did not pass in the senate and of course that would codify roe but it would also go beyond that some opponents like senator susan collins have pointed out that by codifying the federal right to abortion that the bill would necessarily strike down some state laws restricting certain procedures for instance banning sex selective abortions and laws that require parental notifications for minors seeking an abortion so should we read into the president s support of that legislation that he also supports overturning state laws that would ban sex selective abortions or require parental notifications ms psaki the president believes in codifying roe and there are a range of ways to do that through congress q right but that wasn t but that s not an answer to the specific policy question where is the president on these specific restrictions no one here doubts the president supports roe v wade and codifying it but there s allegations that this this proposed bill goes farther so where does he stand on this specifically ms psaki the bill the bill failed the president supports the bill go ahead q thank you jen q yeah jen thank you ms psaki oh go go ahead nadia go ahead nad and then i ll go to you ed and go yeah ladies first q thank you jen and thank you for your service and good luck with your new inaudible ms psaki thank you thank you q i have a question and a follow up on the question the russian ambassador to vienna said today that under different circumstances russia probably could have provided its good offices to the two sides but not now referring to the iran talks and the eu chief foreign policy chief said there is enough positivity for the talks to resume do you believe that russia is an obstacle to going back to the deal and do you think that there is actually a chance that we can go back to it ms psaki well i would say that our belie our view on the deal is that iran needs to decide whether it insists is going to continue to insist on extraneous conditions and whether it wants to conclude a deal or not we believe that concluding a deal would serve all sides interests but while we have certainly condemned the actions of russia in ukraine and their the actions of a war criminal in invading ukraine are the biggest obstacle to an iran deal moving forward is iran q and i want to follow up with my colleague s mention of shireen abu akleh and i want to emphasize she is an american citizen ms psaki yes q you know when american journalists are killed in ukraine nobody waits for an investigation they pinpoint their you know inaudible to the russians why israel get away with this why not calling for an independent inquiry since palestinians do not believe that israel is capable of investigating itself i mean this journalist was fully covered in a vest in a helmet yet she was targeted under the ear that means it s a professional job by a sniper and many people believe that it was an israeli soldier who shot her ms psaki well as we understand it there are investigations by both sides we ve offered our assistance to the israelis to the palestinians and we re prepared to provide that should they want it go ahead q thanks jen two questions one do you have a comment on a texas supreme court ruling allowing state officials to conduct abuse investigations of parents with transgender kids ms psaki i have not looked into this specific court case but i would tell you that any efforts to discriminate against to bully to you know put transgender kids at risk would be something we would oppose but i would have to check out more about this specific court case q on the summit of the americas you ve mentioned a couple times that invitations have not gone out ms psaki yeah q it is assumed that the president of mexico and the president of brazil are invited you recognize juan guaidó as the interim president of venezuela why is it not assumed he s getting invited why the mystery ms psaki there are a range of conversations going about the final invitation list i just don t have a final conclusion on those and as soon as we do we will make those information available to all of you q and then just to bookend our time at the state department i wanted to ask about israel a broader question on how the president seems to be the first in the modern era not to put quite an emphasis on solving the israeli palestinian conflict he has not appointed a special envoy for the conflict he has not assigned the portfolio to a top administration official what should we read into that what priority is it of his especially as we see these images coming out of jerusalem to personally get involved in dialogue ms psaki i would say first as it s always been the case any envoy would be working out of the state department it was the case when i was at the state department and we knew each other there and certainly you ve seen the secretary of state and also the president talk for decades about the need for a two state solution how that is the only viable end way to end an ongoing conflict in the region and i would certainly say that remains his view remains his policy and but i would point you to the state department for any updates on negotiations or on engagement go ahead q i have a follow up on brittney griner does the president have plans to meet with brittney griner s family like he met with trevor reed s family ms psaki we are in touch with her family but i don t have any planned meetings to preview for you at this point in time q and then i have a follow up on title 42 ms psaki sure q i know a judge s ruling hasn t been made yet but if he does rule to sort of continue to temporarily delay title 42 from being lifted does the biden administration plan to appeal that ms psaki that would be an announcement made by the department of justice q and one more question just regarding that you know it seems that the biden administration has been challenged by the court several times on you know immigration efforts that they ve tried to overturn from the previous administration i guess what concerns does the administration have that this will continue as you know immigration is pretty much a pretty big policy you know that the biden administration and president biden himself has said that he would try to overturn some of these policies that were implemented under the previous administration i guess how does the president feel about some of these sort of roadblocks that the administration keeps hitting you know with judges and the courts not allowing or further delaying these ms psaki well i would say the biggest roadblock is the fact that the president put forward an immigration bill on his first day in office and we haven t been able to move it forward and there have been efforts to move it forward through the senate through the reconciliation process there have been efforts to try to engage in a way we re very open to engaging have been very open to engaging in a bipartisan way there are aspects of his proposal many aspects that should not be controversial at all you know the effort to invest in smarter security to fix our broken asylum processing system those are our biggest obstacles and what is deeply unfortunate is that the need to implement immigration reform to fix a very broken and outdated system has become so political that there s an unwillingness to engage from the other side on what solutions should be you know we can where we can work together on it it wasn t that long ago when there were bipartisan bills that were being discussed and even almost passing go ahead ed q yeah i want to build on josh s question here you know cpi inflation is 8 3 percent we know it s hard to get baby formula gas and diesel fuel is now at record prices again today house staffers are getting free peloton memberships a monmouth poll says ms psaki wow there s a lot packed into that list there you have laughter q yeah i know ms psaki i don t know how it s related it s a potpourri q okay it is potpourri and and it s a wider view a monmouth poll shows that 79 percent of americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction so my question is is the president as the head of the country as the head of the democratic party out of touch economically with americans ms psaki well there was a lot packed in there and i m not entirely sure the root of your question but i will do my best i would say first the president s top priority and you heard him say this the other day is addressing costs and addressing inflation for the american people and he laid out a specific plan to do exactly that and he has taken a number of steps that would to do exactly that including lowering the cost of the internet ensuring we re taking every step we can to bring down the cost of gas taking steps to ease the supply chain something he s been working on from his first day in office and he has proposed and advocated for and continue to fight for a reconciliation package that will lower significant costs for the american people i would say the contrast here is what the other side is offering which as you ve heard me say many times but it s worth repeating is a plan by chairman scott that would raise costs on a hundred on 75 million americans who make less than 100 000 so i would say for the american people what they can know and understand is we all agree inflation is an issue we all agree costs are too high the question is who has a plan to address it q but on gas specifically the interior secretary testified before the house appropriations committee that there was no plan to go forward with a five year plan for oil drilling in the gulf they need that plan in order to open up leases down the road for that we ve se we saw the department of interior cancel a lease sale so are there signals you know to bring down gas prices are there long term ms psaki well we know the department of interior made quite clear that they canceled the cook inlet project because there was a lack of industry interest that s not actually the issue the issue if we take a step back is that leasing and production offshore is a lengthier process taking up to 10 years mo second of the more than 10 9 million offshore acres currently under lease industry is not producing on 8 26 million acres that s 75 percent that is non producing of the 24 9 million onshore acres under lease industry is not producing 12 3 million that s almost 50 percent and there are almost 9 000 onshore permits the issue is not permits there are plenty of places for oil for oil companies to drill on they re not that is the issue go ahead q thank you jen ms psaki okay go ahead patsy q thank you jen thank you for your service and good luck for your next endeavor ms psaki thank you i have two questions on the u s asean summit as i understand there are no bilaterals scheduled with the president but he did have quick private time as we were told with each of the leaders i have two questions on that did the president use the opportunity for his private time to press indonesian president joko widodo to disinvite president putin from the g20 summit that s number one and number two which leader did he specifically press on human rights if any ms psaki the president never holds back in raising human rights issues i don t know how long these brief pull asides were so i don t know the range of topics that were discussed and certainly his publicly stated position is that we it should not be business as usual at the g20 which is six months away and that he does not and he believes that president putin should not be a part of that okay q just to follow up on the human rights though jen there s a lot of criticism coming out from human rights activists that the white house hasn t been strong enough in terms of condemning some of the human rights concerns in the southeast asian countries and you ve given out statements on the initiatives you ve given out statements on maritime security you know in terms of regional security maritime cooperation but nothing so far on human rights so how does the administration respond to that ms psaki i stated very clearly the other day on cambodia that we had had past concerns about human rights we have made those clear and we never hesitate to raise concerns about human rights when warranted q thank you jen ms psaki thank you everyone q we will miss you we will

patrick pleul picture alliance via getty images new york tesla ceo elon musk s 44 billion bid to purchase twitter struck an unexpected roadblock early friday morning when he tweeted that he had put the deal temporarily on hold citing concern over the prevalence of bot and spam accounts on the platform nearly two hours later musk assured observers that he remains committed to acquisition but damage had been done the price of twitter shares plunged friday closing more than 9 down market analysts said the worry over fake accounts could serve as a pretext for musk to bargain a lower price for the acquisition or abandon the effort altogether the share prices of both tesla and twitter have fallen in the weeks since musk reached a deal to purchase the social media platform on april 25 potentially making the acquisition less attractive for musk i believe he s still committed in theory probably at a lower price dan ives a managing director of equity research at wedbush an investment firm who closely follows the tech sector told abc news it starts to be a boy that cried wolf an unpredictable figure musk defies an easy assessment of his thinking but he has expressed concern over fake accounts on previous occasions on april 21 days before he reached the deal to acquire twitter musk tweeted if our twitter bid succeeds we will defeat the spam bots or die trying there are two main explanations for why musk could be worried about fake accounts first there is the threat they pose to the company s business model second there is their potential to undermine the credibility of the platform as a site of authentic discourse between real users twitter generates the vast majority of its revenue through advertising to users on the platform which means its business depends to a significant degree on the number of users who see the ads displayed by the company in the first quarter of this year the company reported 229 million users who accessed twitter on any given day on a platform on which they could be shown ads which amounted to a 15 9 increase from the same quarter a year ago the company reported 1 2 billion in revenue for the first quarter of this year of which 1 11 billion came from advertising if the number of spam or bot accounts on twitter is larger than the company has estimated then it could cut into that number of monetizable users and the amount of ad revenue they generate in turn that could damage twitter s bottom line an accurate estimate of the number of fake accounts is important given that establishing an accurate number of real tweeters is considered to be key to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site susannah streeter a senior investment and markets analyst at hargreaves lansdown told abc news in a statement in prior comments musk has stated another source of worry over bot accounts that centers on how they could undermine the role twitter plays as a de facto public town square as he has described it if twitter posts cannot be trusted as real remarks from actual human beings then the value of the discourse on the platform deteriorates there is so much potential with twitter to be the most trusted broadly inclusive forum in the world musk tweeted on may 3 that is why we must clear out bots spam scams is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts right now you can t tell he added in a follow up tweet minutes later public interest in fake accounts on social media platforms intensified in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election when it was found that russian operatives had used false accounts to spread misinformation on a massive scale in 2018 twitter escalated its efforts to remove fake or suspicious accounts suspending more than 70 million such accounts in may and june of that year the washington post reported that july for its part twitter has acknowledged the challenge of accurately estimating the number of fake accounts on the platform in the public filing this month in which it stated that fake accounts make up less than 5 of users twitter added a note of caution about the figure in making this determination we applied significant judgment so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated last month musk reached a deal to buy twitter at 54 20 a share which amounted to a 38 premium above where the share price stood before it was made public that musk had been purchasing company stock the securities and exchange commission is investigating musk over a delay in notifying regulators of a 9 2 stake in twitter he took earlier this year the wall street journal reported wednesday likewise the federal trade commission is reviewing the acquisition over the possible violation of an antitrust reporting rule ives the analyst at wedbush said the announcement from musk on friday puts the outcome of the acquisition in question this continues to be a circus show that really puts the deal in uncertainty he said the chances of a deal getting done is probably less than 50

america doesn t need a mind reader as president it needs a wall street journal reader per jim geraghty the journal had a story about the formula shortage back on january 12 advertisement did anyone in the white house read it at the time how many times is this administration going to find itself surprised by supply chain issues they dropped nearly 2 trillion last year on covid relief amid a supply crunch then were stunned that the whole country being flush with cash while goods are scarce might cause prices to rise now they re figuring out that when a major baby formula manufacturing plant got shut down three months ago at a moment when formula was already hard to find a serious shortage might result is seeing one move ahead on the chessboard too much to ask biden if we had been better mind readers i guess we could ve taken action to address the baby formula crisis sooner biden hadn t said one word in public about this crisis until today pic twitter com w3kfld3koo rnc research rncresearch may 13 2022 ed pointed out on twitter that the washington post and the journal were running stories about stores rationing baby formula fully a month ago what has the crack biden economic team been doing about it since then fair enough you might say but you have to admit there was no way the white house could have anticipated abbott s baby formula factory in michigan being shut down in february actually there was a way bloomberg revealed yesterday that the fda had concerns about possible contamination at the plant in september of last year advertisement the fda report obtained by bloomberg news through a freedom of information request shows that during a routine visit to abbott s sturgis michigan manufacturing facility in september inspectors determined that employees may have transferred contaminants including deadly cronobacter from surfaces to baby formula in one instance the report said records showed abbott detected cronobacter in a finished batch of formula that may have been tainted by a worker who touched a contaminated surface without changing gloves that batch wasn t distributed if a meaningful share of the u s baby formula supply runs through a single plant and safety concerns at that plant are raised portending a future recall that might be a moment to worry preemptively about a potential formula shortage no the story of the shortage is mostly a story about counterproductive federal regulations however the supply of formula was disrupted repeatedly during the pandemic due to sudden spikes and drop offs in demand writes derek thompson parents hoarded formula in the early days of covid causing companies to surge production then as the initial phase of the outbreak began to ease parents began working through their stockpiles leading to a decline in demand and a production slowdown then births began to tick up again generating new demand once again manufacturers were left scrambling to keep up that explains the baseline shortage in january i believe before the abbott shutdown cut domestic supply further and threw the country into crisis advertisement what takes this from bad to unforgivable are the fda regulations that have made european baby formula hard to get in the u s read elizabeth nolan brown s thread for some of the most depressing nuances one specious claim is that european formula isn t as nutritious as american formula when in some ways it s actually more nutritious european baby formula is also more likely to be organic derived from grass fed cows made w milk fat as opposed to plant based fats there are also more goat milk based and gentle options sold there than there are here elizabeth nolan brown enbrown may 13 2022 one study flagged by brown found that 15 of 16 european formulas tested met the fda s standards even if they hadn t no doubt many american parents would surely prefer to have an abundant supply of almost as good european formula to keep their babies fed for the next two months while abbott s plant gets back on line and up to speed and hey at least they don t have to worry about the european formula being contaminated with bacteria domestic production isn t always higher quality after all another obstacle is labeling yes really some formulas are off the market here not because of what s in them but because their labels aren t up to fda snuff eric boehm cites a case last year of the fda recalling more than 75 000 units of german formula because the package neglected to say that the product contained less than one milligram of iron per 100 calories advertisement on top of all that american parents are bedeviled by protectionism once foreign imports of baby formula cross a certain threshold tariffs kick in that render the products unprofitable choking off supply meanwhile thompson notes that the department of agriculture is the largest single purchaser of baby formula in the u s but limits its contracts to a small number of american manufacturers one of which is abbott if the department were more diversified if it purchased from canadian manufacturers as well for instance then one supplier going offline wouldn t create such a shock biden and the fda could have moved quickly to ease some of the regulations as soon as they heard of problems at the abbott plant anticipating the shortage to come as it is they re playing catch up the fda is promising action soon but without specifics us food and drug administration commissioner dr robert califf also said that the fda is working around the clock to get more formula to shelves and will announce plans next week to streamline formula imports though the commissioner didn t indicate exactly when formula stock would return to normal he wrote that the new and ongoing steps will help dramatically improve the supply in the u s in a matter of weeks what s stopping the white house from lifting the tariffs tomorrow what s stopping the fda from waiving the labeling restrictions however temporarily ron klain said this week that they re considering using the defense production act to boost domestic supply of formula but regulatory action to reduce barriers to trade would doubtless solve the problem more quickly what s the hold up i m sure european formula manufacturers are eager to make a buck here advertisement here s biden s new video showing him doing nothing particularly productive

drew angerer getty images washington the ongoing baby formula shortage with nearly half of products recently unavailable according to experts triggered a flurry of responses from washington this week as the biden administration and congress sought to address the public outcry there s nothing more urgent we re working on than that right now president joe biden said friday from the white house at an event that had been meant to tout public safety funding reflecting how the lack of formula has quickly overtaken other administration concerns criticism and dismay from parents grew ever sharper as families encountered more empty shelves with an estimated 43 of formula products out of stock as of sunday at stores across the u s according to tracking firm datasembly the shortage compounded by broader coronavirus related supply chain issues was worsened by a recall from abbott one of the nation s largest manufacturers of baby formula products the company pulled three of its popular brands in february and closed its plant in sturgis michigan in the wake of bacterial infections linked to two infants who died after consuming abbott formula and a food and drug administration inspection that documented problems at abbott s michigan facility including the same bacteria abbott maintains there is no evidence its products were connected to the babies deaths though it has acknowledged the infractions the fda found elsewhere at the plant a complaint against abbott was first filed in september but the fda didn t investigate the plant until approximately four months later now the biden administration is facing questions from republicans and others about how long problems may persist and what solutions are available to the public even as the government stresses its watchdog role in investigating abbott this is not a third world country rep elise stefanik a new york republican and a new mother said at a thursday gop news conference this should never happen in the united states responding to such criticism biden insisted friday that if we had been better mind readers we could ve but we moved as quickly as the problem became apparent to us we have to move with caution as well and speed the white house has not provided a timeline for when shelves will be restocked though press secretary jen psaki maintained thursday that the government has been working for months on this issue as they roll out new steps aimed at alleviating the problem among the fixes as psaki and biden then reiterated on friday was supporting the ability of parents to use benefits from the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also known as wic to buy formula abbott has agreed to provide rebates through august for wic users to buy other products the administration is also calling on federal and state officials to crack down on reports of potential price gouging the fda will announce next week ways that the u s can import more products from abroad it remains unclear how the imports would work given the fda s requirements on formula packaging and vitamin content though commissioner robert califf tweeted friday that the agency will ensure imported products meet certain safety quality and labeling standards biden said friday he believed the timeline for imports would be a matter of weeks or less the department of health and human services has also unveiled a new website where parents and caregivers can go to obtain information on where to find formula and other resources psaki said thursday the white house was considering every option including invoking the defense production act which gives the president substantial power over private industry but on friday psaki noted that the administration views the dpa as a potential long term solution our focus primarily is twofold one is increasing supply and the other is making it readily available she said meanwhile the democratic majority on capitol hill is launching investigations into the nationwide shortage the house oversight committee is demanding records from four major manufacturers we have asked for a briefing by the end of the month and we ve asked three basic questions do they have the supply to meet the demand is there a supply chain problem that can be corrected and what can we do to make sure this doesn t happen again chairwoman carolyn maloney d n y told abc news a group of 32 senate democrats on friday wrote a letter to urging the infant nutrition council of america an association of formula manufacturers to take immediate action to address the shortage though they didn t offer any specific steps the group can or should implement we are calling on you and your member companies to take immediate action and ensure that infant formula manufacturers are making every effort to mitigate this dangerous shortage and get children the nourishment they need the lawmakers wrote speaker nancy pelosi said friday the house of representatives intends to take legislative action as soon as next week voting on a bill that would grant emergency authority to the wic program to address supply disruptions and recalls by relaxing certain regulations senate republican leader mitch mcconnell addressed the shortage in his own floor speech on thursday calling it outrageous and unacceptable it seems that while president biden s administration and the fda have been asleep at the switch in terms of getting production back online as fast as possible he argued utah republican sen mitt romney penned his own letter to both the fda and united states department of agriculture earlier this week urging the agencies to protect infant health by ensuring they have access to safe formula and when crises arise to initiate contingency plans to mitigate shortages that risk the lives of infants across the nation house appropriations committee chair rosa delauro d conn announced wednesday her panel would examine the abbott plant in michigan where the bacteria was found and the fda s delayed response to this horrific incident delauro released a whistleblower complaint last month showing a former employee of abbot detailed concerns about alleged wrongdoing at the facility abbott said it could restart operations at its michigan facility within two weeks of getting the green light from the fda from there the company estimates it would take an additional six to eight weeks to get the product into stores but the fda said friday that abbott s plant still carried contamination risks as of march the plant remains closed as the company works to correct findings related to the processes procedures and conditions that the fda observed during its inspection of the facility from january 31 march 18 2022 which raised concerns that powdered infant formula produced at this facility prior to the fda s inspection carry a risk of contamination an fda official said abbott says they are working to address the fda s issues so they can resume operations we are confident that we can continue to produce safe high quality infant formula at all of our facilities as we have been doing for millions of babies around

elon musk puts twitter deal on hold over fake account details elon musk has said his 44bn deal to buy twitter is on hold after he queried the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform he said he was waiting for information supporting calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 of users musk added later that he was still committed to acquisition however analysts speculated he could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away from the takeover musk s tweets sent twitter s share price plunging 10 in morning trade in new york even before his comments the company s stock had been selling for less than the 54 20 per share musk has offered a sign that the markets were not convinced he would complete the buyout musk has been vocal about defeating the spam bots identifying it as a key goal following his planned takeover of the company twitter has long faced accusations of not doing enough to address automated fake accounts posting content in a filing more than two weeks ago twitter estimated that fake accounts accounted for fewer than 5 of its daily active users during the first three months of this year it cautioned that the figures were based on estimates and could be higher those claims were not different from what the firm had shared in previous disclosures the number of spam bots on the service is a key statistic as a higher than expected figure could hurt the ability to grow advertising revenue or paid for subscriptions said susannah streeter analyst at hargreaves lansdown but she said it was not clear how genuine musk s concerns were there will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover she said the 44bn price tag is huge and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform weeks of market turmoil in the us have wiped billions off the value of many companies including once favored tech firms tesla the electric car company where musk serves as chief executive has also seen its shares plunge a hit to musk whose status as the world s richest person is bound up in his stake in the company and who had planned to rely on his shares to help finance the twitter purchase after musk tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold tesla s share price gained more than 5 musk s latest move comes after an announcement that two twitter executives are leaving the social media company kayvon beykpour who led twitter s consumer division and bruce falck who oversaw revenue both tweeted on thursday that the departures were not their decisions from this week the firm also said it had paused most hiring except for business critical roles source bbc news story date may 14 2022

updated may 13 2022 at 4 25 pm et president biden said friday that the administration had moved as quickly as the problem of the national baby formula shortage became apparent his remarks came after the white house outlined steps being taken to ease the shortage the white house said states have been asked to boost accessibility of baby formula for wic recipients and the food and drug administration said it is looking at ways to make it easier to import baby formula if we had been better mind readers i guess we could ve done something about the shortage biden told reporters friday afternoon we moved as quickly as the problem became apparent to us he said we have to move with caution as well as speed because we got to make sure what we re getting is in fact first rate product that s why the fda has to go through the process the federal wic program which stands for special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children provides grants to states to support low income postpartum and pregnant women as well as infants and children as old as 5 who are at a nutritional risk the shortage follows abbott s voluntarily recall of some powdered baby formulas in february after four infants were hospitalized with bacterial infections abbott holds an expanse of contracts in the wic program with states territories and tribes that make up nearly half of all infants on the program according to a letter to from secretary of agriculture tom vilsack to abbott ceo robert ford in the letter dated friday vilsack urged abbott to take further action to support wic recipients white house press secretary jen psaki said abbott had committed to providing states with rebates through the end of august which will allow states to buy supply ahead of time from a variety of manufacturers rather than just the ones with which they have contracts this means that families on wic can purchase any available product in the months to come through august and states and retailers can plan ahead psaki said vilsack also sent a letter to states friday afternoon urging the adoption of all flexibilities in the wic program psaki said states were asked the same in february she added but not all states made the adjustment next week the u s house will consider a bill to grant emergency authority to the wic program to address supply chain disruptions and recalls house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said friday in a message to lawmakers that will let the government relax certain non safety related regulations she said pelosi also announced plans to consider an emergency appropriation to immediately address the infant formula shortage beyond the wic program psaki said president biden has spoken to formula retailers and manufacturers to understand how they can increase availability the fda is also taking steps to improve supply also on friday dr robert califf the food and drug administration s commissioner saidthe agency is working to bring as much infant formula to us shelves as quickly as possible he called it a top priority in a tweet on friday califf said the fda plans to announce plans next week that define how suppliers and manufacturers outside of the u s will bring products to america the agency will ensure the products are safe and appropriately labeled he added the fda is also working with manufacturers in the u s market such as mead johnson reckitt and nestlé gerber to increase formula production including for specialty products the average out of stock rate for baby formula at retailers across the country was 43 in early may according to data from the firm datasembly we believe these and other ongoing efforts will help dramatically improve the supply in the u s in a matter of weeks califf said our data indicates that in stock rates in retail stores are stabilizing but we continue to work around the clock to further increase availability parents can visit the u s department of health human services website for more information if they cannot find formula psaki said this work is far from over she added copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
tonight we need to talk about cryptocurrencies sometimes called digital currencies sometimes even called alt currencies these currencies are traded outside the banking system they have been developing their own digital ecosystem and yes their prices can fluctuate quite a bit of course we ve seen it recently just on a year to date basis the digital currency exchange company coinbase is off 72 the most widely traded alt currency bitcoin is down 37 another widely held is ethereum it s down 44 bitcoin s terrible week what happened according to surveys 16 of americans own cryptocurrencies quite an increase from the 1 who owned them in 2015 according to the pew foundation survey the coinbase exchange has 90 million people involved according to their documents overall there were 2 9 trillion worth of digital currencies in market circulation through november in november 2020 there were only 500 billion circulating so you can see this huge quantum leap one way or another in one form or another i think digital currencies are here to stay i would say first and foremost the issue of digital currencies is the fact that it s an internet thing it s internet based it s internet driven it s internet traded and at least at the moment it is not run by the federal reserve the treasury or other government regulators of the marketplace and that was always the spirit of the thing when it got started years back think of bitcoin as having a libertarian soul during the trump administration we talked and thought about digital assets one big debate was whether bitcoin for example is a currency in the classical sense of providing efficient transactions is it a commodity or is it just a plain investment currencies versus commodities versus investment labels would matter for regulatory purposes but none of these issues have been decided yet institutionally the federal reserve and the treasury staff have always disliked digital money because they can t control it and those folks like to control which is probably one of the biggest problems for our whole economy let alone alt currencies white house buried over tweet claiming there was no vaccine when biden took office delete this investors are very upset now because they have lost a lot of money in recent weeks and i get that and i feel their pain but a lot of risk assets have lost a lot of money in recent weeks the nasdaq is off 27 year to date consumer discretionary stocks have lost 29 telecom is down 27 infotech 25 want more well the semiconductor index is down 28 s p homebuilders is down 24 s p retail is down 29 jpmorgan chase is down 25 citigroup is down 23 goldman and bank of america are down 22 so with inflation rising and market interest rates going up and the federal reserve swearing on their bibles on a daily basis that they re going to drain liquidity from the inflated economy it s been a rough year no matter what you own whether you own bonds stocks leverage loans junk bonds bitcoin really outside of energy investing hasn t been that much fun this year so the digital currency world has been hit hard harder than other asset classes but you know as jimmy carter once said in his finest moment some things in life aren t fair when investors invest they should have their eyes wide open i hate to see anyone lose money but in a free market capitalist system it happens i m surprised joe biden hasn t blamed the high inflation crisis and his collapsing poll numbers on bitcoin it s about the only thing he s left out of his laundry list biden admin announces measures to address baby formula shortage i m going to bet that the radical progressives in his administration will oppose digital currencies and try to control them and regulate them to death just the way those progressive central planners and big government socialists want to regulate and control everything else in the economy that s my hunch finally i think there will be some movement for more transparency in the digital currency world particularly the exchange companies although they are already covered by the sec investors will want to know more about reserves behind these companies and capitalization behind these companies and will look for some standardization in their accounting and their reporting now that could be done voluntarily by the digital currency people themselves there s an interesting thought in our banking system remember the fdic provides 250 000 to guarantee deposits and sipc guarantees 500 000 i doubt if digital currencies or their exchanges will get anything like that protection in the foreseeable future and frankly that suits me just fine click here to get the fox news app the interesting final thought for me is you know gee whiz you know the dollar if it were really king dollar if it were really backed by a reliable standard of value if we really knew our central bank was keen on defending the value and purchasing power of our dollars if we really embraced king dollar then this alt currency movement might not have grown up quite so fast then again the inflation wouldn t be so high and the risk of the economy sinking wouldn t be so high just saying so folks live a little take a couple risks in life digital currencies might be one of them this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the may 13 2022 edition of kudlow

the department for transport wants to trim the ss richard montgomery masts as it is feared they could fall on to the shipwreck below and cause a detonation 77 year old wreck ss richard montgomery is monitored and there is an exclusion zone around it but it is not far from the main shipping lanes into the capital the department for transport dft wants to trim the masts as it is feared they could fall on to the ship below and cause a detonation it follows remedial work to trim the rigging and such from the masts above the water line in october 1999 which was carried out with the aim of reducing stress levels businesses have been told the masts will go in june a dft spokesperson said we continue to monitor the wreck of the ss richard montgomery closely and it is understood that it is in a relatively stable condition expert wreck assessors are now undertaking detailed surveys which will inform future work to reduce the height of the masts professor david alexander from university college london is an expert in risk and disaster reduction and has studied the ss richard montgomery in detail he told pbo the dft spokesperson was right the wreck is in a relatively stable condition emphasis on relatively five years ago the surveyors gave it between eight and 20 years before it starts to disintegrate seriously liberty ships were made with low grade steel and slapdash welding expendable ships that were easily sunk in the atlantic by u boats mild steel deteriorates over time in cold water why not just remove the explosives professor alexander thinks it is time the authorities removed the explosives although he admitted the work would not be cheap not least because there s only one company in the world that could do that smit of the netherlands and would probably need robots he said in the worst case scenario or top event there could be a very small tsunami as a result of a pressure wave but there is not enough depth of water to generate a large one or so i believe other events might include smaller but sporadic explosions and an ungovernable situation if a liquefied natural gas carrier were to plough into the montgomery then all hell would break loose nevertheless a top event is not inevitable that said the blast effect on the nearby isle of grain could be spectacular masts pose a hazard regarding the masts professor alexander added if the support structures disintegrate the heavy masts could sink through the decking and compress the bombs in the holds it is not known how many of the bombs are fused regarding the salvage and clear up professor alexander said salvage has been resisted so far because it is argued that the population of the isle of sheppey would have to be evacuated for up to a year with one set of bridges by the way emergency response on sheppey would not be easy i think it could be done by building temporary blast walls on sheppey and grain and restricting the movement of people on the island the salvage would be made complex by the different types of bombs and their condition after 77 years meanwhile the wreck is disintegrating ss richard montgomery s history the ss richard montgomery was a us liberty ship of 7146 gross tons she was built in 1943 by the st john s river shipbuilding company of jacksonville florida and was one of more than 2 700 of these mass produced vessels built to carry vital supplies for the war effort in august 1944 the ship was loaded with a cargo of some 7000 tons of munitions and joined convoy hx 301 bound for the uk and then on to cherbourg on arrival in the thames estuary the vessel was directed to anchor in the great nore anchorage off sheerness the ship was to await the formation of a convoy to continue the journey across the channel however on the 20 august 1944 she dragged her anchor in the shallow water and grounded on a sandbank running east from the isle of grain approximately 250 metres north of the medway approach channel the vessel grounded amidships on the crest of the sandbank intensive efforts began to unload her cargo unfortunately by the next day a crack appeared in the hull and the forward end began to flood the salvage effort continued until the 25 september by which time approximately half of the cargo had been successfully removed the salvage effort had to be abandoned when the vessel finally flooded completely the wreck of the ss richard montgomery remains on the sandbank where she sank the wreck lies across the tide close to the medway approach channel and her masts are clearly visible above the water at all states of the tide there are still approximately 1 400 tons of explosives contained within the forward holds wreck co ordinates the wreck is designated under section 2 of the protection of wrecks act 1973 which means that there is a no entry exclusion zone around it the wreck is clearly marked on the relevant admiralty charts the exclusion zone is defined by the following co ordinates 51 28 04 n 00 47 12 e 51 27 57 n 00 47 22 e 51 27 50 n 00 47 11 e 51 27 58 n 00 47 01 e medway ports is contracted by the maritime and coastguard agency mca to mark and guard the wreck this includes the provision and maintenance of warning notices on the wreck which are fastened to the masts medway ports is also contracted to provide and maintain a circle of buoys around the wreck to ensure that shipping avoids the area the wreck is also under 24 hour radar surveillance by medway ports medway ports whose operations room is within sight of the wreck provide a first line of response to any incursions within

sacramento calif ap california gov gavin newsom on friday pledged to use the state s record breaking 300 billion budget including an unprecedented nearly 100 billion surplus to future proof the state from the impacts of a volatile midterm election cycle that he fears will undermine abortion access gun safety and privacy protections across the country the first term governor of the nation s most populous state and a potential democratic presidential candidate used his budget presentation on friday to prop up his progressive credentials while attacking his rivals in conservative states he trumpeted major increases in spending on health care education child care and the environment while also pledging to spend 125 million to make it easier for women to get abortions in california including those from other states with the u s supreme court poised to possibly overturn roe v wade next month newsom pointed to a sign displaying california s lower covid 19 death rate compared to the republican led states of florida texas and arizona all of which are expected to further restrict or outlaw abortions if the court overturns roe newsom instituted the nation s first statewide coronavirus stay home order and many credit his aggressive actions throughout the pandemic with saving lives critics say he overreached and worsened the economic harm if you re pro life how the hell is this possible newsom said of the higher death rates in the three states that used a more hands off approach during the pandemic spare me their mantra on being pro life they don t deserve that status the sign at newsom s presentation referred to how california compared to the most populous states texas is no 2 followed by florida but arizona is no 14 the no 4 state is democratic led strongly in favor of abortion rights new york whose covid death rate is higher than texas and comparable to florida bryan griffin deputy press secretary for florida gov ron desantis disputed newsom s assertion arguing that in an appropriately adjusted format florida has fared about as well as california with covid but still preserved the personal liberties of its citizens and didn t destroy a litany of small businesses in the process california s projected 97 5 billion budget surplus is unlike anything seen before at the state level and is fueled by soaring tax revenue it is larger than the entire operating budgets of nearly every other state the unceasing flow of tax money prompted california republicans who don t have enough numbers in the state legislature to have much influence to complain about high taxes reducing quality of life he did not propose any permanent tax relief to deal with a worsening affordability crisis exacerbated by his policies said republican vince fong vice chair of the assembly budget committee the governor may not want to acknowledge it but california is in crisis and his budget is unsustainable newsom said the surging revenues are a sign of how well a number of people are doing in this economy and a reflection of the concentration of wealth and success in the hands of a few roughly half of california s income tax collections come from the top 1 of earners who have fared well during the pandemic that system makes the state more vulnerable than others to the booms and busts of the economy capital gains the increase in value of assets such as stocks and other investments where most wealthy people derive their wealth accounted for 9 7 of california s personal income that s the second highest ever recorded behind the year 2000 that was just before the dot com bubble burst and ushered in a recession the newsom administration said that could be a sign the economy is about to slow down again also citing uncertainties caused by the war in ukraine supply chain issues and recent actions by the federal reserve to combat runaway inflation it projects capital gains revenue will drop by 22 next year newsom s proposal would leave the state with 37 1 billion in reserves while using nearly all of its surplus on things that are not recurring expenses one of his biggest proposals is to return 18 1 billion to taxpayers in the form of tax rebates and programs that offer assistance with rent utility bills and health insurance premiums with gas prices reaching a record high in march newsom has suggested suspending the state tax on diesel fuel offering rebates of up to 800 for every person with registered vehicles in the state and spending 750 million to give everyone free rides on public transportation for three months but that proposal has gone nowhere in the state legislature where democratic leaders favor of a narrower relief package that would only target low to moderate income families newsom insisted the two sides will come to an agreement to get checks out later this year republicans argue the state should instead temporarily suspend its gas tax which at 51 1 cents per gallon is the highest in the nation the governor is living in an election year fantasyland if he believes promises of debit cards and rebates in the fall will provide relief now senate republican leader scott wilk said newsom s budget presentation comes as the state is in the throes of a deepening drought and as state energy officials warn of possible power shortages during the summer when air conditioning is at its peak the governor has called for people to cut their water use by 15 but consumption went up dramatically in march newsom wants to spend more money to encourage conservation provide loans to struggling drinking water systems and boost water recycling it includes 75 million for grants to farms and businesses hurt by drought meanwhile he s calling for 5 billion to create a 5 000 megawatt strategic reserve of energy to help the state avoid blackouts one megawatt can power 750 to 1 000 homes newsom s budget document included limited details on how that reserve would be built but he has indicated he s open to the possibility of keeping the diablo canyon nuclear facility online past its planned closure in 2025 as well as some gas fired power plants that are set to retire the budget plan must be approved by the legislature and takes effect july 1 copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

into this breach stepped a handful of scholars including philip edward mosely the man who would become the most influential sovietologist of the cold war he lacked the name recognition and elegant writing style of the diplomat george kennan whose 1947 x article introduced the concept of containment to the world nor could he rival the publication record and scholarly reputation of harvard professor merle fainsod whose 1953 book how russia is ruled introduced generations of readers to soviet politics and mosely was nowhere near as colorful a character as the economic historian alexander gerschenkron whose 1952 essay on economic backwardness remains a subject of debate into the twenty first century mosely s contributions to the development of soviet studies have received little attention but in a field of study that emphasized its practical application to policymaking no one else was so adept at working the lines of influence and power that connected america s campuses and its capital mosely did more than anyone to underwrite the achievements of soviet studies in the 1950s as well as its explosive growth in the 1960s thanks to the institutions he created and led soviet studies went from scholarly backwater to intellectual juggernaut in a matter of years scholars in the field published dozens of books that peeked inside the soviet enigma they also trained hundreds of other experts to do the same sitting at the intersection of scholarship intelligence and philanthropy mosely created a field in which practitioners like himself could imagine as secretary of state william p rogers noted no line between government and academic work in the process though mosely set the field up for the controversies that wracked it in the years before his death in 1972 in other words he put sovietology on a collision course with that phenomenon generally known as the sixties mosely was raised in the town of westfield massachusetts in the 1910s for a determined cold warrior he had surprisingly liberal views in his youth much later he would regale a former student about his trip to celebrate the release of socialist eugene victor debs from prison in 1921 perhaps it was politics that got young mosely interested in russia or perhaps it was his chance encounter with a russian immigrant on a trip to the library in springfield in any case mosely studied russian with a tutor until leaving for harvard at the age of sixteen after completing his bachelor s degree he began graduate study in history writing a dissertation on russian diplomacy in the 1830s perhaps most crucial for his future career was a two year stint in moscow for dissertation research mosely s moscow years 1930 to 1932 coincided with the immense and rapid changes of the first five year plan stalin s program of forced draft industrialization in the name of building socialism moscow teemed with people from the countryside basic goods were in short supply and small private enterprise was eradicated in favor of rationing mosely worked in government archives meanwhile scavenging food and supplies through networks of friends a process no doubt aided by his marriage to a russian woman his soviet sojourn left a deep impression on mosely visible in letters home they movingly describe the difficulties of everyday life as well as enthusiasm for the promises of a brighter future mosely repeated the praise for the ussr typical of sympathetic american journalists like louis fischer whom he knew well even as the show trials and purges accelerated for instance mosely called the ussr a defender of peace and praised its social welfare programs photo caption philip e mosely left confers with fred stolling associate editor of current digest of the soviet press in 1953 courtesy columbia university archives photo caption philip e mosely left confers with fred stolling associate editor of current digest of the soviet press in 1953 courtesy columbia university archives this assessment of the ussr was no doubt shared by other american members of the institute for pacific relations an organization that brought together scholars missionaries and business people interested in asia the organization grew increasingly interested in the ussr in the 1930s an interest justified by the soviet union s pacific coastline the real interest though was political as the institute s american members included a handful of communists and many others sympathetic to the soviet cause after a prolonged itinerancy which included a social science research council ssrc fellowship in the balkans mosely landed at cornell university in 1936 he immediately demonstrated entrepreneurial zeal winning a rockefeller foundation grant to expand russian studies and serving as secretary of the committee on slavic studies of the american council of learned societies acls over the next decade mosely would help steer rockefeller ssrc and acls work toward the new enterprise of area studies the transformation of american academic life during world war ii would turn mosely and many other ambitious and talented scholars from a grant recipient into a grant maker and from a diplomatic historian into a diplomat the arrival of world war ii offered remarkable opportunities even before pearl harbor mosely joined a program of the council on foreign relations to conduct confidential studies on strategic issues after the german invasion of the ussr in june 1941 he organized cornell s intensive program in russian arguing that it would enable the government to meet its rapidly expanding need for men able to use russian the program introduced a number of future sovietologists including political scientist robert tucker and sociologist alex inkeles to the russian language mosely also helped the institute for pacific relations add some two dozen other languages in the process providing the basis for army and navy programs designed to prepare soldiers for occupation of foreign countries these military programs would train dozens of future experts including historians martin malia and richard pipes as well as numerous social scientists after three years of commuting from ithaca to new york and washington mosely abandoned his university post for full time government work he served in a dizzying succession of state department posts related to wartime diplomacy and increasingly planning for the peace as postwar topics became the subject of diplomatic negotiations mosely accompanied the secretary of state to conferences in paris moscow and potsdam calling for allied cooperation in war and peace as american policy makers debated the shape of postwar europe mosely found himself more open to cooperation with the ussr than many of his colleagues looking back at these discussions mosely ruefully noted that the policies he promoted provided the only real chance for postwar western soviet cooperation but that other policies had prevailed mosely s entry into high diplomacy hardly slowed his academic work he participated in two rockefeller foundation conferences that outlined the work of area studies connecting scholarship training and national needs rather than bring scholars together by discipline it would unite those interested in a particular world region a hallmark of the area programs was their direct relevance to government officials fighting the war and planning the peace area studies was a product of a network of philanthropists scholars and diplomats who planned the enterprise during world war ii and built it in the decade or so afterwards mosely knew everyone in that network and was active in all three spheres simultaneously working at the state department editing the british journal in exile slavonic and east european review and consulting for the rockefeller foundation he promised to join the rockefeller foundation at war s end but instead took a job at one of its major postwar ventures the russian institute at columbia university at geroid robinson s invitation mosely came to columbia to teach soviet international relations and held an appointment in the political science department but his work despite his departmental affiliation did not stay within either his adopted discipline or his original one history like others of his generation whose ties to scholarship were weaker than their ties to diplomacy he published articles frequently in foreign affairs but rarely in political science quarterly his articles evinced little sympathy for the ussr but were hardly calls to arms in 1948 he called on the united states to restrain its conflicts with the soviet union and hoped instead for peace by mutual toleration though the sovietization of eastern europe and the expansion of soviet influence in asia led mosely to abandon those hopes in the 1950s he still insisted that there were important opportunities for postwar amity that fell victim to western disorganization photo caption mosely right

background as geroid tanquary robinson the russian institute s first director addresses students in the mid 1940s rockefeller archive center even before succeeding robinson as director of the russian institute in 1951 mosely wielded his influence over soviet studies by building a russian or is that russianist empire at columbia insisting that soviet studies could best serve the national interest if it was centrally coordinated mosely helped establish the joint committee on slavic studies jcss a combined effort of the acls and ssrc serving as its founding chair mosely presided over what amounted to the sovietology s politburo the committee s work consisted of heavy lifting rather than high politics at a time when no american scholars could visit the ussr the only one there in the 1940s was robert tucker who spent seven years waiting for soviet authorities to grant an exit visa to his wife evgeniia the primary job of the committee was to develop sources in 1953 for instance the year of stalin s death its big concern was soviet periodicals the committee had to sort out which american libraries should hold which of the dozens of journals and newspapers like izvestiia and pravda and how to keep them safe from overeager american postal inspectors the joint committee spent 1956 the year that nikita khrushchev denounced stalin in his headline making secret speech organizing a microfilm version of library of congress holdings and sending a young historian martin malia to arrange book buying deals with soviet publishers they spent plenty of time and tens probably hundreds of thousands of dollars organizing the current digest of the soviet press a translation service that never broke even and survived on secret but well known cia subsidies the infrastructure built by the joint committee made possible scholarship on an otherwise inaccessible country in addition to leading and hosting the joint committee and its current digest mosely branched into new territory after witnessing the failure of kennan s effort together with the cia to resettle russian émigré scholars in a washington based eurasian institute he built a successor organization housed at columbia the research program on the ussr received ford foundation monies channeled through the east european fund on whose board coincidentally mosely served and paid émigré scholars and former government officials to write monographs in english or russian about their experiences administered by alexander dallin coincidentally mosely s student and later one of the most prominent students of soviet politics the program sought to produce primary sources about soviet life while also offering financial support to émigrés these apparent coincidences of course demonstrate perfectly mosely s style as an organizer mosely s interest in émigrés long predated the cia s proposed eurasian institute his professor at harvard michael karpovich was the hub of the american branch of émigré russians through karpovich mosely met boris bakhmeteff a wealthy engineer who was the last russian ambassador in washington before the bolshevik takeover together the three men gathered the papers of russian émigrés and deposited them at columbia s library creating the core of what would later become the bakhmeteff archive a remarkable collection of materials about the cultural intellectual and political life of russia before 1917 and that of its exiles afterward again mosely used his connections to help expand the base of sources available to scholars of russia and the ussr these activities though not well remembered today are easily documented harder to trace are mosely s continuing connections to government agencies in the early cold war both to promote soviet studies and to advise on policy nevertheless a record of declassified documents scattered across government archives shows just how hard mosely worked to make soviet studies useful to government and vice versa his interest in obtaining sources for instance led mosely to a treasure trove of soviet party documents that the germans had taken from smolensk in 1941 and the american army had taken from berlin in 1945 the smolensk records along with a much larger set of official nazi records passed through the american national security apparatus indeed the materials were used in a rare example of interservice cooperation by army and air force intelligence the cia and the rand corporation by 1954 a white house committee was ready to dispose of the materials when mosely stepped in to ensure their continued use indeed work on the documents was known internally as the special mosely project it was mosely who suggested that fainsod be the first to work with the materials and who called for the smolensk records to be made available at the national archives while mosely put government in the service of scholarship as with the smolensk materials he more often served government he spent a good portion of the winter break in 1952 on an official american delegation to yugoslavia he also served on the secret white house exercise operation solarium that shaped eisenhower s defense strategy the so called new look favored nuclear deterrence over larger and more expensive conventional forces mosely was not of course solely responsible for new look but his involvement in this white house exercise joined by diplomats including kennan and admirals indicates the circles in which he traveled the best evidence of mosely s classified connections comes from a security investigation in 1954 shortly after mosely had moved from columbia to the council on foreign relations where he became director of studies the episode offers a snapshot of what would later be called the foreign policy establishment in the early cold war mosely learned in january that his security clearances had been revoked primarily because of his prior membership in the institute for pacific relations a target of senator joseph mccarthy and others at the time mosely held top secret clearances at nine government agencies including the white house s national security council for solarium cia state department office of naval research which funded his work with an old friend the anthropologist margaret mead and elsewhere in response to the denial of clearance mosely and his lawyers gathered a docket of fifty some affidavits from family members a dozen ambassadors and a similar number of intelligence officers the affiants revealed their strong support for mosely as well as something of their own worldviews kennan the father of containment wrote that the inquisition into mosely plays directly into communist hands while blueblood editor hamilton fish armstrong who identified himself as a seventh generation american vouched for mosely s old new england stock whether it was based on mosely s politics his value to the government or his lineage the affidavits worked his clearances were reinstated after six months the clearance episode reveals a great deal about mosely the extent of his government work the reach and prominence of his contacts and of course the dangers of past associations even for cold war insiders yet his enthusiasm for government academic relations remained unshaken as he maintained his consulting relationships for decades afterward and made his move to the council on foreign relations it is hardly a surprise that so many of his columbia students most prominently dallin and marshall shulman were frequent consultants on government projects the council job played to one of mosley s great strengths bringing scholars and government officials together in formal and informal settings mosely was a key figure behind an effort to expand these informal conversations to include soviet as well as american experts and diplomats the so called dartmouth conferences of the 1960s continued a form of the engagement that mosely had been promoting since the 1940s bringing together mid level government officials and scientists in an informal setting as the conferences did helped pave the way for superpower arms control agreements in the 1960s in other ways too mosely and his generation of sovietologists helped keep the cold war cold research projects supported by mosely s friends in the national security apparatus undermined public and political assumptions that the communist party was an all powerful force ruling over an atomized population that was waiting for an outside power to unshackle it operation solarium rolled back u s efforts to challenge directly soviet power in eastern europe the smolensk project underscored the limits of the kremlin s reach even within the ussr and a major air force project at harvard university one of the few that mosely didn t advise concluded that the soviet system was relatively stable and that potential american invaders would not be greeted as liberators especially in the early 1950s when american rhetoric was at its most confrontational professional sovietologists like mosely were a moderating force this model of soviet studies worked for mosely and for his generation thanks to their efforts to obtain both sources and funding scholars of what churchill called riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma produced remarkable works on the history culture and politics of america s cold war adversary the major supporters were all familiar to mosely the rockefeller foundation which supported columbia and other graduate programs in soviet studies the newly ambitious ford foundation with mosely as an adviser which established academic exchanges with the ussr the joint committee on slavic studies which mosely chaired which promoted the field through grants and the office of education which mosely advised which funded area studies programs after the passage of the national defense education act in 1958 photo caption mosely right accompanies robinson the recipient of an honorary law doctorate at columbia university s commencement in june 1967 courtesy columbia university archives photo caption mosely right accompanies robinson the recipient of an honorary law doctorate at columbia university s commencement in june 1967 courtesy columbia university archives mosely s vision of soviet studies closely tied to national security interests loosely connected to academic disciplines and centrally administered by a self selected network of scholars heavily weighted with columbia and harvard men did not survive his lifetime the field s rapid growth soon met with a democratizing impulse as a new national membership organization the american association for the advancement of slavic studies took over some joint committee tasks the organization still in existence will change its name in 2010 scholarly exchange which mosely first proposed to the soviet foreign ministry in 1943 came under attack in the 1960s the exchange program met with increasing controversy in the american academy in what amounted to a generational divide students and young faculty chafed at the ways in which the american exchange organizers closely supervised their personal lives and resented the involvement of the state department for reasons both political and professional a new generation of scholars rejected the field s direct involvement in foreign policy increasingly critical of american policy in vietnam and elsewhere many young scholars rebelled against what they saw as government incursions into academic life others preferred to contribute to disciplinary journals rather than policy debates in doing so ironically they benefited handily from the scholarly exchanges that mosely promoted as well as sources like the smolensk documents and the bakhmeteff archive that mosely helped organize for all of his insights about the ussr and his renewed work in teaching he had returned to columbia in 1963 mosely did not fathom these changes in an essay published in 1967 as conflicts brewed on campuses all over the country mosely praised scholars for their impact on affairs of state five years later upon mosely s death came secretary rogers s praise that mosely did not distinguish between academic and government work undoubtedly an exaggeration it nevertheless reflected mosely s long standing commitment forged during world war ii to serve mars and minerva the gods of war and wisdom yet by 1972 such sentiments were hotly controversial mosely s accomplishments were many he brought together disparate groups to forge a field that shaped foreign policy and academic life for almost three decades he helped hundreds of students giving many of them more attention than they received from their ostensible advisers he aided russian émigré scholars

patrick pleul picture alliance via getty images new york tesla ceo elon musk s 44 billion bid to purchase twitter struck an unexpected roadblock early friday morning when he tweeted that he had put

damage had been done the price of twitter shares plunged friday closing more than 9 down market analysts said the worry over fake accounts could serve as a pretext for musk to bargain a lower price

bloomberg this week s undoing of the terrausd algorithmic stablecoin and its sister token luna has ramifications for all of crypto first there s the immediate impact the rapid collapse of a once popular pair of cryptocurrencies sent a ripple effect across the industry contributing to plummeting coin prices that wiped hundreds of billions of market value from the digital asset market and stoked worries over the potential fragility of digital asset ventures then there are the knock on effects in addition to delivering punishing losses to individual users and investment firms the spectacular failure of a market darling like terra threatens to have a cooling effect on the fundraisings that have jacked up crypto startups valuations in recent years venture capitalists who have long been some of the industry s biggest cheerleaders may not have quite the same risk tolerance now especially those directly caught in the crossfire it s something the scale of which crypto has really never seen in terms of a top five project just absolutely imploding said matt walsh founding partner of castle island ventures a blockchain focused vc firm almost 45 billion evaporated from the market caps of terrausd known as ust and luna over the course of a week according to coingecko there were some winners in this scenario like the investment firms including f9 research that shorted terrausd known as ust stablecoins backed by reserves rather than algorithms also came off looking like better options but it s the losses from these bruising past few days that will resonate read more everything broke terra goes from defi darling to death spiral individual holders of ust and luna the token that s part of the peg mechanism for the algorithmic stablecoin are now deeply in the red the biggest losers from all of this will be retail that didn t understand the risks they were taking said kyle samani co founder and managing partner at crypto vc firm multicoin capital other losers include the venture capitalists and investment firms that have backed terraform labs the startup behind ust and luna foundation guard the nonprofit managing the luna token galaxy digital holdings ltd pantera capital and lightspeed venture partners invested in terraform s last 150 million fundraise in july while jump crypto and three arrows capital participated in a 1 billion sale of luna tokens in february these backers who once hoped that their investments would deliver massive returns instead found themselves being solicited to prop up ust and luna in a 1 5 billion backstop in essence they were asked to put their money where their mouth is a test of whether these institutions actually believe in what they re investing said billy dishman investment and research analyst at crypto vc firm coinfund so far they haven t shown much interest terraform labs is working on another contingency plan in which ownership of the blockchain network would be distributed to investors according to a blog entry posted friday that was attributed to co founder do kwon investors and startups with no direct connection to ust are also finding themselves on unsteady ground chris mccann and edith yeung general partners at race capital a vc firm that focuses on early stage crypto startups have heard of deals falling apart or being repriced and said that founders are getting ghosted by potential investors they re urging their portfolio companies to take caution and ensure that the funds they ve raised so far are in fiat not crypto if you re in the middle of a fundraise period close it mccann added if you re not don t do it now now s not the time yeung said she also has a playbook in case a portfolio company finds itself in crisis she said part of race s strategy is to find a better way for founders to communicate lengthy twitter threads have the potential to spur rumors and spread discord i have a blog post template ready to go she said it s kind of silly but it s happened now so many times now downstream impact castle island ventures walsh said that later stage companies are more likely to see valuation hits as they raise more funds because of their proximity to public markets where stocks like coinbase global inc have plummeted coinbase stock slumped 35 this week and ended the week with a market value of 15 billion coinbase trading at 17 to 18 billion market cap that s going to have a downstream impact on the venture community in the crypto space walsh said in an interview this will eventually trickle down to the seed stage where newer crypto startups could take valuation cuts walsh added he said that there also could be a shift in the types of firms investing in crypto noting that a lot of of traditional funds have gotten more interested in the industry in the last year there s a question of are some of those funds just tourists that in the bear market back away walsh said traditional take dana stalder a general partner at tech vc firm matrix partners said it s important to note that it s not just cryptocurrencies caught in a downturn tech stocks are struggling as well there s a flight to safety out of the equity asset class stalder said in an interview the firm is still excited about its investment in crypto startup lightspark which it announced thursday the company was founded by david marcus who left meta platforms inc last year after overseeing its crypto efforts lightspark is building infrastructure to help support payments for bitcoin which traded at less 30 000 as of friday evening in new york and is down more than 25 over the past 30 days i don t think this cycle will have any impact on what the lightspark team is building it is a very long play he said peter fenton a general partner at benchmark said that there will likely be a slowdown in crypto investing as many vc firms were likely playing out of their winnings and using returns from previous crypto investments to fund new ones in the space however his firm which has already backed crypto startups chainalysis and sorare is still committed fenton said benchmark plans to pursue three to five crypto investments a year because it still has confidence in the industry and its startups people forget that google s best financings were done in really the worst venture years he said 2022 bloomberg l p

drew angerer getty images washington president joe biden on friday defended his administration s response to an ongoing baby formula shortage that has triggered public outcry from parents lawmakers and drawn republican fire there s nothing more urgent we re working on than that right now and i think we re going to be making some significant progress very shortly biden said from the white house at an event that had been meant to tout public safety funding reflecting how the lack of formula has quickly overtaken other administration concerns biden dismissed growing criticism that the white house was too slow to respond to the nationwide shortage that had been building for months telling reporters if we had been better mind readers i guess we could ve but we moved as quickly as the problem became apparent to us complaints from families grew increasingly desperate this week as they encountered more empty shelves with an estimated 43 of formula products out of stock as of sunday at stores across the u s according to tracking firm datasembly biden on friday reiterated the efforts already announced by the white house to alleviate supply issues including expanding access to baby formula for recipients of the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also known as wic and a new government website to provide information to caregivers biden also he believes more formula could be getting on the shelves in a matter of weeks or less as the food and drug administration scrambles to find a way to relax restrictions in order to allow more formula to be imported from abroad the fda is expected to detail their plan for imports next week it remains unclear how the imports would work given the agency s requirements on formula packaging and vitamin content though commissioner robert califf tweeted friday that the agency will ensure imported products meet certain safety quality and labeling standards we have to move with caution as well as speed because we got to make sure what we are getting is in fact first rate products biden said that s why the fda has to go through the process the shortage compounded by broader coronavirus related supply chain issues was worsened by a recall from abbott one of the nation s largest manufacturers of baby formula products the company pulled three of its popular brands in february and closed its plant in sturgis michigan in the wake of bacterial infections linked to two infants who died after consuming abbott formula and a food and drug administration inspection that documented problems at abbott s michigan facility including the same bacteria abbott maintains there is no evidence its products were connected to the babies deaths though it has acknowledged the infractions the fda found elsewhere at the plant a complaint against abbott was first filed in september but the fda didn t investigate the plant until approximately four months later republicans haven t missed a beat in laying the blame on the biden white house holding a press conference on thursday to speak out on the issue this is not a third world country rep elise stefanik a new york republican and a new mother said at the press event this should never happen in the united states senate republican leader mitch mcconnell addressed the shortage in his own floor speech on thursday calling it outrageous and unacceptable it seems that while president biden s administration and the fda have been asleep at the switch in terms of getting production back online as fast as possible he argued meanwhile the democratic majority on capitol hill is launching their own investigations the house oversight committee is demanding records from four major formula manufacturers we have asked for a briefing by the end of the month and we ve asked three basic questions do they have the supply to meet the demand is there a supply chain problem that can be corrected and what can we do to make sure this doesn t happen again chairwoman carolyn maloney d n y told abc news a group of 32 senate democrats on friday wrote a letter urging the infant nutrition council of america an association of formula manufacturers to take immediate action to address the shortage though they didn t offer any specific steps the group can or should implement we are calling on you and your member companies to take immediate action and ensure that infant formula manufacturers are making every effort to mitigate this dangerous shortage and get children the nourishment they need the lawmakers wrote house appropriations committee chair rosa delauro d conn announced wednesday her panel would examine the abbott plant in michigan where the bacteria was found and the fda s delayed response to this horrific incident delauro released a whistleblower complaint last month showing a former employee of abbot detailed concerns about alleged wrongdoing at the facility abbott said it could restart operations at its michigan facility within two weeks of getting the green light from the fda from there the company estimates it would take an additional six to eight weeks to get the product into stores but the fda said friday that abbott s plant still carried contamination risks as of march the plant remains closed as the company works to correct findings related to the processes procedures and conditions that the fda observed during its inspection of the facility from january 31 march 18 2022 which raised concerns that powdered infant formula produced at this facility prior to the fda s inspection carry a risk of contamination an fda official said abbott says they are working to address the fda s issues so they can resume operations we are confident that we can continue to produce safe high quality infant formula at all of our facilities as we have been doing for millions of babies around the world for decades the company said in a statement on friday abc news anne flaherty mariam khan molly nagle and allison pecorin contributed to this report copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved
three months after abbott laboratories recalled some of its top name brands of baby formula over concerns some of the formula may have been contaminated with harmful bacteria the company s michigan plant is still shut down many parents are struggling to find their baby s formula pediatrician jennifer shu offered some tips that might help first dr shu says check your neighborhood and social media groups for other moms who may have extra infant formula to share also she says reach out to your pediatrician or your baby s birth hospital or local wic office they may have formula samples or extra supplies that can tide you over until you can find more formula dr shu also recommends checking smaller stores pharmacies even convenience stores to see if they have formula switching to a store brand formula may also help dr shu recommends bringing a can of your formula with you and checking ingredient labels to find a formula nutritionally comparable to the one you were using a baby formula display shelf is seen at a walmart grocery store in orlando stores across the united states have struggled to stock enough baby formula paul hennessy sopa images lightrocket via getty images expand if you cannot find formula at local store she says consider buying it online through well known chains like costco or walmart if your baby is at least 9 12 months shu says talk to pediatrician about switching to a toddler formula or even whole milk but she says do not make any switches before first talking to your child s doctor shu also has a few tips for parents to avoid formula mistakes she says don t try to make your own formula formula is designed to mimic breast milk and requires a careful balance of nutrients diy or homemade formulas she says may not be nutritionally balanced which can throw off your baby s electrolyte levels a complication that can cause seizures also do not water down formula because that too can keep your child from getting the nutrients he or she needs finally dr shu says do not switch to plant based milks if your baby is under 1 shu says plant based milks like oat milk or soy milk do not have the right nutritional balance for babies

each day ashley beattie and her fiancé spend hours driving around bell county looking for baby formula to feed her eight month old son first h e b then walmart then target she searches until she can find something on tuesday a friend alerted her that there were eight cans of enfamil gentlease at a nearby sam s club the brand meant beattie one of nearly 200 000 texas moms whose lower income qualifies her to have her formula purchases paid for through the texas women infant and children or wic program had to quickly calculate how much that would put her budget behind yet again i feel stressed beattie said it s hard it s a lot of money being taken out of pocket since february parents across the country have been dealing with scarce supplies of baby formula after abbott nutrition one of the four major manufacturers of u s baby formula issued a february recall due to bacterial contamination resulting in a shutdown of its plant in sturgis michigan the shutdown and recall has hit retailers formula inventories hard many families have taken to their social media feeds to help locate stores with formula texas is being hit particularly hard with 52 of baby formula out of stock as of may 1 the third worst in the nation according to the retail software company datasembly both houston and san antonio are among the u s metro areas hit hardest by the shortage with houston the second worst in the u s at a 52 5 out of stock rate the data firm said but for wic moms like beattie the problem is even worse similac made by abbott was the brand she was initially told to buy with her texas wic card although texas health and human services added 75 alternative standard formula options within the first week after the abbott recall announcement in february word has not trickled down to wic users contacted by the texas tribune adding to the confusion is the fact that moms in different counties are being offered different guidance on what they can purchase with their state issued wic cards that s because according to hhsc local wic offices are telling their clients what to buy based on local supply levels and even though the state has relaxed what wic moms can buy through the program expanding the formula list to 90 brands that s not the message some moms are getting from their local offices so they re taking what they can find and paying for it themselves for beattie that meant that on tuesday she grabbed the available cans of enfamil gentlease she found at sam s club she calculates that she has been spending almost 500 a month for formula and has had to cut back on her family s other groceries sometimes she says she finds one of the brands covered by wic but it s always in a size larger than the 20 ounce she has been told by the state to buy i wish there was any cheaper way for this but there s not beattie said for low income mothers across texas the new expense is coming at a time of surging inflation when family budgets are already strained by rising food costs and soaring gas prices this is the worst timing for this situation said rachel cooper a senior policy analyst at every texan the left leaning policy group this would be complicated and confusing no matter what but when food prices in general are through the roof wic s ability to cover formula becomes even more important started as a pilot in 1972 and made permanent two years later the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children was designed to offer nutrition assistance to moms with children under the age of five today wic funded by the u s department of agriculture serves about half of all infants born in the united states according to a 2018 report nationwide about half of all infant formula is purchased by wic participants the biden administration said on thursday households must meet certain salary thresholds to qualify for texas wic for example a texas household of three with a gross annual income of 40 626 qualifies for the program texas health and human services commission spokesperson tiffany young told the tribune that texas wic employees have been in constant communication with both the families they serve and local wic clinics about the changing formula purchase rules the agency relies on a text messaging system to push out the latest information to their clients at this time the texas wic program and the contract formula company is covering the cost of almost any brand or size of standard milk or soy based infant formula that families can find young told the tribune in an email she said that if wic clients had any questions about whether formula purchases they should go to the texas wic websiteor check with the local clinics in their area texans can use this link to check if their baby formula was included in the recall young also said the agency has encouraged grocers to use maximum flexibility possible to ensure wic participants received safe formula including allowing redemption of one of the 90 additional formulas h e b confirmed to the tribune the state had informed them they could relax restrictions we have been actively coordinating with grocers in response to any reports from wic families who are having difficulty redeeming newly authorized products young said nataly romero 20 is a new mother of a 1 year old boy who lives in baytown and they re both enrolled in the texas wic program at her doctor s direction she had recently begun the transition from formula by adding milk to her baby s diet she said she spends hours each afternoon after work going from store to store with her husband looking for formula that she still needs to feed him at this time there is a wic app that tells you your benefits explained romero but on the app it did not show that i could expand to the different brands romero says she now spends 100 150 each month switching formulas is complicated by the fact that her son rejects many of the brands new to him and has reacted negatively to them after she contacted her wic office by phone romero was informed she could use two other brands she said due to the shortage if those two brands weren t in stock i would have to buy a different one out of pocket she said romero says she heard about the opportunity to switch brands after her friend sent her an article detailing how texas wic would now be covering different formulas after the recall although texas hhsc has said the agency has sent texts to wic mothers about the relaxing of what brands can be purchased romero says she never got one they should have been like just whatever
