during the covid 19 pandemic central banks have pushed to the extreme the tools they had created after the global crisis targeted lending large asset purchases and negative interest rates hartmann and schepens 2021 this is especially true in the euro area the balance sheet of the ecb amounts to 60 of gdp it holds around 25 of public debt of the euro area and the deposit facility rate is at 0 5 1 for targeted long term refinancing operations or tltro these measures were useful and necessary to avert deflation both during the 2010s and in the covid 19 crisis however since 2015 the annual inflation rate has been around target only 10 of the time see figure 1 based on its june 2021 forecast the ecb itself anticipates after a temporary increase in 2021 an average inflation rate below its 2 target at 1 5 in 2022 and 1 4 in 2023 figure 1 distribution of monthly inflation in the euro area 2015 2021 what else can the ecb do to get to its inflation target can and should it expand existing tools further if another crisis hits can other instruments do better especially in the context of the euro area we attempt to answer these questions in two joint reports martin et al 2021 renault and savatier 2021 more of the same will have to pass the credibility test given the difficulty to attain the target and will not be without problems one potential problem is that the purchase of public debt increases the risk in the long run of fiscal dominance the ecb insists that it is not in this situation because monetary policy remains guided by the objective of price stability and not by an objective of reducing the public debt burden schnabel 2020 this may be the case today but there is a risk if persistently low inflation generates an anticipation of persistently higher public debt purchases garicano et al 2020 in addition these instruments also have consequences like all monetary actions in terms of inequalities amberg et al 2021 andersen et al 2021 although asset purchases by central banks have contributed to lower income inequality through their impact on economic activity and employment they contributed to increasing asset prices by decreasing and flattening the yield curve in addition keeping interest rates in low and negative regions for a long period of time may have some unintended effect on financial stability economists have anticipated these limits and considered alternative powerful instruments to strengthen economic activity and inflation a widely discussed option in the profession is helicopter money ball et al 2016 mullbauer 2014 mullbauer 2016 barstch et al 2019 gali 2020 yashiv 2020 bilbiie and ragot 2020 the principle here is to create money through a direct transfer to individuals1 instead of through lending to banks the transmission mechanism would be more direct and according to economic theory more effective following several authors cohen setton et al 2019 we explain why contrary to the federal reserve the ecb can implement a direct transfer to individuals without major legal barriers we view the use of helicopter money as a contingent strategy in the case where inflation falls persistently and dangerously below target activity stalls and no coordinated fiscal response either at the european or national level is put into place how large should this new instrument be to attain the inflation ecb target despite numerous theoretical discussions few contributions have provided quantitative estimations of the impact of such transfers renault and savatier 2021 attempt to answer the question quantifying the effect of monetary transfer on inflation two different estimation methods are used to assess the potential impact on inflation of a monetary transfer to households first the joint impact of a standard exogenous monetary policy shock i e on the interest rate on inflation and consumption is assessed under the assumption that inflation responds to monetary policy through its effect on aggregate demand consumption we can infer the impact of an exogenous consumption shock on inflation by taking into account the effect on consumption of a transfer to households social benefits etc as estimated in various academic works i e the marginal propensity to consume we can evaluate how much a monetary transfer would affect consumption and then inflation from these different estimates we estimate that a monetary transfer of 1 of gdp would generate an increase of 0 5 in consumption and 0 5 percentage point in inflation renault and savatier 2021 second a monetary transfer to households can be considered equivalent to a tax cut in an environment of accommodating monetary policy the impact of fiscal policy on inflation is still much debated in the academic literature however econometric work that has causally identified tax shocks finds a significant effect on inflation using confidential euro area data van der wielen 2020 estimates that a fiscal expansion of one percentage point increases inflation by 0 43 over a one year horizon using uk data cloyne 2013 finds an effect of around 0 6 in the fifth quarter after the shock renault and savatier 2021 estimate the impact of german tax shocks on inflation using data from hayo and uhl 2014 in the case where economic activity is below its potential level which would be the likely situation where helicopter money is considered the estimates also show that a tax cut of 1 of gdp increases inflation by 0 3 percentage points after six quarters and 0 5 percentage points after eight quarters figure 2 effect of an exogenous tax cut on inflation in germany depending on the state of the economy 12 quarters ahead source authors based on data from hayo and uhl 2014 these macroeconomic estimates should be treated with caution yet it is interesting that different methods lead to similar orders of magnitude a monetary transfer of 1 of gdp would increase the inflation rate by 0 5 percentage points over a one year horizon table 1 lays out the transfers required to eliminate the inflation deficit relative to the target it shows that only a large inflation deficit of 1 5 percentage points would require a transfer to households quantitatively close to the cheques sent by the biden plan 1 200 per adult and up to 3 600 per child income tested these estimates are based on relatively strong assumptions about the empirical link between a cash transfer and inflation the proposed amount of the monetary transfer is therefore on the low side to avoid overshooting the desired target and corresponds to a first injection to be credible however the ecb should announce that it will make the necessary number of money transfers to reach its target and that once the target is reached it will immediately stop this policy defending the proportionate nature of helicopter money as well as announcing an exit strategy may from this point of view be easier than for quantitative easing qe the central bank can easily terminate the program in case of a return of inflation without any consequences on the management of the public debt in the extreme and unlikely case where the ecb would have to issue five waves of helicopter money in a short period of time its balance sheet would thus increase by a maximum amount of 10 of gdp this amount is relatively small compared to the size of its current balance sheet 60 of gdp and to the scale of the asset purchases that have been necessary to keep inflation close to 1 since 2015 for a stock that is equivalent to 30 of gdp in 2021 it should also be noted that if the introduction of helicopter money succeeds in bringing the inflation rate back towards its target it would allow for a more rapid normalisation of monetary policy regarding both asset purchases and interest rates from this point of view this monetary instrument might be more acceptable to some countries e g germany for which the ecb s unconventional monetary policy is most problematic table 1 amount of transfer to achieve a 2 target note for children under 15 the transfer would be half that for adults source authors the effectiveness of such a measure on current and future inflation should limit the number of helicopter money drops it is important to avoid significant costs to the central bank when monetary policy normalises and interest rates are paid on bank reserves to the central bank the counterparty to the creation of helicopter money cannot bear interest so it will be costly for the central bank to remunerate the bank reserves created by the helicopter money if it has to do so these costs are similar in nature to the current costs due to the ecb s policy of lending to banks at 1 while remunerating bank reserves at 0 5 lonergan and greene 2020 these costs must be anticipated but would be minor in our scenario if a handful of helicopter drops are sufficient to achieve the inflation target and long term interest rates remain low monnet 2021a coordination with fiscal policy to ensure the full effectiveness of this monetary policy measure the ecb should ask the european council to coordinate fiscal responses to the central bank s policy this coordination should also be initiated by the european commission during the european semester with approval of the european parliament monnet 2021b like any transfer the sum paid by the ecb will be taxable in each country the european council must commit itself to ensure that the member states do not increase their taxes so as not to counteract the immediate impact of the helicopter money on private consumption in addition to its importance for the effectiveness of the measure on inflation such coordination will also make it possible to ensure the fiscal neutrality of the ecb s helicopter money policy i e it must not modify the tax structure chosen by each state a common criticism of helicopter money that takes the form of direct transfers to households points to the risk of a harmful confusion between monetary policy and fiscal policy we believe on the contrary that transferring money directly to agents falls within the scope of a central bank s actions this policy is strictly speaking monetary policy money creation and can be conducted essentially in the name of the ecb s main objective the inflation target moreover unlike purchases of financial assets it is less likely to conflict with other objectives of the ecb financial stability and secondary objectives defined by the eu notably the fight against inequality thus a direct monetary transfer to households with clear communication in terms of the inflation target and the exit strategy is a last resort policy that maintains a clear boundary between central bank and governmental action references amberg n t jansson m klein and a

by dominique patton wei county china reuters agrichemicals giant syngenta group is rapidly expanding its rollout of farm services in china ahead of a huge stock market listing as it seeks to meet surging demand from farmers crucial to beijing s increasing focus on food security the world s biggest crop protection maker and no 3 seed supplier says it is boosting grain yields and raising farmers incomes just as the pandemic fuels government worries about food supplies and pushes up the cost of key farm materials that means opportunity for swiss based chinese backed syngenta to grab market share in a fragmented farm chemicals market positioning the company for growth as chinese farmers expand their holdings the group aims to raise 10 billion by listing in shanghai in what is likely to be the year s biggest market flotation but syngenta acknowledges it faces tremendous competition in the markets in which it operates rivals include bayer ag de and corteva nyse inc as well chinese firms selling agronomy services to the nation s farmers before we sold pesticides seeds and fertiliser now we re a farm services company we sell service and technology said mao feng chief brand manager for syngenta group china s modern agriculture platform map and digital agriculture map is to receive some 12 of the ipo proceeds for expansion according to a prospectus filed on friday selling individual products we had hit the ceiling there was no more room mao told reporters last month in china crop yields lag far behind western countries even as growers use three times as much fertiliser while farms in the vast country are tiny by global standards averaging half a hectare compared with 180 hectares 440 acres in the united states bigger better so syngenta is trying to help itself by helping farmers like liu ligang liu who farms 20 hectares 50 acres in wei county in the northern province of hebei has doubled his contracted land over the past four years one of a growing number of chinese farmers seeking to become professional growers to date 37 million hectares have been contracted out some 30 of china s arable land such expansion brings more risk for farmers requiring more knowledge and sophisticated services liu has just harvested some 7 500 kg of wheat per hectare 6 600 pounds per acre up 25 from last year and 10 above his neighbours he says thanks to syngenta s map service which helped him manage pests before it was only when the disease came that the pesticide was started he said that is too late and it can be advanced now in addition to supplying seeds and chemicals map runs training centres across china and about 900 demonstration farms showing growers what produces the best yields in a given location farmers get free management of their land and in return buy the firm s products or others recommended by its agronomists map tripled its revenues to more than 280 million in the first quarter from a year earlier adding 40 centres to reach 365 nationwide it contributed 4 of group revenues up from 1 in the same period a year earlier the business also makes money selling crops and fresh produce to such customers as alibaba nyse group s hema supermarkets and dole food co they pay above market prices for map farmers quality and the traceability of its digital platform revenues are expected to break 1 billion this year and hit some 4 5 billion by 2025 according to one industry estimate competition but other companies are also trying to capitalise on the increasing scale and sophistication of chinese farming bayer otc for example is advertising for a china head of digital agriculture beijing based ican has built digital crop models to guide farmers through plot selection planning and harvesting it claims its modelling can increase yields while reducing fertiliser use sales of fertiliser and crop chemicals in china were 24 billion in 2018 rabobank estimates more than the 20 billion in the united states while seed in each country was worth around 12 billion input markets are more fragmented in china offering huge room for share growth syngenta generated less than 5 of its sales in china before it was acquired by state run chemchina in 2017 it had less than 1 of the seed market though a more significant 7 share of crop chemicals map is aided in reaching farmers through group affiliate sinofert holdings china s largest fertiliser producer and distributor its 30 000 retail stores reach farmers working 95 of the country s farmland reckons fitch but china s small farm sizes push up logistics costs and progress in consolidating land has been slower than expected said thomas luedi senior partner at bain co in shanghai we found that to break even we needed to have 5 000 hectares of farmland in one town using our service said an industry executive who previously helmed a farm services firm syngenta said scattered farming and incomplete infrastructure and supply chains hold back all services firms but it is working with farm co operatives and trying to standardise production across entire villages to reduce the impact of fragmented landholdings 1 6 4764 renminbi

m6 coupe make bmw segment coupe the main difference between rotary and your more standard combustion engines is that rotary engines don t use pistons essentially one or more triangular rotors spin in a circular chamber to combust the fuel air mixture which is a lot less complex of a solution than using pistons other advantages include less mechanical stress less vibration higher power to weight ratio than a piston engine higher compression the ability to use a wider range of fuels a wider torque band and better thermodynamic efficiency it all sounds wonderful when described as above but the only successful rotary engine design to be used in cars is the wankel most famously found in the mazda rx 7 and rx 8 the problems come with fuel efficiency and emissions and the habit of the rotary seals to fail as they are exposed to the fuel and varying heat levels they also tend to consume a lot of oil however when the pros outweigh the cons it can be a brilliant engine it s also a great candidate for engine swaps to give a car a completely different character in its performance engine swaps are not the easiest of projects and a rotary has a particularly high level of difficulty but that hasn t stopped some adventurous car owners rotary turbo volkswagen beetle there are a couple of standard options for taking the original beetle from being a car that plods along to a car that can blow modern cars away from the lights if you have the money a porsche flat six cylinder is the obvious choice otherwise a subaru flat four is an excellent choice however mario markakis opted for a 1 3 liter 13b engine from a second generation rx 7 because the engine itself is small compared to the four cylinder lump he managed to squeeze the stock turbo and intercooler in the back so he could get the full 250 horsepower because the beetle is light this one is now a 10 5 second quarter mile car close six rotor bmw m6 if you re going to swap out the v10 engine from bmw s e63 m6 an ls just isn t going to hit the spot instead the south african tuning shop aj racing swapped the 500 horsepower v10 for a custom built six rotor rotary engine for reference sake mazda s insanely fast r26b race engine was custom built using four rotors a six rotor engine is a rarity in this case the engine showed 478 hp on the dyno while revving to 5 500 rpm which is just starting to get into its powerband other kiwire built rotary engines have demonstrated 800 hp and up if you want to know what a six rotor engine sounds like it s well worth checking out the video below close mazda 12a powered 1987 suzuki samurai one of the great wonders of the off road world is suzuki s little samurai despite feeling like you re a pea in a tin whistle inside one and that it was powered by a 1 3 liter engine making around 60 hp those little suckers seemed to be able to go anywhere this one is swapped with what looks like a mazda 12a rotary from the first generation rx 7 it made around 100 hp when new it also looks suspiciously like a holly double pumper carburetor mounted on the engine it popped up for sale on craigslist last year where it was residing in the desert city of hesperia california it s a build someone has put a lot of time into and looks amazing so hopefully someone bought it and is still ripping it around dirt trails in california close 1969 mazda 1200 rotary restomod an engine swap doesn t have to be about adding more power but like the samurai above the mazda 12a rotary replacing the original 1 2 liter four cylinder will have doubled the power to close to 100 hp in the rx 7 the 12a propelled it to 62 mph in 9 2 seconds but the vintage little mazda 1200 was a lighter car the engine upgrade won t have turned this 1200 into a rocket ship but it will make the stylish little coupe much more drivable in modern traffic while giving it even more character which is exactly what a restomod should be about close rotary chevrolet nova there are plenty of rx 7 s out there with v8 swaps but you ll find very few muscle cars with the v8 swapped for a rotary nick holms of houston texas was up for the challenge though and built something not just unorthodox but when you hear it rev out something mind bending the orange 1974 chevy nova is now home to an extensively modified turbocharged 13b mazda rotary boosted to 26 lbs of forced induction and making 576 hp and 449 lb ft of torque at the wheels that s a lot more beef under the hood than the original factory installed 350 cubic inch v8 that made 185 hp and is good for an 11 second quarter mile time close turbo rotary chevrolet z06 corvette even more baffling for traditionalists than the nova swap is the idea of swapping the v8 from a c5 generation z06 corvette for a mazda rotary engine youtuber rob dahm is becoming famous for his rotary swaps but so far this is his finest effort so far the engine is stock but the two rotor 13b s turbo is swapped out for a garrett gtx3584rs turbocharger and the brain of the engine is now an adaptronic m2000 ecu its first run on a dyno with a tune showed 550 hp and 503 lb ft of torque which is 145 more horsepower and 104 more lb ft of torque than the factory ls1 installed under the hood dahm s next project is to put a crashed c8 corvette he bought back on the road with rotary replacing the 6 2 liter lt2 v8 close queen st bmw e46 m3 this is an old one but it s also literally a gold one queen st is a renowned australian show car building company that turned its hand to drag racing with exquisite style the queen st bmw e46 m3 turns everything about drag racing on its head first by using an e46 generation bmw m3 then by using a four rotor 1 600 hp mazda rotary engine and just in case that wasn t statement enough queen st went ahead and took the gold and black color scheme to the extreme by 24 carat gold plating the pac performance built engine the last we heard was that the drag car had a personal best quarter mile time of 6 827 seconds and below you can see and hear it in all its glory and thankfully not see it crash

dannii minogue offers a slightly nervous smile when i warn her i ll only be asking her questions about the 1990s during our interview after all it s been 21 long years since the decade ended there is of course a reason for this step back in time to quote another minogue s famous song dannii s just been announced as host of the oldskool 90s hits station and podcast series the 90s with dannii minogue both available now via the listnr app but while she says the 90s whirlwind top of the pops appearances new york recording sessions and ibiza nightclub gigs are a world away from her typical 2021 routine of school runs with son ethan back in her melbourne hometown dannii s memories of the decade are still fresh front row at fashion week with kylie and prince meeting and instantly feeling sorry for princess diana stripping off for playboy to pay the bills dannii s got 90s stories yep that s dannii nick carter eat your heart out and she s embracing the retro fun with her new gig check the video above of several truly unrecognisable danniis busting out their best boy band moves to everybody backstreet s back let s start at the beginning 1990 was the year your debut album came out and you moved to the uk i d just finished a year on home and away and it was absolutely massive over there they said why don t you come over we d love for you to promote one single i went over there with a suitcase packed thinking i was going for three weeks and i came back 22 years later i think that if i d known what was coming i would have been too scared to jump on that train it s a familiar pilgrimage for a young aussie to move to london but you were doing it as a pop star early 90s dannii bright eyed and high haired related why dannii refused to use her masked singer trailer it was crazy my sister was already there and she d been in neighbours she d released a lot of music already it was absolute hysteria i came from australia where i grew up on tv and everybody knew me from young talent time and then i went to london and then i was the girl from home and away who s kylie s sister and i had a good five years of that every introduction was you re kylie s sister which she used to get back in australia when i was on young talent time so it was a weird flip and reverse the hardest question was people would always say oh so you re doing music now because your sister does it and i said no i ve been singing professionally since i was 10 years old but great cool did that make it more important to make sure that you crafted your own sound was anybody over there saying just get in the studio with stock aitken waterman it worked for kylie dannii right started on aussie tv first but in the uk she was kylie s sister i know kylie had a pretty hard time even getting into pwl studios on her first trip over there they kept her waiting in a waiting room for like a week and she almost didn t record with them but my passion growing up i was the biggest fan of janet jackson and you can see in my early videos i m just fanning and trying to be the best janet jackson that i can be when i went into mushroom records they knew that i loved more of an r b jam and they were sifting through finding songs one came from a couple of writers in the bronx and it was dannii s 1990 debut single love and kisses they said would you like to record this and there was money in music so i was put on a plane to go to new york to record with them we just started recording more and more until it made up an album you ve always been quite aware of the power of a good image change the this is it video in 1993 was a big shake up and a big hit suddenly you re in this day go beach world dannii frolicking on a beach with then partner julian mcmahon in the this is it video related dannii minogue reveals show she s refused to appear on many times well i d been living in london and it was always grey and drizzly and cold and as i say there was money in the music business back then so they were like we were thinking maybe you could shoot this video on a beach somewhere in california and i m like i m in take me there i m going to leave this rain for a bit and get on a beach i was just buzzing i was missing that australian beach life and the sunshine and just soaking in every bit of it i think the video did capture that really well because it always takes people back another image and sound change came with the girl album in 97 all i wanna do was the first hit written by brian higgins just before he hit it big with cher s believe a bleached blonde makeover for the dance focused girl album that album was all about just working with new people brian higgins is one of those i remember being in the studio and brian was saying i ve got this tune have a listen to it see what you think and i said i don t know do you think it s me let s just record it and see if it sounds any good i don t want to mess up your song it sounds brilliant i just don t know if i can fit into it you look back on those moments now and you re like wow i really didn t know and sometimes with music you ve got to go out of your comfort zone and yeah it was very pivotal a lot of great things came from that album even though it wasn t the biggest chart success as an album it s very much loved you mention chart success the life of a jobbing pop star must be stressful when so much hinges on your latest chart position joy and stress in abundance amazing moments like the amount of times i got to perform on top of the pops i ended up even hosting the show years later that led to royal command performances and you re suddenly backstage at the palladium waiting to meet a very young princess diana in a line up with the rolling stones nothing prepares you what did you say to diana i have no idea she was very young she was very nervous they were her first royal engagements where she was on her own and so she was dressed up i remember looking at her thinking you look like you dressed up as a woman who s 80 years old it was really like she d been styled by the queen s mother it wasn t until after that she found her fashion mojo and changed she was just the little princess diana with the chin down looking up at you and i felt sorry for her because you could feel the nerves but there s no book or manual to being a pop star there s so many moments that crop up and you re like don t really know what to do in this situation i m just going to have to make it up as i go along whereas most other jobs you study for and you plan for but with pop music anything can happen i mean like going in and seeing alexander mcqueen fashion shows and sitting front row and next to me is my sister and then there s prince the three of us the same height of course dannii circa 2021 there s no manual to being a pop star there is no manual to being a pop star but you did have kylie did you lean on her for advice on how to navigate the job we had to lean on each other and also our rock is our brother brendan he is a news cameraman and he s always there to be the voice of reason and to really bring it back into perspective for us bad days were probably more to do with really being hounded by press whereas we would speak to my brother and his day was being in afghanistan trying not to step on a landmine and you go okay that puts it all in perspective i ve just had my little moan i m ready to go back to my amazing job being dressed up by stylists and having makeup artists arrive at my home and performing for royalty a pivotal moment for you came right in the middle of the 90s posing nude for playboy in 95 you said afterwards the pictures looked great and it paid a few bills but were you as relaxed going into it dannii needed the money playboy offered but she also loved the photos i desperately needed money i got married very young dannii married actor julian mcmahon in 1994 aged 22 and i was supporting both of us my husband at the time was trying to break into america i was supporting him in america me living in london and flying between the two cities and i just got into debt i was now divorced in debt they said do you want to do this shoot and i m like my family are loaning me money i don t want to be that person i have to pay them back so for me it was everything my dad didn t want me to do it he tried so hard to talk me out of it he s like you have to live with this for the rest of your life it s not just about paying off the debt now but i did want to do it when the magazine came out it was like this is what i wanted it to be and i still look back and they re beautiful pictures and i m like damn that s really good i did the shoot when i had that washboard stomach i really wish i had that again now info dannii minogue hosts the

before riggs and murtaugh before carter and lee before lowery and burnett and before tango and cash there was cates and hammond buddy movies have been a staple of cinema for decades but walter hills gritty and violent action film 48 hrs filled with acerbic banter between two mismatched men who despite despising each other must work together to bring down the bad guys while trying not to kill each other in the process inspired more than its fair share of imitations 48 hrs became a blueprint for more than a few successful films from the 1980s and 90s later films may have come to theaters with more spit and polish but there is something refreshing in the grit and grim of the action language and brute force on display 48 hrs 1982 released 08 dec 1982 rated r runtime 96 min director walter hill genre action comedy crime drama thriller cast nick nolte eddie murphy annette o toole frank mcrae writer s roger spottiswoode walter hill larry gross steven e de souza plot a hard nosed cop

this we ain t partners we ain t brothers and we ain t friends i m puttin you down and keepin you down until ganz is locked up or dead and if ganz gets away you re gonna be sorry you ever met me reggie i m already sorry eddie murphy stars as convict reggie hammond and nick nolte as jack cates the police detective who secures his short term so that they can track down ganz james remar a violent escaped criminal and former member of hammond s robbery crew hammond hid the loot from the turn that landed him in jail and he and cates have just 48 hours to track down the money ganz ganz s trigger happy partner billy bear sonny landham and the girl they ve kidnapped as collateral to get their hands on the cash hammond s wise cracking ways quickly grate the nerves of cates a curmudgeonly bad habited veteran detective with questionable offensive diversity standards and a truly short fuse from this mix arises an action film that unfolds at break neck speed director walter hill s distinct style for action is stamped all over the shoot outs and car chases his lively appreciation for the city in which his film is set in this case san francisco and his penchant for the seedier underbelly of urban sprawl is in full swing his characters inhabit a tattered world graveled with common vices chauvinism racial prejudice and authority figures quick to anger nick nolte s gruff and cavalier portrayal of det cates is a template from which the unhinged aggressive characters in subsequent films of the subgenre would morph though the subgenre would evolve to the more traditional two character orbit of the rule following sensible foil to the comedic and unpredictable partner 48 hrs is the original spark that gave rise to many seeking to model its success consider the rule following det murtaugh portrayed by danny glover partnered with the unhinged and suicidal det riggs in the first lethal weapon film or arnold schwarzenegger s russian police capt denko partnered with the slovenly and undisciplined det art ridzik played by james belushi in hill s own 1998 red heat these are the results of screenwriters and studios inspired in part by what 48 hrs sparked it should be noted that james belushi would later transmogrify the subgenre when partnered with a german shepherd in 1989 s k 9 and 48 hrs co writer roger spottiswoode would tackle a similar man dog buddy cop film that same year with turner hooch nick nolte s cantankerous detective and eddie murphy s clever convict are a classic misfit pairing though murphy s character is somewhat understated during the first and some of the second act he leaps into top form during the red neck bar sequence where his mockery and disdain of backward white folk plays like a reward for his more modest quips to that point which he rides all the way to the film s close it s easy to see how his reggie hammond character became so popular and murphy with it helping launch a successful run of wise cracking characters including perhaps his most famous det axel foley in the beverly hills cop films james horner s score is a delight in the same year he was hired to score the second installment of the star trek feature films and before his meteoric rise in hollywood as a prolific and renowned composer he composed a beat rich steel drum infused soundtrack for this action film it s a rambunctious score of ambiguous ethnic influence rich in low end brass woodwinds and a cacophony of now staple instruments for which horner would later be known 48 hrs is bloody bawdy and brilliantly unpolished entertainment in many ways it was a test run for hill s red heat several years later complete with seedy motel shoot outs and the bus barreling down the city streets though in red heat it was bus vs bus the racism that comes out of nolte s cates character has never been more unpleasant but it s a part of the character or who the character was playing to cajole his unwilling cohort and there s a moment in the film where it s directly addressed video 4 5 5 3d rating na paramount s improved blu ray of 48 hrs part of its paramount presents line is the best i ve ever seen this film the colors are richer detail is surprisingly good the image is cleaner than you might expect the grain is interesting darker scenes particular stock presents the grain you might expect from this production but daylight well lit sequences have a much finer level of grain there s probably some digital toolery at play but not at the expense of detail all the dirt and debris that were apparent on previous releases are taken care of here black levels are also surprisingly deep notably in the scene when reggie and cage head to the country bar audio 4 5 5 the audio is a repeat of the previously available english dolby truehd 5 1 audio it remains punchy and rowdy the sounds of san francisco and the rustle and bustle of the police headquarters and the excellent unbroken single shot sequence following cates near the film s opening come alive and are active in the surrounds james horner s score is a real pleasure it dominates in many scenes though isn t intrusive it simply provides a grungy jazz infused rhythmic cadence to the action almost playing counterpoint such as the sequence where cates is pursuing ganz in the subway the cat and mouse chase boils and simmers cates stalks the windows looking to see which subway car ganz billy bear and their hostage have holed up most films today would ease back on the underscore to just tense violin but 48 hrs plays this sequence at full boar with the percussion and brass indulgences at full pace it s terrific special features 2 5 5 filmmaker focus director walter hill on 48 hrs a welcome new special feature with director walter hill sharing memories and stories from

insensitive racial remarks nudity and strong language occasion the film frequently the language is rough and crude the character arguments ruthless and politically incorrect even by early 80s

by jim hightower here s a thought provoking bumper sticker the system is fixed we must break it this thought came into vivid focus recently when a new report by propublica revealed that a nest of preening multibillionaires led by the likes of jeff bezos elon musk and michael bloomberg have been playing america s rigged tax system to dodge paying their share of upkeep for the society that so lavishly enriches them in leaked irs data the 25 richest americans were exposed for using tricks and loopholes to pay barely 3 percent of their enormous riches to our public treasury while ordinary working people shell out about 24 percent of their meager income check out the manipulations by amazon s jeff bezos the world s richest man even as his riches skyrocketed by 120 billion from 2006 to 2018 he paid just 1 percent in taxes on that huge gain one year in which his wealth swelled by 18 billion he even took a 4 000 tax credit from us for the care of his children the chief fix for these super dodgers is that they can take out loans on the escalating value of their stock mansions yachts etc without paying taxes on the cash they get then they spend the cash value of those assets without having to sell them financial voodoo for the privileged few in response to the revelations in propublica s jaw dropping report congressional republicans biden administration officials and the irs are all promising a thorough investigation and crack down not on the sleazy billionaires but on propublica yes some top public officials exclaim that they are outraged not by the tax rigging but by the fact that you and i have been told about it in specific undeniable detail it s not cynical to call the system corrupt when the corruption is put right under our noses this post was previously published on otherwords org under a creative commons license don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free

be well positioned to taper most economists expect an announcement by the end of the year the fed s careful approach might reflect lingering memories of 2013 when it last warned of tapering to come bonds sold off sharply the dollar soared and emerging markets suffered capital outflows in what is now known as the taper tantrum even mr powell s announcement in june was accompanied by a mini tantrum of sorts prompted by higher inflation officials also indicated that they expected to raise interest rates twice by the end of 2023 sooner than they had previously signalled the hawkish turn sent emerging market currencies tumbling qe is swathed in so much mystical uncertainty that working out the impact of unwinding it is no easy feat but a careful examination of central banks past experience of asset purchases yields clues for what to expect it also contains lessons for how central banks might be able to extricate themselves from their bond buying gracefully this time before the negative side effects of their enormous balance sheets start to be felt acutely begin with the effects of changing course everyone agrees that central banks asset purchases reduce long term bond yields but there is enormous uncertainty as to how much they underpin markets today last year ben bernanke the fed s chairman at the time of the taper tantrum suggested that in america in 2014 every 500bn of qe reduced ten year treasury yields by 0 2 percentage points by that rule of thumb adjusted for inflation the fed s total securities holdings of 7 5trn today are lowering yields by nearly three percentage points though mr bernanke suggested somewhat arbitrarily that the overall effect of qe might be capped at 1 2 percentage points alternatively the median estimate of a survey of 24 studies conducted in 2016 by joseph gagnon of the peterson institute for international economics suggests that asset purchases worth 10 of gdp reduced ten year government bond yields by about half a percentage point that suggests that qe today is suppressing long term rates by just under two percentage points in america britain and the euro area although mr gagnon argues that when yields approach zero as they have in europe and japan qe reaches its limits a bigger bond market may also reduce the size of the effect the bank of japan owns government debt worth a staggering 97 of gdp but mr gagnon finds the effects of qe have historically been more muted perhaps because japan s total public debt is more than two and a half times that figure these numbers and the experience of the taper tantrum make the reversal of qe seem like something that will upend financial markets sky high asset prices today reflect the assumption that long term interest rates will stay low for a long time we know we need to be very careful in communicating about asset purchases mr powell acknowledged earlier this year yet the lessons from the taper tantrum are subtler than they seem and may even provide some cause for comfort when the toys go out of the pram the tantrum of 2013 is associated with mr bernanke raising the subject of slowing the fed s pace of asset purchases but asset prices fell because investors brought forward the date at which they expected the fed to raise overnight interest rates the traditional lever of monetary policy the episode supports the signalling theory of qe which says that central banks balance sheets influence long term bond yields not directly as rules of thumb suggest but by acting as a marker for future interest rates the implication is that you can reverse qe without much fuss if you sever the perceived link between asset purchases and interest rate decisions some past episodes of tapering seem to observe this rule indeed the fed has already achieved a big tapering during the covid 19 crisis as the severity of the pandemic became clear and markets panicked in spring 2020 the fed hoovered up almost 1 5trn of treasuries in just two months before dramatically slowing its purchases which eventually settled at around 80bn a month but there was no expectation that interest rates would soon rise and bond yields seemed unaffected in a speech gertjan vlieghe of the bank of england a proponent of the signalling theory cited this experience which was mirrored in britain as evidence that there is little mechanical link between bond yields and qe the fed also seemed to achieve such a separation the last time it shrank its balance sheet significantly in 2018 and 2019 it let assets mature without reinvesting the proceeds rather than by selling anything with no discernible effect on bond yields the point around signalling and intent is a very salient feature of how qe operates says a trader at a big wall street bank since the end of march ten year treasury yields have drifted down even as tapering talk has become louder perhaps then central banks can pull off a graceful exit the question is whether rising inflation and booming markets will make them impatient to reverse course more abruptly some particularly in britain are also wary of three potential undesirable effects of central banks balance sheets being too large for too long the first concern which has troubled mr bailey is about preserving ammunition a popular view is that qe is highly effective at calming markets during crises when it is deployed quickly and at scale but has smaller effects in more normal times the danger of prolonging an enormous market presence in good times is that you run out of room to act with force during emergencies central bankers usually scorn this logic when it is used to argue for higher interest rates because harming the economy today to rescue it later is to put the cart before the horse but if qe works best in a crisis then withdrawing it in normal times should not be so painful not doing so might mean a gradual ratcheting up during each crisis of the share of government debt that central banks own the second worry is the unseemly tangle of monetary and fiscal policy that qe creates during the pandemic central banks have routinely faced the accusation that qe is meant to fund governments in january a survey by the financial times of the 18 biggest investors in britain s gilt market found that the overwhelming majority thought the purpose of the bank of england s bond buying was to finance the government s emergency spending rather than to support the economy but although lower bond yields help the government s finances qe does not extinguish the government s financing costs it just shifts them to central banks whose profits and losses end up back with the taxpayer the central bank reserves created to buy bonds carry a floating rate of interest making them analogous to short term government borrowing over the past decade issuing short term liabilities to buy long term debt has been a profitable strategy between 2011 and 2020 the fed sent over 800bn in profits to the treasury the bank of england s asset purchase facility transferred 109bn to british taxpayers if interest rates rose however central banks enormous balance sheets could become lossmaking that could have sizeable consequences for the public finances in november 2020 britain s office for budget responsibility estimated that the country s debt service costs had become twice as sensitive to short term interest rates as they were at the start of the year as a result of the combination of qe and increased debt every one percentage point increase in short term interest rates will raise the annual cost of servicing debt by 0 5 of gdp by 2025 26 in large rich countries 15 45 of public debt is in effect overnight calculates the bank for international settlements some economists also worry that central banks could see their independence compromised were they to require cash injections from governments the final factor is appearances the prominence of central banks holdings of public debt has helped create a widespread impression that governments can spend with abandon it has had weird effects such as sending measures of the broad money supply through the roof contributing to fears of inflation politicians eye central banks ever more greedily wanting to use qe to further goals such as reducing inequality or fighting climate change during times of economic crisis central bankers have to lead from the front as normality returns their focus should be on keeping a lower profile dig deeper the new fault lines on which the world economy rests july 2021 will surprisingly high levels of

by dominique patton wei county china reuters agrichemicals giant syngenta group is rapidly expanding its rollout of farm services in china ahead of a huge stock market listing as it seeks to meet surging demand from farmers crucial to beijing s increasing focus on food security the world s biggest crop protection maker and no 3 seed supplier says it is boosting grain yields and raising farmers incomes just as the pandemic fuels government worries about food supplies and pushes up the cost of key farm materials that means opportunity for swiss based chinese backed syngenta to grab market share in a fragmented farm chemicals market positioning the company for growth as chinese farmers expand their holdings the group aims to raise 10 billion by listing in shanghai in what is likely to be the year s biggest market flotation but syngenta acknowledges it faces tremendous competition in the markets in which it operates rivals include bayer ag and corteva inc as well chinese firms selling agronomy services to the nation s farmers before we sold pesticides seeds and fertiliser now we re a farm services company we sell service and technology said mao feng chief brand manager for syngenta group china s modern agriculture platform map and digital agriculture map is to receive some 12 of the ipo proceeds for expansion according to a prospectus filed on friday selling individual products we had hit the ceiling there was no more room mao told reporters last month in china crop yields lag far behind western countries even as growers use three times as much fertiliser while farms in the vast country are tiny by global standards averaging half a hectare compared with 180 hectares 440 acres in the united states bigger better so syngenta is trying to help itself by helping farmers like liu ligang liu who farms 20 hectares 50 acres in wei county in the northern province of hebei has doubled his contracted land over the past four years one of a growing number of chinese farmers seeking to become professional growers to date 37 million hectares have been contracted out some 30 of china s arable land such expansion brings more risk for farmers requiring more knowledge and sophisticated services liu has just harvested some 7 500 kg of wheat per hectare 6 600 pounds per acre up 25 from last year and 10 above his neighbours he says thanks to syngenta s map service which helped him manage pests before it was only when the disease came that the pesticide was started he said that is too late and it can be advanced now in addition to supplying seeds and chemicals map runs training centres across china and about 900 demonstration farms showing growers what produces the best yields in a given location farmers get free management of their land and in return buy the firm s products or others recommended by its agronomists map tripled its revenues to more than 280 million in the first quarter from a year earlier adding 40 centres to reach 365 nationwide it contributed 4 of group revenues up from 1 in the same period a year earlier the business also makes money selling crops and fresh produce to such customers as alibaba group s hema supermarkets and dole food co they pay above market prices for map farmers quality and the traceability of its digital platform revenues are expected to break 1 billion this year and hit some 4 5 billion by 2025 according to one industry estimate competition but other companies are also trying to capitalise on the increasing scale and sophistication of chinese farming bayer for example is advertising for a china head of digital agriculture beijing based ican has built digital crop models to guide farmers through plot selection planning and harvesting it claims its modelling can increase yields while reducing fertiliser use sales of fertiliser and crop chemicals in china were 24 billion in 2018 rabobank estimates more than the 20 billion in the united states while seed in each country was worth around 12 billion input markets are more fragmented in china offering huge room for share growth syngenta generated less than 5 of its sales in china before it was acquired by state run chemchina in 2017 it had less than 1 of the seed market though a more significant 7 share of crop chemicals map is aided in reaching farmers through group affiliate sinofert holdings china s largest fertiliser producer and distributor its 30 000 retail stores reach farmers working 95 of the country s farmland reckons fitch but china s small farm sizes push up logistics costs and progress in consolidating land has been slower than expected said thomas luedi senior partner at bain co in shanghai we found that to break even we needed to have 5 000 hectares of farmland in one town using our service said an industry executive who previously helmed a farm services firm syngenta said scattered farming and incomplete infrastructure and supply chains hold back all services firms but it is working with farm co operatives and trying to standardise production across entire villages to reduce the impact of fragmented landholdings 1 6 4764 chinese yuan renminbi reporting by dominique patton additional

what is peak oil have we reached it peak oil is the theoretical timeline for when domestic or global oil production will hit its maximum rate and begin to decline it s the idea that at some point the world s finite quality and quantity of oil will decline to such low numbers that it would no longer be economic to produce the concept has been the subject of debate for decades backed by a slew of peer reviewed studies government research and analyses conducted by oil industry leaders arguing underlying expectations of peak oil demand where do fossil fuels come from both crude oil and petroleum are referred to as fossil fuels made up of hydrocarbons formed from the remains of animals and plants that lived millions of years ago over time these organic remains were buried by layers of sand silt rock and other sediments the heat and pressure turning them into carbon rich fossil fuels today companies drill or mine for these energy sources to be burned in order to produce electricity or refined to use for heating or transportation in the united states about 80 of our domestic energy consumption originates from fossil fuel sources including oil coal and natural gas peak oil definition and theory the peak oil concept was first derived from marion king hubbert a research geophysicist who developed a theory that oil production follows a bell shaped curve hubbert worked for the shell oil company at the time and used the theory to advocate for alternative energy sources throughout the rest of his career he went on to work as a senior research geophysicist for the united states geological survey and also taught at stanford columbia and john hopkins university in 1956 hubbert presented a paper at a meeting of the american petroleum institute in which he hypothesized that u s petroleum production would peak between 1965 and 1975 the model showed the peak happening at 2 5 billion to 3 billion barrels per year and declining rapidly until 2150 when production would slow back down to 19th century levels he later predicted a similar trend after focusing his research on the global production of crude oil reporting that the world s oil production would peak in 2000 to roughly 12 billion barrels per year before disappearing completely in the 22nd century hubbert s primary goal with these findings was to highlight the superiority of nuclear power over fossil fuels citing that the heat obtainable from one gram of uranium or thorium was equal to that of three tons of coal or 13 stock tank barrels of petroleum specifically he wanted to utilize uranium deposits in the colorado plateau in 1998 petroleum geologists colin campbell and jean laherrère published a paper in scientific american that re examined hubbert s model for the first time since he d first presented it in 1956 by then hubbert s peak oil theory had been largely forgotten due to the low oil prices in the late 1980s convincing most people that the earth still held plenty of oil for future generations to use as a cheap energy source campbell and laherrère used the same bell shaped curve in their thesis only this time they predicted that the global oil production industry would peak sometime between 2004 and 2005 before beginning to decline sharply arguments against peak oil workers drill an oil well in southern california vince streano getty images most people consider oil to be a finite energy source crude oil exists in liquid of gaseous forms underground either in reservoirs pooled between sedimentary rocks or nearer to the earth s surface in tar pits that bubble to the outside after the crude oil is removed from the ground using methods like drilling or mining it is sent to a refinery to be separated into different petroleum products including gasoline jet fuel and the synthetic materials that are in almost everything we use from asphalt and tires to golf balls and house paint although the u s department of energy maintains emergency petroleum reserves it took millions of years for the earth to fill up with enough hydrocarbons to give us the fossil fuel resources we use today keeping crude oil from being considered a renewable energy source there are of course arguments against peak oil some of which rest on denying crude oil as a finite resource that will someday peak and eventually decline theoretically today s organic material could turn into more fossil fuels it would just take a very very long time since we have been so reliant on fossil fuels throughout history we already have a developed infrastructure that is set up for their use and oil companies are already experienced in extraction so they are cheaper to produce a lot of these arguments come from those who have the most to lose from a transition away from fossil fuels the big oil industry environmentalists refute with countless studies as to the enormous toll that fossil fuel extraction has on our landscapes and ecosystems threats to waterways toxic air pollution ocean acidification and the big one the large amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels and the subsequent contributions to climate change in 2019 for example fossil fuel combustion burning accounted for 74 of total greenhouse gas emissions in the united states companies like bp have vowed to change their business models based not on the fact that we are likely to run out of oil but rather that the world s transition to low carbon energy systems and renewable power will lower the population s dependency on oil shell another oil industry giant announced its intentions to start reducing oil production in february of 2021 the company had already reached its own peak oil and expected a future yearly output decline of 1 to 2 there is also the idea that the behavior changes like working from home traveling less and opting for public transportation we developed during the covid 19 pandemic will persist even after the bulk of the complications are behind us leading to even less oil demand this prediction is pretty valid considering that global demand for oil dropped by 29 million barrels a day in 2020 have we reached peak oil a hydraulic fracturing fracking oil rig in colorado grandriver getty images as it turns out hubbert s theory that the united state s oil production would peak in 1970 proved itself to be true that year the country produced 9 64 million barrels of crude oil and fell sharply downward after but then something happened that hubbert did not predict a good 40 years later in the 2010s oil began to climb upward rapidly hitting a brand new peak in 2018 at 10 96 million barrels per day a 17 increase from the previous year all of a sudden the united states was the world s top crude oil producer and continued to maintain the lead into 2019 and 2020 in 2020 the u s produced 15 of the world s crude oil mostly from texas and north dakota surpassing that of russia saudi arabia and iraq why did this happen with the advancement of technologies in drilling and hydraulic fracturing fracking not to mention the improvements to detecting or finding fossil fuels production growth has exceeded hubbert s initial calculations therein lies the controversy was hubbert truly correct in his prediction some energy analysts don t think so believing that peak oil was reached in the early 2000s rather than the 1970s others argue that the world hasn t come close to reaching peak oil production yet and that there are even more oil reserves lying undiscovered in the arctic south america and africa determining when peak oil will occur or if it already has is dependent on measuring the world s available oil reserves and future oil extraction technologies what will happen after peak oil peak oil doesn t necessarily mean that the world will run out of oil but rather that we will run out of cheap oil with a majority of our economy and everyday lives reliant on a steady supply of cheap oil and petroleum products the stakes are obviously quite high when it comes to peak oil theory a drop in oil supply would lead to a spike in oil and fuel prices which would affect everything from the agriculture industry to the transportation industry to the technology industry the consequences could be as serious as widespread famine as food supplies dwindle or a mass exodus from metropolitan areas as the oil supply drops at its worst peak oil could lead to massive public unrest geopolitical upheaval and the unraveling of the fabric of the global economy if the peak oil theory holds it only makes sense to begin investing in alternative and renewable sources of energy now treehugger
authored by david stockman via contra corner blog according to the mainstream narrative we were all born yesterday there is no such thing as context history or critical analysis just cherry picked short term data deltas which are held to be either awesome or at least much improved from last time that s why we predictably got this headline from the wall street journal with reference to today s june employment release which allegedly showed employers added 850 000 jobs last month stocks tick higher with strong jobs report well no it wasn t and they employers didn t in fact total hours worked in june actually declined from the may level and far more importantly were still down 4 4 from the pre covid peak in february 2020 when expressed in total hours there is absolutely nothing strong at all about the numbers to wit at the end of q2 2021 total hours employed in the nonfarm economy were still down 8 billion hours from the q4 2019 level that s right eight billion worker hours are mia yet the lazy shills at the wsj bloomberg reuters et al keep pumping out bilge about an awesome economic rebound actually what has never been noted notwithstanding the fact that it sits there in plain sight on the bls website is that dr fauci and his economy wreckers dug a far deeper hole in the main street labor market last spring than the narrative led you to believe at the pre covid peak in q4 2019 the nonfarm economy utilized 257 2 billion labor hours at an annualized rate but that plunged by nearly 12 to just 227 6 billion hours in q2 2020 so doing fauci co wiped out all of the aggregate nonfarm labor hours gain since q4 2011 that is to say it obliterated the awesome gains that had been contained in 102 monthly jobs friday reports in the interim and now after 4 trillion of freshly printed fiat cash and 6 trillion of stimmies and other bailouts and free stuff only 73 of the state imposed shrinkage of hours worked has been recovered as of june 2021 indeed the not at all awesome june jobs report was even more squirrely than usual our memory may fail but we are quite sure that back in the day june was the time when school let out the city kids all got to got to go to the beach and we farm kids got to pick the berries cherries sweetcorn cucumbers peaches and tomatoes as they took their turn in rotation perhaps no longer the bls claims that state local and private educational institutions went on a hiring binge during june bringing on a total of 269 000 new teachers to superintend presumably empty classrooms moreover when you add in the 192 000 bartenders and waiters who were rehired in june that adds up to 461 000 jobs or 54 of the ballyhooed 850 000 gain during the month meanwhile when it comes to the high pay high productivity jobs in construction manufacturing mining and energy not so much those sectors accounted for 23 338 million jobs in may and reported an increase of well 20k jobs in june that s a 0 0008 gain if you have your hp 12c set to four decimal places more importantly the 20 358 million goods producing jobs reported for june were still down by 780 000 from the pre covid peak in february 2020 and on the more appropriate and accurate hour based measurement employment in the goodsproducing sector truly remains mired in the dumps thus the index of aggregate hours worked for june black line was down by 6 4 from its 2019 interim high and off by 21 1 from its turn of the century level 23 1 from its all time peak in march 1979 and down by 4 8 from the level first attained in well may 1947 you can t make this up employment in the goods producing sector of the us economy has been dying on the vine for a half century and even as these jobs paid a living wage of 56 000 per annum in the month of june the purchasing power of those paychecks was no higher than january 1979 on an inflation adjusted basis purple line in summary after real wages in the goods producing sector doubled between 1947 and 1979 what has followed is one half century of real wage stagnation coupled with a 23 shrinkage of hours worked that alone should ixnay the strong and blow out descriptions that have been used hundreds of times in the interim to describe the jobs friday reports real weekly earnings versus aggregate weekly hours good producing sector 1947 2021 then again there is truly no mystery as to where the fed s endless injections of fiat credit have come out in the wash for three decades the nation s central bank has been primarily inflating financial asset prices on wall street not jobs incomes and prosperity on main street and that s especially been the case since the pre crisis peak in q4 2007 when today s 8 1 trillion fed balance sheet stood at just 800 billion for want of doubt you only need to ponder the message of the chart below in order to ascertain what an 8x increase in the fed s balance sheet has actually generated since q4 2007 cumulative gains have been as follows nonfarm labor hours red line 4 3 nonfarm output black line 24 8 nominal gdp blue line 50 nasdaq 100 purple line 600 q e d do these knuckleheads have the slightest idea that this is their true handiwork really is there any more proof needed that all of their lunatic money pumping never actually leaves the canyons of wall street cumulative gains since q4 2007 stocks versus main street so we perforce return to the central topic namely that the fed s moaar inflation mantra is one of the most perversely idiotic and inequitable public policies ever imposed by an arm of the state in fact hitting the averaged over time 2 00 inflation goal remains the only reason for the fed s 120 billion per month of what amounts to financial fraud after all with employers from coast to coast scrambling to find workers continued money pumping is surely not needed to further the so called full employment goal for crying out loud private employers are already on it we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us then again would it be too much trouble for these power intoxicated groupthinkinebriated dolts to examine exactly what their pro inflation policies have actually produced and we mean over an extensive period of time where the cumulative impact can be clearly observed well here s an inflation targeting stopper if there ever was one during the approximate half century since real hourly rates peaked in 1972 the average american worker has been on the mother of all treadmills change from 1972 through 2020 nominal hourly wages 533 real hourly earnings 2 2 it doesn t get any more dramatic than that even the proverbial squirrel in the cage would have gotten the bends after that 50 year journey to nowhere 50 year trend nominal versus inflation adjusted hourly earnings as is evident in the chart above the fed made a cataclysmic mistake in the 1990s and thereafter due to the high inflation of the 1970s and to a lesser extent through the 1980s nominal hourly wage had tripled between 1972 and 1995 when mr deng s shiny new export factories were cranking up with ultra cheap labor drained out of china s endless rice paddies and peasant villages and thank you all that 200 gain in nominal wages had not done domestic workers one damn bit of good in 1995 real hourly wages purple line were actually 18 below the level that had obtained in 1972 when fed chairman arthur burns to his everlasting shame grabbed his ankles upon nixon s presentation of what amounted to an election year bar of soap nixon got his temporarily booming economy and landslide election victory of course but that had also set up the hard hats nixon labor dems and forgotten middle class like sitting ducks vis a vis the new chinese and mexican et al export factories by the mid1990s the dollar wage gap was now enormous so what was needed was deflation of domestic prices wages and costs not more of the same as it happened under greenspan s phony disinflation policies and then bernanke s formal inflation targeting regime thereafter the domestic price level was inflated by another 70 or 2 14 per annum between 1995 and 2020 what that meant was fully two thirds of the gain in average hourly wages during that period was eaten up by domestic inflation when the order of the day should have been wringing out some of the staggering 240 increase in the domestic price level that had occurred between 1972 and 1995 yes inflation adjusted hourly wage rates purple line above did manage to crawl back to their 1972 starting point by 2020 but at the expense of another doubling of nominal wage rates that is to say the fed s idiotic pro inflation policies drove the wage gap between domestic factories and the new low wage export economies dramatically wider in all average dollar wages in the us were 533 higher by 2020 than they had been when nixon destroyed the gold backed dollar in 1971 1972 needless to say when the average domestic wage rate went from 3 90 per hour in 1972 to 24 68 per hour in 2020 at absolutely no purchasing power benefit to workers it left corporate executives with no choice except to outsource and off shore to the maximum feasible extent and that set in motion the hollowing out of america s industrial economy the chart below is surely the smoking gun implicit in the fed s faustian bargain that is it got its fetishistic 2 00 inflation and showered the household sector with cheap debt to augment living standards that would have otherwise diminished owing to the export of good jobs as a result real consumption spending pce for goods rose by 87 or 3 0 per annum between q1 2002 and q1 2021 yet during the same 19 year period the industrial production index for manufacturing rose by only 9 or barely 0 41 per year needless to say we are not talking here about some marginal item that is better produced abroad where some venue has comparative advantage as adam smith originally saw it to the contrary this is the entire goods economy and for all practical purposes the growth in consumption of goods during this century to date has been supplied by imports it is no wonder therefore that the burned out zones of the rust belt voted for high tariff man trump twice real pce for durables versus manufactured goods output q1 2002 q1 2021 in throwing good producing workers under the china import bus the powers that be urged them to make up the difference by buying stock wall street had plenty of rapidly inflating shares on offer and the donald could not stop telling workers to check their 401ks but here s the thing to ride the drastically inflated stock market higher you had to have material savings to invest and growing wages to allocate to investment rather than current consumption alas american workers had neither when greenspan was nominated to head the fed in july 1987 the average wage was 9 12 per hour and the nasdaq 100 index stood at 196 that is it took about 22 hours of work to buy the index at the close of june 2021 the average hourly wage as we learned this am was 25 68 per hour while the nasdaq 100 had taken flight to another financial planet posting at 14 554 that is it now took 566 hours of work to buy the index or 26x more than when greenspan inaugurated wealth effects monetary policy to paraphrase a famous black panther slogan of the 1960s trickle down might have been televised on cnbc but it most definitely did not happen number of worker hours to buy the nasdaq 100 1987 2021 what happened of course is them s that had got our friend tim knight who publishes at the must read slope of hope captured the moral of this

dannii minogue offers a slightly nervous smile when i warn her i ll only be asking her questions about the 1990s during our interview after all it s been 21 long years since the decade ended there is of course a reason for this step back in time to quote another minogue s famous song dannii s just been announced as host of the oldskool 90s hits station and podcast series the 90s with dannii minogue both available now via the listnr app but while she says the 90s whirlwind top of the pops appearances new york recording sessions and ibiza nightclub gigs are a world away from her typical 2021 routine of school runs with son ethan back in her melbourne hometown dannii s memories of the decade are still fresh front row at fashion week with kylie and prince meeting and instantly feeling sorry for princess diana stripping off for playboy to pay the bills dannii s got 90s stories yep that s dannii nick carter eat your heart out and she s embracing the retro fun with her new gig check the video above of several truly unrecognisable danniis busting out their best boy band moves to everybody backstreet s back let s start at the beginning 1990 was the year your debut album came out and you moved to the uk i d just finished a year on home and away and it was absolutely massive over there they said why don t you come over we d love for you to promote one single i went over there with a suitcase packed thinking i was going for three weeks and i came back 22 years later i think that if i d known what was coming i would have been too scared to jump on that train it s a familiar pilgrimage for a young aussie to move to london but you were doing it as a pop star early 90s dannii bright eyed and high haired related why dannii refused to use her masked singer trailer it was crazy my sister was already there and she d been in neighbours she d released a lot of music already it was absolute hysteria i came from australia where i grew up on tv and everybody knew me from young talent time and then i went to london and then i was the girl from home and away who s kylie s sister and i had a good five years of that every introduction was you re kylie s sister which she used to get back in australia when i was on young talent time so it was a weird flip and reverse the hardest question was people would always say oh so you re doing music now because your sister does it and i said no i ve been singing professionally since i was 10 years old but great cool did that make it more important to make sure that you crafted your own sound was anybody over there saying just get in the studio with stock aitken waterman it worked for kylie dannii right started on aussie tv first but in the uk she was kylie s sister i know kylie had a pretty hard time even getting into pwl studios on her first trip over there they kept her waiting in a waiting room for like a week and she almost didn t record with them but my passion growing up i was the biggest fan of janet jackson and you can see in my early videos i m just fanning and trying to be the best janet jackson that i can be when i went into mushroom records they knew that i loved more of an r b jam and they were sifting through finding songs one came from a couple of writers in the bronx and it was dannii s 1990 debut single love and kisses they said would you like to record this and there was money in music so i was put on a plane to go to new york to record with them we just started recording more and more until it made up an album you ve always been quite aware of the power of a good image change the this is it video in 1993 was a big shake up and a big hit suddenly you re in this day go beach world dannii frolicking on a beach with then partner julian mcmahon in the this is it video related dannii minogue reveals show she s refused to appear on many times well i d been living in london and it was always grey and drizzly and cold and as i say there was money in the music business back then so they were like we were thinking maybe you could shoot this video on a beach somewhere in california and i m like i m in take me there i m going to leave this rain for a bit and get on a beach i was just buzzing i was missing that australian beach life and the sunshine and just soaking in every bit of it i think the video did capture that really well because it always takes people back another image and sound change came with the girl album in 97 all i wanna do was the first hit written by brian higgins just before he hit it big with cher s believe a bleached blonde makeover for the dance focused girl album that album was all about just working with new people brian higgins is one of those i remember being in the studio and brian was saying i ve got this tune have a listen to it see what you think and i said i don t know do you think it s me let s just record it and see if it sounds any good i don t want to mess up your song it sounds brilliant i just don t know if i can fit into it you look back on those moments now and you re like wow i really didn t know and sometimes with music you ve got to go out of your comfort zone and yeah it was very pivotal a lot of great things came from that album even though it wasn t the biggest chart success as an album it s very much loved you mention chart success the life of a jobbing pop star must be stressful when so much hinges on your latest chart position joy and stress in abundance amazing moments like the amount of times i got to perform on top of the pops i ended up even hosting the show years later that led to royal command performances and you re suddenly backstage at the palladium waiting to meet a very young princess diana in a line up with the rolling stones nothing prepares you what did you say to diana i have no idea she was very young she was very nervous they were her first royal engagements where she was on her own and so she was dressed up i remember looking at her thinking you look like you dressed up as a woman who s 80 years old it was really like she d been styled by the queen s mother it wasn t until after that she found her fashion mojo and changed she was just the little princess diana with the chin down looking up at you and i felt sorry for her because you could feel the nerves but there s no book or manual to being a pop star there s so many moments that crop up and you re like don t really know what to do in this situation i m just going to have to make it up as i go along whereas most other jobs you study for and you plan for but with pop music anything can happen i mean like going in and seeing alexander mcqueen fashion shows and sitting front row and next to me is my sister and then there s prince the three of us the same height of course dannii circa 2021 there s no manual to being a pop star there is no manual to being a pop star but you did have kylie did you lean on her for advice on how to navigate the job we had to lean on each other and also our rock is our brother brendan he is a news cameraman and he s always there to be the voice of reason and to really bring it back into perspective for us bad days were probably more to do with really being hounded by press whereas we would speak to my brother and his day was being in afghanistan trying not to step on a landmine and you go okay that puts it all in perspective i ve just had my little moan i m ready to go back to my amazing job being dressed up by stylists and having makeup artists arrive at my home and performing for royalty a pivotal moment for you came right in the middle of the 90s posing nude for playboy in 95 you said afterwards the pictures looked great and it paid a few bills but were you as relaxed going into it dannii needed the money playboy offered but she also loved the photos i desperately needed money i got married very young dannii married actor julian mcmahon in 1994 aged 22 and i was supporting both of us my husband at the time was trying to break into america i was supporting him in america me living in london and flying between the two cities and i just got into debt i was now divorced in debt they said do you want to do this shoot and i m

george akerlof won the nobel prize in economics in 2001 his paper the market for lemons is a seminal work in the discipline he wrote it in 1967 as a fresh assistant professor at berkeley having completed his phd at mit in 1966 the paper was rejected by three prestigious journals by two on the grounds of triviality and by the third on the grounds that it would upend the then prevailing understanding of economics it was finally published by the quarterly journal of economics in 1970 the market for lemons is about markets and transactions in akerlof s own words it concerns how horse traders respond to the natural question if he wants to sell that horse do i really want to buy it akerlof uses the example of the used car market to illustrate the point in any given market some cars will inevitably be of bad quality lemons in the slang and some of good quality peaches any seller as the current owner of the car always has better information about the quality and inherent value of the car than any buyer a buyer contemplating a purchase does not know if the car is a peach or a lemon let us say the fair value of a peach is rs2 000 000 and that of a lemon rs1 000 000 the buyer under the circumstances can expect equally to get either a peach or a lemon and will therefore offer an average of the two prices ie rs1 500 000 at this price the owners of the lemons will be happy to sell but the owners of the peaches will withhold their cars from the market since the price offered is less than the fair value there is thus a market malfunction we can take it a step further if a certain number of peaches are withheld by the sellers buyers will revise their expectations of the average proportion of lemons to peaches and will bid even lower than rs1 500 000 the malfunction intensifies the root cause of the problem is of course the existence of unequal information economists have a fancy phrase for it information asymmetry information asymmetry may make the investor hesitant and therefore the transaction less likely any market malfunction is serious because it results in a loss of economic efficiency transactions which could have added value to both parties do not happen in response markets the institutions rules and regulations which govern them have evolved over time to become more efficient with positive repercussions for economic growth and development let us take a leap from the used car market to financial markets to see this more closely financial transactions are highly susceptible to information asymmetries because of their inherent complexity financial markets for all of their considerable sins offer insights into the nature and role of markets in general by virtue of their size scope and sophistication financial markets at their most basic provide a mechanism to move money from those who have a surplus to those who have a productive need for money but do not have a surplus financial markets as any other market are a central meeting place for buyers and sellers of funds these meeting places can be physical or increasingly virtual the presence of a large number of participants ensures that buying and selling is easier liquidity the quantum and value of transactions that take place is an important aspect of markets the more liquidity you have the more efficient the market transparency is another key factor transactions in financial markets are recorded and the information disseminated information asymmetry is to a large extent mitigated since each transaction takes place at a certain price at a certain time markets give critical information about the value of traded assets this information is more valuable since it is arrived at not in isolation but as the net result of the aggregate buying and selling decisions of multiple participants economists have a fancy phrase for this too price discovery let us take a basic financial transaction say there is an entrepreneur who is looking to sell shares in her company to outside investors for fresh capital the entrepreneur will always possess more information on the health of the company than any potential investor will the position is exactly the same as the seller and buyer in the used car example the entrepreneur may offer the shares of her company at a certain price the potential investor has no way to judge the fair value the information asymmetry may make the investor hesitant and therefore the transaction less likely let us now contrast this with a share transaction at a formal financial market like the pakistan stock exchange any company listed on the psx is required by law to disclose certain information publicly this includes quarterly financial results an annual audited result and all material information which can have an impact on the business and its value the requirement for information disclosure and its mandatory dissemination by the exchange mitigates the information asymmetry problem it enables investors to make informed investment decisions furthermore the share price information is publicly available indeed during psx trading hours it is available in real time there can be no disagreement between a buyer or seller over its price at a given time the buyer and seller may differ on whether the price is a fair valuation in which case either may decide not to do the transaction however this will not be due to a lack of information markets promote greater economic activity if markets are non existent or inefficient such activity is starved with consequences for economic development this holds true for financial markets goods markets and commodity markets the latter are a particularly vexatious issue at present in pakistan their malfunction due largely to government intervention one of the historical lessons from centrally planned economies and why they failed is that there were no markets and thus not enough information to make optimal economic decisions the writer is a financial markets professional and a teacher twitter samirahmed14 published in dawn july 5th 2021

don t miss out on the headlines from music followed categories will be added to my news dannii minogue offers a slightly nervous smile when i warn her i ll only be asking her questions about the 1990s during our interview after all it s been 21 long years since the decade ended there is of course a reason for this step back in time to quote another minogue s famous song dannii s just been announced as host of the oldskool 90s hits station and podcast series the 90s with dannii minogue both available now via the listnr app but while she says the 90s whirlwind top of the pops appearances new york recording sessions and ibiza nightclub gigs are a world away from her typical 2021 routine of school runs with son ethan back in her melbourne hometown dannii s memories of the decade are still fresh front row at fashion week with kylie and prince meeting and instantly feeling sorry for princess diana stripping off for playboy to pay the bills dannii s got 90s stories yep that s dannii nick carter eat your heart out and she s embracing the retro fun with her new gig check the video above of several truly unrecognisable danniis busting out their best boy band moves to everybody backstreet s back let s start at the beginning 1990 was the year your debut album came out and you moved to the uk i d just finished a year on home and away and it was absolutely massive over there they said why don t you come over we d love for you to promote one single i went over there with a suitcase packed thinking i was going for three weeks and i came back 22 years later i think that if i d known what was coming i would have been too scared to jump on that train it s a familiar pilgrimage for a young aussie to move to london but you were doing it as a pop star early 90s dannii bright eyed and high haired related why dannii refused to use her masked singer trailer it was crazy my sister was already there and she d been in neighbours she d released a lot of music already it was absolute hysteria i came from australia where i grew up on tv and everybody knew me from young talent time and then i went to london and then i was the girl from home and away who s kylie s sister and i had a good five years of that every introduction was you re kylie s sister which she used to get back in australia when i was on young talent time so it was a weird flip and reverse the hardest question was people would always say oh so you re doing music now because your sister does it and i said no i ve been singing professionally since i was 10 years old but great cool did that make it more important to make sure that you crafted your own sound was anybody over there saying just get in the studio with stock aitken waterman it worked for kylie dannii right started on aussie tv first but in the uk she was kylie s sister i know kylie had a pretty hard time even getting into pwl studios on her first trip over there they kept her waiting in a waiting room for like a week and she almost didn t record with them but my passion growing up i was the biggest fan of janet jackson and you can see in my early videos i m just fanning and trying to be the best janet jackson that i can be when i went into mushroom records they knew that i loved more of an r b jam and they were sifting through finding songs one came from a couple of writers in the bronx and it was dannii s 1990 debut single love and kisses they said would you like to record this and there was money in music so i was put on a plane to go to new york to record with them we just started recording more and more until it made up an album you ve always been quite aware of the power of a good image change the this is it video in 1993 was a big shake up and a big hit suddenly you re in this day go beach world dannii frolicking on a beach with then partner julian mcmahon in the this is it video related dannii minogue reveals show she s refused to appear on many times well i d been living in london and it was always grey and drizzly and cold and as i say there was money in the music business back then so they were like we were thinking maybe you could shoot this video on a beach somewhere in california and i m like i m in take me there i m going to leave this rain for a bit and get on a beach i was just buzzing i was missing that australian beach life and the sunshine and just soaking in every bit of it i think the video did capture that really well because it always takes people back another image and sound change came with the girl album in 97 all i wanna do was the first hit written by brian higgins just before he hit it big with cher s believe a bleached blonde makeover for the dance focused girl album that album was all about just working with new people brian higgins is one of those i remember being in the studio and brian was saying i ve got this tune have a listen to it see what you think and i said i don t know do you think it s me let s just record it and see if it sounds any good i don t want to mess up your song it sounds brilliant i just don t know if i can fit into it you look back on those moments now and you re like wow i really didn t know and sometimes with music you ve got to go out of your comfort zone and yeah it was very pivotal a lot of great things came from that album even though it wasn t the biggest chart success as an album it s very much loved you mention chart success the life of a jobbing pop star must be stressful when so much hinges on your latest chart position joy and stress in abundance amazing moments like the amount of times i got to perform on top of the pops i ended up even hosting the show years later that led to royal command performances and you re suddenly backstage at the palladium waiting to meet a very young princess diana in a line up with the rolling stones nothing prepares you what did you say to diana i have no idea she was very young she was very nervous they were her first royal engagements where she was on her own and so she was dressed up i remember looking at her thinking you look like you dressed up as a woman who s 80 years old it was really like she d been styled by the queen s mother it wasn t until after that she found her fashion mojo and changed she was just the little princess diana with the chin down looking up at you and i felt sorry for her because you could feel the nerves but there s no book or manual to being a pop star there s so many moments that crop up and you re like don t really know what to do in this situation i m just going to have to make it up as i go along whereas most other jobs you study for and you plan for but with pop music anything can happen i mean like going in and seeing alexander mcqueen fashion shows and sitting front row and next to me is my sister and then there s prince the three of us the same height of course dannii circa 2021 there s no manual to being a pop star there is no manual to being a pop star but you did have kylie did you lean on her for advice on how to navigate the job we had to lean on each other and also our rock is our brother brendan he is a news cameraman and he s always there to be the voice of reason and to really bring it back into perspective for us bad days were probably more to do with really being hounded by press whereas we would speak to my brother and his day was being in afghanistan trying not to step on a landmine and you go okay that puts it all in perspective i ve just had my little moan i m ready to go back to my amazing job being dressed up by stylists and having makeup artists arrive at my home and performing for royalty a pivotal moment for you came right in the middle of the 90s posing nude for playboy in 95 you said afterwards the pictures looked great and it paid a few bills but were you as relaxed going into it dannii needed the money playboy offered but she also loved the photos i desperately needed money i got married very young dannii married actor julian mcmahon in 1994 aged 22 and i was supporting both of us my husband at the time was trying to break into america i was supporting him in america me living in london and flying between the two cities and i just got into debt i was now divorced in debt they said do you want to do this shoot and i m like my family are loaning me money i don t want to be that person i have to pay them back so for me it was everything my dad didn t want me to do it he tried so hard to talk me out of it he s like you have to live with this for the rest of your life it s not just about paying off the debt now but i did want to do it when the magazine came out it was like this is what i wanted it to be and i still look back and they re beautiful pictures and i m like damn that s really good i did the shoot when i had that washboard stomach i really wish i had that again now info dannii minogue hosts the oldskool 90s hits station and the exclusive podcast series the 90s with dannii minogue both available now via the listnr app

by vicki shabo and marcia st hilaire finn when we were testifying last month at a congressional hearing one of us as a paid leave and gender equity expert and the other as the owner of a small and growing child care center business we encountered a common and pernicious myth that american moms could and should choose to stay home to raise their children if they did all these pesky problems with paid leave and child care wouldn t even exist yet as we ve so clearly seen this year when millions of parents have interrupted work or left jobs to provide care to children it s women who have disproportionately taken on the extra load this was the result of a major crisis and spurred major disruption to families incomes housing food security and more we hope it will now catalyze public investments in paid leave and child care that were badly needed before the pandemic and essential for rebuilding in its wake some conservatives are advancing a revisionist history of the good old days that is not based on today s realities or even those of the past at the hearing for instance sen mitt romney of utah waxed nostalgic about his childhood at home with his mother and said democratic proposals had a significant bias toward getting women and men into the workforce his own proposals however assume that most families have the same choices his well off family had but they don t because wages are too low the cost of living is too high and public investments in middle and working class families are too paltry romney s child care plan would do nothing to help parents who work outside their homes or find quality affordable child care and it would eliminate much needed food and cash assistance support for low income families his paid parental leave plan would require them to trade away some of their future social security benefits to pay for the leave and would provide no relief for the majority of workers who need paid leave to deal with a serious personal or family health issue if we truly want to give parents choices we need to offer options for providing and receiving care while meeting household expenses and saving for emergencies and the future these needs would be meaningfully addressed with significant investments like those outlined in president joe biden s american families plan which would create a national permanent paid family and medical leave program substantially expand access to high quality affordable child care and prekindergarten and extend the enhanced child tax credit first included in the american rescue plan biden signed in march family challenges are a national as well as an individual economic concern before the pandemic in january 2020 women made up more than half of the workforce for the first time in a decade although as treasury secretary janet yellen has noted women s labor force participation was low even pre pandemic relative to other high wealth countries today we ve erased decades of progress for women falling to 1980s levels due largely to the caregiving needs of the country defaulting to an unpaid plan b aka moms during the pandemic many did not have any choice but to stay home some of those who did so were able to avert serious hardships or financial devastation only because of federal relief programs adopted last year on a bipartisan basis including extended unemployment emergency paid leave and food and housing assistance women s earnings are essential to their households in 2017 mothers were primary or sole breadwinners in 41 of families and co breadwinners in 23 women were even more likely to be key breadwinners in families with low incomes and in families of color mothers wages buy food pay for gas and utilities and save for the future when mothers and fathers have paid leave they are better able to care for their children in the early weeks and months of life which produces better health outcomes for children and mothers as well as higher rates of labor force attachment and higher wages for moms in the year after a child s birth when men take leave they take on more caregiving over time which promotes gender equity at home and at work when parents have access to high quality affordable child care their ability to work increases and so does their household income and higher household income is correlated with numerous measures of better outcomes for children s health well being and educational success wishing away a need for public investments in paid leave also ignores personal and family care reasons people need paid leave from recovering from surgery to caring for an ill or disabled loved one it also leaves behind small business owners who like one of us marcia has personally paid out of pocket to help ensure her employees do not go without pay when they are ill the hardship on employees and on small business is why she supported the paid family and medical leave program for washington d c and why she like multitudes of small business owners supports a national paid leave solution it would be a national tragedy if america were to come through the pandemic without enacting comprehensive national policies it would be even more foolish if the reason we didn t is because some politicians have personal histories or notions that don t reflect the reality of most families in this country today their vision of america is not today s america and for many people it was not yesterday s either we must invest in care if we want to build back better vicki shabo is a senior fellow on paid leave policy and strategy at the new america marcia st hilaire finn

scattered across the mountainous and beautiful appalachian landscape lie the remnants of what once powered the world coal mines these remains are the legacy of mining but what will be the future of these vast open spaces across an area that is among the nontropical world s most biodiverse regions and what will be the future for people who live and work there carl zipper professor emeritus in the college of agriculture and life sciences school of plant and environmental sciences co edited appalachia s coal mined landscapes resources and communities in a new energy era with jeff skousen a professor of soil science in the division of plant and soil sciences at west virginia university after careers researching environmental effects of fossil fuel production including appalachian coal mining zipper and skousen collaborated with multiple authors from across appalachia to produce the book which was published in late 2020 through springer much of the coalfield work and research conducted by zipper and colleagues at virginia tech was through the powell river project a public private research and outreach partnership between virginia tech other educational institutions environmental organizations and natural resource industries that serve the southwest virginia coalfield region according to zipper and other book contributors more than 3 800 square miles of appalachia and more than 10 percent of the land area in the most heavily mined counties have been surface mined for coal these lands have altered soils and typically host plant communities that differ from the region s native forests often with nonnative invasive plants they also give rise to waters that carry pollutants from the mined areas for decades these resource effects also impact animals as both land based wildlife and aquatic biota in mining affected areas differ from those of the region s still extensive native forests human communities also bear the influence of the region s mining history as economic educational and human health indicators in the most intensive coal mining areas are below levels of nearby areas where mining did not occur or was less intensive these effects remain evident even as coal mining declines to levels last seen in the late 19th century despite impairment by mining the region s extensive and mostly unused mined lands have the potential for conversions to uses that support ecological and human needs where the terrain is favorable seeding fertilization and vegetation management can convert degraded mine sites to livestock pasture mined lands occupied by invasive plants can be made more similar to native ecosystems by controlling nonnative species mitigating soil limitations and planting native trees degraded mine site streams can be rebuilt to restore water function and aquatic habitats if geologically stable and relatively flat lying the mined lands can support housing projects industrial sites and other large scale building structures because of wide availability and lack of competing uses mined lands could be good locations for renewable energy projects although these conversions are technically feasible zipper said they require expertise and often signiﬁcant expense appalachian coal was instrumental in america s development as a nation but coal mining is the region s past not its future yet as the region looks to the future it bears the legacy of past mining zipper said it s easy to lose sight of the big picture of appalachian mining zipper continued we want people to understand the important role of appalachian coal in the development of this nation but also the challenges faced by coal mining communities as they look to the future and how the region s ability to meet those challenges going forward is influenced by the legacy effects of its coal mining past

by dominique patton wei county china reuters agrichemicals giant syngenta group is rapidly expanding its rollout of farm services in china ahead of a huge stock market listing as it seeks to meet surging demand from farmers crucial to beijing s increasing focus on food security the world s biggest crop protection maker and no 3 seed supplier says it is boosting grain yields and raising farmers incomes just as the pandemic fuels government worries about food supplies and pushes up the cost of key farm materials that means opportunity for swiss based chinese backed syngenta to grab market share in a fragmented farm chemicals market positioning the company for growth as chinese farmers expand their holdings the group aims to raise 10 billion by listing in shanghai in what is likely to be the year s biggest market flotation but syngenta acknowledges it faces tremendous competition in the markets in which it operates rivals include bayer ag and corteva inc as well chinese firms selling agronomy services to the nation s farmers before we sold pesticides seeds and fertiliser now we re a farm services company we sell service and technology said mao feng chief brand manager for syngenta group china s modern agriculture platform map and digital agriculture map is to receive some 12 of the ipo proceeds for expansion according to a prospectus filed on friday selling individual products we had hit the ceiling there was no more room mao told reporters last month in china crop yields lag far behind western countries even as growers use three times as much fertiliser while farms in the vast country are tiny by global standards averaging half a hectare compared with 180 hectares 440 acres in the united states bigger better so syngenta is trying to help itself by helping farmers like liu ligang liu who farms 20 hectares 50 acres in wei county in the northern province of hebei has doubled his contracted land over the past four years one of a growing number of chinese farmers seeking to become professional growers to date 37 million hectares have been contracted out some 30 of china s arable land such expansion brings more risk for farmers requiring more knowledge and sophisticated services liu has just harvested some 7 500 kg of wheat per hectare 6 600 pounds per acre up 25 from last year and 10 above his neighbours he says thanks to syngenta s map service which helped him manage pests before it was only when the disease came that the pesticide was started he said that is too late and it can be advanced now in addition to supplying seeds and chemicals map runs training centres across china and about 900 demonstration farms showing growers what produces the best yields in a given location farmers get free management of their land and in return buy the firm s products or others recommended by its agronomists map tripled its revenues to more than 280 million in the first quarter from a year earlier adding 40 centres to reach 365 nationwide it contributed 4 of group revenues up from 1 in the same period a year earlier the business also makes money selling crops and fresh produce to such customers as alibaba group s hema supermarkets and dole food co they pay above market prices for map farmers quality and the traceability of its digital platform revenues are expected to break 1 billion this year and hit some 4 5 billion by 2025 according to one industry estimate competition but other companies are also trying to capitalise on the increasing scale and sophistication of chinese farming bayer for example is advertising for a china head of digital agriculture beijing based ican has built digital crop models to guide farmers through plot selection planning and harvesting it claims its modelling can increase yields while reducing fertiliser use sales of fertiliser and crop chemicals in china were 24 billion in 2018 rabobank estimates more than the 20 billion in the united states while seed in each country was worth around 12 billion input markets are more fragmented in china offering huge room for share growth syngenta generated less than 5 of its sales in china before it was acquired by state run chemchina in 2017 it had less than 1 of the seed market though a more significant 7 share of crop chemicals map is aided in reaching farmers through group affiliate sinofert holdings china s largest fertiliser producer and distributor its 30 000 retail stores reach farmers working 95 of the country s farmland reckons fitch but china s small farm sizes push up logistics costs and progress in consolidating land has been slower than expected said thomas luedi senior partner at bain co in shanghai we found that to break even we needed to have 5 000 hectares of farmland in one town using our service said an industry executive who previously helmed a farm services firm syngenta said scattered farming and incomplete infrastructure and supply chains hold back all services firms but it is working with farm co operatives and trying to standardise production across entire villages to reduce the impact of fragmented landholdings 1 6 4764 chinese yuan renminbi reporting by dominique patton additional

article article body small businesses can expect the reserve bank of australia rba to prioritise lowering the unemployment rate before increasing interest rates ahead of tomorrow s board meeting like other central banks around the world the rba responded the economic shock of the pandemic by cutting its interest rate to near zero purchasing a significant amount of government bonds and offering low cost funding to the banking system richard holden professor of economics at the university of new south wales business school says the rba won t change the cash rate which is currently 0 1 when deciding on monetary policy in tuesday s board meeting they won t change the cash rate and i don t think they re going to meaningfully walk back from their strategy on government bond purchases holden tells smartcompany the rba has already purchased two 100 billion rounds of government bonds and is expected to continue with future purchases but whether it will buy a third round of the same value is unclear i think that s still an open question as to how they are going to tweak holden says the rba has committed to keeping official interest rates close to zero until unemployment drops towards 4 and there s an increase in real wages growth and inflation unlike in the united states the australian economy is yet to show any meaningful sings of inflation rising there s obviously much more of a sign in the us but on the other hand the us has had very significant fiscal stimulus even relative to australia s and the biden administration announced plans for even more spending holden says holden says while there are early signs that the rba s strategy will lead to higher inflation there are no signs of inflation getting out of control whatever the outcome of the central bank s meeting tomorrow holden says small and medium businesses can have confidence that the rba is committed to providing the necessary monetary policy for the economy to rebound the rba also recognises that the economy wasn t in great shape in late 2019 before covid and it s trying to get the economy in better shape than that he says in august last year the rba predicted unemployment to peak at 10 in december 2020 and gdp growth wasn t expected to return to pre covid levels until march 2022 however the australian economy recovered from the pandemic better than expected with unemployment reaching 6 6 in december 2020 before falling to 5 1 by may 2021 in this context jenny lambert chief executive of the australian chamber of commerce and industry says it s unrealistic for the rba to maintain its position that it doesn t expect to raise interest rates until 2024 these forecasts have been proven too conservative as the economy has recovered to be 1 1 above pre covid levels in march 2021 lambert says lambert says most market economist now expect interest rates to rise between late 2022 and early 2023 we would like to see the rba provide a clearer indication of when it expects to begin to raise the cash rate subject to the covid situation continuing to improve she says

if you go what chicago presented by theatre aspen where hurst theatre rio grande park when through july 22 how much 80 120 tickets theatreaspen org few industries have been harder hit by the pandemic than the performing arts and none more so than the theater theater needs a live audience for survival the way a deep sea diver needs an oxygen tank so when the curtain went up thursday night on chicago the musical launching theatre aspen s 38th season it was as if 15 months of bottled up talent passion and longing all came rushing out in one big jubilant wave for the next 100 minutes the show runs sans intermission a rapt audibly gleeful audience was swept aloft by this air tight production of broadway s iconic tony award winning musical in terms of sheer entertainment value there s little not to love about chicago and kudos to theatre aspen producing director jed bernstein for christening the return to new normal with it based on a handful of actual murders by women and the media circus they generated the story is set in 1920s prohibition era chicago rife with flappers and floozies shysters and shakedowns corruption abounds celebrity reigns supreme and in the court of public opinion he she they who make the most noise wins fold in some burlesque and a jazz hands aflutter leggy ensemble moving to bob fosse s steamy choreography and it s easy to see why chicago holds the record as broadway s longest running musical the story follows the plight of roxie julie kavanagh returning for her third theatre aspen season an attention starved wannabe vaudevillian who shoots her lover dead for trying to break up with her roxie s impulsiveness lands her in cook county jail where she meets velma jessica crouch in her theatre aspen debut burlesque star two time killer and chicago press corps darling the women become instant arch rivals vying for headlines and public sympathy the zeitgeist of the day suggests trials are won or lost based not on evidence but on public opinion as roxie s ethically challenged attorney billy flynn a suitably slick nathan cockroft later demonstrates control the narrative and you control the outcome a hundred years later it s impossible not to connect the dots to today s celebrity obsessed news as entertainment political climate in addition to a consummate cast of triple threats what makes this production soar is veteran theatre aspen director choreographer mark martino s meticulous staging and drum tight pacing interestingly the action all takes place on a proscenium stage when theatre aspen s intimate venue naturally lends itself to a ¾ thrust stage an arrangement in which the audience surrounds the action on three sides one can only surmise the decision was a pandemic driven effort to maintain distance between actors and audience rehearsals would have begun weeks ago when social distancing and mask mandates were still in flux regardless aided by the dynamic scenic and lighting design of david l arsenault and gifford williams respectively the show is visually pleasing and all the more impressive for the inherent staging constraints under eric alsford s music direction and excellent live accompaniment from the offstage band number after number 20 songs in all sizzled and popped hot as an egg on a recent portland sidewalk opening night s already high wattage cranked up a notch in scene three with the entrance of galyana castillo as matron mama morton castillo planted a flag and took command of the stage belting out when you re good to mama other standouts included the sexy cell block tango and we both reached for the gun in which roxie perched on her fast talking lawyer billy flynn s knee plays dummy to flynn s ventriloquist it s a tricky scene requiring razor sharp reactions and kavanagh and cockroft nailed it martino s amusing marionette ish choreography and the ensemble s impeccable timing drew hoots of approval from the house jayke workman deserves special mention as mary sunshine the chicago tribune reporter who helps stir public support for our villainous vixens workman s surprise packed performance knocks it out of wrigley field ben liebert is equally memorable as roxie s downtrodden husband amos hart liebert previously seen in theatre aspen s avenue q and the full monty manages that rare trick in musical theater real emotional honesty he takes a stock character in

this is by no means the central expectation for those forecasting the uk and scottish economies but as stressed in a recent report from the bank for international settlements it is sufficient of a genuine risk scenario and one posing significant downside risks to justify the attention of business and households as the recovery unfolds in the uk the implementation of policy related to inflation is primarily the responsibility of the bank of england s monetary policy committee mpc at its meeting in late june the mpc noted that consumer price index cpi inflation had trebled from 0 7 in february to 2 1 in may the may figure is just a smidgeon above the mpc s 2 target the committee expects cpi inflation to exceed 3 for a temporary period while gross domestic product gdp growth accelerates after which it anticipates that growth and inflation will fall back as a consequence of this belief that above target inflation will be a transitory and short term phenomenon the mpc emphasised that it will focus on the medium term prospects for inflation rather than factors that are likely to be transient and does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2 target sustainably in other words the encouraging expectation is that growth will slow naturally as capacity is used up via enhanced investment and consumption at the same time the mpc expects short term inflation pressures related to higher oil and other commodity prices to dissipate given this benign expectation and refreshingly moderate policy stance we can expect a continuation of ultra low interest rates for several more months well into 2022 at the least indeed interest rates should only rise from their historically low levels in the medium term if growth continues at an above trend level when excess capacity has been used up and domestic and global trends result in inflation above target for an extended period i e a risk of a dangerous inflation spiral in the longer term the mpc is anticipating a period of rapid economic catch up post pandemic then a return to growth around trend with inflation remaining close to target at this stage the committee could breathe a deep sigh of relief slowly but steadily return interest rates to more normal levels and gently unwind other aspects of monetary loosening which have been so crucial over the past 18 months the other half of macroeconomic policy is on the fiscal front taxes and public expenditure led by the uk treasury and the chancellor they will be constantly aware that uk public sector debt is at a record high of some 2 2 trillion if the forecasts from the office for budget responsibility continue to match those of the mpc as described above then the chancellor should be in no rush to make any sharp increases in taxation and should oversee only a gentle easing back of government expenditure this will imply government borrowing remaining at high levels for two three or more years ahead essential to continue to encourage consumption and investment while providing clearly necessary support for inter alia health education reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the levelling up agenda the last thing our economy needs in the period ahead is another era of austerity but the inflation risk could have implications for fiscal policy if the mpc sees it as necessary to raise interest rates earlier than now expected then the markets will react sharply and the cost of uk government borrowing could rise significantly one key reason why we can at present cope with historically high levels of government debt is because interest rates along the curve are all ultra low so the cost of servicing that debt is minimal a significant hike in rates or rate expectations would cause a major change with the cost of debt servicing shooting up resulting in major pressure on government to raise taxes and or cut expenditure the last thing the uk or scotland needs in 2021 or 2022 is tightening of both monetary and fiscal policies thus far the benign scenario continues to be the central expectation gdp in scotland remains 5 4 below the pre pandemic peak but with gdp growth expected by the fraser of allander institute to reach 5 9 this year and 3 5 next scotland still needs time to re adjust to post covid conditions in the labour market and across key sectors and to provide particular support to regions demographic groups and business sectors which have suffered most success in the necessary re adjustment requires a benign monetary and fiscal policy context one final caveat is that the uk is always subject to global forces inflation is rising elsewhere in the usa it has reached 5 if the financial markets anticipate early upward movement in us short term rates then medium and longer term rates could rise for all nations at the least that would cause the uk treasury to worry about debt servicing costs and hence be reluctant to leave uk debt at the present exceptional level for any length of time

an article by helen oji published recently by the guardian newspaper expressed concern about the future of the nigerian stock market in the face of waning interest from millennials who are increasingly turning to alternative investment options in micro finance fintech and cryptocurrencies stakeholders are reportedly worried about losing market patronage on the exit of the older generation who thus far form the largest segment of investors this article piqued my interest and mirrored the outlook of millennial investors i had interacted with in the past who laughed and sighed when i suggested the nigerian stock exchange as a viable investment option what i found most concerning was the stark contrast between young nigerian investors and my colleagues from business school in the uk who have constantly badgered me to scout investment opportunities for them in nigeria this article examines the long term potential of nigerian equities and aims to predict patterns of growth by analyzing policy social trends and economic data a 2008 study investigated the connection between stock market performance and economic growth in malaysia by using annual data on real gdp growth and the kuala lumpur composite index findings revealed that causality runs from the stock market to economic activity and not the other way around therefore policymakers have a significant role in ensuring the smooth operations and growth of financial markets in recent times a large portion of global stock trading volumes has been driven by retail trade due to the democratization of access to the markets by fintech applications for example robin hood a fee less trading app recorded 350 billion worth of transactions in 2020 alone several mobile trading applications have been launched in nigeria over the past few of years leading to an uptick in retail trading volumes on the nigerian stock exchange nse one of the most significant events within the fin tech space in recent times was the first issuance of a sub broker license for digital platforms to chaka a retail trading application in december 2020 the securities and exchange commission sec released a statement banning chaka for operating outside the regulatory purview of the commission and without requisite registration as stipulated by the investment and securities act 2007 this came on the heels of a draft publication released by the sec in july 2020 containing proposed rules for collaboration between fintech operators and brokers chaka understandably did not realize the need to obtain the license leading to their temporary ban subsequently a successful dialogue between chaka and the sec led to a resolution and chaka became the first company to obtain a sub broker license for digital platforms according to techcabal chaka s ceo noted upon obtaining the license that we ve built a great relationship with sec that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward this was a major victory for the fintech space as there now exists a clear regulatory framework for innovators and investors to work within the sec has a major role in promoting the stock market s development and expansion over the next few years ensuring fluid communication with stakeholders will be a significant factor in the growth of investor confidence and the market as a whole the nigerian stock exchange was founded in 1961 and has 161 listed companies across a number of sectors many of the companies are market leaders within the continent and have expanded their operations significantly with nigeria as a base for example access bank started in nigeria and now has subsidiaries in the democratic republic of the congo ghana kenya rwanda gambia sierra leone zambia and the united kingdom many other companies on the nse such as dangote cement uba and oando have experienced similar growth and expansion if this trend continues it is fair to assume that nigerian companies will possess a significant market share of the continent s major industries while many young nigerians have shied away from the nse several foreign investors have realized nigeria s potential and placed a bet on its growth zenith s bank s 2nd 3rd and 4th largest shareholders are invesco limited russel invest management limited and mirae global asset investments these three companies are based in new york and london most of the blue chip companies on the nse have similar patterns in shareholding and in my opinion this poses a large risk to country s future growth it could be argued that if foreign companies increase their dominance on the nse nigeria will miss out on a large portion of dividends from major companies as they would be repatriated to investors outside of the country a number of nigerian companies such as gt bank and seplat petroleum development company have been able to secure dual listings on the nse and the london stock exchange lse these have enabled access to a far wider pool of investors who have acquired shares in large amounts and driven prices higher over the past few years seplat s share price has risen from n200 per share in january 2016 to n700 as at june 2021 the global market crash of 2008 led to the dow losing 1 2 trillion of value in a single day at this point investors sold their stocks in panic and left the market in droves while this was the point of maximum loss it was also the point of maximum opportunity and the few who recognised this were able to capitalise and multiply their wealth over the following years warren buffet was one of such investors during the financial crisis he bought large amounts of shares in american companies and these investments were primarily responsible for making him one of the wealthiest people in the world in 1979 india faced its worst recession to date due to drought falling oil prices and political instability the bse sensex is an index comprising of 30 major companies on the bombay stock exchange sensex has been one of the best performing indexes in the world providing a compounded annual growth rate of 16 1 from 1979 to 2019 while economic shocks at different points in this time period led to temporary weakness an investment of n10 000 in 1979 would have provided a return of over n45 0000 000 as of 2019 macro economic similarities and nigeria s current economic challenges lead me to believe that we stand at a similar crossroad as india in 1979 while many of the companies on the nse provide value and are growing rapidly they are significantly undervalued investors who capitalise on low stock prices and accumulate shares in market leading companies may face a similar fate as those who invested in india after its largest recession and global equities in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis one of my favourite indicators for analysing stocks is the price to book ratio according to investopedia companies use the price to book ratio p b ratio to compare a firm s market capitalisation to its book value it s calculated by dividing the company s stock price per share by its book value per share bvps book value per share is derived by subtracting a company s total liabilities from its total assets if a company s price to book ratio is one its share capital is equal to its assets minus liabilities and the company is reasonably valued a stock with a price to book ratio of 3 or under is generally considered a good buy however the retail frenzy surrounding global stocks has driven companies to high price to book ratios in recent times for instance tesla s p b ratio is currently at 26 this means that tesla s share capital is valued at 26x its assets minus liabilities this leads me to believe that tesla and many other similar companies are overvalued on the other side of the coin lies nigerian companies the average p b ratio for nigerian banks currently stands at 0 4 as such the average nigerian bank is valued at 60 less than its assets minus liabilities while i agree with oji s observation on scant youth participation i disagree that this lack of participation will lead to the loss of relevance and eventual extinction of the nigerian stock market instead i am led to believe that the country may lose out on dividends and control of nigeria s largest companies if the current patterns of shareholder demographics are maintained osinbajo is a technology entrepreneur

photographer waldo swiegers bloomberg via getty images in the five years since anheuser busch inbev ab inbev closed on a 100 billion merger with south african breweries sab the belgian multinational s share price has plummeted while its competitors stock has gone up the troubles facing the world s largest brewer are complex for years beer sales slumped due to the changing tastes of health conscious consumers having a presence all over the world has made ab inbev vulnerable to economic headwinds in emerging markets the company has also been saddled with a pile of debt from the 2016 sab deal covid 19 has only added pressure another ban on alcohol sales announced by president cyril ramaphosa last sunday will hit ab inbev s south african business for at least another two weeks experts have linked the ab inbev woes to the sab deal which the company s then chief executive carlos brito said at the time would cement its position as a truly global brewer but the merger was not all it was cracked up to be the fall ab inbev s share price has fallen by more than 43 over the last five years in the same period its competitors have seen their prospects brighten heineken s share price rose 23 7 and carlsberg s share price went up by 67 42 analyst simon brown said there is some complexity behind ab inbev s share price spiral but the true source of the decline is easy to pinpoint the simplicity is the sab deal the lockdown and the pandemic hasn t helped but of course the decline in the share price predates that he said the really big driver is that they paid a really vast amount for sab and they took on a vast amount of debt in the long term five to 10 years they will have paid off the debt and everything will be fine but they simply chronically overpaid for the acquisition according to ab inbev s 2020 annual report the company s net debt was 82 7 billion by december last year sab was likely not worth the price tag ab inbev paid for the south african business brown said when you are buying shares there is truthfully only one thing that you control and that is the price you pay future profits future dividends the future share price the price that you are able to sell it those are beyond your control the ab inbev executives got a little bit starstruck brown said we see it often in mega deals the desire to do the deal overwhelms and good old fashioned logic goes out the window alec abraham a senior equity analyst at sasfin agreed that the sab acquisition is the reason for ab inbev s share price decline the deal exposed ab inbev to a volatile market abraham said exposed when they made the acquisition they were bolstering their emerging market exposure and it came at a time i think emerging markets were performing very poorly from an economic point of view abraham said and what we ve seen is that because the emerging market economies haven t performed well affordability has become a bit of an issue and they haven t seen the kind of volume growth that they were hoping for abraham added it was unfortunate timing maybe but i think it was directly linked to the fact that they bought a bigger stake in the emerging markets and the emerging markets simply haven t achieved what they had hoped for at ab inbev s first quarter results presentation in may brito who was replaced by the brewer s north american division head michel doukeris in july said it has been a hard ride in emerging markets over the last few years the company recorded a 10 decrease in equity for the first quarter of 2021 this was primarily related to weakening currencies in emerging markets including south africa by december 2020 the rand had fallen to r14 69 to the us dollar down from the 25 year high of r18 46 to the us dollar recorded in april 2020 ab inbev s exposure in emerging markets also means the company is more vulnerable to covid 19 s impact in these regions abraham noted brito said when you think about covid our industry was one that was hardest hit we had businesses in ecuador peru and south africa that were shut down for two months or more and we continue to have restrictions according to the presentation its south african business was significantly impacted by the one month ban on alcohol sales in january though the company saw strong consumer demand once the ban was lifted sales volumes were flat compared to the first quarter of 2019 after the first alcohol ban revenue and volume from the south african market declined by more than 60 last year ab inbev chose to take a 2 5 billion impairment charge in light of heightened business risk in south africa ab inbev s 2020 annual report emphasised the company s view that alcohol bans significantly damage the south african economy threaten the over one million livelihoods at stake throughout the alcohol industry s value chain and entrench illicit alcohol trading which has devastating consequences the company attributed last year s 29 decrease in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation ebitda in europe the middle east and africa to the impact of lockdown on on site alcohol consumption as well as the three outright government mandated bans on the sale of alcohol over the course of 2020 in south africa recovery however ab inbev s first quarter results signalled better performance with the company forecasting that in 2021 ebitda would grow between 8 and 12 based on its analysis of the pace of market recovery the company had not factored in any full operational shutdowns such as another alcohol ban in south africa brito said but the latest two week alcohol ban announced as part of the government s efforts to slow down the rate of hospital admissions came as existing measures were not enough to contain the spread of the doubly contagious covid 19 delta variant sab is heading to court to have the alcohol ban overturned there is no scientific link that the consumption of alcohol raises the risk of contracting covid 19 especially if alcohol is consumed safely and responsibly in the comfort of one s home sab said in a statement announcing the court action the statement added the current ban which is unsubstantiated by robust scientific evidence has been implemented at a time when the industry was already gearing itself for future stability and was ready to play its part in the country s economic recovery last year sab withdrew r5 billion in investments in the wake of the covid 19 alcohol bans last month weeks before the fourth alcohol ban was announced sab said it had allocated a r2 billion investment to upgrade its south african operations in a statement announcing the investment sab s vice president of finance and legal richard rivett carnac said the move to implement reasonable measures as we continue to navigate the pandemic is a welcomed signal that we can expect to see more consultation in the future and that blanket bans will be a thing of the past further collaboration will provide the required confidence boost needed in order to attract further investment to the country as long as emerging markets struggle to recover there will continue to be pressure on ab inbev s share price abraham said despite the fact that we are seeing a rally in commodity prices i think you will need more sustained growth in emerging markets and i think emerging markets are going to have moderate recovery compared to developed markets because they don t have the same resources however abraham said if the stars align emerging markets can still be a source of growth for ab inbev i think it would be a huge step to go back on that sab deal and get rid of the emerging market exposure because the prospect if things work out is just so great at the time of publication ab inbev had not responded to questions from the mail guardian
the pleasant news of the petroleum industry bill passage by the national assembly almost drowned the continued concerns and discourse being generated over the propriety or otherwise of the move by the nigeria national petroleum corporation s acquisition of 20per cent stake in dangote refinery and petrochemicals regardless of the heat this historic downstream deal is generating the share purchase move by nnpc may be a good sign that it is ready and equipped to play in the pib space chris paul reports the week ended on two positive notes the passing of the pib by both chambers of the national assembly and the signing of the term sheet between nnpc and dangote refinery
confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the united states rose 17 percent during the two weeks leading up to the july 4 holiday weekend figures which belie the ongoing campaign by the biden administration and us media to declare the country s independence from the pandemic as in numerous other countries including russia south africa and the united kingdom the renewed spread of the disease in the us has been caused by the delta variant an analysis from the financial times notes that an estimated three out of five cases nationally are from infections of the new variant in some states the proportions are even worse 90 percent of cases in missouri are from the delta variant 89 percent in arkansas 87 percent in utah 79 percent in kansas and 78 percent in colorado as well as 72 percent in california 69 percent in texas and 65 percent in new york in the words of world health organization director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus we re in a very dangerous period of this pandemic delta has been detected in at least 98 countries and is spreading quickly in countries with low and high vaccination coverage such comments are in sharp contrast to biden s actions over the weekend which have been to visit the traverse city national cherry festival and then to stop for ice cream all while promoting the lie that america s back together and that the pandemic is essentially at an end the president is also hosting a 1000 person event at the white house giving an implicit go ahead to other such events across the country first lady jill biden declared at a rally doesn t the air just smell so much sweeter without our masks biden s coronavirus response coordinator jeff zients had a particularly callous comment claiming that the country has a lot to celebrate no doubt wall street oligarchs and corporate executives will be celebrating the stock market where the dow jones industrial average has increased by about 5 000 points since january the working class on the other hand whatever immediate celebrations that are being held is remembering the nearly 35 million cases of the pandemic in the united states and the more than 621 000 dead moreover the spread of the delta variant has raised many concerns about the decrease in vaccination rates across the country the cdc estimates that 156 million people are fully vaccinated in the united states just under 47 percent and that about two thirds have received at least one dose and a recent kaiser family foundation report found that very few who haven t gotten vaccinated currently plan to do so in other words through a combination of the fact that the pandemic was allowed to spread so far and mutate so much in the first place and the anti scientific conceptions and cultural backwardness in the population engendered by the american ruling elite coronavirus vaccines will not be enough to halt the pandemic the spike in missouri in particular underscores the dangers of the delta variant as hospitalizations in some areas have increased by as much as 225 percent since june 1 of those hospitalized 37 percent are less than 45 years old and daily new cases have doubled since may missouri is pretty much the epicentre of the delta variant in the us right now alexander garza health official for the st louis area told the financial times only 39 percent of the population in missouri has been fully vaccinated and as the international situation shows what is happening in the us now is only the precursor of what is to come there are now more than 23 000 daily cases in the united kingdom and rising more than 10 times the case count before the delta variant began spreading deaths in britain have also begun to rise doubling over the past month to 17 every day hospitalizations in the uk are also rising dr eric feigl ding noted on twitter that hospitalizations in england due to deltavariant are now accelerating upward even faster than before according to new data compiled by covid19actuary hospital admissions spiked above 250 a day at the end of june the highest levels since march despite about half of the population being fully vaccinated in russia new cases have tripled since the beginning of june and deaths have spiked to 654 nearly double what they were in the sharpest increase in known deaths in that country since the pandemic began as a result of the spread the country has begun to require vaccinations for those that work in government offices health care education retail and other service industries the surge in cases in south africa is among the most troubling daily case counts since april have increased almost 19 fold and have exceeded the peaks in january an increase in deaths followed with daily fatalities currently at 247 four times what they were in april and may less than one percent of the country s population is fully vaccinated according to our world in data many other countries face a similar predicament which led dr tedros on friday to renew his call to equitably share protective gear oxygen tests treatments and vaccines in order to save lives around the world he also made clear the continued necessity for fundamental epidemiological measures public health and social measures like strong surveillance strategic testing early case detection isolation and clinical care remain critical as well as masking physical distance avoiding crowded places and keeping indoor areas well ventilated are the basis for the response such measures continue to be critical especially as scientific research continues to show that the coronavirus is airborne and spreads easily an article in infection chemotherapy traced transmission through two people that visited the same unventilated bathroom 40 minutes apart and followed up with cctv footage and genomic sequencing of the virus further confirming just how infectious the coronavirus is particularly the variants and how necessary public health measures are to save lives workers and youth must take heed especially as they are forced back into workplaces and schools in the final phases of the reopening drive of governments in the us and the world over the coronavirus pandemic is far from over and the official celebrations this weekend are aimed at both papering over the immense suffering of the past 18 months and concealing the dangers of the weeks and months to come

as the stock market cavorts in making all time highs nearly every day in turn nullifying our massive top notion we briefly begin with this friendly reminder query has the s p crashed yet we re just askin after all by any and all historically tried n true measures be they fundamental or technical none of em matter anymore let alone are indicatively useful and just in case you re scoring at home the 20 same day sell off limit means the can drop some 900 points and the some 7000 points in a single session moreover if i e when we get a 50 correction by present earnings the s p still shall be overvalued do the math here yet again is the formula in case you ve misplaced it yet the herd mentality maintains that the post covid economy is go go go but as you regular readers already know the economic barometer shows it ain t so we read this past week that u s businesses are pouring money into equipment and technology further stateside president biden just lauded the 46 june growth in but what did his staff not tell him mmb well squire let s just say they didn t convey that the ticked up nor that the of jobs fell 22 nor that the tanked from 75 to 66 its worst drop since hello april a year ago nor that may s actually shrank you go bro joe meanwhile jumping on the bandwagon that the federal reserve be obliged to raise rates by the end of next year is the international monetary fund itself the congressional budget office targets the federal deficit to be 3 trillion this year twas 1 trillion just two years ago 130 nations have now signed on to having a global minimum tax on corporations taxes are to rise as well on personal income and capital gains and the cherry on top from the class envy spreading finmedia those benefitting the most during covid are the rich ready for more civil unrest ready for stagflation ready for the greatest global financial train wreck in history got as for gold goes short which isn t really a surprise per our recent missives by the following graphic of price s weekly bars from a year ago to date the parabolic trend has so flipped per the rightmost fresh red dot so what s going on and what of our forecast high for this year of 2401 be it little reaction to basel iii the having an up spree or bits t still posing as a currency common sense interest in gold remains wee nonetheless we re anticipating that this new short trend shall be short lived yet here at mid year with gold settling friday at 1788 can price still achieve 2401 by year s end such previous 34 3 price increases occurred within six months originating in 1976 1978 1979 1980 1982 2005 2007 and 2011 it can go quickly recall too our premise that shorting gold is a bad idea notably per our market profiles later shown in this missive still year to date gold along with the bond now finds itself down in the cellar of the begos markets as we view their mid year plus two trading days standings and isn t it curious how the economically driven components and the s p stand at present atop the podium but as we just saw with the econ baro in decline the great uh oh is coming even more curious is the dollar as measured by its index tis presently 92 250 that is the same level twas better than three years ago on 14 may 2018 when the us money supply m2 was 32 smaller than tis today tick tick tick as for the begos markets respective linear regression trends across the past 21 trading days one month here we go round the horn with the whole bunch including their baby blue dots of trend consistency throughout which the bond is actually getting a bid hint hint nudge nudge elbow elbow specific to the precious metals equities prices are not that far afield from where they were on this date a year ago the exception being the global x silver miners exchange traded fund nyse 19 recall a year ago at this time the gold silver ratio was 97 9x vs today s more historically in line 67 2x for the rest of the group we ve franco nevada nyse 8 newmont nyse 4 gold itself unch pan american silver nasdaq 1 agnico eagle mines nyse 2 and the vaneck vectors gold miners exchange traded fund nyse 5 as to near term pricing here we ve our two panel display of the 10 day market profiles for gold on the left and on the right as earlier inferred despite gold s weekly parabolic trend having just flipped to short its profile appears price supportive from 1783 down to 1775 similarly sister silver looks safe above 26 00 finally here is gold s structure by the monthly bars from 2010 to date with gold grabbing for grip inside of the northern front these recent months can be construed as price consolidation ahead of said common sense buying do urge your sovereign bank to get with the program we started with the s p let s conclude with same its inane rise of insanity finds a great colleague here joking with us about s p 5000 by year end obviously we don t believe that a wit but linearly regressing the s p s covid closing low level of 2237 on 23 march 2020 through today 4352 and then extrapolating that trend the mighty index would settle on 10 january 2022 at 5001 and that given the present unsupportive level of earnings would put the p e ratio at 65 9x we

analysis and easy to use tools to help you select the right etfs tesla s entry into the s p 500 has cost investors tracking or benchmarked against the index of blue chip us stocks more than 45bn since december the electric vehicle pioneer was already the world s seventh largest listed company when it was finally admitted to the s p at the end of 2020 more than a decade after entering some other indices such as the russell 1000 its stock had rallied 764 per cent in the 12 months beforehand partly in anticipation of forced buying on entry to the s p 500 and its market capitalisation equalled the total market cap of the nine largest automakers by sales volume which between them accounted for 94 per cent of global sales in 2020 according to research affiliates a californian investment house tesla s share price then fell in the six months after its admission while the stock it replaced apartment investment and management aiv rallied 48 per cent this rebalance cost investors 41 basis points of their portfolios said rob arnott chair of ra a tidy sum given that the s p 500 is directly tracked by about 4 6tn of capital with a further 6 6tn benchmarked against it aiv outperformed tesla by a stupendous margin arnott said in a blog post a pensioner with a 100 000 allocation to the s p 500 is about 410 poorer as the result of the december index rebalance unfortunately this cost is totally unnoticed by investors because it is baked into the index s performance while tesla is an extreme case research affiliates analysis suggests market cap weighted indices have a clear tendency to systematically buy high sell low when they rebalance since 2000 an average of 23 stocks have entered and left the s p 500 each year sometimes because of corporate action such as mergers acquisitions or bankruptcy among existing constituents on other occasions as a result of growth by companies outside the index ra found that 65 per cent of new entrants see their share prices rally between the day their impending admission is announced and the day that change becomes effective in contrast 60 per cent of the discretionary deletions from the index fall between announcement and exit dates on average deletions underperformed additions by 6 2 percentage points over this period plus a further 1 point on the day after the change is enacted as index trackers catch up over the subsequent 12 months prices move in the opposite direction additions on average underperform the index albeit by only 1 percentage point but deletions beat it by an average of almost 20 points as a result ra calculated that investors typically lose 20 40bp a year from stocks added at too high a price and sold at too low during the rebalancing process traditional indices embody built in performance dragging inefficiencies arnott wrote the index rebalance is a great opportunity to do the opposite of what the index does buy the deletion and sell the addition arnott whose business is a proponent of factor based smart beta investment said this was not a criticism of s p per se but rather a flaw inherent to all market cap weighted indices vitali kalesnik director of research for europe at ra said the rebalancing effect was likely to be exacerbated by hedge funds buying stocks when their impending promotion is announced in the full knowledge that index trackers such as etfs will need to buy them when they enter the index who benefits from this hedge funds and other liquidity providers who pays the investors a lot of which are pensioners that hold collectively billions of dollars in the s p kalesnik said this applies to all indices and strategies whenever any trading pattern becomes predictable and can be front run while an annual loss of 20 40bp may not be huge kalesnik argued this can be 10 times the stated management fee for an index tracker with investors often switching funds in order to save a fraction of this amount while indices have little option but to rebalance periodically ra had some suggestions to lessen the impact selecting additions based on their five year average market cap can help avoid admitting hot stocks that prove to be temporary high fliers while banding can limit flip flop trades additions that are quickly reversed kalesnik said any investor able to postpone trading of the s p 500 s additions and deletions by a year can outperform the index alternatively tracking an index that represents the full universe of us large cap stocks rather than the very narrow s p 500 avoids entry point risk he argued gareth parker a former director of index research and design at s p who has also worked with ra and is now chairman and chief indexing officer of moorgate benchmarks believed that the selection methodology for the s p 500 which includes the stipulation that a company should be profitable was not ideal it is essentially active management they don t follow objective transparent rules the result is anomalies such as adding tesla and from memory google and microsoft far later than would have happened if the rules followed the normal approach of adding by size subject to basic eligibility criteria parker said however he was unconvinced by arguments that market cap indices inherently buy high and sell low given that the s p 500 s track record is remarkably good when compared to active management even before fees aye soe global head of product management at s p dow jones indices said its data suggested what she termed the index effect had actually declined in the past decade reducing rebalancing related losses market cap weighting is the only way to show proportional representation of assets in an aggregate way it s the only macro consistent way she added people criticise it but if you look at active managers most can t beat it

a stable foreign exchange rate helps stimulate long term fixed investment while a prolonged abnormally fluctuating value of the national currency tends to distort the financial viability of projects with longer gestation periods and a stable currency with minimal fluctuations is necessary for the success of any long term economic growth strategy as amply proved by china for pakistan keen to launch the second phase of industrialisation under the china pakistan economic corridor umbrella rupee stability assumes added importance while claiming the economy is moving in the right direction the policymakers also have expressed satisfaction that the rupee is stable unlike in the past foreign companies are reported to be largely remitting their profits to parent companies instead of ploughing back a significant part of their earnings into investment in the 11 months of 2020 21 the outflow of profits and dividends on foreign investment increased by 23 per cent to 1 5 billion up

production facilities the pti government needs to relink the exchange rate to lower core inflation rate excluding food and oil prices as was the earlier established practice instead of higher headline inflation adopted under the international monetary fund s imf current conditionality finance minister shaukat tarin says that the fund has shown flexibility in its stance and the imf spokesman in washington affirms that we stand ready to continue to support pakistan in achieving its objectives of debt sustainability and strong growth the fund should let the core inflation set the exchange rate to reduce the rupee cost of debt servicing and take a needed step towards making private investment cost effective in view of rising international prices the enormous rupee depreciation under pti stewardship was recently followed by the rupee gaining both value and relative stability for a very brief period as long as the current account was in surplus as trade and current account deficits started widening on a month to month basis the rupee started losing value it fell from rs153 5 per dollar by end of april to rs158 30 on june 27 the national unit gained 50 paisa the next day since the shift from fixed parity to flexible exchange rate adopted globally decades ago economic growth has become much more problematic than before unusually prolonged fixed parities also led to excessive overvaluation of the rupee as happened in the case of pakistan during the development decade of the 1960s and led to substantial devaluation in the early 1970s apparently huge devaluation plus regulatory import duties did not help cut costly imports on a durable basis nor encouraged import substitution in any noticeable way nor have exports increased to expected levels owing to the challenging domestic and international business environment created by covid 19 and the preceding weak recovery from the 2007 2008 international financial crisis in fact the value of imports of goods is rising at twice the pace of export earnings in a meeting on june 28 a concerned senate standing committee on commerce asked the commerce secretary to explain reasons for stagnant exports which according to a committee member has remained stuck at the 2013 level of 24bn in 2020 21 a pakistani political economist settled in the us says while the free float of the rupee will cut current account deficits it will fuel inflation too and won t end current account deficit fully looking at 11 months of performance of 2020 21 the merchandise trade deficit rose to 24 14bn from 19 12bn compared to the same period of 2020 21 the current account surplus was reduced to 153bn with deficits rising since december that shot up to 632bn in may the real issues in exports of goods persist on both supply and the demand side on the other hand exports of telecommunications computer and information services increased by almost 48pc to 1 9bn during the period under review notwithstanding the current account surplus record workers remittances and increase in exports the government borrowed over 12 13bn during july may up from 7 44bn a year ago in the first nine months of 2020 21 the costlier borrowings from commercial banks rose to 3 61bn debt servicing amounted to 10 63bn and are expected to reach 14bn for the entire fiscal year the rising level of external debt is providing short term relief while enhancing the country s sovereign risk and making borrowing costlier to quote an opinion piece pakistan s economy remains fragile on massive borrowings the balance of payments was salvaged by a slowing economy and hence low imports were buffeted by high remittances says an institute of business administration iba study the researchers warn that increasing imports reaching 60 70bn in 2021 22 will be achilles heel of the economy as remittances are unlikely to show markedly growing trends as excessive imports are a major problem a view has emerged that successful import substitution should precede export oriented economic growth huge devaluation has created adverse terms of trade resulting in an enormous outflow of wealth abroad from a cash strapped and debt stimulated economy suffering from low levels of investment production and exports as well as import substitution in terms of dollars exports are made cheaper for foreign buyers and imports become costlier for local industrial and other consumers in the past cosmetic measures were adopted to tackle boom and bust cycles that according to a working paper prepared by a central bank expert gave the pretence of stability but made future instability inevitable the point the study observes is to sustain stability once achieved it sees the manufacturing sector as the key to long term development as demonstrated by the historical global experience of successful development published in dawn the business and finance weekly july 5th 2021

housing boom is global not local fixing our housing boom demands a broader perspective there are vocal calls for government intervention in the booming housing market what is deeply troubling is not the creative albeit often futile ideas that are driving government intervention in the pricing of residential housing the deeply troubling aspect is that many people are calling for intervention in a market dynamic that is neither regionally influenced nor driven by existing government policies the residential housing boom we see is the result of macro economic dynamics influenced at a global level and perpetuated by the overall monetary system demands that labour fix the residential housing price boom occur when ignoring world wide trends and monetary dynamics that are positioning the housing market as one of the few remaining stable investment vehicles there is an ongoing substantive and particularly long lived residential housing boom occurring globally this global boom in residential investments is specifically targeted within stable economies that have grounded monetary policies where long term investment growth remains tenable unlike much of the rest of the world therefore it is not a surprise that some european nations north america and some asia pacific nations are seeing a particularly high intensity housing boom in march the wall street journal reported on a housing boom that was across the globe the point the authors mike cherney and patricia kowsmann made in their article house prices are inflating around the world was absolutely essential pandemic related stimulus ultralow rates and changes in buyer behavior are turbocharging markets from europe to asia advertisement scroll to continue reading this point was raised again by major economists in april with poignant economist article by bicester and rhinebeck declaring house prices in the rich world are booming furthermore in may reuters reported in the concise article pandemic surge in european house prices raises fears of new bubble that a set of specific stable economies like sweden and germany were seeing unprecedented housing booms in the article the housing supply was pointed to as a fundamental stabilising mechanism for run away economies that had been over heated by the pandemic responses and inappropriately low mortgage levels there is nothing particularly unique nor surprising regarding the new zealand housing boom there is nothing particularly unique nor surprising regarding the new zealand housing boom interest rates were held too low for too long creating very strong incentives combined with a pandemic that both overshadowed and blurred the lines between stabilising growth and over stimulus on top of the global monetary weakness driven by trade wars and inflationary stimulus printing the current new zealand housing market boom is driven by much more profound underlying global macro economic instigators that require new zealand government to use broad and holistic approaches fixation on house prices encouragement of punitive legislation around that explicitly market and implementing this in the current macro economic environment can have substantively negative consequences related to kiwi investments household income and overall stability of the new zealand economy instead as many of the economists have already proposed the boom must be taken in the context of the global financial markets and only then proper and stabilising decisions should be made key aspects include 1 prepare everyone for rate rises the government leaders can take steps for immediate preparation and incentivised programmes to help offset and stabilise mortgage debt as rates rise ensuring we do not see sudden mortgage shocks 2 leaders can help promote better banking practices banks offer mortgages to investors because their system especially driven by larger international banking processes encourage money to flow to where money already exists new home buyers young families getting started hardworking single people are very low on the ranking for bank lending leaders can incentivise loan policies to some degree and dictate how well such incentives work for first home buyers and younger investors 3 leaders can help promote young to save simple tax policies can help as well as creating new incentives specifically to allow young kiwi s to save money encourage longer term investment strategies and have options other than housing for wealth building instead most young working people are watching as any saved wealth devalues quickly due to the inflationary reality of the current macro economic conditions 4 leaders can diminish economic rhetoric that may collapse the nz economy vocal proponents of government intervention demand that leaders step in and do something to control a housing market instead of making demands around other broader market incentives that will work for instance these intervention proponents often fail to demand incentives for higher wages even though wages are a key aspect of wealth disparity 5 wage disparity and job security are fundamental causes of social divide ironically it is the government employment itself that regularly fails to create environment and processes to either retain hard working staff or pay them market salaries now is probably an inappropriate time to encourage government pay freezes where the economic disparity is growing so quickly for now many government wages remain abysmally low compared to overall cost of living and the government is notorious for employment contracts that do not meet its own rhetoric 6 encouraging other savings methods the current policies do nothing to encourage savings and the banks have all but completely eradicated savings plans as a part of their focus in this unique environment the leadership can create tax and other incentives to promote other forms of savings and thus investment demand it may be a bit late to the gate but such incentives should exist otherwise single focused investment vehicles become the fixation of most investors 7 increase housing supply by increasing incentives to build finally an overt method by which the government can and should intervene is to incentivise housing supply the housing stock remains low as costs for building are increasing and market instability raises risks for developers government leadership should create positive incentives to build more houses that are designed and developed to be affordable at lower mortgage debt rates and require lower initial deposit levels this unique housing boom is global in scope and can only be tempered when our leaders focus on overall macro economic policies that create stability unfortunately a fixation with housing prices and short term focused policies will increasingly encourage more intensive upheaval in already tenuous market conditions mark rais is the creator of the think tank trend analysis network writer for the

the author is the chief global strategist of morgan stanley investment management and the author of ten rules for successful countries driven by the successful launch of vaccines in the united states and the government s large scale stimulus measures the us economy is expected to achieve a rapid growth of 7 this year and is currently leading the world s recovery critics are talking about an american renaissance the country ushered in its 245th independence day on sunday but there is a problem the united states has just experienced an economic renaissance the possibility of rebirth is unlikely ten years ago after the 2008 financial crisis standard poor s downgraded the us government debt rating for the first time triggering terrible predictions of the us economic recession on the contrary in the 2010s driven by its technological prowess and relatively quick resolution of the debt crisis the us economic power expanded the united states share of global gdp has risen from a low of 21 in 2011 to 25 last year at the beginning of the decade the average income in the united states was 26 higher than in europe and at the end it was more than 60 higher the income of the united states is ahead of japan s growth more significantly by the beginning of 2020 despite talking about despair among the unemployed middle class the confidence of american consumers and small businesses has reached the highest level since the 1960s as a financial superpower the united states has reached a higher level its share of the global stock market increased from 42 to 58 in the 2010s this u s dollar more dominant than ever before helping the united states expand its leading position ahead of other developed countries by the end of 2019 75 of personal and corporate overseas loans were denominated in u s dollars up from 60 before the 2008 crisis six out of every 10 countries use the u s dollar as their anchor that is their currencies measure and stabilize the value of their currencies close to record highs china s efforts the challenge to the us dollar as the world s most popular reserve currency also failed completely in the 2010s after a ten year comeback the united states is unlikely to rise again in the 2020s just like me debate at the beginning of a pandemic a strong boom is almost always accompanied by a long hangover the us economy led the world in the 1960s but in the 1970s it worried about lagging behind the oil fueled soviet union in the 1980s it was troubled by the rise of japan the united states made a comeback during the technological boom of the 1990s but the 2000s were all about the rise of emerging markets led by china the prediction of another surge in the united states depends in part on its belief that it can continue to expand its technological leadership but american internet giants are already facing challenges in emerging markets from asia to africa and local entrepreneurs are establishing national and regional market leaders in the fields of e commerce e banking and search beurope is closing the innovation gap in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence european startups have attracted more private equity investment than ever before prosperity is often stifled by complacency and this complacency is now haunting the united states important voices in both parties believe that due to the unparalleled status of the us dollar as the most popular currency in the world the united states should continue to borrow and spend freely but the loose money flowing out of the fed may weaken the dollar and encourage the rise of zombie companies companies whose income is too low to even pay interest on debt twenty years ago they almost did not exist in the united states but by 2010 they accounted for 6 of listed companies and almost 20 last year the federal government and companies are now heavily in debt and it is hard to imagine how they can further boost the economy in 2010 the united states owed the rest of the world us 2 5 trillion equivalent to 17 of us gdp by the beginning of last year those debt it has risen to 10 trillion us dollars accounting for more than 50 of gdp a threshold that has often triggered currency crises in the past currently they are us 14 trillion accounting for 67 of gdp this does not mean that the decline theorists in the united states were wrong in the 2010s and will eventually prove to be correct china s rising share of the global economy has largely come at the expense of europe and japan decliners who still believe that the united states will soon be surpassed by china ignore the fact that china also has a huge debt problem it is more likely that the united states will spend a mediocre decade dragged down by recent excessive prosperity compared to other markets the us stock market is at a 100 year high such high valuations reflect new optimism after a decade of unexpected success in the united states many analysts now expect more of the same situation alas this may be the best for the united states

of new sellers on amazon were from china amazon has aggressively recruited chinese vendors to sell items to its customers directly despite the concern that this practice elevated the percentage of mislabeled faked and unsafe products sold on the platform advertisement it is not an accident that amidst the pandemic the us trade deficit in general and the deficit with china reached a historic high trade war notwithstanding amazon is not the only retailer that expanded its sourcing from china during the pandemic chinese electrical appliance exporters saw a surge in orders from the us and elsewhere that they could barely manage as such a large part of the stimulus fueled consumption spending in 2020 went to purchase goods from china this is only an acceleration of a trend that began long before the pandemic before amazon walmart exemplified the same dynamic in which the liquidity provided by the us state supports consumption spending which largely benefits us corporations and china s export machine rather than us workers in light of these dynamics the recent discussion about whether the great fiscal and monetary expansion will bring back high inflation is misplaced the dominance of monetarism as an economic doctrine has long gone as we are told but curiously many public intellectuals and policymakers are still stuck in the monetarist assumption that fiscal spending and money supply growth will bring out of control inflation we are still haunted by milton friedman s assertion that nflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output echoes of friedman can be heard when larry summers criticizes biden s 1 9 trillion stimulus plan for being the least responsible economic policy in the last forty years arguing that it would only ignite inflation of a kind we have not seen in a generation but there is no reason to believe that summers warnings will age better than the 2004 economist cover with a platform shoe and a back to the 1970s headline or niall ferguson s 2011 prediction of a double digit great inflation of the 2010s facing the mismatch between economic reality and monetarist orthodoxy we should not blame the reality but question orthodoxy in 2017 then us fed chair janet yellen admitted that she and her colleagues may have misjudged the fundamental forces driving inflation after spending two days in the fed policy meeting to debate the mystery of low inflation amidst abundant money supply when central bankers from around the world met at the imf annual meeting in dc in 2017 the paradox of stubbornly low inflation amidst large government deficit and cheap money across the developed world were enthusiastically discussed the world economic outlook that the fund published on the eve of the meeting pointed out that persistently low inflation in advanced economies deepens the downside risks to advanced economies medium term growth prospects presenting a major risk to the global economy echoing yellen imf research director maurice obstfeld added at the report s release press conference that such low inflation is puzzling advertisement the labor theory of inflation we do not need to look far for a theory that can better explain the puzzling absence of inflation in recent years in the 1960s and 1970s before the rise of monetarist orthodoxy many social scientists agreed on a labor theory of inflation according to which the most important cause of inflation was the rising wage demands of powerful unions this view was shared by marxists like robert rowthorn and weberians like john goldthorpe as well as centrists and conservatives as laid out in a 1970 oecd report high inflation in rich countries was understood to be a problem of the wage price spiral the concentrated power of workers organized into unions meant they could demand higher wages which businesses would then attempt to recover by passing on higher costs to consumers ever rising consumer prices would lead workers to demand ever higher wages and so on in an unhappy cycle of rising prices to remedy inflationary pressure an earlier study by the us chamber of commerce suggested that union monopoly compulsory unionism in other words the basic framework of post new deal labor relations must be eliminated in 1970 barry goldwater the father of the american new right declared that higher and higher union wage hikes was the root cause of the present price inflation he even suggested friedman s monetarist theory of inflation was a liberal apology for organized labor downplaying the tremendous role played by union demands in increasing the cost of production and causing the upward spiral of prices advertisement what became of this labor theory of inflation once so prevalent on both the left and the right in large part it has been overshadowed by friedman s monetarist explanation in october 1979 fed chair paul volcker announced his conversion to monetarism in practice this meant the fed would fight inflation by limiting the growth of the money supply rather than targeting interest rates the fed s evident success in stemming inflation by the early 1980s appeared to confirm the power of the monetarist approach but historical research has revealed that the fed s embrace of monetarism was as much political as analytical in a 2016 paper daniel thompson and i performed a test of the labor and monetarist explanations of inflation using data from twenty three oecd countries from 1960 2009 we found that the power of labor measured by labor share of gdp unemployment rate or union density exerted a much stronger influence on the inflation rate than did the rate of growth of the money supply even a casual look at the curves of changing inflation rates of most oecd countries over the period reveals that they coincide much better with changes in labor power than with changes in the money supply this would not have surprised volcker himself even as fed officials addressed the public in technical monetarist terms they were privately obsessed with the role of industrial relations and collective bargaining in fueling inflation monetary tightening was a means to induce recession and force the unions to restrain their wage demands monetary contraction was only one of the tools the reagan administration leveraged to beat back organized labor in 1981 reagan used the brute force of the state to crack down on unions by firing 11 000 striking air traffic controllers jailing their leaders and decertifying their union tellingly volcker called defeating patco the air traffic controllers union the most important single action of the administration in helping the anti inflation fight the success of this assault on labor can be read in the statistics union density fell from a peak of 33 percent in the 1950s to barely 10 percent now the decline of unions and increasing competition from low wage countries did bring down wage growth and with it inflation under the great wage repression workers hourly compensation grew by only 11 6 percent from 1979 2018 while productivity grew by 69 6 percent over the same period this was a sharp contrast to 1948 79 an era of stronger unions when compensation grew by 93 2 percent nearly tracking productivity growth of 108 1 percent advertisement why has the monetarist theory endured despite the evidence against it friedman s theory sanitizes and depoliticizes the act of dismantling union power casting it as a technocratic adjustment by central bankers committed to price stabilization long after it fell out of fashion in academic economics monetarist orthodoxy remains attractive as a rhetorical device on the right today cheap money flows to wall street and china recovering the labor explanation of inflation allows us to resolve the so called mystery of chronic low inflation despite great fiscal and monetary expansion from 2001 2019 it also provides an insight into the fateful interdependence of american and chinese economic processes with workers bargaining power curbed monetary expansion could no longer contribute to any wage price spiral even with low unemployment while cheap money does not bring wage growth today it does flow into financial markets where it inflates asset bubbles and boosts debt fueled consumption the assault on us labor was simultaneous with the global expansion of productive capacity in low wage countries notably china at the same time consumption in the us has been maintained through the expansion of personal debt and cheap imports when china joined the world trade organization in 2001 it became in large measure the workshop of the world with an army of disciplined and low cost rural originated labor not protected by independent unions chinese factories pumped out a whole range of consumer goods at a fraction of the us cost for american workers the price of this import bonanza was the loss of 2 3 7 million manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2018 advertisement the interlock between chinese production and american debt fueled consumption can also be seen as a set of financial flows much of the cheap money created by the fed flowed into china s foreign exchange reserves denominated mostly in usd these ballooning foreign exchange reserves allow the people s bank of china china s central bank to create commensurate new liquidity in rmb china s currency to boost domestic economic growth as in the us this new liquidity aggravated preexisting sectoral imbalances and inequality between capital and labor most of the liquidity ends up fueling investment by local governments and state enterprises which have privileged and unlimited access to cheap loans from state banks workers and peasants benefit the least as a result the growth of per capita disposable household income and per capita household consumption expenditure has fallen far short of the growth of gdp per capita throughout the china boom as of 2018 china s gdp per capita is 64 644 rmb more than two times of disposable household income per capita of 28 228 rmb corporate profit and government income account for the gap between the two figures one consequence of such imbalance and inequality aggravated by the surge in global usd supply is the relatively slow growth of household consumption and the buildup of industrial overcapacity china responds to this challenge by exporting its excess capacity overseas a policy accelerated by the belt and road initiative begun in 2013 beijing has been channeling a large part of its foreign exchange reserves toward the developing world in the form of development loans largely denominated in usd the terms of the loans are obscure but research finds that nearly 90 percent of contractors in belt and road projects are chinese with pushback against chinese lending in many recipient countries and the concern about the viability of many of the belt and road projects china s capital export saw a retreat after 2016 but as indebtedness and overcapacity resurged after beijing doubled down in its monetary stimulus to rescue the economy from the pandemic fallout it is well plausible that china s capital export will regain momentum in the years to come for us corporations active in emerging markets china s capital exports represent intense competitive pressures in the 1990s and 2000s us transnational corporations motivated by their real or expected interests in expansion in china served as beijing s proxy lobbyists in washington they worked hard to ensure a friendly us china policy and obstructed any hostile policies today many us corporations still benefit from their dealings with china but an increasing number now see their chinese counterparts as rivals in the world market the intensifying competition from state supported chinese enterprises in more recent years dampens us corporate enthusiasm in neutralizing any washington action that irks beijing advertisement inter imperial rivalry and its remedy since the 1980s easy money combined with the epochal disempowerment of labor has brought financial bubbles and domestic inequality it has also aggravated geopolitical tensions development loans and capital exports from china have allowed beijing to expand its sphere of influence in the developing world at the expense of washington this largesse has swung erstwhile us allies to beijing s position on contentious geopolitical issues and offered a lifeline to internationally sanctioned regimes like iran and russia as such a bloc of authoritarian rivals to the us has become ever stronger on the world stage the resulting intensification of the great powers rivalry is comparable to the inter imperial rivalry at the turn of the twentieth century unleashed by the rise of the german empire a relatively late developing capitalist power whose loans and investments to underdeveloped regions of the world brought it into competition with established powers like britain and france as in contemporary china wilhelmine germany was marked by deep domestic distributional conflict as evidenced by the rapid growth of the german social democratic party spd and in 1914 as today rising global tensions co existed with a seductive belief that economic interdependence had made major war impossible well before the pandemic brought on a protracted global recession central banks worldwide worried that low inflation was stifling growth and dampening investment they were rightfully looking for ways to reflate the economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the years of anemic recovery that followed but even as central bankers began to rethink the virtues of inflation they did not grasp the root of the problem the great disempowerment of labor since the 1980s on the eve of the pandemic the wage and salary share of us gdp had dropped to a historic low just over 40 percent in 2019 democrats in washington are now floating plans to strengthen us labor by reshoring key us manufacturing re building us infrastructure offering support to unionization and pursuing a worker centered trade policy that puts labor and wage standards into trade agreements if successful a healthy growth of wage and price could lead to a more sustainable economic expansion without requiring incessant monetary growth the end of cheap money will not only tame financial bubbles and reduce inequality but also help reduce international tension worsened by the excessive global supply of the usd advertisement the democrats initiatives to re empower labor are commendable but there is no indication that the defeats of the 1980s will be reversed easily the defeat of organized labor in the amazon warehouse along with the defeat of efforts to raise the federal minimum wage reminds us that labor s position has been further weakened by the heightened precarity of lockdowns and massive layoffs despite recent scares about the return of inflation any price increases so far seem to be temporary and related to specific bottlenecks rather than a general shift in class power even if such a shift were in the cards the political consequences of a new surge of worker power remain deeply uncertain as a recent study shows to re empower labor and push the inflation rate up to a healthy level the biden administration would need to let money wage grow faster than productivity and price growth for a sustained period this would certainly provoke interest rate hike and financial asset deflation which would trigger strong political resistance from wall street and affluent households in china domestic redistribution would go a long way to reducing global tensions a redistributive reform corresponding to an american new new deal could increase wages and household consumption growth relative to capital accumulation this would tame china s urge to export capital and arrest the impending collision between late imperialism and established empires but the power monopoly of the party state capitalist elite makes redistributive reform in china no easier to achieve than it is in the us until the difficult rebalancing and reforms on both sides of the pacific gain traction the world will continue to be on the dangerous path of inter imperial antagonism resembling the international politics of a century ago renewing the world economy without a clash between great powers is going to be an uphill battle

you treat them right if your 2023 resolution is to be a bit more active in the kitchen a good set of knives can go a long way when it comes to food prep to help you master the blade here s the run down on why you should steer clear of cheap knife sets and what you should consider picking up instead read more how to sharpen a knife with a whetstone knife sets almost always mean terrible knives when you re first moving out on your own or setting up a kitchen buying a set of knives can seem like a good idea for a decent price you can get a bunch of knives a honing steel and a block to store them all in sounds good right the problem with knife sets is that they re almost universally terrible we ve touched on this a little bit before but often manufacturers skimp on build quality materials size and even blade geometry in order to produce a cheap product they re not designed to keep their edge in day to day use to stand up to regular use or even sharpening and dull knives can actually be a hazard the video above from the folks at america s test kitchen actually puts several sets to the test and it just reinforces the point advertisement read more knifehacker these global and furi knife deals are a cut above long story short for the money you spend on a knife set from a department or big box store you can easily buy two or three great versatile knives that will stand the test of time and keep their edge after all you ll have to keep replacing knife sets so wouldn t it be better to save money and get two or three amazing knives instead if you re hoping to turn them into a gift just grab a few of our suggestions below then pack them along with something like a honing steel like this wiltshire stainless steel model or this victorinox sharpening steel a whetstone set is also a great gift option for keeping their blades sharp the knives you need in your kitchen and should buy instead the right knives for your kitchen depend on the type of cooking you do of course however there are a few multi purpose knives that every home cook should have because they re good at just about anything you throw at them here are the essentials a 20 or 25cm chef s knife which one you get depends entirely on your kitchen working space and how comfortable you are with a large knife i prefer a 20cm knife unless i m working with larger cuts of meat or thick rinded vegetables in which case the added length of the 25cm option can make a huge difference you ve heard us mention it before but the 8 victorinox fibrox is a knife that punches way above its weight here and the 10 mercer culinary is no slouch either an 8 or 10cm paring knife for things like peeling fruit and veg and general light duty jobs you ll want a good paring knife america s test kitchen likes the wusthof classic paring knife but the victorinox swiss classic paring knife is a good second choice and a much better budget option a long serrated bread knife life without a bread knife sucks they re not just for cutting bread either think cuts of fatty meat tomatoes peaches or just about anything else that s firm on the outside and soft on the inside advertisement you ll want at least a 25cm blade with a little flexibility as this america s test kitchen review explains in detail again the 10 victorinox bread knife was one of their favourite picks delivering clean cuts with a long handle for easy grip if you have cash though the wustof 10 classic bread knife was their clear favourite an 18 or 20cm santoku okay so this is my personal choice because i prefer a santoku handles over a chef s knife for many tasks like multipurpose slicing and cutting vegetables you may or may not agree but i recommend mercer culinary s 7 santoku knife as a good budget option these are your starters but if you d like to know more check out alton brown s gear for your kitchen the knives you don t need but will eventually want once you have the knives above here are some additional knives that you don t need to have but they ll certainly make specific tasks much much easier a carving or slicing knife don t mistake this for a bread knife a long flexible non serrated blade like this victorinox 10 slicing knife can mean the difference between nice even slices of ham roast or corned beef or cake and a hacked up mess basically you ll use it for anything you want nice even slices from a meat cleaver lots of lists include the meat cleaver as an essential and we can kind of understand why but often times a chef s knife will do instead however if you re ready to expand your knife collection you ll love having a cleaver a chinese cleaver can be the best of both worlds designed for finely chopping vegetables like cabbages and carrots you can also use it as an impromptu bench scraper or for hammering through bones and joints of large cuts of meat this paudin 7 cleaver is a good option for the more traditional cook advertisement a fillet or boning knife once you get in the habit of filleting your own fish or cutting up your own chicken you ll probably eventually want one of these the super thin narrow and flexible blade makes it easy to slip in between bones and joints in a way you just can t do with a chef s knife it s also good for cutting off excess fat from large cuts of meat or trimming off thin skin from large fruits and veggies america s test kitchen and cook s illustrated prefer the 6 victorinox fibrox boning knife read more keep your knives out of the utensil drawer to keep them sharp and happy a pair of kitchen shears there s a strong case to be made that these should be on the

19 447 billion metric tonnes and 353 8 million teu twenty foot equivalent unit from january 2020 to april 2021 the volume of cargo that have been through chinese ports was almost 19 5 billion tonnes within the same period the container throughput stands at over 350 million 20ft container equivalent units since the pandemic china has been recovering faster than many other countries with their export figures rebounding spectacularly after the first half of 2020 western countries started buying large volumes of products from china especially the united states of america so huge volumes of shipping containers had to leave chinese ports cargo for ocean freight are transported in metal containers when these shipping containers are delivered to the port of destination they usually circle back to the port of loading albeit many make a few stops along the way when required when it gets back to the original port the process repeats itself that has not been happening it s because china is currently shipping way more to the us europe and the rest of the world than it is importing china has been moving a lot of shipping containers to their biggest markets and these containers do not circle back to facilitate other exports why millions of shipping containers were stranded at many locations around the world when the pandemic started congested ports also did not have the needed manpower to process customs procedures in a fast manner these hampered global container circulation many shipping containers were stranded on chinese ports as well at the beginning of the pandemic but thechinese economy rebounded these shipping containers got emptied and were sent back out due to western demand for asian made products the story is not the same in most parts in the world a shortage in this instance means shipping containers are congested somewhere concentrated elsewhere not repurposed or out of commission a few months back bloomberg reported on a massive backlog of 28 container ships that were waiting to enter just the us ports of long beach california and los angeles an additional 16 ships full of containers were expected to arrive over the following three days a week before that it was 26 container ships reports from officials monitoring marine traffic in san pedro bay indicated it was less than the 40 container vessels backlog peak back in february 2021 also back in march 2021 one of the world s largest container vessels a 400m long 200 000 tonne ship called the ever given got stuck in the suez canal and frustrated the entire global shipping industry about 12 of global trade use the canal daily so it s understandable how and why it became such a big deal the ever given got stuck after it run aground and wedged sideways across the canal blocking passage for other ships there were over 360 ships that were waiting on either sides of the canal to cross during this blockade this contributed to the current shortage of containers globally it made worse an already ailing world container circulation during the second half of 2020 ecommerce traffic exploded all over the world amazon profits have soared past 200 since this pandemic begun china represents a very large volume of suppliers for ecommerce websites and china is currently shipping more to the us and europe than it is importing you d have to also factor in the fact that over the last few decades there has been a lot of outsourcing to china so already china has been exporting massively to many parts of the world this global container shortage situation has been a problem waiting to happen only very much exacerbated by the current covid pandemic heavy competition for available containers have sent shipping rates through the roof the whole situation looks dreadful when you factor in the current limited air freight capacity since the pandemic started the airline industry have been dealt a heavy blow with record low number of flights when there s increased demand prices usually rise with freight rates soaring and a shortage of shipping containers coupled with limited air freight capacity ecommerce companies and their customers suffer in the west retail purchasing has shifted to primarily ecommerce because of lockdowns and other covid related restrictions as earlier stated china is exporting more to the west than vice versa and most of these shipping containers are not circling back compared to q1 2020 freight rates have gone up by as much as 300 from china to the usa that shipping cost surge must be borne by someone the consumer in ghana everyone purchases one thing or another that s imported most of our poultry is imported most of our rice is imported when companies suffer added costs yet maintain increased demand the final bearer of the added cost is none other than yours truly you remember extra shipping costs must be borne by someone e commerce has picked up in ghana at a fast and impressive pace the brief lockdown we experienced also accelerated this yet it s still not mainstream to use an app or a website to order for broiler frozen chicken product for cooking the fact still remains that a large volume of what we consume as citizens are imported because china is facing a challenge with container circulation any country that depends on chinese exports will be affected it s safe to say then that it is why seemingly every country in the world is affected by this inadequate container circulation including ghana and where we get our imports think electronics think automobile spare parts think household items etc what s happening is that there s so much cargo waiting to be loaded onto shipping vessels and the ships are ready but shipping containers are scarce because of all the above mentioned the higher the demand the more visible the variance here s an example let s take frozen poultry products everybody eats chicken generally speaking the sale price of one carton of chicken leg quarters broiler has increased from gh 97 as at two weeks ago to gh 115 this week it looks like it ll go up a bit next week as well i know because i checked all this is because freight rates and other delivery costs to ghana have gone up just as with other places in the world due to the limited availability of shipping containers importers are not carrying these extra costs for you that shipping cost surge must be borne by someone if you ve bought a broiler recently you just took that added cost frozen products face a particular challenge because about 10 of the world s shipping containers are refrigerated what they call reefers reefers are meant to transport perishable products like seafood and poultry while all of freight is affected it s easy to see why freight involving reefers face a more acute challenge all this will stop when trade flows smoothen out the problem is covid seems to be resurging so normalcy in this respect in 2021 does not look likely when you take into consideration the recent spikes in cases in many places in the world then there s new covid variants that keep popping up it wasn t raining when noah built the ark those that prepared for a day when consumers do not need to enter brick and mortar stores for shopping items have literally made billions of dollars and made their co participants and other stakeholders millions and billions of dollars amazon so i ve been talking about solutions emergency preparedness is a team sport eric whitaker said that there have been two occasions where i ve held discussions in passing on the limited availability of shipping containers from how they re addressing challenges i ve thought yeah this could work really well i had an interesting conversation with one company the other day innovative distribution solutions ids they had an innovative approach to the shocks that ghanaian supply chains are suffering because of covid ids has created an app where in a world moving further away from brick and mortar one can create and sell products on a small scale or on a large scale all from the convenience of your mobile phone anywhere in the world a lot of competitors are in the emarket space what makes ids stand out to me is the extensive warehousing and cold store infrastructure for frozen products well positioned across the country remember when i said consumers in ghana are not accustomed to buying broilers from a phone or a laptop ids makes that possible with an app that is populated with an impressive and growing number of wholesalers retailers and even a good number of insulated aboboya s that make frozen product deliveries right to your doorstep in effect you can direct delivery of your dry stock into an ids warehouse or delivery of your frozen products into an ids cold store and once your estore on the ids app is loaded with your very own stock that s it you can sell without ever handling a single one of your products because ids supports dry and wet last mile deliveries as well the other conversation i had was with mne shipping the way they explain their project they make me think of supply chain as the different stages of things because a thing overseas doesn t just land in ghana it passes through many stages they ve broken it all down into many stages and have taken a critical look into how to make the operations of each stage very efficient by improving value for money there s a difference between lowering delivery costs and increasing value for money still the two are not mutually exclusive traditional shipping lines had one main objective to deliver your product at the lowest cost so over the years the ships got bigger and bigger that made them slower and slower and by their sheer volume of containers per vessel they made multiple stops along the way to ghana the result of this is that delivery cost per unit gets reduced but delivery time got way too long what mne shipping understands very well is the concept of working capital of you the shipper when you have ordered products overseas to ghana while it s on this traditionally slow ship that s your working capital locked up right there that s your money sitting on someone s big ship not earning you a single cedi or pesewa even if you really needed it you can t send a helicopter for it because it s probably under a thousand containers far out at sea so that s a real problem mne shipping believes that the shipping industry should be speeding up shipments not slowing it down traditional shipping companies got carried away by their unit economy calculations with their super mega ships but they didn t account for the law of unintended consequences elsewhere in the ghana man s pocket if you have two months of inventory on your books as opposed to one month your balance sheet will be bigger but at what cost what s the true cost of capital there is a cost of having your working capital in the form of cargo sitting on someone s slow ship for 4 to 6 weeks their solution to utilise medium sized shipping vessels that are fast and singularly headed directly for ghana so delivery periods becomes shorter and the economies of scale still do kick in because each delivery by sea from mne is a shipload nonetheless i believe they hit that critical clientele mass that allows them to do regular shiploads with ease all this is towards reducing that delivery cost per sku stock keeping unit from an overseas factory to your doorstep in a pandemic this is innovation container shortages have changed the working dynamics of many trading companies since covid as many economies recover things will only get worse and then better because global demand for shipping services will go higher the global shortage of shipping containers will persist for a much longer while then we d like necessity is the mother of invention

it s too risky to own chinese technology stocks said david roche president and global strategist at independent strategy roche said uncertainty stems from an ongoing regulatory crackdown in china and the geopolitical rivalry between washington and beijing he added that taiwan s dominance in the high end semiconductor space is one factor underpinning the investment case for for the north asian market on a two to three year horizon veteran investment strategist david roche said it s too risky to own chinese technology stocks given an ongoing regulatory crackdown in china and the geopolitical rivalry between washington and beijing there are a lot of issues to do with politics there are a lot of issues to do with the availability of technology which personally i don t want to take those risks in a portfolio at the present time roche president and global strategist at independent strategy told cnbc s squawk box asia on monday u s china relations were already rocky as president joe biden took office and some observers have warned that tensions between the two countries could worsen get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters biden has kept many restrictions on chinese tech companies imposed by his predecessor donald trump that includes export controls on chinese telecommunications equipment maker huawei and top chipmaker semiconductor manufacturing international corp tensions with the u s and its allies mean that china will have problem in accessing the high end of things like robots and the high end in particular of semiconductors said roche at the same time chinese regulators have stepped up scrutiny on some of the country s largest tech firms including e commerce giant alibaba and ride hailing app didi roche said the crackdown adds uncertainty and makes companies such as those in the financial technology space less profitable and less attractive to investors investment case for taiwan while china aims to become self reliant in tech particularly semiconductors it will take years before the country can catch up to industry leaders such as taiwan said the veteran strategist roche said taiwan produces 70 of all really high end chips in the world while china only accounts for about 5 of the global share that s one factor underpinning the investment case for taiwan on a two to three year horizon he added the big asset of taiwan is its research and technological ability to produce high end chips the strategist said so essentially taiwan is the golden egg for china it is also the golden egg for the united states because it supplies the united states which has lost its leadership in this section so that puts taiwan in a very special place added roche but he warned that taiwan is geopolitically very vulnerable the ruling chinese communist party in beijing has never controlled taiwan but it claims the self ruled democratic island as a renegade province that must be one day reunited with the mainland the ccp doesn t rule out the use of force to take over taiwan chinese president xi jinping last week pledged complete reunification with taiwan in a speech to mark the communist party s 100th year which drew a strong rebuke from taiwan roche said a move by xi on taiwan is most definitely on the cards for the next five years but it is probably not on the cards for the next two to three years
according to the mainstream narrative we were all born yesterday there is no such thing as context history or critical analysis just cherry picked short term data deltas which are held to be either awesome or at least much improved from last time that s why we predictably got this headline from the wall street journal with reference to today s june employment release which allegedly showed employers added 850 000 jobs last month stocks tick higher with strong jobs report well no it wasn t and they employers didn t in fact total hours worked in june actually declined from the may level and far more importantly were still down 4 4 from the pre covid peak in february 2020 when expressed in total hours there is absolutely nothing strong at all about the numbers to wit at the end of q2 2021 total hours employed in the nonfarm economy were still down 8 billion hours from the q4 2019 level that s right eight billion worker hours are mia yet the lazy shills at the wsj bloomberg reuters et al keep pumping out bilge about an awesome economic rebound actually what has never been noted notwithstanding the fact that it sits there in plain sight on the bls website is that dr fauci and his economy wreckers dug a far deeper hole in the main street labor market last spring than the narrative led you to believe at the pre covid peak in q4 2019 the nonfarm economy utilized 257 2 billion labor hours at an annualized rate but that plunged by nearly 12 to just 227 6 billion hours in q2 2020 so doing fauci co wiped out all of the aggregate nonfarm labor hours gain since q4 2011 that is to say it obliterated the awesome gains that had been contained in 102 monthly jobs friday reports in the interim and now after 4 trillion of freshly printed fiat cash and 6 trillion of stimmies and other bailouts and free stuff only 73 of the state imposed shrinkage of hours worked has been recovered as of june 2021 indeed the not at all awesome june jobs report was even more squirrely than usual our memory may fail but we are quite sure that back in the day june was the time when school let out the city kids all got to got to go to the beach and we farm kids got to pick the berries cherries sweetcorn cucumbers peaches and tomatoes as they took their turn in rotation perhaps no longer the bls claims that state local and private educational institutions went on a hiring binge during june bringing on a total of 269 000 new teachers to superintend presumably empty classrooms moreover when you add in the 192 000 bartenders and waiters who were rehired in june that adds up to 461 000 jobs or 54 of the ballyhooed 850 000 gain during the month meanwhile when it comes to the high pay high productivity jobs in construction manufacturing mining and energy not so much those sectors accounted for 23 338 million jobs in may and reported an increase of well 20k jobs in june that s a 0 0008 gain if you have your hp 12c set to four decimal places more importantly the 20 358 million goods producing jobs reported for june were still down by 780 000 from the pre covid peak in february 2020 and on the more appropriate and accurate hour based measurement employment in the goods producing sector truly remains mired in the dumps thus the index of aggregate hours worked for june black line was down by 6 4 from its 2019 interim high and off by 21 1 from its turn of the century level 23 1 from its all time peak in march 1979 and down by 4 8 from the level first attained in well may 1947 you can t make this up employment in the goods producing sector of the us economy has been dying on the vine for a half century and even as these jobs paid a living wage of 56 000 per annum in the month of june the purchasing power of those paychecks was no higher than january 1979 on an inflation adjusted basis purple line in summary after real wages in the goods producing sector doubled between 1947 and 1979 what has followed is one half century of real wage stagnation coupled with a 23 shrinkage of hours worked that alone should ixnay the strong and blow out descriptions that have been used hundreds of times in the interim to describe the jobs friday reports real weekly earnings versus aggregate weekly hours good producing sector 1947 2021 then again there is truly no mystery as to where the fed s endless injections of fiat credit have come out in the wash for three decades the nation s central bank has been primarily inflating financial asset prices on wall street not jobs incomes and prosperity on main street and that s especially been the case since the pre crisis peak in q4 2007 when today s 8 1 trillion fed balance sheet stood at just 800 billion for want of doubt you only need to ponder the message of the chart below in order to ascertain what an 8x increase in the fed s balance sheet has actually generated since q4 2007 cumulative gains have been as follows nonfarm labor hours red line 4 3 nonfarm output black line 24 8 nominal gdp blue line 50 nasdaq 100 purple line 600 q e d do these knuckleheads have the slightest idea that this is their true handiwork really is there any more proof needed that all of their lunatic money pumping never actually leaves the canyons of wall street cumulative gains since q4 2007 stocks versus main street so we perforce return to the central topic namely that the fed s moaar inflation mantra is one of the most perversely idiotic and inequitable public policies ever imposed by an arm of the state in fact hitting the averaged over time 2 00 inflation goal remains the only reason for the fed s 120 billion per month of what amounts to financial fraud after all with employers from coast to coast scrambling to find workers continued money pumping is surely not needed to further the so called full employment goal for crying out loud private employers are already on it then again would it be too much trouble for these power intoxicated groupthink inebriated dolts to examine exactly what their pro inflation policies have actually produced and we mean over an extensive period of time where the cumulative impact can be clearly observed well here s an inflation targeting stopper if there ever was one during the approximate half century since real hourly rates peaked in 1972 the average american worker has been on the mother of all treadmills change from 1972 through 2020 nominal hourly wages 533 real hourly earnings 2 2 it doesn t get any more dramatic than that even the proverbial squirrel in the cage would have gotten the bends after that 50 year journey to nowhere 50 year trend nominal versus inflation adjusted hourly earnings as is evident in the chart above the fed made a cataclysmic mistake in the 1990s and thereafter due to the high inflation of the 1970s and to a lesser extent through the 1980s nominal hourly wage had tripled between 1972 and 1995 when mr deng s shiny new export factories were cranking up with ultra cheap labor drained out of china s endless rice paddies and peasant villages and thank you all that 200 gain in nominal wages had not done domestic workers one damn bit of good in 1995 real hourly wages purple line were actually 18 below the level that had obtained in 1972 when fed chairman arthur burns to his everlasting shame grabbed his ankles upon nixon s presentation of what amounted to an election year bar of soap nixon got his temporarily booming economy and landslide election victory of course but that had also set up the hard hats nixon labor dems and forgotten middle class like sitting ducks vis à vis the new chinese and mexican et al export factories by the mid 1990s the dollar wage gap was now enormous so what was needed was deflation of domestic prices wages and costs not more of the same as it happened under greenspan s phony disinflation policies and then bernanke s formal inflation targeting regime thereafter the domestic price level was inflated by another 70 or 2 14 per annum between 1995 and 2020 what that meant was fully two thirds of the gain in average hourly wages during that period was eaten up by domestic inflation when the order of the day should have been wringing out some of the staggering 240 increase in the domestic price level that had occurred between 1972 and 1995 yes inflation adjusted hourly wage rates purple line above did manage to crawl back to their 1972 starting point by 2020 but at the expense of another doubling of nominal wage rates that is to say the fed s idiotic pro inflation policies drove the wage gap between domestic factories and the new low wage export economies dramatically wider in all average dollar wages in the us were 533 higher by 2020 than they had been when nixon destroyed the gold backed dollar in 1971 1972 needless to say when the average domestic wage rate went from 3 90 per hour in 1972 to 24 68 per hour in 2020 at absolutely no purchasing power benefit to workers it left corporate executives with no choice except to outsource and offshore to the maximum feasible extent and that set in motion the hollowing out of america s industrial economy the chart below is surely the smoking gun implicit in the fed s faustian bargain that is it got its fetishistic 2 00 inflation and showered the household sector with cheap debt to augment living standards that would have otherwise diminished owing to the export of good jobs as a result real consumption spending pce for goods rose by 87 or 3 0 per annum between q1 2002 and q1 2021 yet during the same 19 year period the industrial production index for manufacturing rose by only 9 or barely 0 41 per year needless to say we are not talking here about some marginal item that is better produced abroad where some venue has comparative advantage as adam smith originally saw it to the contrary this is the entire goods economy and for all practical purposes the growth in consumption of goods during this century to date has been supplied by imports it is no wonder therefore that the burned out zones of the rust belt voted for high tariff man trump twice real pce for durables versus manufactured goods output q1 2002 q1 2021 in throwing good producing workers under the china import bus the powers that be urged them to make up the difference by buying stock wall street had plenty of rapidly inflating shares on offer and the donald could not stop telling workers to check their 401ks but here s the thing to ride the drastically inflated stock market higher you had to have material savings to invest and growing wages to allocate to investment rather than current consumption alas american workers had neither when greenspan was nominated to head the fed in july 1987 the average wage was 9 12 per hour and the nasdaq 100 index stood at 196 that is it took about 22 hours of work to buy the index at the close of june 2021 the average hourly wage as we learned this am was 25 68 per hour while the nasdaq 100 had taken flight to another financial planet posting at 14 554 that is it now took 566 hours of work to buy the index or 26x more than when greenspan inaugurated wealth effects monetary policy to paraphrase a famous black panther slogan of the 1960s trickle down might have been televised on cnbc but it most definitely did not happen number of worker hours to buy the nasdaq 100 1987 2021 what happened of course is them s that had got our friend tim knight who publishes at the must read slope of hope captured the moral of this story about as well as can be said while his accompanying chart truly does tell you all you need to know well if you weren t born yesterday the economy the capital markets and wealth distribution have become more grotesquely distorted perverted and warped than at any other time in human

event that will impact the lives of indonesians especially during the covid pandemic and well beyond sort of flew a little under the radar two of indonesia s largest tech unicorns announced that they will be combining to form a new entity that currently contributes two percent of the country s gdp and potentially ten percent if the ambition of tokopedia s ceo is realized the announcement in may that gojek and tokopedia are merging will result in a company with a combined value of usd18 billion based on valuations during fundraising between 2019 to 2020 the new entity named goto is seeking a concurrent listing in the united states and on the jakarta stock exchange this year that could give the integrated company a public market value of between usd 35and 40 billion on july 1 indonesia reluctantly announced a two week lockdown but only for the main island of java where the capital city jakarta is and the resort island of bali this followed reports that indonesia s covid 19 cases have trebled to over 20 000 per day in the last three weeks challenging the limits of its healthcare system indonesia has less than half the intensive care beds per capita compared with india the lockdown will affect about 55 percent of its population and 12 of the country s 34 provinces as with other countries that have experienced lockdowns food delivery and e commerce will become an

article mark rais there are vocal calls for government intervention in the booming housing market what is deeply troubling is not the creative albeit often futile ideas that are driving government intervention in the pricing of residential housing the deeply there are vocal calls for government intervention in the booming housing market what is deeply troubling is not the creative albeit often futile ideas that are driving government intervention in the pricing of residential housing the deeply troubling aspect is that many people are calling for intervention in a market dynamic that is neither regionally influenced nor driven by existing government policies the residential housing boom we see is the result of macro economic dynamics influenced at a global level and perpetuated by the overall monetary system demands that labour fix the residential housing price boom occur when ignoring world wide trends and monetary dynamics that are positioning the housing market as one of the few remaining stable investment vehicles there is an ongoing substantive and particularly long lived residential housing boom occurring globally this global boom in residential investments is specifically targeted within stable economies that have grounded monetary policies where long term investment growth remains tenable unlike much of the rest of the world therefore it is not a surprise that some european nations north america and some asia pacific nations are seeing a particularly high intensity housing boom in march the wall street journal reported on a housing boom that was across the globe the point the authors mike cherney and patricia kowsmann made in their article house prices are inflating around the world was absolutely essential pandemic related stimulus ultralow rates and changes in buyer behavior are turbocharging markets from europe to asia this point was raised again by major economists in april with poignant economist article by bicester and rhinebeck declaring house prices in the rich world are booming furthermore in may reuters reported in the concise article pandemic surge in european house prices raises fears of new bubble that a set of specific stable economies like sweden and germany were seeing unprecedented housing booms in the article the housing supply was pointed to as a fundamental stabilising mechanism for run away economies that had been over heated by the pandemic responses and inappropriately low mortgage levels there is nothing particularly unique nor surprising regarding the new zealand housing boom there is nothing particularly unique nor surprising regarding the new zealand housing boom interest rates were held too low for too long creating very strong incentives combined with a pandemic that both overshadowed and blurred the lines between stabilising growth and over stimulus on top of the global monetary weakness driven by trade wars and inflationary stimulus printing the current new zealand housing market boom is driven by much more profound underlying global macro economic instigators that require new zealand government to use broad and holistic approaches fixation on house prices encouragement of punitive legislation around that explicitly market and implementing this in the current macro economic environment can have substantively negative consequences related to kiwi investments household income and overall stability of the new zealand economy instead as many of the economists have already proposed the boom must be taken in the context of the global financial markets and only then proper and stabilising decisions should be made key aspects include 1 prepare everyone for rate rises the government leaders can take steps for immediate preparation and incentivised programmes to help offset and stabilise mortgage debt as rates rise ensuring we do not see sudden mortgage shocks 2 leaders can help promote better banking practices banks offer mortgages to investors because their system especially driven by larger international banking processes encourage money to flow to where money already exists new home buyers young families getting started hardworking single people are very low on the ranking for bank lending leaders can incentivise loan policies to some degree and dictate how well such incentives work for first home buyers and younger investors 3 leaders can help promote young to save simple tax policies can help as well as creating new incentives specifically to allow young kiwi s to save money encourage longer term investment strategies and have options other than housing for wealth building instead most young working people are watching as any saved wealth devalues quickly due to the inflationary reality of the current macro economic conditions 4 leaders can diminish economic rhetoric that may collapse the nz economy vocal proponents of government intervention demand that leaders step in and do something to control a housing market instead of making demands around other broader market incentives that will work for instance these intervention proponents often fail to demand incentives for higher wages even though wages are a key aspect of wealth disparity 5 wage disparity and job security are fundamental causes of social divide ironically it is the government employment itself that regularly fails to create environment and processes to either retain hard working staff or pay them market salaries now is probably an inappropriate time to encourage government pay freezes where the economic disparity is growing so quickly for now many government wages remain abysmally low compared to overall cost of living and the government is notorious for employment contracts that do not meet its own rhetoric 6 encouraging other savings methods the current policies do nothing to encourage savings and the banks have all but completely eradicated savings plans as a part of their focus in this unique environment the leadership can create tax and other incentives to promote other forms of savings and thus investment demand it may be a bit late to the gate but such incentives should exist otherwise single focused investment vehicles become the fixation of most investors 7 increase housing supply by increasing incentives to build finally an overt method by which the government can and should intervene is to incentivise housing supply the housing stock remains low as costs for building are increasing and market instability raises risks for developers government leadership should create positive incentives to build more houses that are designed and developed to be affordable at lower mortgage debt rates and require lower initial deposit levels this unique housing boom is global in scope and can only be tempered when our leaders focus on overall macro economic policies that create stability unfortunately a fixation with housing prices and short term focused policies will increasingly encourage more intensive upheaval in
