on tuesday that authorities had once again not been able to evacuate civilians due to kremlin attacks moscow s forces have laid siege to ukrainian cities and cut off food water heat and medicine in a growing humanitarian disaster but for days attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians have stumbled amid continuing fighting and objections to the proposed routes mizintsev earlier said ukrainian authorities had endorsed only one civilian evacuation route from areas affected by fighting out of 10 that were proposed including five towards territory controlled by kyiv europe s worst refugee crisis since the second world war grew even more severe with un officials reporting that 2million people have now fled ukraine it comes as ukraine accused russia of carrying out new airstrikes

000 people according to video from the ukrainian communications agency vereshchuk said they were heading south west to the city of poltava and included students from india and china hours before the convoy reached sumy overnight strikes killed 21 people there including two children ukrainian authorities said meanwhile buses emblazoned with red cross symbols carried water medicine and food towards the encircled southern port of mariupol scene of some of the worst desperation vereshchuk said the vehicles would ferry civilians out of the city of 430 000 people but soon after officials announced the buses were on their way ukrainian authorities said they had learned of shelling on the escape route it was unclear whether the supply convoy made it to mariupol and it appeared unlikely that civilians would be able to board the buses to get out the deputy mayor of mariupol cast doubt on the evacuations telling the bbc that russian forces continued to pound areas where people were trying to gather ahead of being taken out he said some roads were blocked while others were mined so we cannot establish sustainable ceasefire and safety route at the moment serhiy orlov said so we still have a city in blockade the city is without water heat working sewage systems or phone service residents have been getting water from streams or by melting snow corpses lay in the streets and authorities planned to start digging mass graves with the electricity out many people are relying on car radios for information picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by russian forces or russian backed separatists in mariupol authorities planned to start digging mass graves for all the dead though the number is unclear the shelling has shattered buildings and the city has no water heat working sewage systems or phone service theft has become widespread for food clothes even furniture with locals referring to the practice as getting a discount some residents are reduced to scooping water from streams with the electricity out many people are relying on their car radios for information picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by russian forces or russian backed separatists ludmila amelkina who was walking along an alley strewn with rubble and walls pocked by gunfire said the destruction had been devastating we don t have electricity we don t have anything to eat we don t have medicine we ve got nothing she said looking skyward in a video address from an undisclosed location ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said a child had died of dehydration in mariupol another sign of the city s desperation nearly two weeks into the fighting russian forces have captured a stretch of southern and coastal ukraine but have seen their advances stopped in many areas including around kyiv by ukrainian fighters targeting moscow s armoured columns thousands of people are thought to have been killed civilians and soldiers although the actual number remains unknown for days as moscow s forces have laid siege to ukrainian cities attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians have stumbled amid continuing fighting and objections to the proposed routes kyiv has rejected moscow s offers of corridors that lead civilians to russia or its ally belarus the russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the ukrainian side is blocking evacuation efforts people carry a wounded woman during the evacuation by civilians of the city of irpin northwest of kyiv civilians continue to flee from irpin due to ongoing russian attacks as snow falls a woman carries her dog during the evacuation by civilians of the city of irpin northwest of kyiv people displaced from their homes carry what belongings they can as they flee from the city of irpin near kyiv russia has committed all of the forces it massed on the ukrainian border before the invasion and has made only limited territorial gains capturing just one major city kherson others including sumy and kyiv are slowly being surrounded but in some places the ukrainians have managed to thwart russian attacks or successfully counter attack kyiv claims these are the losses that its forces have inflicted on russia in the first 12 days of fighting while moscow has acknowledged casualties none of these figures have been verified we will shoot you like rabid dogs for

which they say they will avenge every child killed in russia s invasion of their country posting a video on tiktok the six women holding machine guns and assault rifles and dressed in combat fatigues against the backdrop of a ukrainian flag say they will destroy the enemy on every inch of ukrainian land the video begins with a woman whose face is covered by a battle scarf saying we are women of

successful tuesday with vereshchuk saying that 5 000 civilians including 1 700 foreign students had been brought out via a safe corridor from sumy an embattled northeastern city of a quarter million people where overnight strikes killed 21 including two children the fighting has caused global economic turmoil with energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting it also threatens the food supply of millions around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the black sea region western countries have rushed weapons to ukraine and moved to slap putin s russia with sanctions in a further effort to punish moscow us president joe biden announced a ban on russian oil imports and shell announced it will stop buying oil and gas from russia ukraine s military said its forces continued defence operations in the mariupol suburbs the military said demoralised russian forces were looting commandeering civilian buildings and setting up firing positions in populated areas the battle for mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow moscow to establish a land corridor to crimea which russia seized from ukraine in 2014 oleksiy kuleba governor of the kyiv region said ukraine was also making arrangements to get people out of the suburb of irpin late on tuesday zelensky released a video showing him standing near the presidential offices in kyiv behind him were piles of sandbags a snow dusted tree and a few cars it was the second video in 24 hours showing him near the country s seat of power apparently made to dispel any doubts about whether he had fled the city advertisement snow fell it s that kind of springtime he said in a soft voice you see it s that kind of wartime that kind of springtime harsh but we will win
president joe biden ran as the tough on russia candidate but americans want him to do more to curb moscow s warmongering forays into eastern europe multiple recent polls conducted since russian president vladimir putin invaded ukraine show a majority of americans think biden needs to be tougher on his russian counterpart biden responded to some of that political pressure tuesday when he announced that the united states would no longer be purchasing russian oil and gas a quinnipiac poll released monday found that 56 of respondents said that the steps taken by biden so far to punish russia for invading ukraine were not strong enough with only 30 saying they were sufficient in the same poll americans approved of banning the import of russian energy by a margin of 71 22 even if it leads to higher gas prices that s just the move biden announced tuesday the same day that gas prices reached an all time record high of 4 14 according to aaa surpassing levels hit during the 2008 2009 financial crisis nearly 10 of america s imported energy comes from russia meaning prices could continue to rise due to the ban a separate poll taken by the economist and yougov between feb 26 and march 1 found that only 11 of americans would not impose additional sanctions on russia 40 said they supported more sanctions even if it resulted in higher gas prices 49 of americans said the government s response to russia should be tougher compared to only 28 who said it was about right or should be softer biden was delayed in taking some actions that americans broadly approved of such as sanctioning putin directly according to multiple reports the white house also stepped in to nix a bipartisan plan in congress to ban the import of russian energy in order to not be seen as leading from behind on the issue related biden says he can t do much right now about rising gas prices members from both parties expressed frustration that they spent the whole weekend working in a bipartisan fashion only to get rolled by the wh and as i type this reuters reports a wh announcement to ban russian oil is imminent jacqui heinrich jacquiheinrich march 8 2022 a cbs poll released march 1 found that biden s approval rating on the ukraine crisis is heavily underwater with independents on the whole only 41 of americans approved of how he s handled the situation predictably democrats approved 71 29 and republicans disapproved 83 17 but among independents only 35 approved and 65 disapproved on the campaign trail biden positioned himself as the choice that would be harder on russia and putin after democrats for years accused former president donald trump of colluding with the russian government to advance his own personal interests biden tweeted in feb 2020 that putin doesn t want me to be president vladimir putin doesn t want me to be president he doesn t want me to be our nominee if you re wondering why it s because i m the only person in this field who s ever gone toe to toe with him joe biden joebiden february 21 2020 biden s economic sanctions have done significant financial harm to russia the russian stock market has been closed for a week and a half and counting and the value of the ruble has plummeted more than 40 in the past month more hawkish options remain available to biden and the next one the white house and its nato allies may consider is the institution of a no fly zone over ukrainian airspace initially dismissed by many pundits calls for such a policy have grown louder from defense experts and american politicians in recent days ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy has repeatedly asked the west to secure ukrainian airspace white house press secretary jen psaki has consistently reiterated that a no fly zone would be a bad idea such a policy would require nato aircraft to shoot down russian planes in the event they fly over ukraine potentially leading to a wider more destructive conflict between moscow washington and europe related poll republicans and independents would defend america if invaded dems say they would flee but the american people are coming around to the idea that the biden team is hesitant to broach a new reuters ipsos poll released friday found that 74 of americans supported instituting a no fly zone enforced by nato over ukraine majorities of both republicans and democrats were in favor of the policy the question s wording did not fully explain the possible implications of the policy thus far the war in ukraine has claimed thousands of lives between the two sides including many civilians most of the world has united in condemnation and sanctioning of russia but putin has continued to justify the war on denazification grounds as he cracks down on domestic liberties in his own country
by brenda goodman cnn the man came to the er at charles regional medical center in la plata maryland wide eyed and scared he couldn t catch his breath he was middle aged overweight and unvaccinated he had also recently tested positive for covid 19 two weeks earlier a doctor who had diagnosed the man during an urgent care visit had noted his risk factors and prescribed a new drug paxlovid an antiviral pill that in clinical trials cut a person s the risk of hospitalization or death from covid 19 by nearly 90 compared with a placebo but the man hadn t taken it because he couldn t find it he said i went to a couple of pharmacies and they just didn t have it said a doctor who later treated him in the er the doctor asked not to be named because he didn t have permission from his employer to speak about the case a ct scan revealed that a massive clot called a saddle embolism was choking off the blood supply to the man s lungs the doctor had no doubt that the cause of the rare clot was the man s untreated covid 19 infection quick treatment saved the man s life he was extremely lucky to survive the doctor said paxlovid and another covid 19 antiviral pill molnupiravir were widely hailed as pandemic game changers when the us food and drug administration authorized them in late december taken within the first five days of covid 19 symptoms they can sharply reduce illness severity seizing on the potential of these new therapies the federal government ordered at least 23 million courses of these medications 20 million of paxlovid and more than 3 million of molnupiravir at a cost of more than 1 billion this week the federal government is launching a program called test to treat that aims to improve access to the medications by creating one stop locations where people with covid symptoms can take a rapid test get their results within minutes see a clinician and leave with a course of the medication to take at home the program was needed because although the federal government has been shipping treatment courses to states access to the pills quickly became unequal while a doctor in delaware scours the internet and spends hours calling local pharmacies to try to find the pills for her patients courses of the drugs sit unused on pharmacy shelves in mississippi leading dr thomas dobbs the state s public health officer to plead with physicians and patients to use them the government has been distributing these scarce treatments to states based on the size of their populations and their covid 19 infection rates and although states can shift unused supplies within their own borders there s no plan to redistribute unused doses from states that have a surplus like mississippi to those that are going without like west virginia which has used 84 of its allotted doses of paxlovid through march 7 holy smokes i could use some of that said retired maj gen james hoyer director of west virginia s joint interagency task force after learning how many doses of paxlovid other states still have on hand we use our entire allocations every week and we could probably use an additional two to three times what we receive hoyer said no plan to redistribute unused pills in the past if states weren t using all their supplies of infused therapies like monoclonal antibodies they could decline their allotment and the federal government could sweep unused covid 19 therapies back into a federal pool where it could be claimed by other states said michael ganio senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the american society of health systems pharmacists because of the high demand for these drugs and because of how limited the supply is by not sweeping it it makes sure that states still have access to that amount ganio said that gives the states some certainty with regard to supply but it comes at the expense of flexibility and access for areas that are going without it s really really frustrating from an icu doc perspective said the maryland doctor who treated the man with the serious blood clot i should be able to prescribe it to my family members like i do with tamiflu and it should be available at every cvs in the country i just don t understand why it s not test to treat may bring this ideal closer to reality for the first time pharmacies will be able to order their own supplies of the pills from the federal government without having to go through states in its latest weekly update the us department of health and human services assistant secretary for preparedness and response or aspr said the supplies of pills to stock the test to treat program will come from a separate federal cache of drugs that will not affect current state allocations test to treat will also ship pills directly to pharmacies serving long term care facilities pharmacy chains will choose where the pills should go however rather than the federal government or states although the program officially gets underway this week it may take some time to get it up and running and it s not clear where stores that participate in the program will be located in many states lifesaving pills go unused until test to treat becomes widely available however states will continue to be the main distributors of antivirals pills a cnn analysis of data collected from state health departments shows big differences in availability of these medications washington and new jersey report using nearly all available supplies of their paxlovid for example but minnesota mississippi and utah still have more than three quarters of their allocated supplies providers are tasked with reporting daily usage of these therapeutics into the federal government and hhs shares this data in a public therapeutics locator the federal data however is notably incomplete thousands of providers last updated usage more than a month ago and some states told cnn that some providers have not reported this information at all it s really frustrating said dr tete tonwe who runs a family practice clinic called divergent primary care in milford delaware despite regularly searching the government s therapeutics locator database networking with other doctors and calling pharmacies tonwe says she still hasn t been able to find this drug to treat her high risk patients though she recently heard that a physician friend was able to find some i just want to help people feel better she said when something like this drug which is as close to a cure as you get with a virus exists but it s not available here and it s being wasted elsewhere it s just really really kind of like a moral injury she said the delaware department of health and social services says the state gets enough paxlovid every two weeks to treat 200 people mississippi has enough paxlovid sitting unused on pharmacy shelves to treat 2 846 people according to the state department of health the test to treat program should reach more people creating convenience for our citizens we are communicating with our partners and providers to determine resources they would need to implement this statewide wrote timothy turane a spokesperson for the delaware department of health and social services in a statement to cnn although some states are reserving their limited supplies of the drug to treat only those at highest risk of severe consequences mississippi is making the medications available to anyone with a positive covid 19 test and a prescription we have unused tools in our toolbox and we want to make sure that everyone is aware that they are available and can help save mississippi lives dobbs said at a recent news briefing though the pace of new infections is slowing nationwide 78 of us counties are still reporting substantial or high rates of transmission according to cdc data almost 45 000 new covid 19 infections reported each day in the united states yet about half of covid 19 therapeutics are still going unused according to aspr overcoming hurdles to prescribing the drugs the reasons why these lifesaving treatments have been underutilized are complex molnupiravir causes the genetic material inside the virus to make mistakes as it copies itself essentially mutating the virus to death because of the way the drug works there s some fear that it may also mutate the dna in rapidly dividing cells animal studies have suggested that it might interfere with bone formation so it s not supposed to be used in anyone younger than 18 it s also not recommended for women who are pregnant since there s a risk of birth defects in clinical trials molnupiravir was less effective than paxlovid cutting the risk of a covid 19 hospitalization by 30 that led many doctors to question whether the risks for some people are worth its benefits paxlovid a pill that combines two medicines interacts with drugs in 32 classes of medications including antidepressants antibiotics antipsychotics and blood pressure medications these interactions make it tricky to prescribe the sicker people who qualify for it are also more likely to have drug interactions so we have to be more cautious of it says dr mark horne immediate past president of the mississippi state medical association horne says he recently tried to prescribe paxlovid for a 94 year old patient and although he could have temporarily stopped his patient s cholesterol medication he didn t feel like he could stop a different heart medication his patient was taking that would have interacted instead he had to call around until he found a dose of the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab which came from a neighboring state another obstacle is that doctors just aren t aware of the medications or don t feel familiar enough with how they work to confidently prescribe them dobbs the state health officer for mississippi says this happened with monoclonal antibody infusions too they were available for many months before we had robust use in the state of mississippi dobbs said once a prescriber has found a patient who can safely take one of the new antiviral drugs they have to locate it even with the pills becoming more plentiful the medications can still be difficult to find rod hilton a 40 year old software developer from denver recently drove three hours round trip to fill his paxlovid prescription hilton has an underlying health condition and says he and his wife are very covid conscious they pulled their two young children out of school through the winter holidays to try to protect them from infection then when the family couldn t stand doing work and school from home any longer their 5 year old ended up catching covid 19 on her first day back to school then it was just one by one dominoes he says his 3 year old got sick then his wife and then i caught it normally their family doctor phones in their prescriptions to a nearby pharmacy this time though he handed hilton his prescription on a piece of paper because he d already written 14 prescriptions for paxlovid they d all gone unfilled knowing that he had to take the medicine quickly for it to be effective hilton sat in the parking lot of his doctor s office congested and with a throbbing headache and started searching for pharmacies that might have it walmart was out across the state the he found the covid 19 therapeutics locator website and started calling finally he found some at a hospital pharmacy in greeley a 90 minute drive north into the mountains hilton says the drug was worth the trip the day he filled his prescription he was in rough shape he took his first dose that night within 24 hours it was gone he says hilton and his wife are both vaccinated she got covid 19 before he did hilton recovered completely within a day of starting paxlovid but his wife was sick for more than a week after he recovered hilton knows he was lucky even sick he had the means and time to find a pharmacy where he could get his pills not everyone is able to do that we re not done with treatment the prescribing process is what kind of took the shine off the medications said dr jane wainaina an infectious disease specialist and medical director of the antimicrobial stewardship progam at froedtert hospital in milwaukee wainaina said that although the pills particularly paxlovid looked in their clinical trials like they could deal a crushing blow to the pandemic they have been harder to use in the real world we ve been able to supply oral antivirals to every patient that qualified and wanted their treatment she said but not many do at her hospital only about 30 of the people the hospital has deemed eligible to take the pills have responded to an initial phone call and of that group only about half end up taking them wainaina says many patients feel wary about taking a medication that s not fully approved by the fda both antiviral pills are available through an emergency use authorization which requires a lower standard of evidence to bring a treatment onto the market she says timing also presents some challenges we re offering these medications early because that s when they work at that point many people are not feeling unwell they re like why do i need to take a medication i don t feel that bad it s just a cold she said these drugs are good she said but they don t check all the boxes we re not done with treatment we re going to have to continue to work and study in order to stay somewhat ahead of the virus as far as effective treatments go wainaina said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s deidre

president biden today banned imports of russian crude oil and natural gas aiming to increase the economic pressure on russian president vladimir putin as his war against ukraine rages on the united states is targeting the main artery of russia s economy biden said in a briefing today the american people will deal another powerful blow to putin s war machine the white house is also instituting a prohibition on russian petroleum products liquefied natural gas and coal according to the executive order biden signed today it also blocks u s entities from new investment in the energy sector in russia advertisement in the initial aftermath of troops moving into ukraine in late february the biden administration and allies deployed financial sanctions against russia but sought to bypass a crude and natural gas embargo out of fears of pushing up global energy costs the president today acknowledged this likely ripple effect this is a step we are taking to inflict further pain on putin but there will be cost as well here in the united states he said the u s benchmark price west texas intermediate hit 128 this morning the highest in a steady upward trend since the ukrainian invasion the average price of gasoline hit a record 4 17 per gallon today surpassing a previous record set during the oil boom of 2008 according to aaa gas pump prices have surged in recent weeks as crude oil prices climbed a coordinated release of u s and ally reserves of 60 million barrels of crude oil last week has failed to slow the increase despite inflation fears political support on capitol hill for halting russian imports has grown in recent days urged on by ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy who has pressed the united states to broaden its economic sanctions that already targeted russia s largest banks central bank and finance ministry we will not be part of subsidizing russia s war biden said this morning biden s move follows the european union s announcement that it will cut its consumption of russian gas by 66 percent as it prepares to fully end its reliance on russian supplies the united kingdom also announced today that it would phase out russian oil and oil products by the end of the year the u k relies on russian oil for about 8 percent of its supply biden noted that european allies would not be able to quickly stop their reliance on russian supplies while the u s s oil and gas sector is powerful enough to do so we can take this step as others cannot he said while also warning the oil and gas sector not to capture excess profits from this crisis russia s aggression is affecting us all and it s no time for profiteering he said u s industry groups expressed support for the oil import ban our industry is prepared to comply with the import ban in response to this aggression said mike sommers ceo of the american petroleum institute the industry has already taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships both with respect to assets in russia as well as imports of russian crude oil and refined products biden acknowledged his ban comes after announcements by many energy and tech companies to stop doing business in russia in response to the aggression against ukraine noting apple inc visa inc and ford motor co among others oil and gas companies like exxon mobil corp bp plc and equinor asa are among those that have already announced they are ending new purchases of russian oil shell plc after taking heat for buying some urals russia s benchmark crude oil apologized and pledged to phase out further purchases we are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of russian crude oil was not the right one and we are sorry ceo ben van beurden said today according to reuters action in congress despite biden s sanctions announcement house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said the chamber would vote on legislation to ban russian energy imports review that country s role in the world trade organization and facilitate new sanctions because this legislation is an urgent imperative both morally and for our security interests the house will consider this legislation on the floor today it is our hope that we have a strong bipartisan vote pelosi wrote white house skepticism earlier this week about limiting russian energy imports only energized congress to accelerate its efforts to force the president s hand e e daily march 8 house majority leader steny hoyer d md expressed concern that the price of gas that is already high would go higher but he noted the u s only imports a small amount of russian oil we re all in this together including the oil companies and they need to be producing more oil not less they need to buy back fewer stocks not more they need to pay lower dividends not higher dividends while the american people are struggling he said i would hope that the oil companies would join with us in trying to minimize pain at the pump biden said today the oil ban was a bipartisan issue that both republicans and democrats on capitol hill understood the u s must do this but the expectation of an oil ban first reported this morning by bloomberg did little to calm the political division over russia and oil in response to the news of an import ban this morning sen steve daines r mont said great now instead of looking to iran and venezuela for oil work with american producers and unleash american energy production he said in a statement senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said the biden administration has spent the last year hammering the domestic oil and gas industry so while the ukrainians are fighting russia democrats are trying to fight a war on the law of supply and demand they only want to have to look at solar panels and windmills here at home so they want to get our oil and gas from everywhere else he said on the senate floor the war in the ukraine has exacerbated a sore issue for the biden administration climate policy versus energy demand climate change experts have urged biden to do more to shift the country away from fossil fuels even as the industry and the political right have slammed the white house for actions like canceling the keystone xl pipeline which would have offered an additional pipeline to connect tar sands crude oil in canada to u s markets the administration has also been under political attack for attempting to slow down the federal oil and gas program to institute reforms but that political and policy battle has been complicated by the courts biden s nearly yearlong moratorium on new energy leasing on public lands was overturned by a federal judge but its first and only federal oil sale in the gulf of mexico this winter was also overturned by a different federal judge for failing to account for climate impacts on the other hand the biden administration has continued to approve oil and gas drilling on federal lands at a rapid clip outpacing in its first year in office the trump administration s first year a fact that biden underscored during his sanctions announcement climbing prices russia s aggression against ukraine has accentuated the interconnected nature of global oil and gas supply and consumption with political leaders in the u s hamstrung to rapidly respond to the dearth of supply in the private sector russia is the third largest oil producer in the world and supplies the lion s share of natural gas for europe russia supplied about 8 percent of u s imports of oil and refined products last year according to the u s energy information administration both biden officials and the oil industry s most influential ceos warned this week that oil volatility will continue even before the announcement of additional sanctions the volatility of price and with supply and demand is something we re going to live with for a little while said john kerry biden s special envoy on climate yesterday at ceraweek by ihs markit an energy conference in houston ceos have used this moment to stress the importance of oil and gas investments to stave off the price shocks and crippling economic impacts of roiled global energy markets the focus really should be on energy security and oil and gas have a vital role to play in the global economy said john hess ceo of hess corp in a panel at ceraweek yesterday oil and gas are needed for decades to come and the key challenge to oil and gas is investment but the white house has rejected that conclusion this crisis is a stark reminder to protect our economy over the long term we need to become energy independent biden said today it s just not tenable it should motivate us in a transition to clean energy environmental groups have rallied around the same idea one of the most important measures we can take right now is to reduce our dependence at home and abroad on the oil and gas that s helping to bankroll the russian military said john bowman managing director for government affairs for the natural resources defense council that means shifting away from the fossil fuels that lock in dependence on belligerent petro states and drive us toward climate catastrophe even with oil prices increasing drilling has not kept pace and there is little a sitting u s president can do to force a ramp up of oil and gas drilling by private companies experts have said climatewire march 7 occidental petroleum corp ceo vicki hollub said today that many oil companies that hadn t planned to expand drilling this year likely wouldn t be able to rapidly shift their strategy during a talk at ceraweek everyone came into this year wanting to keep production pretty much flat no one really prepared for significant growth hollub said if you didn t plan for growth you won t be able to achieve growth today the rig count in the u s held at 650 earlier this week a rally from last year but still low compared to the more than 800 in the field in 2019 before covid 19 all but froze worldwide economies now the war and responses to the war are exacerbating the tight supply with energy insecurity priced in fundamentals are no longer the key driver of the market said kaushal ramesh senior analyst for rystad energy in a client note today the russian oil ban will likely push benchmark crude prices higher in both europe and the u s with wti holding over 120 per barrel into may according to a recent analysis by bloomberg intelligence reporters carlos anchondo manuel quiñones and george cahlink contributed
get serious on oil prices urging the public to use private cars less often seems to be a sorely inadequate if not altogether irresponsible response to the oil price surge the government needs a more comprehensive and systematic plan to deal with the fallout on the energy sector caused by the russia ukraine war as the united states mulled a ban on russian oil imports even without europe s cooperation the price of brent crude hit a 10 year high at us 130 4 300 baht per barrel on sunday surpassing the record of 128 in 2012 with the war continuing into its 13th day the oil price rise is expected to keep climbing meanwhile energy futures on the london stock exchange saw traders flocking into options that bet on oil prices soaring to as high as 200 per barrel by the end of the month according to a report by the wall street journal prime minister gen prayut chan o cha on monday expressed his concern about the soaring oil prices and possible effects on the larger energy sector he did not reveal how the government would tackle the issues though he only suggested that people save as much energy as they can he also told the public only to use private cars when absolutely necessary it is no surprise that his comments which sound more like an afterthought than an attempt to sketch out government policy were met with disdain many people said if private cars are to be used less often members of the government should set a good example by abandoning their comfortable rides and spending more time in the slow lane along with the public it is clear that while people understand there must be a pinch following the oil price rise which could push up the cost of living further they expect the government to come up with measures that are well thought out and effective above all if there are to be relief measures as well as restrictions to help save energy directly or to sensitise people so they become more aware of the situation they should all be inclusive and fair earlier the government cut the excise tax by 3 baht from 5 99 baht per litre in an attempt to keep the retail price of diesel under 30 baht per litre the measure to last until may 20 was implemented after truckers threatened to block roads if the government failed to cap the diesel price as for the immediate hike the national energy policy committee nepc is expected to meet today to discuss measures the proposals will be forwarded to the cabinet for approval on march 15 hopefully these measures be they subsidies or restrictions will be more equitable and not designed to help only a certain group or profession as the cost is borne by all taxpayers if gen prayut is serious about wanting people to rely less on private cars then restrictions that will be applied to all such as imposing vehicle access zones or congestion charges might be more effective both in terms of saving energy and as a way to send a message to the public to participate in the campaign if oil prices keep on surging a mere plea for cooperation will be the least effective way to cope with the coming hardship the government must show it is capable of issuing policies and clear action plans that will help the public ride out the soaring oil prices fairly and effectively

country can be rendered irrelevant overnight sure investors might make money for a while but in the end all that matters are the rules set by the person running the country and often that means they are setting the rules to maintain power enrich themselves and their cronies or both it was one thing to miss the risks of investing in russia it s a country where most diversified investors have only a small percentage of their portfolio it s a different story for a country like china many mutual funds and stocks have hefty direct or indirect exposure to the country and observers who had warned about russia are encouraging investors to ask similar questions about china china has been this incredibly lucrative emerging market to invest in but there s been so little discussion of the regime says jon hale director of sustainability research for the americas at morningstar the question directly confronting investors is whether it is really sustainable long term to be investing in these kinds of countries hale says it s a systemic risk that we are all contributing to and that we should be paying more attention to and the reality has been that for more than the past decade investors would have been better off keeping their money in the united states rather than sending it to russia or china geopolitical risk and rule of law one way to look at these questions is to consider the two risks of investing in autocracies geopolitical risks and rule of law russia s attack on ukraine is an extreme example of the geopolitical risks that come with investing in autocratic countries the risk that investors are more likely to bump up against is rule of law rule of law should be a primary consideration for investors says bill browder the famed hedge fund manager who made his fortune in russia only to be deported after run ins with oligarchs and whose russian lawyer was arrested in moscow mistreated by authorities and died in a prison you can do all the analysis you want on an industry on the economics on the management team and then all of a sudden somebody comes along and rips you off and you don t have any recourse in the courts you don t have recourse in the media and generally if they re not rule of law countries you have no recourse with the regulators he says it s flying by the seat of your pants hoping you re in the good graces of whoever is in charge browder says he s heard various rationales and strategies for investing in countries like russia for example investors should avoid strategic industries such as oil and gas that are likely to be closely aligned with the power structure and corrupt officials yes you can invest in nonstrategic industries but usually the only things aren t strategic are money losing he says who s lying there s also the lack of transparency in autocratic or authoritarian regimes many mutual fund companies and professional investors like to talk about their boots on the ground research when it comes to stock or bond research but consider the example of blackrock s emerging markets team as noted in a previous article the team running silver rated blackrock emerging markets madcx thought the odds of warfare were unlikely after some team members visited russia in late january as the country mustered more than 150 000 troops on its neighbor s border the fact that the population did not seem primed for a full scale invasion and other factors including cheap valuations argued in favor of maintaining the strategy s long term positions in russia the team said on feb 16 of course there were many observers who did not believe russia would invade ukraine and it s not as if a mutual fund manager could ask someone in power if russia was going to invade ukraine and get an answer but browder says this reflects a broader point in america when officials or company managers tell you something they tell you the truth browder says they may not be telling you everything and they might hold back information but they will tell you the truth in russia and in places like russia lie and there is no shame in lying they ll say we have no intention of defaulting and then default the next morning tie it all together browder says and investors wrongly think they can approach these markets the same way they do a market that operates on investor friendly principles you have somebody who says ok i ve done my research i ve read barron s and gazprom is trading at 2 or 3 times earnings parallels are being drawn between vladimir putin s designs on ukraine and china s long running claims on taiwan china has also been cracking down on freedoms in hong kong and has been persecuting its uyghur population but china doesn t have to go as far as invading taiwan to show investors the risks that come with investing in the country last summer the chinese government imposed a regulatory crackdown on internet companies that included some of the biggest names in the market ones owned by most emerging markets and china stock funds such as alibaba baba and tencent tcehy over the past year alibaba has lost nearly 60 of its value and tencent more than 40 chinese regulators also took aim at private education companies tal education tal was one of the names in the crosshairs of the chinese government and its shares have lost roughly 97 of their value over the past year these moves along with heightened tensions between the u s and china over issues such as corporate disclosure policies for publicly traded stocks hammered u s investors in chinese equities as perth tolle manager of freedom 100 emerging markets etf frdm recently said in an interview with morningstar s leslie norton from an investment standpoint the biggest concern is not russia which is 3 of most benchmarks but china which is more than 30 of most emerging markets indices that s a huge concentration risk says browder just because it s a big economy that s grown doesn t mean they re going to treat foreign investors fairly as they get more nationalistic hidden risks even if investors don t have direct exposure to autocratic countries they may have hidden risks from companies based elsewhere in the world that do business in nations lacking in rule of law a frequent example says shin furuya impact investment strategist at domini impact investments are energy and other natural resources firms a european or asian energy company might well be on the ground in sudan or the same thing with myanmar he says energy and natural resources companies often have to partner with state owned enterprises which makes it very difficult to disentangle from the risks posed by a government that might be involved in war human rights abuses or have a considerable degree of corruption risk vs reward for all these risks there has not been much in the way of returns from russia and china over the past decade prior to the closing of russia s financial markets the rts index had returned an average of 4 2 a year for the past 10 years the s p bny mellon china select index 1 9 a year and the hang seng index negative 0 24 a year meanwhile the morningstar us market index averaged 14 9 returns for the past decade browder notes that markets like china while they have periods of outperformance are afflicted by big drawdowns caused by political decisions if you re a trader you can find moments when the markets are really bombed out and then you trade out of it but long term there s just as much chance that you will lose money as make money morningstar s hale thinks that with investors being burned in russia and china perhaps awareness of regime risk will grow among investors that could extend to countries such as turkey and hungary i think it will be considered more prominently than it has been in the past couple of decades he says this article was updated to remove an incorrect reference to morningstar analyst sam lo regarding blackrock emerging markets

and 15 04 g t silver for 18 000 ounces of gold and 347 000 ounces of silver see below for details to date significant core and reverse circulation drilling has occurred at the esperanza gold project resulting in a total of 389 drill holes for 69 716 metres four targets adjacent to or close to the historical resource were identified to expand the historical resource the project also hosts seven regional exploration targets largely untested that also merit drill testing mineralization at the esperanza gold project is associated with the intrusion of a stock of granodiorite composition into the carbonate rocks of the guerrero morelos platform specifically the rocks of the xochicalco formation spatially related to the intrusive contact with the carbonate rocks are varying degrees of skarn and marble development intruded by the granodioritic stock are the limestone of the xochicalco formation of aptian age early cretaceous that have beds of varying thickness from very thin to medium primary mineralization consists of gold and to a lesser extent silver associated with the skarn zones spatially related to the intrusive based on previous preliminary assessments completed by previous owners the company anticipates that the project would be amenable to a conventional open pit heap leach operation with two stage crushing crushed material would be conveyed to the leach pad and irrigated with dilute cyanide solution gold will be recovered from pregnant solutions utilizing carbon adsorption subsequent electrowinning and on site smelting to produce gold and silver dore bars the company plans to carry out an extensive work program to prepare an updated resource estimate undertake economic studies on the project as well as drilling on nearby exploration targets the total consideration of the transaction is approximately 60 million u s with most of the payments not made until significant steps toward commercial production are achieved the initial consideration consists

the company considers this to be an historical resource for the purposes of national instrument 43 101 resource blocks were defined using with dimensions of 10 metres m by 10 m by five m the estimation of grades was performed with the ordinary kriging method on capped composites an added step in the estimation strategy was the utilization of the dynamic anisotropy technique in vulcan s unfolding options this added capability allows for a more realistic outcome of the estimated grade s spatial distribution as it follows the folded shape of the deposit assumptions used in the resource include the following metal prices gold price of 1 400 u s per ounce oz and silver price of 22 u s per oz the resource assumed the following economic assumptions recovery of 60 4 per cent at 0 2 g t to 71 9 per cent at 1 6 g t for gold 25 per cent for silver 2 60 per tonne mining costs 64 cents per tonne general and administrative costs 4 20 per tonne milling costs and a pit slope of 45 degrees the company considers the resource relevant due to its identification and modelling of the esperanza deposit the company has not done sufficient work to classify the resource as a current mineral resource or mineral reserves and the company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves although the resource estimate is considered reliable the company will resample a portion of the drill core for the purpose of carrying out a new resource estimate furthermore additional data verification including resurveying of select diamond drill holes collars review of graphic drill core logs comparison of these logs with remaining half cut core and a cross check of select geological logs agonist database entries and a check of original assay certificates

global trade remained challenging for global exports in 2021 as the covid 19 pandemic continued to create supply chain and logistical issues lower production also compounded the impact on australian exports as herd rebuilding continued however increased prices across international markets kept export volumes high relative to production as a result exports represented 72 of total red meat production over the year in total australia exported 1 45 million tonnes of red meat a 10 4 decline from 2020 levels beef beef and veal exports declined by 14 6 to total 887 682 tonnes japan was australia s largest customer in 2021 importing 216 000 tonnes of australian beef a 13 decline from 2020 this decline was due to several factors firstly beef imports dropped overall by 2 6 as local production increased and the food service sector remained depressed as a result of covid 19 related disruption secondly large increases in export volumes from canada new zealand and mexico ensured that demand was met finally price increases in australian beef also placed downward pressure on demand of australia s other major trading partners south korea was the only market to import slightly more beef in 2021 importing 165 000 tonnes compared to 161 000 tonnes in 2020 this was largely due to significant increases in frozen grainfed beef which rose by 27 to 42 769 tonnes to contribute to 24 of the total australian beef exports at the same time frozen grassfed beef which made up 58 of exports in 2020 dropped by 10 in 2021 this shift in the export mix alongside the overall increase in volume meant that the value of beef exports to korea rose to au 1 7 billion an 18 increase on 2020 value the us imported 145 024 tonnes of australian beef in 2021 a 32 decline on 2020 and by far the largest decline among australia s major trading partners american domestic production reached a record 12 7 million tonnes cwe this is unlikely to continue into 2022 with the usda projecting that production will fall by 2 8 this year as us cattle stocks continue their downward trajectory which began in 2019 on the value front australian beef and veal exports averaged au 9 36 per kg over 2021 a 7 6 increase on 2020 prices however lower volumes saw an overall decline in total value of beef exports of 5 1 to 9 1 billion through the year lamb and mutton australia exported 265 000 tonnes of lamb and 140 000 tonnes of mutton in 2021 overall remaining steady from 2020 the us saw the largest increase in sheepmeat sales from 78 000 tonnes in 2020 to 93 000 in 2021 lamb continues to dominate the export mix into the us but mutton sales increased by 27 to make up 24 of the total export mix the middle east and north africa mena region imported 31 000 tonnes of australian lamb and 15 000 tonnes of mutton in 2021 a 33 drop in total exports for the year the biggest factor for this was the increased air freight costs due to the pandemic impacts on reduced international flights during most of the year coinciding with record high sheep prices in australia another contributing factor was the ending of subsidies on australian lamb imports by the government of qatar these factors combined saw australian chilled lamb exports to qatar fall 70 3 in 2021 year on year and some uptick in frozen sheepmeat exports to the region the combined unit value and volume increase meant that the total value for sheepmeat exports rose by 10 5 to au 4 05 billion over 2021 the us import price was au 12 83 kg compared to the global average of 9 24 meaning that the increased import volume dragged up prices globally as was confirmed by the fao meat price index goat goat exports increased by 35 in 2021 to 19 000 tonnes combined with an 13 increase in the unit price of australian goat total export value was 52 higher in 2021 than 2020 at au 242 million already the largest market the united states imported 12 500 tonnes a 47 increase year on year and 66 of australian goat exports south korea also saw a 91 increase to 2 100 tonnes and canada imported 1 300 tonnes a 35 volume increase on the horizon in 2022 australia enters 2022 in a strong position to capitalise on high prices and relatively constrained supply production is projected to rise in australia as the restock continues to mature while global demand is expected to outpace increases in supply supply chain constraints are already easing and are expected to attenuate considerably in the third quarter of 2022 meanwhile production is projected to decline in the united states the other major beef exporter to japan and korea throughout 2022

new york with russia intensifying its war on ukraine killing civilians and triggering a mass refugee crisis president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy here is a deeper look what will happen with a u s ban on russian oil amid rising gasoline prices in the u s the average price reached a record 4 17 a gallon on tuesday the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s single largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies file u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman holds a news conference at the nato headquarters in brussels belgium jan 12 2022 not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to even with a ban on russian oil the biden administration and congress remain laser focused on bringing down the higher energy costs for american families and our partners stemming from putin s invasion house speaker nancy pelosi said pelosi who has expressed support for a u s ban on russian oil nevertheless also cited biden s action in leading u s allies to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves including 30 million barrels from u s reserves to try to stabilize global markets would a u s only ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the united states imports a small share of russia s oil exports and doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel file gas prices are displayed at gas stations in englewood new jersey march 7 2022 because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices to their highest level ever recorded with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february the petroleum institute hasn t taken a formal stance on legislation to ban russian oil imports but it says it would comply with any restrictions imposed will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are looking for ways to reduce their dependence but it s going to take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand file pipes at the landfall facilities of the nord stream 2 gas pipline are pictured in lubmin northern germany feb 15 2022 germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs russian deputy prime minister alexander novak underlined that urgency saying russia would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline in retaliation for germany halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which was not yet operating he added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this it was a change from earlier russian assurances that they had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe some ships filled with lng had been heading to asia but turned around to go to europe because buyers there offered to pay higher prices according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars

bloomberg soaring oil prices are disproportionately favoring canada s energy companies over their u s counterparts because of a market quirk unlike past oil booms this one hasn t been accompanied by a surge in the canadian dollar even as the ukraine war has propelled oil prices to their highest level since 2008 the canadian dollar has failed to appreciate against the u s dollar which has benefited from flight to safety buying that contrasts with the 2008 and 2011 oil rallies when the loonie briefly exceeded the u s dollar in value while canadian energy companies sell their oil in u s dollars most of their costs are in canadian currency even after factoring in a discount to west texas intermediate they still collected about c 140 a barrel for heavy oil on monday a record every single company is generating more cash flow out of the oil sands than they ever have in their history mark little chief executive officer of suncor energy inc said at the at the ceraweek by s p global conference in houston oil sands giant suncor s shares rose to their highest since january 2020 before the pandemic rival canadian natural resources ltd s stock price has more than doubled in the past year rising to a record c 79 55 on tuesday cenovus energy inc s shares are trading at their highest level since late 2016 and meg energy corp s since 2015 canadian oil producers are benefiting in other ways as well the heavy grade of crude produced in the oil sands is a suitable substitute for russian fuel oil that s now banned from importation into the u s and u k meanwhile a new pipeline to the u s has alleviated bottlenecks experienced in the past by canadian producers and shrunk the discount that they typically earn for their crude deltastream energy corp a small closely held heavy oil producer in central alberta will see cash flow for the year surge to c 350 million about double what it was in 2021 roger tang chief executive officer said by phone the company plans to increase drilling in the second half of the year with the goal of boosting production from a forecast record of 17 000 barrels a day by june to an even greater 20 000 barrels a day by year end at this price the payout is very quick he said investors get their money back 2022 bloomberg l p
photo wikimedia commons mikoyan mig 29 fighter jet update 3 30 p m the pentagon said tuesday that poland s offer to give its mig 29 fighter jets to the u s so they can be passed to ukraine raises serious concerns for the nato alliance and the plan is not a tenable one pentagon press secretary john kirby said in a statement that the prospect of jets departing from a u s nato base in germany to fly into airspace contested with russia in the ukraine war is concerning he said it s not clear to the u s that there is a substantive rationale for it the u s he said will continue to talk to poland about the matter update 12 p m poland said it would give all of its mig 29 fighter jets to the u s apparently agreeing to an arrangement that would allow them to be used by ukraine s military ukraine has pleaded for more warplanes the decision came tuesday as washington was looking at a proposal under which poland would supply ukraine with soviet era fighters and in turn receive american f 16s to make up for their loss ukrainian pilots are trained to fly soviet era fighter jets the polish foreign ministry said in a statement that poland is ready to deliver the jets to the u s ramstein air base in germany at the same time poland requests the united states to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities it said update 9 a m buses carried civilians out of an embattled ukrainian city tuesday along a safe corridor agreed to by the two warring sides while a parallel effort to relieve the besieged port of mariupol was thrown into jeopardy by reports of renewed russian shelling europe s worst refugee crisis since world war ii grew even more severe with u n officials reporting that 2 million people have now fled ukraine moscow s forces have laid siege to ukrainian cities and cut off food water heat and medicine in a growing humanitarian disaster but for days attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians have stumbled amid continuing fighting and objections to the proposed routes on tuesday a convoy of buses packed with people fleeing the fighting moved along a snowy road from sumy a northeastern city of a quarter million people according to video from the ukrainian communications agency ukrainian deputy prime minister iryna vereshchuk said they were headed southwest to the ukrainian city of poltava and included students from india and china hours before the convoy reached sumy overnight strikes killed 21 people there including two children ukrainian authorities said meanwhile buses emblazoned with red cross symbols carried water medicine and food toward the encircled southern port of mariupol scene of some of the worst desperation vereshchuk said the vehicles would then ferry civilians out of the city of 430 000 people but soon after officials announced that buses were on their way ukrainian authorities said they had learned of shelling on the escape route it was unclear whether the supply convoy made it to mariupol and it appeared unlikely that civilians would be able to board the buses to get out the deputy mayor of mariupol cast doubt on the evacuations telling the bbc that russian forces continued to pound areas where people were trying to gather ahead of being taken out he said some roads were blocked while others were mined so we cannot establish sustainable cease fire and safety route at the moment serhiy orlov said so we still have a city in blockade the city is without water heat working sewage systems or phone service residents have been getting water from streams or by melting snow corpses lay in the streets and authorities planned to start digging mass graves for all the dead with the electricity out many people are relying on their car radios for information picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by russian forces or russian backed separatists looting has become widespread for food clothes and even furniture with locals referring to the practice as getting a discount in a video address from an undisclosed location ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said a child had died of dehydration in mariupol another sign of the city s desperation nearly two weeks into the fighting russian forces have captured a swath of southern and coastal ukraine but have seen their advances stopped in many areas including around kyiv the capital by nimble ukrainian fighters targeting moscow s armored columns thousands of people are thought to have been killed both civilians and soldiers though the actual number remains unknown the fighting has caused global economic turmoil with energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting it also threatens the food supply of millions around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the fertile black sea region western countries have rushed weapons to ukraine and moved to slap vladimir putin s russia with sanctions in a further effort to punish russia u s president joe biden decided to ban russian oil imports according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before an announcement also shell announced it will stop buying oil and gas from russia ukraine s military said ukrainian forces continued defense operations in the mariupol suburbs the military said demoralized russian forces are engaging in looting commandeering civilian buildings and setting up firing positions in populated areas the claims could not be independently verified the battle for mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow moscow to establish a land corridor to crimea which russia seized from ukraine in 2014 oleksiy kuleba governor of the kyiv region said ukraine was also making arrangements to get people out of the suburb of irpin late tuesday zelenskyy released a video showing him standing near the presidential offices in kyiv behind him were piles of sandbags a snow dusted fir tree and a few cars it was the second video in 24 hours showing him near the country s seat of power apparently made to dispel any doubts about whether he had fled the city snow fell it s that kind of springtime he said in a soft voice you see it s that kind of wartime that kind of

americans can order more free at home covid 19 tests from the u s government at covidtests gov to be shipped to their homes the white house said on monday each household can order a total of eight tests so if you ordered four in january when the program launched you re eligible to order a second batch of four more president biden announced the move last week in his state of the union address on monday the white house released a video telling people the website was ready to go again get your free tests today biden said urging people to have them on hand so we re prepared no matter what covid 19 brings more than half of u s households ordered tests in january and february the way that we set this up was to make sure that every household who wanted these tests could get them before we made a second round available white house testing coordinator tom inglesby told npr today you can order another free round of covid tests shipped straight to your home at pic twitter com 3e3fkd3oeu president biden potus march 7 2022 orders should move faster this time in january some tests didn t ship within the seven to 12 day window that had been promised because the administration was waiting for manufacturers to make more tests this time test scarcity is not a problem as we open up this second round we are going to be shipping immediately inglesby said we have a fairly substantial stock of new tests ready to be shipped so we expect orders to be delivered quickly the idea is to have them on hand for when you need them the program began when cases were surging with the omicron variant of the coronavirus and tests were hard to find in stores so biden committed the government to buy 1 billion tests to distribute covid 19 case numbers have dropped significantly since january the biden administration is turning to the new phase of its response which emphasizes getting back to normal while being ready for the possibility that a new variant could emerge and cause case numbers to spike once again the idea is that these tests can be used if someone develops symptoms has a close exposure to someone with covid 19 or wants to spend time indoors with someone who would be at high risk if they were to catch the coronavirus but inglesby said there s another reason the federal government is purchasing all these tests to keep the testing infrastructure strong the government wants to keep the testing industry viable the last time covid 19 case numbers ebbed in the spring and early summer of 2021 the nascent home testing industry saw demand dry up and production slowed but then when case numbers increased with the delta and omicron waves there weren t nearly enough tests to meet demand now the biden administration plans to add at home coronavirus tests into the national strategic stockpile so they can be sent out rapidly in case of a future surge the white house has requested 22 5 billion in additional funding from congress part of which would go to purchasing rapid tests both to keep the industry viable and to fill the nation s strategic reserves copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
outlook the focus on us and global inflation is premature because the peaks and valleys in commodities are still unfolding worries about commodities are rife especially copper and aluminum where we can run out of stockpiles this year overnight in london the metal exchange suspended trading in nickel after its price doubled for a second day bloomberg reports nickel had soared as much as 250 in two days and overnight nickel more than doubled to 100 000 a ton before paring gains and eventually seeing trading suspended on the london metal exchange the exchange said it s calculating margin calls at the monday closing price of 48 000 and is considering whether to adjust or cancel the trades made between then and the suspension weirdly russia produces only 7 of the world s nickel wheat is another troublesome commodity up as much as 5 4 per cent to 13 63 a bushel in early trading on tuesday before pulling back to be down 2 per cent according to bloomberg data we are not sure that russia can get away with continuing to sell oil for all that much longer an increasing number of analysts are telling us to face up to reality you can have solidarity with ukraine or you can have green dreams but not both bring back coal in europe a summit is planned for thursday to talk about energy needs supplies and alternatives one idea is for germany to hang on to its few remaining nuclear power plants instead of closing them this year as planned exactly on schedule and exactly as expected the trumpy right blames biden and the dems for gas prices up over 6 7 but the truth is that it was nixon in 1973 who called for energy independence and it was reagan in 1980 who said oil alternative are silly and result in over regulation to be fair every president of both parties has called for energy independence whether believing in climate change or not and all of them failed jimmy carter installed solar panels on the roof of the white house since removed nobody knows how much is oil industry obstruction via lobbying and how much is the real difficulty of alternative energy generation whatever happened to that bigshot who wanted most of texas covered in wind farms overall the volatility in commodities is excessive and not warranted it s traders going nuts and getting detached from fundamentals as we see in nickel the commodity price index and individual commodity prices shown in the tradingeconomics chart and tables are as of about 8 10 am et today notice that wheat is now down 29 a ridiculous number that makes sense only in the context of the price having spiked the day before this kind of unfettered wild west speculation is what we imagine must be behind the weird crash in the aud yesterday that hasn t ended yet but is nearing the 38 retracement level so hope springs the other big commodity currency is the cad and it s going the other way you can t figure out whatever reasoning might be behind these outcomes because there is no reasoning it s the madness of crowds we feel the same way about bond prices and yields and the expected inflation supposedly embedded in them they do not necessarily reflect any such thing expectations about inflation cannot be formed rationally in the absence of hard data on input prices and industrial consumer demand and no economist worth his or her salt would dare forecast any of that as a major war is unfolding to make matters worse from the forecaster s point of view classic chart reading is mostly out the window we saw the same thing with brexit technical analysis standards got busted with unhappy regularity so in the absence of solid base economic forecasts and the absence of reliable technical rules what can anyone say about the fate of the dollar speak history the dollar tends to come out okay but not in a straight line the best advice is to forego fast juicy profits and pare positions if only because your stops have to be enormous these days and that s the super high risk ukraine update update is the wrong word we have such a flood of information that it s hard to separate wheat from chaff from reuters police detained more than 4 300 people on sunday at russia wide protests against putin s

alpha as robert prechter outlined in his brilliant book the socionomic theory of finance which i suggest to anyone who wants to learn the truth of how markets work observers job as they see it is simply to identify which external events caused whatever price changes occur when news seems to coincide sensibly with market movement they presume a causal relationship when news doesn t fit they attempt to devise a cause and effect structure to make it fit when they cannot even devise a plausible way to twist the news into justifying market action they chalk up the market moves to psychology which means that despite a plethora of news and numerous inventive ways to interpret it their imaginations aren t prodigious enough to concoct a credible causal story most of the time it is easy for observers to believe in news causality financial markets fluctuate constantly and news comes out constantly and sometimes the two elements coincide well enough to reinforce commentators mental bias towards mechanical cause and effect when news and the market fail to coincide they shrug and disregard the inconsistency those operating under the mechanics paradigm in finance never seem to see or care that these glaring anomalies exist gilburt subscribes to the theory that natural law dictates cycles and waves in securities prices which scientists sneer at but at their peril gilburt has a

president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy what will happen with a us ban on russian oil amid rising gasoline prices in the u s the average price reached a record 4 17 a gallon on tuesday the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s single largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies in this image provided by the white house president joe biden listens during a secure video call with french president emmanuel macron german chancellor olaf scholz and british prime minister boris johnson in the situation room at the white house monday in washington photo adam schultz the white house via associated press not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to even with a ban on russian oil the biden administration and congress remain laser focused on bringing down the higher energy costs for american families and our partners stemming from putin s invasion house speaker nancy pelosi said pelosi who has expressed support for a u s ban on russian oil nevertheless also cited biden s action in leading u s allies to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves including 30 million barrels from u s reserves to try to stabilize global markets would a us only ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the u s imports a small share of russia s oil exports and doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security white house press secretary jen psaki speaks during a press briefing at the white house monday in washington photo patrick semansky associated press by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices to their highest level ever recorded with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february the petroleum institute hasn t taken a formal stance on legislation to ban russian oil imports but it says it would comply with any restrictions imposed will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are looking for ways to reduce their dependence but it s going to take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs russian deputy prime minister alexander novak underlined that urgency saying russia would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline in retaliation for germany halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which was not yet operating he added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this it was a change from earlier russian assurances that they had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years that is not a good state of affairs robert habeck germany s economy minister replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe some ships filled with lng had been heading to asia but turned around to go to europe because buyers there offered to pay higher prices according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars

corporation nyse xom chevron corporation nyse cvx and conocophillips nyse cop among others discussed in detail below energy prices in turmoil amid sanctions on march 6 the price of crude oil jumped to a 13 year high of over 130 per barrel the jump was attributed to the supply disruptions from russia amid the invasion of ukraine and the prospect of western sanctions on russian energy exports to europe however after germany signaled that it would not be 100 onboard with a blanket ban on russian oil and gas the prices calmed down again gas prices in europe heavily reliant on moscow have jumped to ten year highs as well and futures contracts for gas are now trading at a record 293 in the region in addition to domestic requirements for heating and cooking russian gas is also used to power key industries in europe that include fertilizer and metal manufacturers both these industries have been forced to drastically reduce amid supply problems from russia moscow is using this advantage to

war is a good time to create wealth and ensure healthy balance sheets both the first and the second world wars in terms of their human tragedy stands as the best example till today representational image afp wars start and wars end warriors die the surviving non warriors pay the price of a miserable life at the end the diplomats and politicians step in as harbingers of â peace at lastâ signing treaties and agreements after failing miserably to stop a war that led to death devastation and destruction they talk of â peace in our timeâ as they await the next war just look at the treaty of versailles june 28 1919 and the manoeuvres since then wars will continue as long as the human race exists mainly because wars and wealth creation are two sides of the same coin historically mayhem and manslaughter have been easiest and best way to make money by select groups of men who invariably claimed to be the saviours and rulers of their times letâ s begin with facts and figures of the human cost of the second world war 1939 1945 the worst of results for the belligerent states though accurate figures never surfaced and the best of record keepers canâ t say with confidence that the stated casualty figures are correct consider the baseline estimates russia then ussr lost more than 27 million combatants and citizens in 1941 1945 germany 7 5 million poland 6 5 million japan two million yugoslavia 1 8 million hungary 8 5 lakhs france 8 2 lakhs greece 5 5 lakhs austria five lakhs romania 4 7 lakhs italy 4 1 lakhs uk four lakhs czechoslovakia four lakhs and all other european states 4 3 lakhs outside europe china lost 15 million due to war and civil war japan two million and india 3 5 million within the country owing to the famine in bengal created by the british and indiaâ s hereditary trading class besides the millions of starvation deaths within 90 000 indians died overseas fighting with british forces and those of other commonwealth countries therefore as the 2022 russia ukraine war rages through europe easily the most volatile â cockpit of killing and killer conflictâ as shown by the first and second world wars itâ s time to assess potential consequences make no mistake food fuel and finance will be the first to fall in the line of casualties across continents followed by an environment disaster due to the sustained heating of the atmosphere caused by high tech kinetics of the belligerents from production to distribution to consumption the unanticipated bottlenecks are bound to wreak havoc on the poor with a combination of sloppy performance and unbridled greed of middlemen in supply lines as found from the history of profit making in wars there will also re emerge old factories producing new fighters warships etc as things look up for corporations who till recently were grumbling about the shrinking military budgets of european nations and the virtual end of big ticket wars after troop demobilisations in the middle east to afghanistan war is a good time to create wealth and ensure healthy balance sheets the signs are too stark to be missed on february 27 germany that had been the most aggressive in starting the second world war over 80 years ago enhanced its military budget by 100 billion euros 113 billion for 2022 the german chancellorâ s historic â policy shiftâ announcement understandably had an electrifying effect overnight monday february 28 arms maker lockheed martinâ s stock jumped 3 77 per cent in pre market trading followed by general dynamics 3 96 northrop grumman 4 47 and raytheon technologies 5 23 thus the german defence budget that rose from 36 7 billion in 2015 to 51 3 billion in 2020 shows an unprecedented jump today rising to a record 165 billion in 2022 thus climbing to the third largest defence budget slot after the united states 720 billion plus and second ranking chinaâ s 200 billion plus contextually however besides the russian ops in ukraine the dramatic defence budget hike is due to the german army chief too whose uncharacteristic outburst against his own countryâ s inability to make forces combat ready neglect of soldiering and reduced budgets hit the political bosses hard clearly countering moscow seems to have gripped the prosperous german economic powerhouse is history coming back with a vengeance with an aggressive germany getting ready to confront the russians in ukraine clearly the russia ukraine conflict has fundamentally destroyed and changed several systems the first casualty is the globalisation attempt to make economics interdependent to avoid war second the dockyards dominance of corporations over countries is unlikely to be sustained third europeâ s grandeur is threatened by an inevitable and universal law of decline development economics could give way to deterrence and defence economics welfare may be substituted by warfare economics the post cold war decade of the 1990s had badly hit europeâ s defence industry its combat aviation industry except for the multinational tornado and franceâ s dassault had hardly anything to offer its naval dockyards had shrunk due to reduced orders the merger of mega corporations had to be resorted to for survival as shown by its long history over centuries â warâ has been an obsession with europe despite it being the cradle of glorious achievements with a plethora of intellectual geniuses in almost every sphere of life in fact this strange recurrence of catastrophic war appears to be europeâ s bane and ordained destiny of self destruction both the first and the second world wars in terms of their human tragedy stands as the best example till today what then will be the aftermath of the russia ukraine conflict which both belligerents appear to signal as a virtuous war for survival or extinction simply put its main victor will be the â arms bazarâ in 2020 active armed conflicts occurred in at least 39 nations five more than in 2019 but they were not as lucrative as the present russia ukraine conflict appears as there were only two â major armed conflicts with more than 10 000 deaths afghanistan and yemen â the war in europe now opens up a new vista of vast opportunities for all major arms manufacturers the boardrooms of the defence corporations must be chuckling with joy with these developments after the chinese origin covid 19 pandemic military spending increased in 2020 only in four regions the highest rate of 5 1 per cent growth was in africa at 43 2 billion europeâ s four per cent increase stood at 378 billion the americas rose by 3 9 per cent to 853 billion and those in asia oceania by 2 5 per cent to 528 billion for â merchants of deathâ war opens a window to generate cash and a golden opportunity for wealth creation contextually it is interesting to note that even the greatest of german philosophers professor hegel of heidelberg university 1816 1818 had admired and rejoiced over napoleon bonaparte defeating his own country then prussia at the battle of jena 1806

short of being elected to congress most investors don t stand much of a chance competing against the likes of u s house speaker nancy pelosi the california democrat has become the poster child for trading activity by members of congress that leads to blockbuster portfolio performance to try and level the playing field a new exchange traded fund will be investing based on public filings from the 82 year old congresswoman the insider portfolio etf insdr which began trading on the merj exchange tuesday is designed to give everyday investors the opportunity to benefit from the kind of inside information that s only available to members of congress nancy pelosi is like the best meme stock trader in the world said jaime rogozinski founder of the reddit s wallstreetbets forum that launched the etf the portfolio which is being managed by digital markets will allocate to specific stocks based on 13 f filings from the 18 term representative which means there will be some lag time between pelosi s actual portfolio and what the etf holds on a daily basis obviously we re not going to be able to replicate her performance one to one but even if we can get a whiff of the performance investors will be able to get some of the returns she s been able to enjoy rogozinski said even getting a portion of pelosi s performance is still pretty good when you consider that one portfolio tracker measured her 2021 portfolio gains at more than 50 which compares to a gain of more than 28 for the s p 500 index if you are not blessed with the financial savviness of the u s congress members the world of investing can be inaccessible and intimidating to the novice investors we know as constituents rogozinski said eric balchunas senior etf analyst at bloomberg intelligence said the key to the new etf s success will be access but he believes the concept is spot on there s been a lot of attention given to how pelosi s portfolio has performed and there s a bit of cynicism there that they re cheating somehow he said i could see something like this catching on pelosi claims her husband paul pelosi is the trader in the family and public records show her 81 year old husband to be both active and proficient when it comes to investing paul pelosi s investing acumen has even spawned a social media movement mocking the coincidence of his stunning success after a groundswell of criticism from the general public nancy pelosi recently endorsed a plan for tighter rules on insider trading by members of congress but rogozinski isn t too worried that the rules will be drastic enough to derail his new fund when the subject of insider trading came up a decade ago congress turned around and passed a slap on the wrist requiring them to disclose a little more he said we might see some watered down potential controls but i believe they won t lose their abilities to pick stocks and continue to retain their competitive advantage in terms of how the etf could be impacted if pelosi ever retires from congress rogozinski said they will find another congressperson s portfolio to track the entire vision was nancy but because we re trying to get regulatory compliance and this is a serious product we wanted to have flexibility he said this allows the longevity to outlast any person the entire thing is built around her portfolio until there s reason to change it
president joe biden announces a ban on russian oil imports toughening the toll on russia s economy in retaliation for its invasion of ukraine tuesday march 8 2022 in the roosevelt room at the white house in washington ap photo andrew harnik andrew harnik stf associated press san antonio refiner valero energy corp has been a major buyer of russian crude oil which president joe biden on tuesday banned from importation into the u s in response to russia s invasion of ukraine last year valero imported more than 15 million barrels of oil from russia to make gasoline and other fuels according to the u s energy information administration the independent refiner bought about one fifth of all russian crude imported into the u s in 2021 biden and other western leaders are punishing russian president vladimir putin and his government for the invasion through sanctions that until this week had excluded russia s energy exports biden reversed course tuesday saying the u s will not be part of subsidizing putin s war advertisement article continues below this ad the loss of russian oil means motorists will pay more at the pump as gas prices surged across the country valero s stock price jumped 7 8 percent or 6 53 to close tuesday at 90 54 near its one year high of 92 on feb 7 it wasn t immediately clear how the fortune 500 company and san antonio s largest publicly traded corporation by revenue is dealing with the ban or how it had prepared in advance for the loss of russian crude valero did not respond to an interview request tuesday the u s imported 200 000 barrels of oil per day from russia in 2021 about three percent of the nation s total imports but analysts say there aren t enough extra barrels of oil on world markets for refiners to purchase in the absence of russian barrels the 4 3 million barrels of russian oil that buyers in western nations imported from russia in january cannot be replaced by other sources of oil supply in a short period of time said bjørnar tonhaugen head of oil markets for rystad energy an industry research firm advertisement article continues below this ad although the impact on u s supply may be limited prices are soaring because the ban makes it more of a challenge to trade in russian oil and more likely that other countries may follow suit he said west texas crude one of the oil industry s benchmarks traded at 125 13 late tuesday up 1 4 percent from monday in valero s 2021 annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission on feb 22 the refiner noted the possibility of oil supply disruptions in boilerplate wording it usually includes in its sec financial filings if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional feedstock supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply the company said valero said it buys a significant portion of its feedstock for gas and other refined products from suppliers in the middle east africa europe asia and north and south america advertisement article continues below this ad producers caught short before the covid 19 pandemic which decimated the energy market and pushed drillers to the sidelines u s oil producers would have been better able to make up the loss of russian crude than they are now said michelle michot foss an energy fellow at rice university s baker institute in houston producers are hesitant to invest in boosting production even amid the ban on russian oil for fear that prices will fall once again making new wells unprofitable also stung by shrinking returns in recent years energy investors have demanded oil and gas firms return more money to shareholders through bigger dividends and stock buybacks instead of significantly increasing production there s been pressure on u s companies to pay down debt to reward investors to let their stock valuations improve and boy have they michot foss said advertisement article continues below this ad since the fall oil producer have used up much of their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells michot foss said so increasing production now would require more work companies would have to drill new wells altogether to make commitments to drill now is a bigger decision michot foss said two or three years ago this would ve been a whole different situation to replace russian oil refiners such as valero likely will look to buy more crude from domestic producers as well as from oil exporters in canada and africa some refiners have joined other companies across industries that have voluntarily boycotted russian products in the wake of putin s invasion houston based par pacific holdings last week suspended purchases of russian crude for the refinery it owns in hawaii par pacfic said it would turn to producers in north and south america to meet its production requirements tonhaugen of rystad energy said producers in the opec cartel which includes russia have about 4 million barrels of spare capacity they could produce advertisement article continues below this ad but there are few signs that the middle east producers are opening the taps at least not yet he said how much oil prices rise depends on whether other buyers such as china step in to buy russian oil analysts expect energy prices to continue to climb until demand is wiped out or sustained high prices push companies to pump more oil either outcome is likely to take months tonhaugen said with no additional opec response the most significant potential oil supply shortage since the 1990 gulf war when oil prices doubled could be upon us he said
listen to this article listen to this article with russia intensifying its war on ukraine killing civilians and triggering a mass refugee crisis president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy here is a deeper look what will happen with a u s ban on russian oil with gasoline prices in the u s surging ever higher the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to does the u s ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the united states imports a small share of russia s oil exports and typically doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti an analyst at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices surging with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows that imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are seeking ways to reduce their dependence but it will take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs deputy prime minister alexander novak of russia underscored that urgency saying moscow would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline to retaliate against germany for halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which wasn t yet operating novak added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this his statement marked a shift from russia s earlier assurances that it had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars ___ daly reported from washington ap writer geir moulson contributed from berlin and ap writer aamer madhani contributed from washington
following the kremlin s invasion of ukraine russia has now become the world s most sanctioned country that s according to a report from castellum ai a global sanctions tracking database russia has now become the target of nearly 3 000 new sanctions after dozens of nations condemned president vladimir putin s attempts to overthrow the ukrainian government with the combination of sanctions against russia that had already been put in place before the invasion as well as the latest penalties russia has racked up a historic 5 532 sanctions russian sanctions even surpassed iran who faces over 3 600 sanctions mostly for its continued efforts to manufacture a nuclear program as well as its financial support of well known terrorist organizations the united states and its allies have retaliated against russia with a series of financial penalties reflecting a massive change in how conflicts can be waged in a world that is globalized digital and highly dependent on accessing money electronically there have been economic targets in the past that depended on military maneuvers such as factory bombings blockades and the capture of strategic resources but the waves of sanctions unleashed over the past several weeks have demonstrated how financial markets can respond faster than setting up conventional weapons the sanctions also are a substitute for direct military action against russia by the u s and its allies president joe biden has repeatedly said there will be no u s troops on the ground even as weapons and materials are provided to ukraine the impact of the sanctions likely depends on the pace of the fighting and whether russia takes ukraine or finds itself in a slog in which the pain of any sanctions becomes more acute over time but the value of the ruble has fallen about 35 since friday according to the financial data firm factset the sharp decline of the currency has triggered higher inflation higher interest rates and shortages of goods that hurt regular people in russia so far the u s and international partners have gone after russia s largest banks its central bank and finance ministry and moved to block certain financial institutions from the swift messaging system for international payments but the rules issued by the u s treasury department allow russian energy transactions to keep going through non sanctioned banks that are not based in the u s in an effort to minimize any disruptions to the global energy markets meanwhile inflation at a 40 year peak and fueled in large part by gas prices has hurt biden politically with voters heading into the november elections on tuesday biden decided to ban russian oil imports toughening the toll on russia s economy in retaliation for its invasion of ukraine according to a person familiar with the matter we re banning all imports of russian oil and gas and energy that means russian oil will no longer be accepted at u s ports the president announced at a press briefing biden had explained his reluctance to impose energy sanctions at the outset of the conflict two weeks ago saying that he was trying to limit the pain the american people are feeling at the gas pump before the invasion russian oil and gas made up more than a third of government revenues global energy prices have surged after the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves making russian exports even more lucrative the sanctions created a possible trade off for biden between his political interests at home and abroad by invading ukraine russia has potentially fed into the supply chain problems and inflation that have been a crucial weakness for biden who now is trying to strike a balance between penalizing putin and sparing american voters biden specifically highlighted the russian energy carve outs as a virtue because they would help to protect u s families and businesses from higher prices our sanctions package we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue he said restricting the world s largest exporter of natural gas and second largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia could hurt the unity that u s officials say is key to confronting putin

updated march 8 2022 at 12 28 pm et president biden on tuesday announced a ban on u s imports of russian oil and gas the latest move to try to punish moscow for invading ukraine the united states is targeting the main artery of russia s economy biden said that means russian oil will no longer be acceptable at u s ports and the american people will deal another powerful blow to putin s war machine the ban also applies to u s imports of russian liquefied natural gas lng products made from oil and coal new purchases are to be ceased immediately but u s buyers with existing contracts for russian energy have 45 days to wind down deliveries biden called the prohibition a critical step to punishing russian president vladimir putin but said as a result americans should be prepared to face further price hikes at the pump already the cost to fuel up has spiked since the early days of russia s invasion of ukraine leading to historic gas prices across the country defending freedom is going to cost it s going to cost us as well in the united states biden said biden pledged to do everything i can to minimize putin s price hike here at home and said that lifting environmental regulations would not boost domestic energy production instead he said that oil and gas companies have leased millions of acres of u s land and received permits to drill but have decided not to use them for production they can be drilling right now yesterday last week last year he said after biden s address a senior white house official said the biden administration plans to continue working with major energy consumers to consider releasing more emergency reserves and will continue urging oil producers with spare capacity to produce more oil but the move to cut off russian oil reserves has redoubled the administration s push to wind down western dependence on fossil fuels altogether the official said the united states and allies need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and transition to more renewable sources of energy to avoid this kind of situation in the future despite the short term push to pump more oil the ban marks a divergence in u s sanctions from those of its allies and partners until now washington had worked in lockstep with european allies to carve out exceptions to its banking sanctions for energy transactions recognizing the potential for disruptions to hike prices for consumers biden said he made the decision after communication with u s allies particularly those in europe and he realized many of russia s buyers did not have the energy resources to cut off oil from moscow we will not be part of subsidizing putin s war biden said we can take this step when others cannot europe imports six times more oil from russia than the united states does the white house had initially resisted the move saying it was trying to avoid actions that would reduce global energy supplies or push up prices for western consumers even more we don t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters last week a senior u s administration official on tuesday told reporters that the united states had not asked its allies to adopt a similar ban but the official declined to say whether allies asked the white house to not take this step the cut off extends to the financial sector as well americans are now banned from investing in russia s energy sector including through foreign consortiums that may invest in the country there was a bipartisan push from congress for the ban even though the united states counts on russian oil for less than 10 of its imports those sales were too much for many democrats and republicans in congress who pushed for the ban which was among the requests for assistance from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy during a video call with u s lawmakers over the weekend we are going to continue to consult with continue to convey where our plans where our discussions are here internally with the europeans psaki said on monday ahead of the announcement but i would look at it through a different prism than past coordinated efforts according to reuters 80 of americans support a ban on russian oil imports as sen_joemanchin and i have proposed it s this simple the vast majority of americans do not want their dollars to finance russia s awful war on ukraine if potus doesn t act congress will sen lisa murkowski lisamurkowski march 6 2022 oil and gas prices have soared oil prices hit a 14 year high on monday ahead of the announcement and u s gasoline prices have now hit a record the aaa puts the national average at 4 17 per gallon topping the previous high of 4 11 in 2008 even before russia invaded ukraine inflation at its highest level in decades had become the top issue on the minds of voters ahead of elections this november that will determine whether democrats hold on to their narrow majority in congress the decision today is not without cost here at home putin s war is already hurting american families at the gas pump biden said tuesday biden had strong words for oil and gas companies as well as the financial firms backing them saying that while energy prices will rise with the ban it is no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits about the current state of the invasion biden said this much is already clear ukraine will never be a victory for putin u s officials have talked to saudi arabia and venezuela about energy american officials have been working behind the scenes to try to boost global energy supplies starting during the weeks leading up to the invasion the united states and other major energy consumers also jointly released emergency stocks of oil to try to take the edge off markets u s officials visited saudi arabia to try to urge the kingdom to pump more oil and talks aimed at reviving the iran nuclear deal have led to optimism that it could also lead to a resumption in trade for barrels of iranian oil kept off the market by sanctions over the weekend u s officials took the extraordinary step of visiting venezuela s nicolas maduro a heavily sanctioned authoritarian leader whom washington does not even recognize as the country s legitimate president to talk about energy security the united states has sanctions blocking dealings with the country s oil company and central banks most of

hey there time traveller this article was published 07 03 2022 769 days ago so information in it may no longer be current new york ap with russia intensifying its war on ukraine killing civilians and triggering a mass refugee crisis president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon in this image provided by the white house president joe biden listens during a secure video call with french president emmanuel macron german chancellor olaf scholz and british prime minister boris johnson in the situation room at the white house monday march 7 2022 in washington adam schultz the white house via ap what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy here is a deeper look what will happen with a u s ban on russian oil with gasoline prices in the u s surging ever higher the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to does the u s ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the united states imports a small share of russia s oil exports and typically doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti an analyst at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices surging with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling white house press secretary jen psaki speaks during a press briefing at the white house monday march 7 2022 in washington ap photo patrick semansky the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows that imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are seeking ways to reduce their dependence but it will take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs deputy prime minister alexander novak of russia underscored that urgency saying moscow would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline to retaliate against germany for halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which wasn t yet operating novak added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this his statement marked a shift from russia s earlier assurances that it had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars ___ daly reported

this story was published march 8 2022 by calmatters gov gavin newsom is an unlikely champion of california s down and out yet the wine entrepreneur who built his political career and fortune with help from the state s wealthy elite campaigned on a promise to address california s disparities and do so boldly from his first day in office in january 2019 newsom called the manifestations of california s inequality homelessness poverty and rising costs moral imperatives not just policy priorities so long as they persist each and every one of us is diminished he declared those inequalities persisted and were laid bare by two years of the covid 19 pandemic a tumultuous time that saw the governor overcome a republican led effort to recall him from office last september now with the pandemic receding the economy rebounding and no major political opposition standing in his way to reelection this year newsom has the opportunity to return to his original priority of reducing the stain of poverty on the state he is expected to address the issue today in the final state of the state speech of his first term there is going to be an explicit call out on inequality and the stakes said an aide who spoke only if not named because they were not authorized to give a preview of the speech one of the themes of the speech is going to be democracy and tying that to how unchecked inequality undermines democracy some experts and advocates say newsom s efforts to close the economic divide may determine his legacy and help set him apart from his predecessor and fellow democrat jerry brown who insisted state government could only go so far in closing the divide between rich and poor if the comparison is past governors in california he s trying to do a lot said chris hoene director of the california budget policy center a nonprofit that researches policy affecting low income californians if the comparison is where we were when he took over as governor and where we are today he s facing a ton of headwinds and the urgency and the need drives expectations about him doing more nationally the jobs recovery is in full swing and though california has lagged other states it could at last see improvements as mask mandates loosen and the economy returns more to normal the pandemic and record state budget surpluses have given newsom the opportunity to address the state s inequalities the democratic leaders of the state assembly and senate leaders also say they want to use the budget to create a more inclusive recovery and more equitable economy but assembly gop leader james gallagher of yuba city said it s the policies of democrats that are driving inequality we have a huge surplus because the wealthiest are doing so well he said that doesn t tell the story of the middle and low income earners in this state for instance he said working families are getting hammered by the state s high cost of gasoline which according to aaa has now topped an average of 5 a gallon an increase accelerated by the ukraine war gallagher and other republicans also blame the state s gas tax which democrats raised in 2017 under brown to repair roads and bridges and expand mass transit newsom has proposed putting off a scheduled july increase but the governor has met resistance from his own party in the legislature the climate change agenda of california democrats has also driven up the cost of utilities further deepening inequality gallagher said i think he genuinely cares about this issue but i think that his policies the policies of either he or democrats in the legislature have made the problem worse gallagher said the other problem is that the governor has a lack of follow through he s big on pronouncements and announcing new programs but pretty short on implementation and results what s newsom s record in his state of the state speech last year newsom returned to the theme of inequality indicating his belief the pandemic was widening gaps between the haves and the have nots california s most acute preexisting condition remains income inequality he said in his three years in office he has pushed through several significant initiatives newsom has steadily expanded medi cal coverage to include undocumented people until they turn 26 and once they turn 50 and in his january budget proposed covering those previously excluded but the expansion would still leave several hundred thousand undocumented immigrants unable to qualify because they earn above the program s annual income thresholds in 2019 newsom expanded the state s earned income tax credit and the young child tax credit to help boost the wages of low paid workers and families in 2020 he signed a law allowing anyone with an individual taxpayer identification number to qualify for the expanded earned income tax credit that made undocumented workers eligible to receive hundreds or thousands of dollars each year last year he signed a measure giving 600 one time payments to those who receive the state s earned income tax credit along with an extra 600 for certain undocumented taxpayers not eligible for some federal aid during the pandemic california expanded eligibility for several safety net programs including food assistance allowing for more people to participate in particular the state paused the recertification process in the state s calfresh program which provides food benefits to some 2 6 million low income households and the state last year created a universal free school meals program doing away with a previous income requirement when taking office newsom announced plans to assist working parents with a six month paid family leave program he has so far extended the program to eight weeks per parent in 2020 he signed a bill expanding unpaid family leave to include smaller employers but in 2021 vetoed a bill intended to extend the program to low income workers the governor has also made progress on his goals to expand preschool with a plan to provide universal transitional kindergarten for four year olds by 2025 experts and activists say making higher education more affordable is important to reducing inequality in the state last year the administration eliminated age and time out of high school requirements for cal grant scholarships to community colleges but the governor vetoed a bill that would have made cal grants more broadly available lawmakers last year also signaled the intent to expand a scholarship for middle class students in the state as well as more slots in public universities for california students though lawmakers must agree this year to fund those promises the governor s efforts with economic recovery trying to target funds regionally could help the central valley and other parts of the state that are struggling such work might not be easy a legislative effort to retrain oil workers has already sparked a political fight among some of the state s labor unions still advocates say the state could be doing more to shrink the economic divide it does seem like newsom is treating a commitment to reducing poverty as one of his key legacy commitments david grusky director of the stanford center on poverty and inequality what do the numbers show while recessions tend to widen income disparities between rich and poor earnings have increased for low income workers while unprecedented government relief kept millions from falling into poverty that s despite the sharp downturn in 2020 and the disproportionate number of pandemic related job losses hitting low wage sectors during the recovery some of the biggest gains are in the leisure and hospitality sectors according to sarah bohn a vice president and policy research chairperson with the public policy institute of california wages are picking up the most at the low end of the spectrum even though we re still in a recovery period with elevated unemployment bohn said it might be that inequality is actually decreasing during the pandemic which is kind of crazy and we ll know more soon but when you just look at the wage statistics the sectors that are lowest paid have the highest increase in wages nationally data from the atlanta federal reserve bank shows typical wages for the bottom 25 of earners growing faster than other income groups meanwhile the biden administration has highlighted research from two influential u c berkeley economists underscoring that economic growth has been broadly shared since he took office in january 2021 in california income inequality statistics for 2020 are not yet available but the trend has been one of dramatic widening over the long run with the modern economy placing a premium on highly educated workers analyzing pretax income and including cash from some safety net programs the ppic found income growth for the bottom 10 of families in california lagging significantly behind the top 10 from 1980 to 2019 david grusky director of the stanford center on poverty and inequality said that while incomes may be increasing on the bottom end those with higher incomes were less interrupted by job losses and many saw a significant rise in the value of their assets those people who had money in the stock market fared well and those are the people who are well off he said with its highest earners doing well and a major boost in federal aid california s budget has been flush with surpluses during the pandemic and congress last year passed president biden s american rescue plan which california has used to address some of its longstanding inequities newsom and legislators have invested billions in homelessness programs affordable housing aid to undocumented immigrants and its youth mental health system the youth mental health system reforms are transformational and are expected to be permanent said ed lazere a researcher who tracks state fiscal policy at the center on budget and policy priorities in washington d c focus on homelessness in many ways much of newsom s political career has been defined by one of the most visible manifestations of the state s extremes homelessness he garnered political attention and notoriety from activists with his care not cash initiative as a san francisco supervisor a measure intended to cut general assistance programs for the homeless in exchange for housing and other services he often walked through the city s tenderloin where he saw homelessness for himself gov gavin newsom helps clean up a homeless encampment in san diego as he promotes his new homelessness plan office of the governor of california creative commons in 2020 just before covid newsom dedicated his state of the state address solely to the subject during the pandemic his administration converted dozens of run down motels into shelters and housing for homeless people last year he and the legislature allocated 12 billion to homelessness programs he s proposing another 2 billion in the 2022 23 budget he s also moving ahead with an ambitious plan to clear homeless encampments and offer services to people living in them and last week newsom outlined a plan to allow courts to force some homeless individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorders into treatment while also providing some services after all that homelessness remains one of the biggest problems facing his administration two thirds of voters in a february poll from uc berkeley s institute of governmental studies said he s doing a poor or very poor job on the issue contributing to a lower approval rating than before the recall election last september and along with public perception of rising crime it may be what gets in the way of a smooth path to a second term in this year s election at the same time californians care about inequality in a november survey by the public policy institute of california 69 said the gap between rich and poor is growing in their region and 76 supported increasing government funding so child care is available to more low income working parents and how newsom decides to lead on inequality will matter politically in sacramento given the number of moderate democrats and legislators finding themselves in new districts untested by voters many of whom could be unlikely to support riskier policies without a push from the governor those who advocate for those policies will be watching it does seem like newsom is treating a commitment to reducing poverty as one of his key legacy commitments and so that s wonderful said grusky of stanford but we can do and should do even

wars start and wars end warriors die the surviving non warriors pay the price of a miserable life at the end the diplomats and politicians step in as harbingers of peace at last signing treaties and agreements after failing miserably to stop a war that led to death devastation and destruction they talk of peace in our time as they await the next war just look at the treaty of versailles june 28 1919 and the manoeuvres since then wars will continue as long as the human race exists mainly because wars and wealth creation are two sides of the same coin historically mayhem and manslaughter have been easiest and best way to make money by select groups of men who invariably claimed to be the saviours and rulers of their times let s begin with facts and figures of the human cost of the second world war 1939 1945 the worst of results for the belligerent states though accurate figures never surfaced and the best of record keepers can t say with confidence that the stated casualty figures are correct consider the baseline estimates russia then ussr lost more than 27 million combatants and citizens in 1941 1945 germany 7 5 million poland 6 5 million japan two million yugoslavia 1 8 million hungary 8 5 lakhs france 8 2 lakhs greece 5 5 lakhs austria five lakhs romania 4 7 lakhs italy 4 1 lakhs uk four lakhs czechoslovakia four lakhs and all other european states 4 3 lakhs outside europe china lost 15 million due to war and civil war japan two million and india 3 5 million within the country owing to the famine in bengal created by the british and india s hereditary trading class besides the millions of starvation deaths within 90 000 indians died overseas fighting with british forces and those of other commonwealth countries therefore as the 2022 russia ukraine war rages through europe easily the most volatile cockpit of killing and killer conflict as shown by the first and second world wars it s time to assess potential consequences make no mistake food fuel and finance will be the first to fall in the line of casualties across continents followed by an environment disaster due to the sustained heating of the atmosphere caused by high tech kinetics of the belligerents from production to distribution to consumption the unanticipated bottlenecks are bound to wreak havoc on the poor with a combination of sloppy performance and unbridled greed of middlemen in supply lines as found from the history of profit making in wars there will also re emerge old factories producing new fighters warships etc as things look up for corporations who till recently were grumbling about the shrinking military budgets of european nations and the virtual end of big ticket wars after troop demobilisations in the middle east to afghanistan war is a good time to create wealth and ensure healthy balance sheets the signs are too stark to be missed on february 27 germany that had been the most aggressive in starting the second world war over 80 years ago enhanced its military budget by 100 billion euros 113 billion for 2022 the german chancellor s historic policy shift announcement understandably had an electrifying effect overnight monday february 28 arms maker lockheed martin s stock jumped 3 77 per cent in pre market trading followed by general dynamics 3 96 northrop grumman 4 47 and raytheon technologies 5 23 thus the german defence budget that rose from 36 7 billion in 2015 to 51 3 billion in 2020 shows an unprecedented jump today rising to a record 165 billion in 2022 thus climbing to the third largest defence budget slot after the united states 720 billion plus and second ranking china s 200 billion plus contextually however besides the russian ops in ukraine the dramatic defence budget hike is due to the german army chief too whose uncharacteristic outburst against his own country s inability to make forces combat ready neglect of soldiering and reduced budgets hit the political bosses hard clearly countering moscow seems to have gripped the prosperous german economic powerhouse is history coming back with a vengeance with an aggressive germany getting ready to confront the russians in ukraine clearly the russia ukraine conflict has fundamentally destroyed and changed several systems the first casualty is the globalisation attempt to make economics interdependent to avoid war second the dockyards dominance of corporations over countries is unlikely to be sustained third europe s grandeur is threatened by an inevitable and universal law of decline development economics could give way to deterrence and defence economics welfare may be substituted by warfare economics the post cold war decade of the 1990s had badly hit europe s defence industry its combat aviation industry except for the multinational tornado and france s dassault had hardly anything to offer its naval dockyards had shrunk due to reduced orders the merger of mega corporations had to be resorted to for survival as shown by its long history over centuries war has been an obsession with europe despite it being the cradle of glorious achievements with a plethora of intellectual geniuses in almost every sphere of life in fact this strange recurrence of catastrophic war appears to be europe s bane and ordained destiny of self destruction both the first and the second world wars in terms of their human tragedy stands as the best example till today what then will be the aftermath of the russia ukraine conflict which both belligerents appear to signal as a virtuous war for survival or extinction simply put its main victor will be the arms bazar in 2020 active armed conflicts occurred in at least 39 nations five more than in 2019 but they were not as lucrative as the present russia ukraine conflict appears as there were only two major armed conflicts with more than 10 000 deaths afghanistan and yemen the war in europe now opens up a new vista of vast opportunities for all major arms manufacturers the boardrooms of the defence corporations must be chuckling with joy with these developments after the chinese origin covid 19 pandemic military spending increased in 2020 only in four regions the highest rate of 5 1 per cent growth was in africa at 43 2 billion europe s four per cent increase stood at 378 billion the americas rose by 3 9 per cent to 853 billion and those in asia

4 antibody has the potential to provide greater therapeutic benefit than systemically administered anti ctla 4 antibodies the preclinical data to be presented demonstrate that vectorized anti ctla 4 antibodies delivered intratumorally i t can improve safety by reducing their systemic exposure efficacy may also be improved with evidence from the immunocompetent murine model showing that vectorized anti ctla 4 antibodies have anti tumoral activity even against cold tumors that are resistant to systemically delivered checkpoint inhibitors furthermore the precise targeting of the antibody to a unique functional epitope of ctla 4 provides a higher level of regulatory t cell treg depletion than currently available immune checkpoint blockade icb therapies the studies also provide several key insights into likely mechanisms underlying the efficacy of bt 001 vectorized anti ctla 4 triggered both fcγ receptor dependent treg depletion and antigen cross presentation mechanisms known to trigger and promote long lasting systemic cd8 t cell antitumor immunity showed broad antitumor activity including activity against murine cold tumor models which are resistant to systemic checkpoint

the p e i potato board said it is no surprise that there has been a third detection of potato wart this one found in soil samples taken in october 2021 it says the field is directly related to and located close to a field where potato wart was detected last october in a statement the board said the potatoes in the field were grown for processing not for the fresh table stock market or seed and that the potatoes have already been processed the announcement comes just days before canada s agriculture minister is expecting to hear whether her american counterpart will agree to allow p e i fresh potatoes back into the u s market in mid february after imports to puerto rico resumed federal agriculture minister marie claude bibeau said she was optimistic the mainland u s would reopen in a couple of weeks bibeau then said it could be as late as march 10 before american officials finish their risk assessment and make a decision agriculture minister marie claude bibeau said she was hoping to hear from her american counterpart by march 10 at the latest once u s officials finished their risk assessment and made a decision twitter marie claude bibeau in an email to cbc news the agriculture minister said she was aware that while testing these samples last month the agency confirmed the presence of potato wart spores however bibeau said she was still satisfied that under the controls that canada has set the trade of table stock and processing potatoes presents a very negligible risk agriculture minister marie claude bibeau u s secretary of agriculture tom vilsack and p e i mp lawrence macaulay met in washington on jan 27 2022 twitter marie claude bibeau with our strong risk mitigation measures in place as they are moving across canada and exports have begun again to puerto rico the science is on our side and we will continue to take a science based approach to resume trade to the u s as quickly as possible for this vital industry unfortunate finding the export ban has been in place since nov 21 after the discovery of potato wart fungus in two island fields the board said while any finding of potato wart is unfortunate it shows the long term potato wart management plan is correctly identifying fields at risk the plan has been in place since the first discovery of potato wart in 2000 potato wart has never spread from p e i to anywhere else the board said a fact it said was confirmed by the national potato wart survey the results of that survey were released in december 2021 island growers destroyed an estimated 136 million kilograms of surplus potatoes in february submitted by alex docherty the announcement of the new detection comes just days after p e i farmers completed a potato disposal program destroying an estimated 136 million kilograms of surplus potatoes not unexpected in a statement the canadian food inspection agency said this latest finding was not unexpected as it is not uncommon to detect potato wart in associated fields during an investigation it said the discovery was made on a farm that does not produce table stock potatoes or export to puerto rico and that no seed potatoes produced in 2021 left this grower s facility the canadian food inspection agency says it has now tested more than 3 500 samples from priority fields associated with the two october 2021 potato wart detections shane hennessey cbc the agency said it has now tested more than 3 500 samples from priority fields associated with the two october 2021 potato wart detections which were in restricted fields already being monitored under the potato wart management plan cfia said the agency has plans in place for further sample collection when the ground thaws in the spring including an investigation into this latest detection of potato wart in the statement it also said that based on science the risk of transmitting potato wart from table stock potatoes and potatoes for processing remains negligible when appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place

by brenda goodman cnn the man came to the er at charles regional medical center in la plata maryland wide eyed and scared he couldn t catch his breath he was middle aged overweight and unvaccinated he had also recently tested positive for covid 19 two weeks earlier a doctor who had diagnosed the man during an urgent care visit had noted his risk factors and prescribed a new drug paxlovid an antiviral pill that in clinical trials cut a person s the risk of hospitalization or death from covid 19 by nearly 90 compared with a placebo but the man hadn t taken it because he couldn t find it he said i went to a couple of pharmacies and they just didn t have it said a doctor who later treated him in the er the doctor asked not to be named because he didn t have permission from his employer to speak about the case a ct scan revealed that a massive clot called a saddle embolism was choking off the blood supply to the man s lungs the doctor had no doubt that the cause of the rare clot was the man s untreated covid 19 infection quick treatment saved the man s life he was extremely lucky to survive the doctor said paxlovid and another covid 19 antiviral pill molnupiravir were widely hailed as pandemic game changers when the us food and drug administration authorized them in late december taken within the first five days of covid 19 symptoms they can sharply reduce illness severity seizing on the potential of these new therapies the federal government ordered at least 23 million courses of these medications 20 million of paxlovid and more than 3 million of molnupiravir at a cost of more than 1 billion this week the federal government is launching a program called test to treat that aims to improve access to the medications by creating one stop locations where people with covid symptoms can take a rapid test get their results within minutes see a clinician and leave with a course of the medication to take at home the program was needed because although the federal government has been shipping treatment courses to states access to the pills quickly became unequal while a doctor in delaware scours the internet and spends hours calling local pharmacies to try to find the pills for her patients courses of the drugs sit unused on pharmacy shelves in mississippi leading dr thomas dobbs the state s public health officer to plead with physicians and patients to use them the government has been distributing these scarce treatments to states based on the size of their populations and their covid 19 infection rates and although states can shift unused supplies within their own borders there s no plan to redistribute unused doses from states that have a surplus like mississippi to those that are going without like west virginia which has used 84 of its allotted doses of paxlovid through march 7 holy smokes i could use some of that said retired maj gen james hoyer director of west virginia s joint interagency task force after learning how many doses of paxlovid other states still have on hand we use our entire allocations every week and we could probably use an additional two to three times what we receive hoyer said no plan to redistribute unused pills in the past if states weren t using all their supplies of infused therapies like monoclonal antibodies they could decline their allotment and the federal government could sweep unused covid 19 therapies back into a federal pool where it could be claimed by other states said michael ganio senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the american society of health systems pharmacists because of the high demand for these drugs and because of how limited the supply is by not sweeping it it makes sure that states still have access to that amount ganio said that gives the states some certainty with regard to supply but it comes at the expense of flexibility and access for areas that are going without it s really really frustrating from an icu doc perspective said the maryland doctor who treated the man with the serious blood clot i should be able to prescribe it to my family members like i do with tamiflu and it should be available at every cvs in the country i just don t understand why it s not test to treat may bring this ideal closer to reality for the first time pharmacies will be able to order their own supplies of the pills from the federal government without having to go through states in its latest weekly update the us department of health and human services assistant secretary for preparedness and response or aspr said the supplies of pills to stock the test to treat program will come from a separate federal cache of drugs that will not affect current state allocations test to treat will also ship pills directly to pharmacies serving long term care facilities pharmacy chains will choose where the pills should go however rather than the federal government or states although the program officially gets underway this week it may take some time to get it up and running and it s not clear where stores that participate in the program will be located in many states lifesaving pills go unused until test to treat becomes widely available however states will continue to be the main distributors of antivirals pills a cnn analysis of data collected from state health departments shows big differences in availability of these medications washington and new jersey report using nearly all available supplies of their paxlovid for example but minnesota mississippi and utah still have more than three quarters of their allocated supplies providers are tasked with reporting daily usage of these therapeutics into the federal government and hhs shares this data in a public therapeutics locator the federal data however is notably incomplete thousands of providers last updated usage more than a month ago and some states told cnn that some providers have not reported this information at all it s really frustrating said dr tete tonwe who runs a family practice clinic called divergent primary care in milford delaware despite regularly searching the government s therapeutics locator database networking with other doctors and calling pharmacies tonwe says she still hasn t been able to find this drug to treat her high risk patients though she recently heard that a physician friend was able to find some i just want to help people feel better she said when something like this drug which is as close to a cure as you get with a virus exists but it s not available here and it s being wasted elsewhere it s just really really kind of like a moral injury she said the delaware department of health and social services says the state gets enough paxlovid every two weeks to treat 200 people mississippi has enough paxlovid sitting unused on pharmacy shelves to treat 2 846 people according to the state department of health the test to treat program should reach more people creating convenience for our citizens we are communicating with our partners and providers to determine resources they would need to implement this statewide wrote timothy turane a spokesperson for the delaware department of health and social services in a statement to cnn although some states are reserving their limited supplies of the drug to treat only those at highest risk of severe consequences mississippi is making the medications available to anyone with a positive covid 19 test and a prescription we have unused tools in our toolbox and we want to make sure that everyone is aware that they are available and can help save mississippi lives dobbs said at a recent news briefing though the pace of new infections is slowing nationwide 78 of us counties are still reporting substantial or high rates of transmission according to cdc data almost 45 000 new covid 19 infections reported each day in the united states yet about half of covid 19 therapeutics are still going unused according to aspr overcoming hurdles to prescribing the drugs the reasons why these lifesaving treatments have been underutilized are complex molnupiravir causes the genetic material inside the virus to make mistakes as it copies itself essentially mutating the virus to death because of the way the drug works there s some fear that it may also mutate the dna in rapidly dividing cells animal studies have suggested that it might interfere with bone formation so it s not supposed to be used in anyone younger than 18 it s also not recommended for women who are pregnant since there s a risk of birth defects in clinical trials molnupiravir was less effective than paxlovid cutting the risk of a covid 19 hospitalization by 30 that led many doctors to question whether the risks for some people are worth its benefits paxlovid a pill that combines two medicines interacts with drugs in 32 classes of medications including antidepressants antibiotics antipsychotics and blood pressure medications these interactions make it tricky to prescribe the sicker people who qualify for it are also more likely to have drug interactions so we have to be more cautious of it says dr mark horne immediate past president of the mississippi state medical association horne says he recently tried to prescribe paxlovid for a 94 year old patient and although he could have temporarily stopped his patient s cholesterol medication he didn t feel like he could stop a different heart medication his patient was taking that would have interacted instead he had to call around until he found a dose of the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab which came from a neighboring state another obstacle is that doctors just aren t aware of the medications or don t feel familiar enough with how they work to confidently prescribe them dobbs the state health officer for mississippi says this happened with monoclonal antibody infusions too they were available for many months before we had robust use in the state of mississippi dobbs said once a prescriber has found a patient who can safely take one of the new antiviral drugs they have to locate it even with the pills becoming more plentiful the medications can still be difficult to find rod hilton a 40 year old software developer from denver recently drove three hours round trip to fill his paxlovid prescription hilton has an underlying health condition and says he and his wife are very covid conscious they pulled their two young children out of school through the winter holidays to try to protect them from infection then when the family couldn t stand doing work and school from home any longer their 5 year old ended up catching covid 19 on her first day back to school then it was just one by one dominoes he says his 3 year old got sick then his wife and then i caught it normally their family doctor phones in their prescriptions to a nearby pharmacy this time though he handed hilton his prescription on a piece of paper because he d already written 14 prescriptions for paxlovid they d all gone unfilled knowing that he had to take the medicine quickly for it to be effective hilton sat in the parking lot of his doctor s office congested and with a throbbing headache and started searching for pharmacies that might have it walmart was out across the state the he found the covid 19 therapeutics locator website and started calling finally he found some at a hospital pharmacy in greeley a 90 minute drive north into the mountains hilton says the drug was worth the trip the day he filled his prescription he was in rough shape he took his first dose that night within 24 hours it was gone he says hilton and his wife are both vaccinated she got covid 19 before he did hilton recovered completely within a day of starting paxlovid but his wife was sick for more than a week after he recovered hilton knows he was lucky even sick he had the means and time to find a pharmacy where he could get his pills not everyone is able to do that we re not done with treatment the prescribing process is what kind of took the shine off the medications said dr jane wainaina an infectious disease specialist and medical director of the antimicrobial stewardship progam at froedtert hospital in milwaukee wainaina said that although the pills particularly paxlovid looked in their clinical trials like they could deal a crushing blow to the pandemic they have been harder to use in the real world we ve been able to supply oral antivirals to every patient that qualified and wanted their treatment she said but not many do at her hospital only about 30 of the people the hospital has deemed eligible to take the pills have responded to an initial phone call and of that group only about half end up taking them wainaina says many patients feel wary about taking a medication that s not fully approved by the fda both antiviral pills are available through an emergency use authorization which requires a lower standard of evidence to bring a treatment onto the market she says timing also presents some challenges we re offering these medications early because that s when they work at that point many people are not feeling unwell they re like why do i need to take a medication i don t feel that bad it s just a cold she said these drugs are good she said but they don t check all the boxes we re not done with treatment we re going to have to continue to work and study in order to stay somewhat ahead of the virus as far as effective treatments go wainaina said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s deidre

washington president biden on tuesday banned imports of russian oil gas and coal in response to what he called president vladimir v putin s vicious war of choice in ukraine but warned americans that the decision to inflict economic pain on russia would inevitably mean higher gas prices at home defending freedom is going to cost mr biden said in televised remarks announcing the ban at the white house the president s move immediately shut off a relatively small flow of oil into the united states but it was quickly followed by a british pledge to phase out imports of russian oil by the end of the year and a declaration from the european commission the executive arm of the european union which is heavily dependent on russian oil and gas to make itself independent of that supply in the coming years the impact of the decisions quickly rippled across the global energy market amid fears that the supply of oil would shrink in the united states the national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline which had already surged in recent weeks reached 4 173 not adjusted for inflation a new high and an average increase of about 72 cents from only a month ago according to aaa

new york with russia intensifying its war on ukraine killing civilians and triggering a mass refugee crisis president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy here is a deeper look what will happen with a u s ban on russian oil amid rising gasoline prices in the u s the average price reached a record 4 17 a gallon on tuesday the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s single largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies file u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman holds a news conference at the nato headquarters in brussels belgium jan 12 2022 not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to even with a ban on russian oil the biden administration and congress remain laser focused on bringing down the higher energy costs for american families and our partners stemming from putin s invasion house speaker nancy pelosi said pelosi who has expressed support for a u s ban on russian oil nevertheless also cited biden s action in leading u s allies to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves including 30 million barrels from u s reserves to try to stabilize global markets would a u s only ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the united states imports a small share of russia s oil exports and doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel file gas prices are displayed at gas stations in englewood new jersey march 7 2022 because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices to their highest level ever recorded with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february the petroleum institute hasn t taken a formal stance on legislation to ban russian oil imports but it says it would comply with any restrictions imposed will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are looking for ways to reduce their dependence but it s going to take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand file pipes at the landfall facilities of the nord stream 2 gas pipline are pictured in lubmin northern germany feb 15 2022 germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs russian deputy prime minister alexander novak underlined that urgency saying russia would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline in retaliation for germany halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which was not yet operating he added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this it was a change from earlier russian assurances that they had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe some ships filled with lng had been heading to asia but turned around to go to europe because buyers there offered to pay higher prices according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars

aboard air force one en route fort worth texas 2 08 p m est ms psaki hi everyone hello okay welcome to our trip to fort worth texas just a couple items for you at the top as i mentioned yesterday this week we are marking the one year anniversary of the american rescue plan today we re focusing on the historic tax relief in the american rescue plan which is helping lower costs faced by working americans thanks to the american rescue plan americans have received the largest ever child tax credit the largest ever earned income tax credit for workers without dependent children and the largest ever child and dependent care tax credit which will help families meet the high cost of care today we re providing new state by state analysis of how many families and children will be reached by this historic tax relief and we ll have more tomorrow also as you all know last week in the president s state of the union address he talked about the sacred obligation we have as a country to our veterans and that could be not be more true or relevant than right now addressing veterans health issues is a bipartisan issue and a core pillar of the president s unity agenda he s pushing for us to understand more about military exposures and their relation to nine additional rare cancers and called on congress to send him a bill he will him a bill he will sign today he is traveling with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to address this important unifying issue we think it shows how seriously he takes this and that he s following through on a key commitment to unifying the country texas is home and he s actually meeting with a number of them right now on the plane texas is home to the second largest population of veterans in the united states many of whom rely upon the va for services and benefits nearly 55 percent of veterans in texas served in the era when burn pits were used finally one year ago today on international women s day the president issued an executive order establishing the white house gender policy council and charged it with leading a government wide effort to advance gender equity and equality both at home and abroad in the year since the biden administration has taken significant steps to advance equal rights and opportunity from taking on gender based violence wherever it occurs to protecting women s health to ensuring that women and families have economic security and laid out an ambitious agenda in the first ever national strategy on gender equity and equality and today we announced that the president s fy23 budget will request 2 6 billion for foreign assistance programs that promote gender equality worldwide more than doubling the amount requested just last year josh why don t you kick us off q thanks jen americans right now know that they re paying a higher price because of the sanctions against russia oil was up 7 percent when we boarded air force one on the day what is the specific price that the ban puts on putin and how does it deter him in a way that the previous sanctions did not ms psaki well let me first say that americans are paying a higher price at the pump because of the actions of president putin this is a putin spike at the gas pump not one prompted by our sanctions we have seen since president putin and the russian military lined up earlier this year troops at the border an increase of about 75 cents on average across the country in terms of what impact this will have this is continuing to build on the steps that the president has taken in coordination with our european partners to squeeze the financial system in russia to squeeze the circle around president putin and to send a clear message that we are going to continue to press and squeeze on the system to hopefully change the behavior over the course of time q is there a dollar amount that you think you re able to extract from the russian economy through the ban ms psaki well i don t have a prediction along those lines josh i certainly understand why you re asking i think as you know and others who track the russian markets closely know they have not even opened the stock market the ruble is at a record low they have enormous financial challenges they re heading into you know a version of a financial recession in russia according to outside economists so this step is meant to build on the steps we have taken to date from the united states and from the global community q jen what can the administration do to protect americans against the kind of price gouging that the president spoke about today ms psaki well first i would say one of the steps we can take is to make clear what is and isn t impacting gas prices and what the oil companies can do and have a responsibility to do and you heard the president talk about that today so let me give you an example there have been some including the american petroleum institute who have claimed that this is an issue of having access or funds the oil and gas industry has a lot of permits onshore alone more than 9 000 unused approved permits to drill and i would note that only 10 percent of drilling is happening on federal lands the other 90 percent is on private lands but i m talking about the 10 percent in that case so the argument that there are just no opportunities to drill for oil is just not true the phenomenon that we re actually seeing is much more about firms wanting to return cash to investors than about a lack of opportunity and so part of what the president can do and we can all do is inform and educate the american public about what the facts are here this is not a lack of places to drill this is not a lack of access to oil in fact last year we produced more oil and gas in the united states than the first year of the trump administration next year is predicted to be the largest year on record of oil and gas production that is not the issue so it s really up to the oil companies to determine whether they are going to as well as wall street whether they re going to reinvest these war profits from high prices back into the economy raise production and lower prices to american consumers and that pressure should be on them q what s the timeframe for implementation of these new restrictions on imports ms psaki so it will ban new contracts and then for contracts that are existing it will be they ll have 45 days to deliver on those q another question on house democrats seeming to plan to still move forward with their bill that will that has an energy component to it that sounds very similar to what the president announced as well as a piece on looking at russia s involvement with the wto and some expansion of magnitsky what is the administration s take on what the house democrats are doing and did the president feel at all pressured by members of congress of both parties and in both chambers to move fairly quickly on his own lest he be boxed in by legislation that might be more complicated to implement than what he was proposing ms psaki well first we welcome the support of members of congress for the president s announcement this morning democrats and republicans who have announced support for his efforts we are working in close coordination with speaker pelosi and other leaders in congress on a shared objective which is to take steps that will maximize the impact on president putin and the russian economy and minimize it on the american people what the president s priority and focus has been from the beginning and he has discussed with a range of members is ensuring that we are taking steps in close coordination with the europeans our partners now we did not expect nor did we ask them to take the same step that we announced this morning they have a you know different capabilities and different capacities than we do even if you look at data that is we have available which is from 2021 we only imported about 10 percent of our oil from russia the europeans it s more like a third it s much higher about 450 barrels million barrels per day as opposed to 700 000 for the united states we recognize that but at the same time taking steps to act in a coordinated way to ensure we re discussing with them the steps we re considering in taking and doing that in a way that does not add to greater you know volatility in the oil markets is a shared objective so we welcome the steps they ve taken now in terms of the wto specifics ambassador tai has been obviously engaging with other wto countries it s not a unilateral step the united states could take or the president could take but we will continue those conversations as well q jen can you outline some of the things that the administration is considering to help blunt the impact on consumers of these higher fuel prices do they include waiving the gasoline tax do they include waiving the jones act do they include lifting environmental specs on fuel are those things that you are considering as you look at trying to help consumers ms psaki so there are a range that we are considering i m not going to give you a nod or a wink to any specifics other than to say that q oh come on ms psaki there are a range of options on the table as you all know we are engaging in ongoing conversations with large global energy suppliers as a part of it part of that effort has also been to do this coordinated release of what will be 90 million barrels from the strategic petroleum petroleum reserve excuse me this fiscal year including the initial announcement and then the one we just made last week i believe it was so those conversations are ongoing i would also note that part of our the capacity out here is with the oil companies who have these approved permits that are unused where they could do more now some ceos have indicated that they do plan to increase production and that s something that to meet the supply needs we have now we certainly would welcome i would say the last piece of this in addition to a range of domestic options we ll continue to consider and discuss is that we re working with europe to ensure we re we are all diversifying our energy security measures and this is maybe a longer term step but this is a reminder of how important it is to do that to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels on foreign oil on russia and on the whims of dictators as we have found ourselves in in this moment q one question about iran as well they their negotiator has said that they are going to stick with their red lines and one thing that they have asked or they want some certainty that if they do end up going through with this agreement that another administration can t come in and walk out of it what how does the u s guarantee that is that even possible ms psaki it s an interesting question jeff i mean i think that you know if you look at what s happened over the last several years you had obviously it was it was the iran nuclear deal was initially approved and moved forward under the obama biden administration when former president trump pulled out of the deal we ve seen the dire impact that that has led to including a lack of visibility into their program they have made significant progress toward acquiring a nuclear weapon so i think that hopefully democrats and republicans of all stripes will recognize what a mistake that was and if we are do get back into the iran nuclear deal something we are close on although it s always final details that you have to work through you know certainly our hope would be and the message we d be sending to the world is that this is in not only global interests but in our u s national interest regardless of who is sitting in the white house q secretary blinken is finishing up a five day trip to europe he s meeting with macron today he met with the leaders of baltic states moldova poland the israeli foreign minister what would you say are the accomplishments of this trip and are these diplomatic efforts going to extend to u s adversaries like venezuela ms psaki well i think those are slight well let me take the first question first we re broadly of course supportive of efforts of our partners and allies including france germany israel turkey and others to seek a diplomatic resolution a number of the countries and leaders you ve mentioned the secretary of state has met with recently over the last couple of days but also we ve been in touch with either prior to or following or both in many cases their conversations with both russians as well as ukrainians who we re encouraging them to also engage with and we maintain open and regular high level channels of communications with all of these partners as it relates to venezuela i would say i would take that question slightly separately in that you know there are a range there was obviously a recent trip that was reported and we confirmed there were a range of topics discussed during that trip including the health and welfare of detained u s citizens but beyond that those conversations are ongoing and i just don t have anything to update you on q we re flying to texas there are a couple of texans who are held in russia right now trevor reed and brittney griner is the white house involved at all in negotiating their release getting their release and also does the white house fear that more americans are going to be used as pawns in this global conflict ms psaki well on the second individual you named we ve obviously seen the reports we don t have a privacy act waiver so i cannot speak to that case on the case of trevor reed i can tell you that our national security advisor met with his family back in the fall and that we are working on a time for the president to meet with his family over the short term as well i don t have a time or date on that or anything like that but that is something we are going to work toward q jen there is a question from the print pool on that why isn t the president meeting with trevor reed s family today ms psaki i would say that we are working toward setting up a meeting with his family the president is looking forward to doing that and again our national security advisor met with his family back in the fall but it wasn t we weren t able to make it happen on this trip q back to venezuela there s been significant bipartisan concern expressed about the fact that there are even conversations happening with the maduro government at this stage can you be more specific about what the conversations are with respect to energy and any tradeoffs that might be on the table to encourage venezuela to produce more oil ms psaki there are really not specifics additional specifics i can add at this point i would just note that any conversation about the health and wellbeing of american citizens happens through different channels so i wouldn t see it as a tradeoff as you said i would note also that you may have seen maduro announced this morning his intention to go back into talks with the opposition so i would just note that q it feels like with saudi like i want to ask you about saudi arabia because it feels like especially compared to venezuela that s a country with much greater capacity to backfill global energy supplies than venezuela is there disappointment or are there ongoing talks with the kingdom of saudi arabia about freeing up more reserves potentially to enable europe to go further with cutting off russian energy ms psaki well i would say that as you know the president spoke with king salman last month made clear that we share important interests deterring iranian proxy attacks against civilians ending the war in yemen ensuring the stability of global energy supplies as part of it and he is very focused on the president is very focused on the situation in front of us and what he can do to improve the security and prosperity of americans so i would also note that in addition to that call brett mcgurk and amos hochstein traveled to the region and had a conversation about all of those topics just a few weeks ago so those conversations are going they will continue but i don t have anything to predict for you at this point q inaudible more recent conversations though since the war in ukraine began ms psaki i don t have anything to read out for you at this point q jen you spoke yesterday about the united states openness to backfill planes to poland if they send jets to ukraine is that something that the vice president will be discussing helping to negotiate or coordinate while she s in poland this week ms psaki you know the vice president s trip to poland and to europe is part of our effort to show our strong support for our nato allies and partners the security assistance they ve been providing their role in accepting and welcoming refugees from ukraine this is certainly a topic that has been discussed by the president with his counterpart as recently as a couple days ago i would note as i said yesterday it s obviously a decision by poland a sovereign country to make about delivering planes there were some logistical questions important ones that were still under discussion about where those planes would take off from and land and then there are questions that are probably best best suited for the department of defense about the procurement of planes to backfill because typically that takes a couple of years q the president mentioned today that he sent secretary blinken to the border of poland and ukraine to see firsthand what was happening will he also send the vice president to that same border while she s on her trip to report back firsthand to him ms psaki sure francesca i don t have the details on her trip at this point in time i m sure they will be doing a backgrounder on additional steps obviously the important role that poland has been playing as a neighboring country in welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees from ukraine into their country is something that the vice president will note and will thank them for personally when she is on the ground q jen senator grassley has expressed some concerns about the pace at which chairman durbin and leader schumer are planning to move ahead on the supreme court confirmation process and you know i know that the white house has in the past been very supportive of that i know you re closely coordinated so i assume the same is true now but do you think that there should be a return to a pace more like the pre barrett pace and yes i know that some of the others in the past were in this 25 ish day range but do you think that is there any consideration in the white house of just slowing things down a bit just by a few days or a week to kind of stave off some of that criticism ms psaki well i would say first if you look at the data and numbers from the past nominees and how long it has took we are much close what we re doing is much closer to the timeframe for justice ginsburg which was about 28 days justice barrett was 13 and it s slower than sandra day o connor s which was 21 days so the pace through which and we are working of course in lockstep and close coordination with leaders on the hill is very much in line with the majority of nominees in recent history q the irish times had a report that the united nations communications office was telling its employees not to call what s going on in ukraine a war or an invasion does the white house have any advice for the united nations or anyone else on what to call what is happening in ukraine ms psaki i think the united nations has put out a clarifying statement on that q one more on oil is the white house prepared for the oil price to go as high as 200 a barrel or something really really high like that and if so what preparations are you making to help the american economy against that kind of a hit q will you encourage americans to stay home the same way they might ve been doing through the pandemic so that they re just driving less or working from home for instance ms psaki we re neither going to make a prediction nor are we going to tell americans to stay home what the president is focused on is taking a range of steps to mitigate the impact obviously we ve seen as i noted a little bit earlier an increase since president putin invaded ukraine of about 75 cents that is you know over the course of the timeline we ve seen that in relation to you know concern in the oil mar in the global oil markets about what they re seeing which is an invasion and but we believe that the impact of this oil ban we announced today will be not long term and what we re working to do is to take steps to mitigate it which is in part the release from the strategic petroleum reserve continuing to coordinate and communicate with global energy suppliers and continuing to consider a range of options q jen on the supreme court today judge jackson is meeting with some republicans including senator scott as well as senator collins does the white house realistically think that those republicans will vote for judge jackson and besides those one on one meetings what is the white house doing to earn support from republicans ms psaki well i would say that first judge jackson has been doing her homework and hard at work since the moment she was announced as the nominee she started prepping for hearings and prepping for these meetings even the weekend after she announced which probably doesn t surprise anyone given her exemplary record and background she has conveyed and expressed an openness as has the team to meeting with a broad range of democrats and republicans of course on the committee and beyond and it s up to them to decide who they re going to vote for of course but she is somebody who has been confirmed three times by the senate in a bipartisan manner she is someone who has ruled in favor of democrats and republicans served under democrats and republicans and very much in the model of justice breyer so we believe she deserves bipartisan support q there s was a letter from former national security officials talking about a limited no fly zone over humanitarian corridors is that something that the white house would consider if it s not considering a full on no fly zone over all of ukraine ms psaki well a limited no fly zone would still require implementation of a no fly zone even if it s a smaller geography which would still require shooting down russian planes if they fly into your no fly zone so that would still have we would still have concerns about that being an escalatory action that could lead us into a war with russia which is not something the president intends to do q jen there was a line in the readout yesterday of the president s conversations with the german french uk leaders about the leaders downloading essentially their respective engagements with president zelenskyy as well as president putin you ve been clear that the u s does not believe now is the time for president biden to engage directly with president putin but is president macron essentially acting as an intermediary at this point is the president using his conversations with president macron to send messages to president putin in any way ms psaki i wouldn t say that the president there are a range of global leaders who are engaging directly with president putin president macron is one of them but so is prime minister bennett the plane experiences turbulence q whoa ms psaki we ve seen so sorry that was quite a for those listening that was a little bit of a lurch there we ve seen a number of leaders express an openness to plans to engage and we welcome that and encourage that and we have been through the process very closely coordinated with all of these leaders who have been engaging directly with president putin what we have been doing is encouraging them and for the most part they ve done this to also engage directly with president zelenskyy as they you know play any role in diplomacy but i wouldn t put it on one leader there are a range of leaders who are playing important roles here q is there any opportunity through the p5 1 conversations are u s officials engaging with their russian counterparts on any matters related to ukraine even in the context of those discussions with iran ms psaki those conversations are about the iran nuclear deal and preventing iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon which even as we have significant serious concerns about the horrific and barbaric invasion that president putin is leading we believe we do share a desire to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon q has the president spoken to any european leaders since that joint call yesterday morning ms psaki we ve put out the readouts of any calls he s had so q so he said this morning when he was going into the event that he had just gotten off the phone so those weren t with world leaders ms psaki i believe that was with members of congress this morning q okay ms psaki i can double check but we have put out readouts for any calls he s had q what are the next steps on the anti lynching bill when does the president intend to sign ms psaki sure well let me just give you a little bit more on this for your records it s long past time that our federal laws recognize lynching for the abomination and the stain on the soul of this country that it is and yesterday congress for the first time in more than 100 years after more than 200 tries made lynching a federal crime this historic moment would not have happened without the bipartisan efforts that started with the vice president then senator harris senator booker and congressman bobby rush who worked to build support in the house and senate to make this day a reality the president looks forward to signing this historic bill into law with the vice president by his side as you know he s obviously traveling today she s traveling so i don t have an update on exactly when but hopefully it will be the plan would be for it to be when they can both be there in person q and a covid question i know the white house released yesterday that the president had tested negative again for the coronavirus now that we re in a more maskless environment i m sure the president will largely not be wearing one today is there plans for the white house to test the president more regularly and disclose the results of those tests more regularly ms psaki he is tested on a regular basis the last time was sunday it s typically about once a week but it s a determination made by his doctor i m not aware of any changes to that protocol the only protocol that s changed is masking let me give you a little bit of an update on today because there s just different rules in different facilities too so outside the president will not be masking at the va facility he will abide by the va facility s mask requirement and wear a mask as we all will as well we ll join him in the masking requirement and at the community center he will not be masking so some of this is there are different restrictions and requirements in different facilities which we ll continue to abide by and this is a yellow zone that we are traveling to q jen do you have a comment on the supreme court ruling yesterday upholding congressional maps in pennsylvania and north carolina ms psaki let me check and see if there s something we have to offer you on that q and staying on the subject of texas for a moment is there anything more you can tell us about the biden administration s efforts to keep the state of texas from implementing a directive on care for transgender children ms psaki well let me first say that the steps we ve seen in texas and florida are deeply concerning and are having are discriminating against exactly the kind of kids who we need to be loving and supporting and we ve seen and i reference florida because as you know they just recently passed a similar hateful bill that hurt some of the students most in need in terms of any legal actions i d obviously point you to the department of justice but i would just note that the president the secretary of education many members of the administration have spoken out about the discriminatory nature of these bills and our deep concerns about the message they re sending to lgbtq kids and families q you mentioned florida the department of education said today in a statement on the florida legislature s parental rights in education bill that quote all schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights laws including title ix s protections end quote is the administration considering halting the flow of title ix funding to florida if it moves forward with that legislation ms psaki i don t have anything to update you on on that front we can check if there s more to report on that q the united kingdom announced that it was also going to have restrictions on the importation of russian oil and gas was there coordination with the white house to time these announcements at the same time and do you think the uk s decision to wait until the end of the year to implement that is the right one ms psaki well i would say every country will make their own decisions we did not expect nor did we request for the european countries to follow suit i m not sure what the import numbers are for the united kingdom i believe they are low as are ours and ours were about 10 percent last year so they may have looked at it through a different prism as we did through many other european countries or countries in europe who have much larger percentages of imports and have lower capacities for production so certainly it s a step we took there have been a range of conversations with prime minister boris johnson but again these are steps taken by individual countries q what is the administration s feeling on the european commission s announcement that the plan now is to cut its russian energy imports by two thirds by the end of the year is that something that the white house applauds or are there also concerns about the potential impact on global supplies of europe which is so much more dependent on russian oil ms psaki we welcome efforts for europe by europe and other countries to diversify their energy sources there is no question about that there are also steps i mean the oil market oil is a global marketplace right so we are working in lockstep with our european partners to ensure that the supply on the marketplace is meeting what the demand is but in terms of efforts to diversify we certainly welcome that we re doing we re working to do something similar q i have a couple more sorry on judge jackson she s also meeting with democrats today is the white house confident it will get the support of the entire democratic caucus for judge jackson ms psaki we believe judge jackson is an eminently qualified nominee who has been approved three times by bipartisan a bipartisan senate and you know certainly we believe she warrants and deserves bipartisan support q and on texas does the president have any plans to meet with beto o rourke the democratic gubernatorial candidate for governor ms psaki on this trip i don t believe so q okay and what why did he choose texas for this trip and veterans first this is the first stop on his unity agenda tour as you could call it so why texas ms psaki well i think as i said at the beginning texas is home to the second largest population of veterans in the united states many of whom rely on the va for services and benefits and nearly 55 percent of veterans in texas served in the era when burn pits were used and this is an opportunity also for the president to travel with a bipartisan group which showcases to the country and the people of texas and the veterans community of texas how important this is to the president and how committed he is to continuing to make proc progress on his unity agenda all right thanks everyone 2

you ve probably noticed that gas prices are at a record high according to data from aaa the national average for a gallon of gas is 4 009 the highest since the 2008 financial crisis this has real consequences for working people across the country but you d never know it based on how some liberal pundits are talking to them americans should be happy to see gas prices rage even higher in exchange for feeling good about themselves when it comes to russia s invasion of ukraine complaining about gas prices have some perspective the usa today columnist michael j stern tweeted over the weekend along with a photo of a bomb ravaged town in ukraine atching cable news and not just fox you would think the biggest story in the world right now is gas prices in the us tweeted another journalist low gas prices was a nice upside consequence of the cataclysmic 2020 economic meltdown where 20 of americans had no job all the stores were closed and 380 000 of us died was senator chris murphy s way of gaslighting you out of noticing your gas bill and last night none other than the dean of the liberal commentariat himself stephen colbert addressed the topic with characteristic smug condescension a clean conscience is worth a buck or two he said to roaring applause from his new york audience i m willing to pay 4 a gallon hell i ll pay 15 a gallon because i drive a tesla stephenathome today the average gas price in america hit an all time record high of over 4 gallon ok that stings but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two it s important i m willing to pay 4 gallon hell i ll pay 15 a gallon b c i drive a tesla pic twitter com my8ukya5rq tom elliott tomselliott march 8 2022 bully for him most of us do not live in cities with great public transportation or drive the latest in fuel efficient cars the working class people of this country those who live in the dilapidated suburbs and exurbs of our cities and the rural hinterlands are more likely to drive a beat up old chevy these are the people the left used to care about these are the people who will be hurt by rising fuel prices who are being mocked by rich liberals of course i feel for the people of ukraine we should do what we can to defend them from putin s aggression but it does not undermine that sentiment to point out that it is the working class that is going to bear the burden of the rising gas prices being inflicted on them by elites in the political and chattering classes higher gas prices disproportionately affect rural america and the working class back in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis this was something that was widely reported on in those halcyon days of yesteryear the left understood that the price of gas was a big determinant in whether american families could make ends meet it was for this reason that then candidate barack obama supported tapping the nation s strategic oil reserves while his primary opponent hillary clinton proposed temporarily suspending the federal excise tax on gas neither of these were necessarily popular with environmentalists or the urban elites of the democratic base but the candidates and many in the party understood they were necessary measures to alleviate immediate pain it did not mean that we should not develop renewable energies or signal a doubling down on fossil fuels rather it was a way to meet the material needs of people in the here and now something the democrats used to prioritize over the ensuing 14 years the democratic party has lost touch with rural and working class americans this shows in the response of the liberal commentariat all of whom are asking the most vulnerable among us to take it on the chin for too many though rising gas prices are more like a punch in the gut 30 percent of rural americans commute 30 minutes one way to and from work which translates into more mileage than it does in the city 4 percent of americans a not insignificant number of the 60 million rural americans commute more than 90 minutes and they re not just commuting to work rural americans live further from the nearest hospital and are more likely to say access to good healthcare locally is a problem above gas prices are displayed at a brooklyn gas station on march 8 2022 in new york city above gas prices are displayed at a brooklyn gas station on march 8 2022 in new york city spencer platt getty images this is not just a rural problem though across the country the poor and working class travel further for groceries school and work most cities outside new york and chicago lack reliable public transportation the result of america s car culture while there is certainly a debate to be had about whether that s in our best interests going forward it does nothing to address the immediate needs of the poor and working class in both rural america and cities like seattle where gentrification has increasingly priced the working class out of the city centers and into suburbs and exurbs to put into perspective just how dire these straits are gas prices consume up to 20 percent of some household budgets unsurprisingly black hispanic and native american communities bear a disproportion burden meanwhile real wages have been stagnant since the 1970s with a 2018 dollar having the same purchasing power as a dollar in 1978 even there rural america lags behind urban and suburban america with wage and salary growth in rural communities between 2010 and 2017 lagging behind cities and suburbs all of this conspires to mean rural americans have lower overall incomes and therefore struggle to absorb the cost of rising gas prices more than urban dwellers even though urban dwellers are more likely to live below the poverty line and even then many of them are pushed to the extremes of their metro areas meaning they too are driving further than middle and upper class elites someone has to pour your lattes pick up your trash stock your shelves and clean your offices what happens when they can t afford to get to work the american people have to ask themselves this question and they do not like the answer this may explain why a washington post abc news poll two weeks ago found that 67 percent of americans support sanctions yet just a week later another poll by the washington post found that number dropped to 51 percent if sanctions led to higher energy prices in the united states it s worth mentioning that the u s working class did not start this war putin did he s the bad guy here yet it is working class and poor people who are feeling the sting of america s morally righteous stand rather than derision they deserve support leaders and pundits who are interested in making this sacrifice easier to bear not harder that used to be what the left did make life better for working people asking americans to make a sacrifice to uphold the global liberal order might be noble but the sacrifice is not one made without pain it certainly is not one that should be mocked by coastal liberals who don t have to worry about the price at the pump skylar baker jordan writes about the intersection of identity politics and public policy based he lives in

what is stagflation and why are economists and investors worried about it staging an unwelcome comeback the spectre of stagflation is stalking the global economy as growth slows and the cost of living soars prices of commodities from nickel to wheat are all on the rise due to sanctions slapped on russia by the west in an attempt to end vladimir putin s bloody rampage in ukraine stagflation where an economy stagnates but inflation is rife is considered a disaster for governments and households it usually means that while prices rise wages remain flat forcing families to cut their spending and even pushing low income households into poverty businesses meanwhile see their costs climb but the lower level of activity in the economy means there is little they can do to meet these expenses now economists are becoming increasingly worried that stagflation could become a reality britain s ftse 100 index has fallen 7 2 per cent so far this year america s s p 500 is down by 13 per cent since the turn of the year as the tech giants which make up so much of the us stock market have taken a beating and the shanghai composite index which contains china s biggest companies has slumped 9 3 per cent since the turn of 2022 stagflation is the fear stalking the markets right now and the longer the war rages the more likely this scenario becomes said aj bell s investment director russ mould according to the centre for business and economic research cebr the harm could be drastic it has cut its growth forecasts for the uk for this year from 4 2 per cent to 1 9 per cent costing the economy 51 4billion next year another 42 5billion will be shaved off as output flatlines the cebr is also warning that the economy will tumble into recession with three consecutive quarters of contraction expected in 2023 inflation could hit a 40 year high of 8 7 per cent the cebr warned and instead of falling back towards the bank of england s 2 per cent target later this year it is likely to stay around 7 per cent until early 2023 the effect on households would be devastating many are already feeling the pain as inflation hit a 30 year high of 5 5 per cent in january with those on low incomes edging even closer towards the breadline others forecasts are less pessimistic thomas pugh an economist at accountancy firm rsm thinks the uk will still grow by 3 5 per cent this year but industrial users of gas and electricity such as steel manufacturers and factories may opt to temporarily shut down rather than pay the sky high prices for their energy he said this could threaten thousands of jobs and lead to more shortages of items from metals to computer chips neil shearing chief economist at capital economics said 2022 could be a painful year for britons even if growth doesn t technically grind to a standstill but growth is going to be lower there will be a squeeze on real incomes and inflation will be higher so it will feel like stagflation people won t feel like things are good the events in ukraine will have caused a headache for policymakers at the bank of england who are due to make their latest decision on interest rates next week soaring inflation increases the need that they will have to hike rates in an effort to encourage households and businesses to save rather than spend and bring down prices but this could threaten the economic recovery even more causing firms to hold back on investment and households to hoard their money whatever the decision on threadneedle street britons face a turbulent few months

called chief propagandist of the russian federation and president vladimir putin s spokesperson boris rotenberg an oligarch and an owner of smp bank which also was added to the sdn list on the same day arkady rotenberg an owner of the company psjc mosotrest which has contributed to the construction and maintenance of the kerch bridge between russia and crimea sergei chemezov the ceo of the sanctioned defense company rostec and igor shuvalov chairman of the sanctioned financial institution vnesheconombank veb which will also be barred from swift access starting on march 12 2022 as described below in addition to the above actions taken against oligarchs the state department also designated 22 russian defense related entities which ofac added to the sdn list these sanctions are intended to strike at the core of putin s war machine by targeting a broad range of entities in the defense and aerospace sector that develop and produce fighter aircraft infantry fighting vehicles electronic warfare systems missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles for russia s military this batch of designations expands the focus of earlier u s sanctions which primarily targeted banks and other financial institutions as the conflict in ukraine continues to escalate additional sanctions targeting the defense sector are anticipated u s persons are generally prohibited from engaging in most transactions with sdns absent a specific or general license and all u s assets of sdns are blocked and must be reported to ofac designated natural persons are also subject to a travel ban and all entities 50 or more owned by an sdn are generally treated as if they were also on the sdn list known as the 50 rule in addition any person including a non u s person may be designated for materially assisting sponsoring or providing financial material or technological support for or goods or services to or in support of these sdns ii new general licenses and faqs on march 2 2022 ofac issued four new russia related general licenses to authorize transactions that would otherwise be prohibited general license 9a which updates the prior general license 9 and authorizes certain transactions

sberbank and 5 vtb along with entities owned 50 or more by them until may 25 2022 as with general license 9a any divestment or transfer must be to a non u s person general license 13 which authorizes certain administrative transactions by u s persons such as paying taxes and fees or purchasing certificates and permits with the russian federation s central bank the national wealth fund or the ministry of finance directive 4 entities to the extent such transactions are prohibited by directive 4 under e o 14024 until june 24 2022 these transactions must be ordinarily incident and necessary to day to day operations in the russian federation general license 14 which authorizes certain clearing and settlement transactions with directive 4 entities that are prohibited by directive 4 under e o 14024 in situations where the directive 4 entity s sole function in the transaction is to act as an operator of a clearing and settlement system provided that i there is no transfer of assets to or from any directive 4 entity unless separately authorized and ii no directive 4 entity is either a counterparty or a beneficiary to the transaction unless separately authorized this general license also does not authorize any debit to an account on the books of a u s financial institution of any directive 4 entity on march 3 2022 ofac issued a new general license 15 which authorizes transactions involving any entity owned 50 or more directly or indirectly by russian billionaire and putin affiliate alisher usmanov that is not listed on the sdn list the general license is notable because it functionally exempts entities that are owned by mr usmanov and not otherwise separately sanctioned such as the yacht and plane described above from ofac s 50 rule as explained above ofac also published new frequently asked questions faqs which include clarifications related to directive 4 which was issued on february 28 2022 and as reported in our earlier client alert prohibits all transactions between u s persons and directive 4 entities the faqs clarify that u s persons must reject transactions involving directive 4 entities unless exempt or authorized by ofac but that directive 4 does not impose blocking sanctions as an sdn list designation would the 50 rule also does not apply to directive 4 entities iii swift access denied to seven russian banks and subsidiaries

new york with russia intensifying its war on ukraine killing civilians and triggering a mass refugee crisis president joe biden on tuesday announced a u s ban on imported russian oil critics of russia have said that sanctioning its energy exports would be the best perhaps only way to force moscow to pull back a full embargo would be most effective if it included european allies which are also desperate to stop the violence in ukraine and the danger moscow poses to the continent yet it s far from clear that all of europe would take part in an embargo though britain announced tuesday that it would phase out russian oil imports by year s end unlike the united states europe is deeply reliant on energy it imports from russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter behind saudi arabia while the u s could replace the relatively small amount of fuel it receives from moscow europe could not at least not anytime soon what s more any curbs on russian oil exports could send already skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices ever higher on both continents and further squeeze consumers businesses financial markets and the global economy here is a deeper look what will happen with a u s ban on russian oil amid rising gasoline prices in the u s the average price reached a record 4 17 a gallon on tuesday the biden administration has faced growing pressure to impose further sanctions on russia including a ban on oil imports for now a broad u s european ban appears elusive on monday german chancellor olaf scholz made clear that his country europe s single largest consumer of russian energy has no plans to join in any ban in response u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman hinted that the u s could act alone or with a smaller group of allies file u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman holds a news conference at the nato headquarters in brussels belgium jan 12 2022 not every country has done exactly the same thing sherman said but we have all reached a threshold that is necessary to impose the severe costs that we have all agreed to even with a ban on russian oil the biden administration and congress remain laser focused on bringing down the higher energy costs for american families and our partners stemming from putin s invasion house speaker nancy pelosi said pelosi who has expressed support for a u s ban on russian oil nevertheless also cited biden s action in leading u s allies to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves including 30 million barrels from u s reserves to try to stabilize global markets would a u s only ban on russian oil hurt moscow the impact on russia would likely be minimal the united states imports a small share of russia s oil exports and doesn t buy any of its natural gas last year roughly 8 of u s imports of oil and petroleum products came from russia together the imports totaled the equivalent of 245 million barrels in 2021 which was roughly 672 000 barrels of oil and petroleum products a day but imports of russian oil have been declining rapidly as buyers shunned the fuel file gas prices are displayed at gas stations in englewood new jersey march 7 2022 because the amount of oil the u s imports from russia is modest russia could potentially sell that oil elsewhere perhaps in china or india still it would probably have to sell it at a steep discount because fewer and fewer buyers are accepting russian oil if russia were eventually shut off from the global market rogue countries such as iran and venezuela might be welcomed back as sources of oil said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy such additional sources could in turn potentially stabilize prices a team of biden administration officials were in venezuela over the weekend to discuss energy and other issues white house press secretary jen psaki said she said officials discussed a range of issues including energy security by eliminating some of the demand we re forcing the price of russian oil down and that does reduce revenue to russia said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners in theory it is a way of reducing how much russia earns on every barrel it sells maybe not by a lot but by some the most important question is whether there s going to be more pressure on the other side of the atlantic how could a russian oil ban affect prices the news of the looming u s oil ban sent gasoline prices to their highest level ever recorded with a gallon of regular selling for an average of 4 17 tuesday a month ago oil was selling for about 90 a barrel now prices are surging around 130 a barrel as buyers shun russian crude refiners had already feared being left with oil they couldn t resell if sanctions were imposed shell said tuesday that it would stop buying russian oil and natural gas and shut down its service stations aviation fuels and other operations there days after ukraine s foreign minister criticized the energy giant for continuing to buy russian oil energy analysts warn that prices could go as high to 160 or even 200 a barrel if buyers continue shunning russian crude that trend could send u s gasoline prices past 5 a gallon a scenario that biden and other political figures are desperate to avoid are russian imports already falling the u s oil industry has said it shares the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and is committed to working with the biden administration and congress even without sanctions some u s refiners have severed contracts with russian companies imports of russian crude oil and products have tumbled our industry has taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships with russia and voluntarily limit russian imports said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the oil and gas industry s largest lobbying group preliminary data from the u s energy department shows imports of russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in february the petroleum institute hasn t taken a formal stance on legislation to ban russian oil imports but it says it would comply with any restrictions imposed will europe go along a ban on russian oil and natural gas would be painful for europe russia provides about 40 of europe s natural gas for home heating electricity and industry uses and about a quarter of europe s oil european officials are looking for ways to reduce their dependence but it s going to take time britain s business secretary kwasi kwarteng said his country will use the rest of the year to phase out its imports of oil and petroleum products to give the market businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace russian imports which account for 8 of u k demand file pipes at the landfall facilities of the nord stream 2 gas pipline are pictured in lubmin northern germany feb 15 2022 germany s economy minister robert habeck on tuesday defended the european decision so far to exempt russian energy from sanctions the sanctions have been chosen deliberately so that they impact the russian economy and the putin regime seriously but they also have been chosen deliberately so that we as an economy and a nation can keep them up for a long time habeck said ill considered behavior could lead to exactly the opposite we have maneuvered ourselves into an ever greater dependency on fossil energy imports from russia in the last 20 years habeck said that is not a good state of affairs russian deputy prime minister alexander novak underlined that urgency saying russia would have every right to halt natural gas shipments to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline in retaliation for germany halting the parallel nord stream 2 pipeline which was not yet operating he added that we have not taken this decision and that no one would benefit from this it was a change from earlier russian assurances that they had no intention of cutting off gas to europe oil is easier to replace than natural gas other countries could increase production of oil and ship it to europe but much oil would have to be replaced and this would drive up prices even more because the oil would likely have to travel farther replacing the natural gas that russia provides to europe is likely impossible in the short term most of the natural gas russia provides to europe travels through pipelines to replace it europe would mostly import liquefied natural gas known as lng the continent doesn t have enough pipelines to distribute gas from coastal import facilities to farther reaches of the continent in january two thirds of american lng exports went to europe some ships filled with lng had been heading to asia but turned around to go to europe because buyers there offered to pay higher prices according to s p global platts while u s oil and gas producers could drill for more natural gas its export facilities are already operating at capacity expanding those facilities would take years and billions of dollars
