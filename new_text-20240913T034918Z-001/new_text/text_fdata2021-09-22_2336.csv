san diego sept 21 2021 prnewswire nuvve holding corp nuvve nasdaq nvve a global technology leader accelerating the electrification of transportation through its proprietary vehicle to grid v2g platform announced today that it has earned a competitively awarded contract with sourcewell a cooperative purchasing organization making it quicker and easier for participating agencies to transition to electric vehicle ev fleets while taking advantage of the economic and sustainability benefits of nuvve s intelligent energy platform through this awarded contract government education and nonprofit entities can also leverage nuvve technology and expertise to better manage their ev assets and future proof their investments normally government education and nonprofit agencies looking to electrify their transportation need to go through a burdensome bidding process before receiving approval to begin the electrification of their fleets through nuvve s contract with sourcewell the bidding process has already been completed and awarded thereby affording sourcewell clients immediate access to nuvve s v2g platform and ev charging solutions including level 2 ac chargers and v2g dc fast chargers electrifying fleet vehicles using nuvve s technology presents a fantastic opportunity to slash greenhouse gas emissions within the transportation sector while also making our energy grid cleaner and

transitioning fleets to electric now while optimizing their ev investments for the future nuvve s software platform always prioritizes vehicles having enough charge to perform daily driving duties and work within oem battery warranty limits it also creates cost savings by precisely controlling the flow of energy between ev batteries and charging stations and by charging when utility rates are lower

from these services that vary by region but start at 2 000 per vehicle per year for light duty vans the combination of charging savings and revenue generation reduces the total cost of ownership of an ev to be on par with their combustion engine counterparts over the lifetime of the vehicle furthermore the technology enables evs to act as storage on wheels for renewable energy including solar and

young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

central banks please visit the dailyfx central bank release calendar taper talk at full tilt in context of recent economic data it seems that more progress may have been made towards the fed s goal of seeing jobs growth return to its pre pandemic days august us retail sales proved better than expected and weekly jobless claims data have not suggested significant volatility in the labor market as unemployment insurance benefits have ended it is widely anticipated that the september fed meeting will yield a strong hint that the taper will begin before the end of the year september 2 bostic atlanta president says we ve changed our long run framework to saywe renot going to be preemptive in this but rather we re going to letthe economy continue torun until we see signs of inflation ahead

he already thinks it s time to taper and that if i get to the meeting and continue to feel that way i d be advocating that we should announce a plan for adjusting these purchases in the september

tourism in most districts reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the delta variant september 9 evans chicago president says after the deep and sharp downturn in economic activity last year we have seen strong economic growth however challenges abound as evidenced by widespread bottlenecks in supply chains and labor markets bowman fed governor notes if the data comes in like i expect that it will then it will likely be appropriate for us to begin the process of scaling back our asset purchases this year september 13 harker philadelphia president comments that it may be appropriate to

2014 when the fed signaled its intention to taper its qe program the 2s5s10s butterfly measures non parallel shifts in the us yield curve and if history is accurate this means that intermediate rates should rise faster than short end or long end rates elevated eurodollar spreads and evidence that the us yield curve is moving in a manner consistent with the 2013 2014 period that suggests a relatively more hawkish fed is soon to arrive there are 91 bps of rate hikes discounted through the end of 2023 that s three hikes plus a 64 chance of a fourth 25 bps rate hike and the 2s5s10s butterfly has increased to its highest rate since the fed taper talk began in june and its widest spread of all of 2021 however consistent with recent chatter from fomc officials the first rate hike looks increasingly likely to arrive in late 2022 federal reserve interest rate expectations fed funds futures september 21 2021 table 1 rate hike expectations have been rather consistent for two months ahead of the july fomc meeting markets were pricing in a 68 chance that december 2022 would be the first month that produced a 25 bps rate hike now just ahead of the september fed meeting fed

young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

both our food and animal safety segments including double digit organic sales growth in both units in addition our overall gross margin improved versus last year s first quarter that improvement really was due to a shift in product mix toward our higher margin food safety products and a price increase that we implemented on august 1 so for the first time in seven quarters i think we re beginning to see business return close to a pre covid environment in the us with the loosening of restrictions it s really allowed our sales team to get back out in the field and have face to face meetings with their customers and in the quarter we ve seen our customers get back really gained back the confidence they lost over the past 18 months and start to make purchases that they previously held off on due to the uncertainty of the pandemic now not all the markets we operate in are doing this but i m pleased that the general trend is good these conditions have positively impacted our

neogen analytics platform which helps our customers manage their data and create a streamlined testing process i ve talked about our next gen system before but boy the sales of that system just continue to impress in the years since we ve launched the next gen spoilage detection system it s seen tremendous success in the marketplace it s providing fast reliable diagnostics to customers across many different industries including reselling food beverage nutraceutical and cosmetics compared to the first quarter two years ago sales of that system had nearly doubled and we continue to be really excited about this system it s also worth mentioning our thyrokare supplement for the treating of hypothyroidism in dogs it s regained market share really nicely since we relaunched in february sales of the supplement contributed really to the impressive quarter of our animal care products this quarter it was an excellent quarter for neogen and i m really proud of the tireless work that the members of our team have put in to achieve these results especially through all the challenges that covid 19 has presented and still continues to present our strength continues to be our ability to adapt in changing times we always find new market spaces we expand and then we expand on our mission of protecting the people and animals we care about now i m going to turn it over to steve for some more color on the numbers for the quarter steve steve quinlan chief financial officer thanks john and welcome to everyone listening this morning before i talk about the numbers i d like to echo john s comments about how proud we are of our global team our results this quarter are largely results of their collective hard work earlier today we issued a press release announcing the results for our first quarter which ended on august 31 revenues for the quarter were 128 3 million an increase of 17 compared to 109 3 million in the same quarter a year ago net income for the quarter was 17 1 million or 0 16 a share compared to 15 9 million or 0 15 a share a year ago the earnings per share for both periods reflect our two for one tax split on june 4 of this year in the next few minutes i ll give you some color around the numbers and i ll start by talking about the currency impacts to the business in the first quarter which were positive several currencies in which we operate were stronger against the dollar in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 21 including the pound which was 9 higher and the mexican peso up 11 even the brazilian real which has devalued significantly the last couple of years was 3 higher against the dollar in this year s first quarter revenues were 2 3 million higher on a comparative basis for the first quarter due to these currency tailwinds most of that impact was felt in the food safety segment as the majority of the international businesses report in through this segment revenues for the food safety segment were 62 7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 an increase of 16 compared to 54 2 million in last year s first quarter megazyme our acquisition from last december contributed to the increase excluding these sales organic growth in the food safety segment was 10 the third straight quarter of double digit organic growth for this segment as john mentioned we experienced broad growth across most of our core product lines as our markets have opened up and we ve capitalized on new product introductions our international revenues rose 20 for the quarter aided in part by the currency tailwinds neogen china continued its strong growth posting a 59 increase now they re still recording strong sales of cleaners and disinfectants but most of their growth was in genomics as our commercial dairy swine and sheep customers all significantly increased sample volumes compared to the first quarter in the prior year china also performed outperformed our expectations of sales of megazyme products in the first quarter at neogen latinoamerica 4 revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter resulted in a 16 increase in us dollars due to assistance from the strength in peso this operation posted nice increases in environmental sampling products and culture media our uk operations posted a 9 increase when sales were converted to us dollars had an overall decline of 2 in pounds due to lower sales at quat chem if you remember in the prior year first quarter quat chem recorded large sales of hand sanitizers to the uk government s health ministry which did not recur this year but i am pleased to report growth in our genomics business and with our diagnostic test kits in the uk and europe this is despite issues we ve had exporting into the eu after brexit we do have a plan in place to resolve these issues that will go into effect next month at our brazilian operations 2022 first quarter sales decreased 15 primarily due to a large non recurring insecticides sale to a government health organization in nicaragua in the first quarter of the prior year additionally brazil has experienced an extended drought during the growing season which greatly reduced the corn harvest the reduced volume along with relatively clean crops resulted in a 36 decrease in sales of aflatoxin test kits in brazil our domestic food safety business grew 13 for the quarter accelerating on the growth we started to see last year as many of our customers have resumed to more normal operations as john mentioned we recently launched our next generation accupoint reader used for environmental sampling which contributed to 14 growth in this product line sales of our new soleris instrument which was just launched just over a year ago were flat but the number of new placements we ve had over the past year contributed to a 9 increase in sales of the consumables used in these instruments which detects spoilage organisms in processed food on a worldwide basis sales of our mycotoxin test kits were up 6 with nice growth in our don and zearalenone test kits offset by the decline in aflatoxin test kit sales in brazil that i previously mentioned our line of allergen test kits increased 17 in the first quarter and listeria right now continued to record nice increases with revenues up 51 in the quarter we also experienced strong growth in culture media products which were up 36 with increases in sales to our diagnostics customers and increased business with a vaccine manufacturer about the only ongoing negative in our food safety products this quarter was drug residues which declined 22 as i ve been mentioning for the past few quarters we re struggling with this product line due to the prior year termination of the european distribution agreement and competitive price pressure the animal safety segment recorded revenues of 65 6 million for the quarter up 19 over the 55 1 million achieved in last year s first quarter organic sales were also up 19 with just a small contribution from the standguard acquisitions from the standguard acquisition which occurred in the first quarter of the prior year our animal safety segment is also benefiting from strong markets especially the companion animal and veterinary markets sales of our animal care products increased 28 as higher consumer spending on pets continues we also made big gains in veterinary instruments which rose 52 this category includes needles and syringes and we benefited from strong gains in our private label needle line sales of insect control products increased 23 primarily from growth in the standguard product line and business with restaurants that s recovering after many were closed or have reduced operations in the first quarter of the prior year even though our rodent control products were coming off an extremely strong year in fiscal 2021 we still posted a gain of 5 in those products and our cleaners and disinfectant sales through the animal safety segments increased 6 worldwide genomic revenues increased 14 on growth in beef and dairy cattle and swine and sheep genotyping our lincoln nebraska lab also recorded a large sale for a non recurring plant research project partially offsetting this growth was a decline in sales to the us companion animal market as sample volumes were lower compared to a strong prior year first quarter we believe that this is timing more than a shift in demand and anticipate higher sample volumes in the second quarter and second half of the year in addition to recording nice gains in genomics business at our australian operations we almost doubled revenues of food safety products there as our sales team continues to grow the business we purchased from a former distributor in march of 2020 gross margins were 46 8 for the quarter compared to 46 even in last year s first quarter the higher margins are primarily the result of sales of higher margin products in our food safety segment including incremental sales of megazyme products and strong performance across many of our diagnostic test kit product lines in the prior year quarter food safety segment sales included a higher percentage of lower margin cleaners and disinfectants sold through our quat chem and neogen china operations i m very pleased with our gross margin improvement as we ve absorbed significant increases in supply chain costs this quarter as an example a container shipment from china cost approximately 4 000 prior to the pandemic this cost had increased to about 7 000 by the summer of 2020 and in this quarter our average container shipment rose cost 22 000 overall our freighting costs are up 82 over last year delivery times on these shipments have also increased significantly our operations team teams continue to take actions to mitigate the negative impact of these supply chain issues and raw material cost increases by increase order increasing order sizes to fill containers and gain price breaks qualifying alternative suppliers consolidating outgoing orders and our commercial teams have implemented price increases where appropriate as a comparison to the prior year we also recorded higher labor and employee benefit costs this quarter we ve increased base wages to address labor shortages and are still struggling to fill open positions last year we have taken actions to place some employees temporarily on furlough or reduce work hours and suspended our company 401 k match during the during that first quarter due to the economic uncertainty surrounding covid we also had a significant reduction in health insurance costs in the prior year as doctor visits were restricted and many elective procedures were deferred due to the pandemic in the second quarter of last year we reinstated the 401 k match and most employees returned to their normal work hours additionally our health insurance costs have risen as the loosening of restrictions and resumption of those procedures and doctor visits deferred last year have resulted in significant increases in healthcare expenditures overall operating expenses increased 22 compared to fiscal 21 partly the result of the increased compensation health insurance and 401 k expenses that i just discussed within sales and marketing which was up 24 business travel trade shows and other customer facing activities have begun to resume while still below pre pandemic levels we recorded a 780 000 increase in these areas compared to the prior year first quarter which had minimal travel shipping expenses rose 27 on the higher volume and increased rates g a expense increased 22 primarily due to higher accruals for performance based incentives the impact of senior management hires in the prior fiscal year and a 608 000 increase in amortization expense primarily resulting from the megazyme acquisition and r d expense increased 11 this includes 200 000 of incremental expense at megazyme operating income for the first quarter was 21 7 million up 15 compared to 18 9 million in last year s first quarter with the increased results of the higher sales and gross margins partially offset by higher operating expenses expressed as a percent of revenue operating income was 16 9 compared to 17 3 in last year s first quarter we only recorded 203 000 in interest income despite higher cash balances as interest rates continued to decline this compares to 722 000 in the prior year our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21 4 compared to 19 9 in last year s first quarter last year s effective rate was lower due in large part to 421 000 in tax benefits recognized from the exercise of stock options this year that comparable number was only 15 000 as fewer options were exercised i ve mentioned on previous calls that the volume of option exercises and the gain on those exercise exercises can result in significant fluctuations in the effective tax rate for the comparative periods another factor impacting the higher tax rate for this year s first quarter was a 548 000 one time charge at our uk operations to revalue their deferred tax liabilities the uk enacted a tax rate increase from 19 to 25 in our first fiscal quarter and we were required to adjust our tax liabilities now despite that new rate not going into effect until fiscal 23 on the balance sheet our net receivable balances declined by 4 5 million compared to year end and our days to collect is currently at 59 compared to 61 in the prior year first quarter and 66 days at may 31 we feel good about these strong collections particularly in this challenging environment inventory increased by 1 4 million or 1 we do continue to run with higher levels in fiscal 22 to avoid back orders and delays caused by the continued global supply chain issues we continue to generate cash nicely and produced 23 2 million in cash from operations during the quarter as you can see from yesterday s press release on the capinnovet acquisition we are focused on acquisitions that add to our product portfolio and are good fits with our existing business our teams continue to perform well in today s challenging operating environment and we re grateful for and proud of their efforts with a strong first quarter we ve gained momentum across our markets and as john has indicated we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year ahead we appreciate the support of our shareholders and all those listening on the call today and at this point i ll turn it back to john for further comments john adent chief executive officer and president thanks steve so i think you can see we feel this first quarter was an excellent start to our new year and as steve has lined out we remain hopeful in the face of covid and the delta variant while we see this success as the beginning of a rebound we also recognize that there s still many variables at play that can move one things one way or another we ll talk a little bit along in the question and answer about supply chain because that s something that we pointed out with addition to that the delta variant continues to be a real concern around the world and we re actively monitoring the state of the pandemic as we move forward going into our second quarter though and looking at the rest of the year i m optimistic and excited about the things that are going to come for neogen as steve mentioned if you didn t see yesterday we announced our acquisition of capinnovet it s a companion animal health company that provides really high quality high value pet medications to the vet market i am really excited about this acquisition as it gives us entry into the fast growing 12 billion retail parasiticide market the company is going to be a great fit it s going to go right right inside our animal safety segment and i m pleased to announce that john tatum will be joining neogen as our vp of operations and business development leslie cash she s going to be our new vp of commercial pet health care and capinnovet co founder rudy hauser is going to work with us as a trusted business consultant the integration of megazyme the food diagnostic company that we acquired back in december of 2020 with our sales and marketing team is now complete our staff is fully trained they re really enthusiastic about the new products and they ve already begun to offer these new products and services to our customers across the country and we ve seen a lot of excitement surrounding these diagnostic assay kits and reagents from the market and with these new products now fully incorporated into our product portfolio we can offer our customers more solutions to help them meet their food safety needs we ve also seen significant growth in sales of our neogen analytics food safety and risk management software as a service in the first quarter we have a strategy in place to continue this trend over the course of the fiscal year neogen analytics offers us a great opportunity it pairs with our ansr and accupoint advanced systems and provides increased visibility around the testing that our customers do once the customers have fully integrated the neogen analytics into their environmental monitoring program we immediately see their consumable products increase as they realize the value of our full product portfolio as our customers build and enhance their environmental monitoring programs they benefit from our ability to provide reliable and trusted products that integrate cohesively and build and provide results and statistics that improve their existing procedures our international businesses continue to thrive i m optimistic for our second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year we also have a number of new products and services in our r d pipeline and we ll be really excited to share with those with you later on in the fiscal year over the past year our neogen team has really set us up well for success and i believe that the strength of our first quarter our first quarter results is a culmination of all their hard work and dedication to our mission in uncertain times we ve all rallied together to ensure our business remains innovative diverse and growing i m very proud of the entire team for their perseverance and motivation as we move into our 2022 fiscal year i ll now open up the floor for any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question comes from david westenberg with guggenheim securities please go ahead david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question and great job on the toplines this quarter so i want to start with capinnovet kind of what you re doing strategically there when i think in neogen i think of it more as devices diagnostics in food safety and animal safety i don t necessarily think of it as a drug company so strategically is this something where you kind of see this as an ability to layer on pharmaceutical products or is this more just taking the existing products into the markets that you have right now john adent chief executive officer and president i think thanks for the question david i think it s a little bit of both so our we have a lot of products in animal safety that you wouldn t technically view as diagnostic right whether it s anything in our animal care line whether it s our wound care or needle syringes just many many different things right and this is really going to allow us and thyrokare is another great example right thyrokare which we just relaunched this is really going to allow us to expand our existing portfolio into that segment into the vet channel because we re already there today so we already reach those customers we already have a relationship with them and it s going to allow us to expand that and going forward we re always looking for newer novel or light product mix that s going to allow us to continue to grow the business and profitably grow the bottom line to those existing customer base so we think it s a great way to add accretive margin in sales and really fast growing categories like parasiticides biologicals therapeutics i mean those are great markets having an opportunity to participate in the 12 billion fast growing parasiticide market is interesting david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you very much and then i guess moving on to culture media you had really strong year over year growth can you call it is there any specific products you want to call out in that particular product line that might have done that in terms of how we should think about this in the forward quarters john adent chief executive officer and president i m not sure we had i mean last year we had opportunistic sales to a vaccine manufacturer but really this is just growth and i think this is growth across the line like we talked about that steve and i talked about is we re seeing a bit of a normalization in the u s and our customers kind of coming back online and we re benefiting from that so i don t see any one particular product that really did better than the other so it s really a broad growth across the portfolio david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it and a similar type question on the other side of your business the private label business that you called out in veterinary instruments was there any one time sales or again is this something that we should see continuing on a forward basis and on john adent chief executive officer and president yes no that was not a one time sale that was just products that we had private label for someone that are really starting to take off in the marketplace david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst thank you very much i will get back in queue john adent chief executive officer and president thanks david operator the next question comes from john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kreger william blair analyst hey thanks very much john just another follow up on capinnovet can you tell us any more details on the financials if you re willing to share revenues margins and maybe what you paid for it john adent chief executive officer and president yes it s i won t tell you what we paid it s a small it s a small business it s really it s a pipeline business so they ve got relatively small products today or revenues today because they just launched last year a permethrin and a fipronil product for dogs and cats which is just starting out but that s a big market so if you think about permethrin that s really a like for like with k9 advantix and the fipronil is really a like for like with frontline plus so we re excited to get a hold of that this group didn t have much of a sales team it was more of a developmental shop so we re excited about that and they ve got products in the pipeline that get us pretty excited so and you know what those margins look like john you re always comparing me to pharmaceutical companies anyway so you know that market pretty well john kreger william blair analyst all right that s helpful and john do you expect to put r d dollars to work there to bring new products out after those two or not necessarily john adent chief executive officer and president yes i think so i mean that s why i m excited about it s not only the lime but the team we have coming over those guys john and leslie have been in that market for a long long time rudy started that business so having their experience to help us navigate and look at those opportunities is a big benefit for us and in our management team we added doug jones doug s got a lot of experience in this marketplace we ve really strengthened the team top to bottom kind of in our companion animal segment that makes us very comfortable getting into this market and growing it john kreger william blair analyst great thanks and then one last one can you talk a little bit about your outlook for the food safety business are in particular the institutional side are things kind of getting back to normal there are we still in a fairly steep ramp in terms of back to school and restaurants reopening and the like john adent chief executive officer and president i think we re getting back and again i prefaced it in the u s right because we do business in so many different places that it s hard to say that we re coming on it because it really depends by region but in the u s we are starting to see a return to normal no we can debate whether or not we should be right but i think we are and you ve seen it kind of in the last three quarters we ve had really strong growth in the last three quarters across the businesses and in the food safety segment so i think like i said i m optimistic about the rest of this fiscal year and we re really pushing hard and the team is doing a good job john kreger william blair analyst and you make a good point about geography should we assume your non u s food safety businesses perhaps lag in the coming year or do you expect strong growth there too john adent chief executive officer and president i expect strong growth there it s just they re not out of the woods around covid john i mean we ve got australia continues to do lockdowns often on china is continuing to do lockdowns india is doing that europe moves back and forth depending on which country we re in so but during that environment last year we also grew and our expectation is to grow so i m just it s not going to be easy john kreger william blair analyst great thank you operator the next question is a follow up from david westenberg from guggenheim securities please go ahead david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hey thank you for taking the follow ups so can you talk a little bit about more the labor headwinds that you said continue to persist is this a global issue or is there anything like specific to maybe lansing or lexington or any other specific stuff you might need to call out john adent chief executive officer and president no this is a david this is a global not only global but it s definitely a u s problem i saw something the other day that talked about participation in the labor force between men between 18 and 64 and however the last 30 years it s dropped 26 and the question was how do these people survive right and so there was a lot of consternation around that but what we re we re seeing a couple of things steve talked about supply chain and you guys cover a lot of businesses the supply chain disruptions are real and it s a challenge and it s an everyday challenge and it s not just freight cost it s getting stuff in and when hernan came you think about on the animal safety side when hurricane ida came and shut down the ports down in new orleans and in the south you instantly saw the grain prices drop you couple that kind of with getting ships and getting containers is what we re seeing i mean the rise in the container cost is crazy i mean if you re moving low volume products or low value products you could have freight be more than what the product is worth that s nuts so those are things that are real and we do address it so we are raising wages but we re also doing it in a way where we re trying to be using technology to be more efficient so where we may have had 10 people at 50 000 we re going to do eight people at 65 000 where you re going to see that your total cost don t change that much but there are some cases on the hourlies where we ve just got to get competitive to get people in the door and get product out the door david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you and then maybe if i can do one last one on trends in china i know it s been a long china and india have been a long term focus for you do you have any can you give us maybe any color in terms of percent of revenue profitability in that area and growth and then as we look at china in the future are there any regulatory geopolitical or any kind of procurement risks that could present itself from that could stop from getting your aspirational goals in that specific market and i ll stop after that question because i realize that one is pretty intense john adent chief executive officer and president yes i ll let steve do the first part but on the second david yes of course i mean i think if you watch what xi jinping is doing over in china and kind of the relation between the u s and china it s going to be interesting and i can t forecast what is going to happen there but what we re going to do is we re going to make sure that we are able to adapt and move quickly around those existing markets i mean i think yesterday s stock market dropped because of the real estate business in china shows everything is connected right so it s an important market for us on the they re still having challenges with african swine fever you re still seeing hog prices severely depressed it s just a very challenging time for them right now but our business has been good and i ll let steve give you the numbers steve quinlan chief financial officer yes and david i think your question first was what percent they are of our overall sales and it s been growing very nicely for us but our growth across the world has been nice as well so china is still less than 5 of our overall revenues as that growth has occurred in china profitability has also grown very nicely we re very happy with the profit performance of china relative to our other businesses david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you for taking the questions operator this concludes our question and answer session my apologies we have one more question a follow up from john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kreger william blair analyst hey thanks thank you just a few follow ups i think these are both steve for you can you just clarify that i think the total revenue growth of in the quarter of 17 can you just sort of break down what that would have been on a constant currency basis and then constant currency organic just to make sure there s no confusion there steve quinlan chief financial officer sure so in constant currency john our revenue would have been 15 and organic that number is 12 john adent chief executive officer and president that s still good john kreger william blair analyst that s impressive yeah and then one last one john i think brazil was pretty weak and if i m remembering correctly last quarter it was quite good and typically i think they ve been very strong on the animal export side can you just talk a little bit about why it was weak and what you expect in the coming year john adent chief executive officer and president yes so one of it was as steve mentioned that non recurring insecticide bid in nicaragua but the other big part of it was we had really nice sales of aflatoxin test kits last year and i don t know if you ve seen but john the first core harvest in brazil is a wreck i mean they had such a drought that it s down 30 40 and so brazil is actually the south has always imported corn but the north the bigger regions have not but now they re starting to import corn so it really was a function of the size of the corn harvest because there just wasn t that much corn to test now again this is because of the way the country is spread over the northern and southern hemispheres this is their first corn harvest the second corn harvest is bigger and they re going to start planting now but this first corn harvest was pretty rough on them now we think that s an opportunity right because now if they re going to be importing we ve got with our acquisition in argentina and uruguay and chile they re going to be pulling from the southern cone we think that s an opportunity to get the business on that side from those countries so that s what we re focused on john kreger william blair analyst okay so it sounds like your outlook for brazil is better for the rest of the year than what you saw in q1 john adent chief executive officer and president i mean they ve got their challenges because of that but i don t know if it s going to be it s not going to be a big hockey stick bounce back john i mean that corn harvest goes through a couple of quarters so it s going to have a bit of a drag but the total international business like you saw for this quarter we re optimistic they re going to do really well the whole business for next quarter john kreger william blair analyst okay thanks much john adent chief executive officer and president you bet thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to john adent for any closing remarks john adent chief executive officer and president thanks betsy well thank you everyone for joining the call and being big supporters of neogen just a reminder if you haven t already please get your proxy votes in for annual shareholders meeting which is going to be on thursday october 7 and we ll talk to you all again in december thank you operator duration 40 minutes call participants john adent chief executive officer and president steve quinlan chief financial officer david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst john kreger william blair analyst more neog analysis all earnings call transcripts
it has begun the greatest financial meltdown in history is now underway the collapse of one of china s biggest property developers evergrande has triggered a stock market crash in hong kong and it is still threatening to spark a major default crisis that can derail the chinese economy and spill over global markets creating a cascade of systemic failures that will result in nothing less than a financial disaster of epic proportions chinese traders are getting out of the market while they still can a major sell off has started as investors grew increasingly more worried that evergrande would default its gigantic loan debt just yesterday the hong kong stock market crashed by another 13 percent and it is now on track to close at its lowest market cap ever given that a bankruptcy of this proportion can wipe out hundreds of billions in equity even worse it can spark a default contagion that would put millions of chinese companies at risk of bankruptcy just as well and as more and more traders panic about the rapidly spreading contagion other sectors that were normally immune to china s property woes are also facing significant drops financial analysts are alarmed that its default crisis will soon spread to the rest of the world last week chinese officials announced that major lenders should not expect repayment that was already a sign that the company would start its default process and today s silence has given further proof in a recent note goldman estimated that the potential impact of the residential and commercial real estate collapse in china s growth could be devastating not only for china but for the entire world it could result in the sharpest gdp drop in decades goldman warned that if a default occurred without clear ring fencing of the spillovers to other parts of the economy then the outcome would be much more threatening with the chinese gdp collapsing as much as 4 1 percent while housing activity plunges and financial conditions tighten right now the worsening of the crisis is depending on the acceleration of the current selloff while investors expect the government to unleash a trillion dollar liquidity injection to ease the downfall moreover while investors get more and more nervous about the financial strains of the chinese real estate market they also set off a crash on the cryptocurrency market with bitcoin tumbling by more than 7 percent on monday as a huge wave of fear over a weaker chinese economic growth sweeps through global markets with investors just realizing how big are the consequences for its domestic peers and international commodity prices contagion has begun to move beyond stocks and sent us equity futures below 4380 yesterday the dow jones industrial average finished down 614 points or 1 8 recording its worst day of trading since july furthermore caterpillar and goldman sachs were the benchmark s biggest losers of the day as investors closely watched the outlook for the federal reserve to start tapering on its bond purchasing program at its lowest point of the day the dow fell 972 points the nasdaq also faced a decline and closed down 2 2 amongst the top three biggest losers were the chinese companies pinduoduo baidu and jd com the s p 500 plunged by 1 7 it was one of the worst days of trading since may the entire financial system is being shaken to the core because what is happening in china right now will ultimately have profound repercussions across all of the world s major economies including america given that global economic growth is directly linked with china s economic strength and the country was the only major economy to expand last year the prospect for a global economic rebound from last year s health crisis induced recession has been remarkably shrunk according to the international monetary fund china alone would contribute with over a fifth of the increase in the world s gross domestic product in the five years to 2026 this means that we re effectively on the verge of the most devastating financial crisis in world history the one experts have been warning about for months all events are converging to what may be the simultaneous collapse of the chinese and the u s economy needless to say this will not end well we re about to witness the biggest collective wealth loss ever recorded as the chinese stock market crash has just begun it s only a matter of time before the monstrous u s stock market bubble finally bursts beware the risks the point of no return is just at the corner we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

morning and welcome to our regular quarterly conference call for investors and analysts today we re going to be reporting on the first quarter of our 2022 fiscal year which ended on august 31 as usual some of the statements made here today could be termed as forward looking statements so these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ from those that we discuss today the risks associated with our business are covered in part in the company s form 10 k as filed with the securities and exchange commission in addition to those of you joining us by live telephone conference i also want to welcome those of you on the internet following our prepared comments this morning we will entertain questions from participants who joined this live conference with me this morning is steve quinlan our chief financial officer who will provide some additional details on our results for the quarter as you saw in our press release this morning we re pleased to report a strong first quarter to our 2022 fiscal year we had a 17 revenue growth across our worldwide business compared to the prior year s first quarter we also had double digit growth in both our food and animal safety segments including double digit organic sales growth in both units in addition our overall gross margin improved versus last year s first quarter that improvement really was due to a shift in product mix toward our higher margin food safety products and a price increase that we implemented on august 1 so for the first time in seven quarters i think we re beginning to see business return close to a pre covid environment in the us with the loosening of restrictions it s really allowed our sales team to get back out in the field and have face to face meetings with their customers and in the quarter we ve seen our customers get back really gained back the confidence they lost over the past 18 months and start to make purchases that they previously held off on due to the uncertainty of the pandemic now not all the markets we operate in are doing this but i m pleased that the general trend is good these conditions have positively impacted our core product lines including food allergens pathogens our natural toxin test kits as the sales of these products we think have returned to our pre covid levels i m also happy because our new products continue to succeed in the marketplace in this first quarter our accupoint advanced next gen atp sanitation monitoring system which we launched in may of 2021 has continued to gain market share this quarter with really impressive sales growth the portable handheld system it quickly and effectively detects atp as a measure of the cleanness of a facility and it s nice because it connects to our neogen analytics platform which helps our customers manage their data and create a streamlined testing process i ve talked about our next gen system before but boy the sales of that system just continue to impress in the years since we ve launched the next gen spoilage detection system it s seen tremendous success in the marketplace it s providing fast reliable diagnostics to customers across many different industries including reselling food beverage nutraceutical and cosmetics compared to the first quarter two years ago sales of that system had nearly doubled and we continue to be really excited about this system it s also worth mentioning our thyrokare supplement for the treating of hypothyroidism in dogs it s regained market share really nicely since we relaunched in february sales of the supplement contributed really to the impressive quarter of our animal care products this quarter it was an excellent quarter for neogen and i m really proud of the tireless work that the members of our team have put in to achieve these results especially through all the challenges that covid 19 has presented and still continues to present our strength continues to be our ability to adapt in changing times we always find new market spaces we expand and then we expand on our mission of protecting the people and animals we care about now i m going to turn it over to steve for some more color on the numbers for the quarter steve steve quinlan chief financial officer thanks john and welcome to everyone listening this morning before i talk about the numbers i d like to echo john s comments about how proud we are of our global team our results this quarter are largely results of their collective hard work earlier today we issued a press release announcing the results for our first quarter which ended on august 31 revenues for the quarter were 128 3 million an increase of 17 compared to 109 3 million in the same quarter a year ago net income for the quarter was 17 1 million or 0 16 a share compared to 15 9 million or 0 15 a share a year ago the earnings per share for both periods reflect our two for one tax split on june 4 of this year in the next few minutes i ll give you some color around the numbers and i ll start by talking about the currency impacts to the business in the first quarter which were positive several currencies in which we operate were stronger against the dollar in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 21 including the pound which was 9 higher and the mexican peso up 11 even the brazilian real which has devalued significantly the last couple of years was 3 higher against the dollar in this year s first quarter revenues were 2 3 million higher on a comparative basis for the first quarter due to these currency tailwinds most of that impact was felt in the food safety segment as the majority of the international businesses report in through this segment revenues for the food safety segment were 62 7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 an increase of 16 compared to 54 2 million in last year s first quarter megazyme our acquisition from last december contributed to the increase excluding these sales organic growth in the food safety segment was 10 the third straight quarter of double digit organic growth for this segment as john mentioned we experienced broad growth across most of our core product lines as our markets have opened up and we ve capitalized on new product introductions our international revenues rose 20 for the quarter aided in part by the currency tailwinds neogen china continued its strong growth posting a 59 increase now they re still recording strong sales of cleaners and disinfectants but most of their growth was in genomics as our commercial dairy swine and sheep customers all significantly increased sample volumes compared to the first quarter in the prior year china also performed outperformed our expectations of sales of megazyme products in the first quarter at neogen latinoamerica 4 revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter resulted in a 16 increase in us dollars due to assistance from the strength in peso this operation posted nice increases in environmental sampling products and culture media our uk operations posted a 9 increase when sales were converted to us dollars had an overall decline of 2 in pounds due to lower sales at quat chem if you remember in the prior year first quarter quat chem recorded large sales of hand sanitizers to the uk government s health ministry which did not recur this year but i am pleased to report growth in our genomics business and with our diagnostic test kits in the uk and europe this is despite issues we ve had exporting into the eu after brexit we do have a plan in place to resolve these issues that will go into effect next month at our brazilian operations 2022 first quarter sales decreased 15 primarily due to a large non recurring insecticides sale to a government health organization in nicaragua in the first quarter of the prior year additionally brazil has experienced an extended drought during the growing season which greatly reduced the corn harvest the reduced volume along with relatively clean crops resulted in a 36 decrease in sales of aflatoxin test kits in brazil our domestic food safety business grew 13 for the quarter accelerating on the growth we started to see last year as many of our customers have resumed to more normal operations as john mentioned we recently launched our next generation accupoint reader used for environmental sampling which contributed to 14 growth in this product line sales of our new soleris instrument which was just launched just over a year ago were flat but the number of new placements we ve had over the past year contributed to a 9 increase in sales of the consumables used in these instruments which detects spoilage organisms in processed food on a worldwide basis sales of our mycotoxin test kits were up 6 with nice growth in our don and zearalenone test kits offset by the decline in aflatoxin test kit sales in brazil that i previously mentioned our line of allergen test kits increased 17 in the first quarter and listeria right now continued to record nice increases with revenues up 51 in the quarter we also experienced strong growth in culture media products which were up 36 with increases in sales to our diagnostics customers and increased business with a vaccine manufacturer about the only ongoing negative in our food safety products this quarter was drug residues which declined 22 as i ve been mentioning for the past few quarters we re struggling with this product line due to the prior year termination of the european distribution agreement and competitive price pressure the animal safety segment recorded revenues of 65 6 million for the quarter up 19 over the 55 1 million achieved in last year s first quarter organic sales were also up 19 with just a small contribution from the standguard acquisitions from the standguard acquisition which occurred in the first quarter of the prior year our animal safety segment is also benefiting from strong markets especially the companion animal and veterinary markets sales of our animal care products increased 28 as higher consumer spending on pets continues we also made big gains in veterinary instruments which rose 52 this category includes needles and syringes and we benefited from strong gains in our private label needle line sales of insect control products increased 23 primarily from growth in the standguard product line and business with restaurants that s recovering after many were closed or have reduced operations in the first quarter of the prior year even though our rodent control products were coming off an extremely strong year in fiscal 2021 we still posted a gain of 5 in those products and our cleaners and disinfectant sales through the animal safety segments increased 6 worldwide genomic revenues increased 14 on growth in beef and dairy cattle and swine and sheep genotyping our lincoln nebraska lab also recorded a large sale for a non recurring plant research project partially offsetting this growth was a decline in sales to the us companion animal market as sample volumes were lower compared to a strong prior year first quarter we believe that this is timing more than a shift in demand and anticipate higher sample volumes in the second quarter and second half of the year in addition to recording nice gains in genomics business at our australian operations we almost doubled revenues of food safety products there as our sales team continues to grow the business we purchased from a former distributor in march of 2020 gross margins were 46 8 for the quarter compared to 46 even in last year s first quarter the higher margins are primarily the result of sales of higher margin products in our food safety segment including incremental sales of megazyme products and strong performance across many of our diagnostic test kit product lines in the prior year quarter food safety segment sales included a higher percentage of lower margin cleaners and disinfectants sold through our quat chem and neogen china operations i m very pleased with our gross margin improvement as we ve absorbed significant increases in supply chain costs this quarter as an example a container shipment from china cost approximately 4 000 prior to the pandemic this cost had increased to about 7 000 by the summer of 2020 and in this quarter our average container shipment rose cost 22 000 overall our freighting costs are up 82 over last year delivery times on these shipments have also increased significantly our operations team teams continue to take actions to mitigate the negative impact of these supply chain issues and raw material cost increases by increase order increasing order sizes to fill containers and gain price breaks qualifying alternative suppliers consolidating outgoing orders and our commercial teams have implemented price increases where appropriate as a comparison to the prior year we also recorded higher labor and employee benefit costs this quarter we ve increased base wages to address labor shortages and are still struggling to fill open positions last year we have taken actions to place some employees temporarily on furlough or reduce work hours and suspended our company 401 k match during the during that first quarter due to the economic uncertainty surrounding covid we also had a significant reduction in health insurance costs in the prior year as doctor visits were restricted and many elective procedures were deferred due to the pandemic in the second quarter of last year we reinstated the 401 k match and most employees returned to their normal work hours additionally our health insurance costs have risen as the loosening of restrictions and resumption of those procedures and doctor visits deferred last year have resulted in significant increases in healthcare expenditures overall operating expenses increased 22 compared to fiscal 21 partly the result of the increased compensation health insurance and 401 k expenses that i just discussed within sales and marketing which was up 24 business travel trade shows and other customer facing activities have begun to resume while still below pre pandemic levels we recorded a 780 000 increase in these areas compared to the prior year first quarter which had minimal travel shipping expenses rose 27 on the higher volume and increased rates g a expense increased 22 primarily due to higher accruals for performance based incentives the impact of senior management hires in the prior fiscal year and a 608 000 increase in amortization expense primarily resulting from the megazyme acquisition and r d expense increased 11 this includes 200 000 of incremental expense at megazyme operating income for the first quarter was 21 7 million up 15 compared to 18 9 million in last year s first quarter with the increased results of the higher sales and gross margins partially offset by higher operating expenses expressed as a percent of revenue operating income was 16 9 compared to 17 3 in last year s first quarter we only recorded 203 000 in interest income despite higher cash balances as interest rates continued to decline this compares to 722 000 in the prior year our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21 4 compared to 19 9 in last year s first quarter last year s effective rate was lower due in large part to 421 000 in tax benefits recognized from the exercise of stock options this year that comparable number was only 15 000 as fewer options were exercised i ve mentioned on previous calls that the volume of option exercises and the gain on those exercise exercises can result in significant fluctuations in the effective tax rate for the comparative periods another factor impacting the higher tax rate for this year s first quarter was a 548 000 one time charge at our uk operations to revalue their deferred tax liabilities the uk enacted a tax rate increase from 19 to 25 in our first fiscal quarter and we were required to adjust our tax liabilities now despite that new rate not going into effect until fiscal 23 on the balance sheet our net receivable balances declined by 4 5 million compared to year end and our days to collect is currently at 59 compared to 61 in the prior year first quarter and 66 days at may 31 we feel good about these strong collections particularly in this challenging environment inventory increased by 1 4 million or 1 we do continue to run with higher levels in fiscal 22 to avoid back orders and delays caused by the continued global supply chain issues we continue to generate cash nicely and produced 23 2 million in cash from operations during the quarter as you can see from yesterday s press release on the capinnovet acquisition we are focused on acquisitions that add to our product portfolio and are good fits with our existing business our teams continue to perform well in today s challenging operating environment and we re grateful for and proud of their efforts with a strong first quarter we ve gained momentum across our markets and as john has indicated we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year ahead we appreciate the support of our shareholders and all those listening on the call today and at this point i ll turn it back to john for further comments john adent chief executive officer and president thanks steve so i think you can see we feel this first quarter was an excellent start to our new year and as steve has lined out we remain hopeful in the face of covid and the delta variant while we see this success as the beginning of a rebound we also recognize that there s still many variables at play that can move one things one way or another we ll talk a little bit along in the question and answer about supply chain because that s something that we pointed out with addition to that the delta variant continues to be a real concern around the world and we re actively monitoring the state of the pandemic as we move forward going into our second quarter though and looking at the rest of the year i m optimistic and excited about the things that are going to come for neogen as steve mentioned if you didn t see yesterday we announced our acquisition of capinnovet it s a companion animal health company that provides really high quality high value pet medications to the vet market i am really excited about this acquisition as it gives us entry into the fast growing 12 billion retail parasiticide market the company is going to be a great fit it s going to go right right inside our animal safety segment and i m pleased to announce that john tatum will be joining neogen as our vp of operations and business development leslie cash she s going to be our new vp of commercial pet health care and capinnovet co founder rudy hauser is going to work with us as a trusted business consultant the integration of megazyme the food diagnostic company that we acquired back in december of 2020 with our sales and marketing team is now complete our staff is fully trained they re really enthusiastic about the new products and they ve already begun to offer these new products and services to our customers across the country and we ve seen a lot of excitement surrounding these diagnostic assay kits and reagents from the market and with these new products now fully incorporated into our product portfolio we can offer our customers more solutions to help them meet their food safety needs we ve also seen significant growth in sales of our neogen analytics food safety and risk management software as a service in the first quarter we have a strategy in place to continue this trend over the course of the fiscal year neogen analytics offers us a great opportunity it pairs with our ansr and accupoint advanced systems and provides increased visibility around the testing that our customers do once the customers have fully integrated the neogen analytics into their environmental monitoring program we immediately see their consumable products increase as they realize the value of our full product portfolio as our customers build and enhance their environmental monitoring programs they benefit from our ability to provide reliable and trusted products that integrate cohesively and build and provide results and statistics that improve their existing procedures our international businesses continue to thrive i m optimistic for our second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year we also have a number of new products and services in our r d pipeline and we ll be really excited to share with those with you later on in the fiscal year over the past year our neogen team has really set us up well for success and i believe that the strength of our first quarter our first quarter results is a culmination of all their hard work and dedication to our mission in uncertain times we ve all rallied together to ensure our business remains innovative diverse and growing i m very proud of the entire team for their perseverance and motivation as we move into our 2022 fiscal year i ll now open up the floor for any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question comes from david westenberg with guggenheim securities please go ahead david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question and great job on the toplines this quarter so i want to start with capinnovet kind of what you re doing strategically there when i think in neogen i think of it more as devices diagnostics in food safety and animal safety i don t necessarily think of it as a drug company so strategically is this something where you kind of see this as an ability to layer on pharmaceutical products or is this more just taking the existing products into the markets that you have right now john adent chief executive officer and president i think thanks for the question david i think it s a little bit of both so our we have a lot of products in animal safety that you wouldn t technically view as diagnostic right whether it s anything in our animal care line whether it s our wound care or needle syringes just many many different things right and this is really going to allow us and thyrokare is another great example right thyrokare which we just relaunched this is really going to allow us to expand our existing portfolio into that segment into the vet channel because we re already there today so we already reach those customers we already have a relationship with them and it s going to allow us to expand that and going forward we re always looking for newer novel or light product mix that s going to allow us to continue to grow the business and profitably grow the bottom line to those existing customer base so we think it s a great way to add accretive margin in sales and really fast growing categories like parasiticides biologicals therapeutics i mean those are great markets having an opportunity to participate in the 12 billion fast growing parasiticide market is interesting david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you very much and then i guess moving on to culture media you had really strong year over year growth can you call it is there any specific products you want to call out in that particular product line that might have done that in terms of how we should think about this in the forward quarters john adent chief executive officer and president i m not sure we had i mean last year we had opportunistic sales to a vaccine manufacturer but really this is just growth and i think this is growth across the line like we talked about that steve and i talked about is we re seeing a bit of a normalization in the u s and our customers kind of coming back online and we re benefiting from that so i don t see any one particular product that really did better than the other so it s really a broad growth across the portfolio david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it and a similar type question on the other side of your business the private label business that you called out in veterinary instruments was there any one time sales or again is this something that we should see continuing on a forward basis and on john adent chief executive officer and president yes no that was not a one time sale that was just products that we had private label for someone that are really starting to take off in the marketplace david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst thank you very much i will get back in queue john adent chief executive officer and president thanks david operator the next question comes from john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kreger william blair analyst hey thanks very much john just another follow up on capinnovet can you tell us any more details on the financials if you re willing to share revenues margins and maybe what you paid for it john adent chief executive officer and president yes it s i won t tell you what we paid it s a small it s a small business it s really it s a pipeline business so they ve got relatively small products today or revenues today because they just launched last year a permethrin and a fipronil product for dogs and cats which is just starting out but that s a big market so if you think about permethrin that s really a like for like with k9 advantix and the fipronil is really a like for like with frontline plus so we re excited to get a hold of that this group didn t have much of a sales team it was more of a developmental shop so we re excited about that and they ve got products in the pipeline that get us pretty excited so and you know what those margins look like john you re always comparing me to pharmaceutical companies anyway so you know that market pretty well john kreger william blair analyst all right that s helpful and john do you expect to put r d dollars to work there to bring new products out after those two or not necessarily john adent chief executive officer and president yes i think so i mean that s why i m excited about it s not only the lime but the team we have coming over those guys john and leslie have been in that market for a long long time rudy started that business so having their experience to help us navigate and look at those opportunities is a big benefit for us and in our management team we added doug jones doug s got a lot of experience in this marketplace we ve really strengthened the team top to bottom kind of in our companion animal segment that makes us very comfortable getting into this market and growing it john kreger william blair analyst great thanks and then one last one can you talk a little bit about your outlook for the food safety business are in particular the institutional side are things kind of getting back to normal there are we still in a fairly steep ramp in terms of back to school and restaurants reopening and the like john adent chief executive officer and president i think we re getting back and again i prefaced it in the u s right because we do business in so many different places that it s hard to say that we re coming on it because it really depends by region but in the u s we are starting to see a return to normal no we can debate whether or not we should be right but i think we are and you ve seen it kind of in the last three quarters we ve had really strong growth in the last three quarters across the businesses and in the food safety segment so i think like i said i m optimistic about the rest of this fiscal year and we re really pushing hard and the team is doing a good job john kreger william blair analyst and you make a good point about geography should we assume your non u s food safety businesses perhaps lag in the coming year or do you expect strong growth there too john adent chief executive officer and president i expect strong growth there it s just they re not out of the woods around covid john i mean we ve got australia continues to do lockdowns often on china is continuing to do lockdowns india is doing that europe moves back and forth depending on which country we re in so but during that environment last year we also grew and our expectation is to grow so i m just it s not going to be easy john kreger william blair analyst great thank you operator the next question is a follow up from david westenberg from guggenheim securities please go ahead david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hey thank you for taking the follow ups so can you talk a little bit about more the labor headwinds that you said continue to persist is this a global issue or is there anything like specific to maybe lansing or lexington or any other specific stuff you might need to call out john adent chief executive officer and president no this is a david this is a global not only global but it s definitely a u s problem i saw something the other day that talked about participation in the labor force between men between 18 and 64 and however the last 30 years it s dropped 26 and the question was how do these people survive right and so there was a lot of consternation around that but what we re we re seeing a couple of things steve talked about supply chain and you guys cover a lot of businesses the supply chain disruptions are real and it s a challenge and it s an everyday challenge and it s not just freight cost it s getting stuff in and when hernan came you think about on the animal safety side when hurricane ida came and shut down the ports down in new orleans and in the south you instantly saw the grain prices drop you couple that kind of with getting ships and getting containers is what we re seeing i mean the rise in the container cost is crazy i mean if you re moving low volume products or low value products you could have freight be more than what the product is worth that s nuts so those are things that are real and we do address it so we are raising wages but we re also doing it in a way where we re trying to be using technology to be more efficient so where we may have had 10 people at 50 000 we re going to do eight people at 65 000 where you re going to see that your total cost don t change that much but there are some cases on the hourlies where we ve just got to get competitive to get people in the door and get product out the door david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you and then maybe if i can do one last one on trends in china i know it s been a long china and india have been a long term focus for you do you have any can you give us maybe any color in terms of percent of revenue profitability in that area and growth and then as we look at china in the future are there any regulatory geopolitical or any kind of procurement risks that could present itself from that could stop from getting your aspirational goals in that specific market and i ll stop after that question because i realize that one is pretty intense john adent chief executive officer and president yes i ll let steve do the first part but on the second david yes of course i mean i think if you watch what xi jinping is doing over in china and kind of the relation between the u s and china it s going to be interesting and i can t forecast what is going to happen there but what we re going to do is we re going to make sure that we are able to adapt and move quickly around those existing markets i mean i think yesterday s stock market dropped because of the real estate business in china shows everything is connected right so it s an important market for us on the they re still having challenges with african swine fever you re still seeing hog prices severely depressed it s just a very challenging time for them right now but our business has been good and i ll let steve give you the numbers steve quinlan chief financial officer yes and david i think your question first was what percent they are of our overall sales and it s been growing very nicely for us but our growth across the world has been nice as well so china is still less than 5 of our overall revenues as that growth has occurred in china profitability has also grown very nicely we re very happy with the profit performance of china relative to our other businesses david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you for taking the questions operator this concludes our question and answer session my apologies we have one more question a follow up from john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kreger william blair analyst hey thanks thank you just a few follow ups i think these are both steve for you can you just clarify that i think the total revenue growth of in the quarter of 17 can you just sort of break down what that would have been on a constant currency basis and then constant currency organic just to make sure there s no confusion there steve quinlan chief financial officer sure so in constant currency john our revenue would have been 15 and organic that number is 12 john adent chief executive officer and president that s still good john kreger william blair analyst that s impressive yeah and then one last one john i think brazil was pretty weak and if i m remembering correctly last quarter it was quite good and typically i think they ve been very strong on the animal export side can you just talk a little bit about why it was weak and what you expect in the coming year john adent chief executive officer and president yes so one of it was as steve mentioned that non recurring insecticide bid in nicaragua but the other big part of it was we had really nice sales of aflatoxin test kits last year and i don t know if you ve seen but john the first core harvest in brazil is a wreck i mean they had such a drought that it s down 30 40 and so brazil is actually the south has always imported corn but the north the bigger regions have not but now they re starting to import corn so it really was a function of the size of the corn harvest because there just wasn t that much corn to test now again this is because of the way the country is spread over the northern and southern hemispheres this is their first corn harvest the second corn harvest is bigger and they re going to start planting now but this first corn harvest was pretty rough on them now we think that s an opportunity right because now if they re going to be importing we ve got with our acquisition in argentina and uruguay and chile they re going to be pulling from the southern cone we think that s an opportunity to get the business on that side from those countries so that s what we re focused on john kreger william blair analyst okay so it sounds like your outlook for brazil is better for the rest of the year than what you saw in q1 john adent chief executive officer and president i mean they ve got their challenges because of that but i don t know if it s going to be it s not going to be a big hockey stick bounce back john i mean that corn harvest goes through a couple of quarters so it s going to have a bit of a drag but the total international business like you saw for this quarter we re optimistic

click to enlarge photo via manchin senate gov shakedown whether biden can sway manchin on the filibuster remains to be seen this long miserable summer ends tuesday not a moment too soon for president joe biden not all of his problems have been his own doing not entirely at least afghanistan s collapse last month had been all but inevitable since the trump administration signed the doha agreement in february 2020 effectively surrendering the country to the taliban even so scenes of the chaotic withdrawal capped off by the military drone murdering children will haunt the administration for years to come the covid 19 delta variant spread unfettered largely because of republican vaccine resistance with gop governors in mississippi florida texas alabama south dakota and elsewhere granting the virus a license to kill and in florida prohibiting local governments or private businesses from even trying to stop it as the delta variant flourished the economic recovery slowed with his approval ratings battered biden s domestic agenda is now imperiled by his own party s timidity and deference to institutional anachronisms its insistence on playing inside the procedural lines it has drawn which gives cover to knee jerk obstructionism and camera seeking egoism ultimately everything comes back to the filibuster because senate democrats most vocally sens joe manchin and kyrsten sinema though they re not alone have refused to eliminate or reform the 60 vote threshold for all non budgetary legislation that hands sen mitch mcconnell a veto manchin and sinema spent the spring negotiating down biden s 2 trillion infrastructure deal to 1 2 trillion caving to republican demands to excise key climate mass transit and revenue provisions to get republican votes the infrastructure bill passed a victory for comity though the legislation doesn t come close to addressing the country s needs progressives were nonplussed in the house they say they ll only support the infrastructure bill if it s paired with biden s 10 year budget plan which spends 3 5 trillion on climate and social programs as a reconciliation bill it can circumvent the filibuster and pass the senate with only democrats but it needs all 50 of them and it needs house democrats with their slim majority to stick together too here come the power plays last week the congressional progressive caucus declared that it has the votes to kill the infrastructure deal if it s separated from the reconciliation package once infrastructure passes after all progressives will have no leverage to ensure that moderates toe the line on reconciliation but moderates say they ll block reconciliation if house speaker nancy pelosi misses a sept 27 deadline to pass the infrastructure deal the circular firing squad is taking aim sinema a leading beneficiary of big pharma s largesse has told the white house she won t support a proposal that allows the government to negotiate medicare prescription drug prices which the reconciliation bill counts on for 700 billion in savings manchin says the 3 5 trillion price tag is 2 trillion too high he wants to gut the child tax credit and after earning 500 000 in stock dividends from a coal brokerage firm last year and reaping more fossil fuel contributions than anyone else in the senate he ll also water down the budget s initiatives to combat climate change amid all of this the senate s parliamentarian ruled that democrats can t include immigration reform in their reconciliation bill while they have options as the senate s presiding officer vice president kamala harris could overrule the parliamentarian fealty to institutional norms will almost certainly trump campaign promises as it did earlier this year when the parliamentarian rejected a minimum wage hike in the american rescue plan if it continues unabated this keystone kops routine all but guarantees a 2010 style wipeout in the shorter term it could also lead to a government shutdown and crash the global economy just as in 2011 mcconnell has threatened not to extend the federal government s borrowing limit unlike in 2011 when republicans used the debt ceiling to force president obama to make drastic spending cuts mcconnell doesn t have an agenda beyond political calculation debt ceiling votes are unpopular he wants the other guys to take them the country must never default he told politics newsletter the punchbowl last week the debt ceiling will need to be raised but who does that depends on who the american people elect democrats have attached the debt ceiling to a spending bill to keep the government open beyond sept 30 that will require 60 votes if mcconnell holds his line the bill will fail the government will close and global markets will enter a tailspin democrats either have to call mcconnell s bluff and hope he s bluffing or attach the debt ceiling to the already wobbly reconciliation bill again their options wouldn t be so constrained if they simply did away with the filibuster the debt ceiling wouldn t be a problem neither would the opinion of the senate parliamentarian senate dems would still have to placate sinema and manchin but they wouldn t have to cram all of their priorities into one messy reconciliation bill earlier this month rolling stone reported that biden told democratic leaders he ll pressure moderates to carve out an exception to the filibuster for voting rights legislation whether he ll sway manchin and sinema remains to be seen i m skeptical broader filibuster reform seems about as likely as the diet pills advertised in your facebook feed actually working democratic moderates have convinced themselves that they re doing themselves and the party a favor by gumming up the works hoping that immunizes them to next year s attack ads about runaway spending it won t and it wouldn t matter if it did that s not how midterms work they re referenda on the country s direction and they almost always favor the party out of power if there s a wave election moderates get wiped out first their chances are almost wholly tied to biden s popularity and biden s popularity is in no small part tied to getting both the infrastructure and reconciliation bills through congress the democrats circular firing squad isn t going to take out alexandria ocasio cortez but it has many of the moderates who are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory dead in its sights

psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by

young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

using extraordinary measures to fund the government since the last debt limit suspension expired july 31 and projects that at some point next month will run out cash reserves then it will have to rely

stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by

bloomberg the federal reserve is expected to signal scaling back asset purchases later this year with scrutiny also on forecasts that could reveal growing internal pressure to raise interest rates in 2022 the federal open market committee is all but certain to hold rates near zero after a two day policy meeting wednesday and keep buying bonds at the current 120 billion monthly pace the panel will release a statement at 2 p m washington time plus updated quarterly estimates including its dot plot of rate projections chair jerome powell will brief reporters 30 minutes later seven of 18 officials in june penciled in liftoff in 2022 though the median estimate saw rates on hold into 2023 with inflation forecasts likely to move higher this meeting more policy makers could join the 2022 camp growing support for an earlier hike could undermine powell s message of patience while covid 19 remains a threat and his claim that tapering doesn t start the countdown to liftoff the tapering has been well telegraphed so it won t surprise people said roberto perli a partner at cornerstone macro llc and former fed economist the dots are more uncertain it s really easy to imagine the dots going up and almost impossible to imagine them going down powell s characterization of the economy will also be parsed by the white house his four year term as chair ends in february an overwhelming majority of economists expect president joe biden will keep him at the helm though some progressives would like the white house to pick someone else biden s decision is expected this fall tapering this week s market turmoil triggered by concerns over china s real estate sector probably came too late to affect the tone of the meeting though tapering will be made conditional on the economy the fomc will leave itself an escape route should the situation deteriorate perli said much of the meeting is likely to be focused on the timing composition and pace of tapering the fed currently buys 80 billion in treasuries and 40 billion in mortgage backed securities every month officials have pledged to maintain bond buying until the economy shows substantial further progress on inflation and employment as it recovers from covid 19 fomc statement powell in a late august speech to the fed s annual jackson hole conference said the fomc could begin tapering this year after meeting the inflation half of that test while the labor market had made clear progress a version of those words could be included in the statement said aneta markowska chief u s financial economist at jefferies llc in new york they might recycle the language which was in powell s jackson hole speech where he said on inflation the taper test has been met and we have made clear progress on the employment side she said it s not quite as strong as substantial further progress it would be a good indication that we are very close we are getting there what bloomberg economics says the statement likely will communicate that inflation has met the criteria of substantial progress toward the fed s price objective and the labor market is expected to have made substantial improvement by the end of the year two markers for the central bank to begin tightening policy anna wong andrew husby and eliza winger while the delta variant has caused some recent softness in the job market the fomc may choose to make relatively few changes in its statement repeating the description that the economy continues to strengthen and that the surge in inflation is transitory some regional fed presidents led by st louis fed s james bullard and dallas fed s robert kaplan have argued for an early tapering but they are not among fomc voters this year so it s unlikely a delay to november or december would bring any dissents forecasts most economists surveyed by bloomberg expect the dot plot to continue to signal the first rate hike in 2023 though concerns about rising inflation could lead to a hawkish tilt more than a third of economists surveyed think the median for 2023 could increase from two hikes an indication that the first hike would occur in the first half of the year the forecasts will also include the first view of 2024 when three additional hikes are expected inflation forecasts should also be notable for how the committee views prices which have been boosted by supply disruptions as the economy reopens from the pandemic higher inflation forecasts could suggest a steeper rate hike path over time most economists expect the median forecast for price gains to rise to 3 8 this year with 2 2 the following year the dot plot could definitely be a thorn in the side for powell since the regional fed presidents could up their dots said thomas costerg senior u s economist at pictet wealth management in geneva the regional fed presidents are much less serene than powell about the inflation risk behind the scenes i would expect quite a vibrant discussion as the gap between the regionals and the board will be quite a big moat press conference powell is likely to acknowledge the fomc continued to discuss tapering and could leave the impression the committee could move as soon as its next meeting on nov 2 3 the chair is likely to be pressed on inflation following the most recent data and whether americans expectations are shifting reflecting gains in recent consumer surveys he s also likely to be asked about threats to financial stability from surging housing prices and from china s real estate sector which has prompted a global stocks rout recent financial disclosures of stock trading last year by two fed presidents are likely to also raise questions for powell who has announced a review of fed policies 2021 bloomberg l p

washington ap the house voted tuesday night to fund the government into early december suspend the federal debt limit and provide disaster and refugee aid setting up a high stakes showdown with republicans who oppose the package despite the prospects of a looming fiscal crisis the democratic led house passed the measure by a vote of 220 211 strictly along party lines the bill now goes to the senate where it is likely to falter because of overwhelming gop opposition the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops on sept 30 the end of the fiscal year midnight next thursday additionally at some point in october the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if its borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted our country will suffer greatly if we do not act now to stave off this unnecessary and preventable crisis house majority leader steny hoyer d md said shortly before the vote the package approved tuesday would provide stopgap money to keep the government funded to dec 3 and extend borrowing authority through the end of 2022 it includes 28 6 billion in disaster relief for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other extreme weather events and 6 3 billion to support afghanistan evacuees in the fallout from the end of the 20 year war while suspending the debt ceiling allows the government to meet financial obligations already incurred republicans argued it would also facilitate a spending binge in the months ahead i will not support signing a blank check as this majority is advancing the most reckless expansion of government in generations said rep dan meuser r pa backed by the white house democratic congressional leaders pushed ahead at a time of great uncertainty in congress democrats are also trying to gather support for president joe biden s broad build back better agenda which would have a price tag of up to 3 5 trillion over 10 years senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he was not about to help pay off past debts when biden was about to pile on more he said since democrats control the white house and congress it s their problem to find the votes the debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be but it will be raised by the democrats mcconnell said in the 50 50 senate democrats will be hard pressed to find 10 republicans to reach the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster this is playing with fire said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y the treasury department has been using extraordinary measures to fund the government since the last debt limit suspension expired july 31 and projects that at some point next month will run out cash reserves then it will have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics warned if lawmakers allow a federal debt default this economic scenario is cataclysmic in a report being circulated by democrats zandi warned that a potential downturn from government funding cutbacks would cost 6 million jobs and stock market losses would wipe out 15 trillion of household wealth once a routine matter raising the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow the increase at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though he also relied on democratic votes help raise the debt ceiling when his party had the majority he explained his current thinking to senators during a private lunch tuesday still some gop senators might have a tough time voting no republican john kennedy of louisiana whose state was battered by the hurricane and who is up for election next year said he will likely vote for the increase my people desperately need the help he said white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters that in our view this should not be a controversial vote psaki said congress has raised the debt ceiling numerous times on a bipartisan basis including three times under president donald trump rep rosa delauro the democratic chairwoman of the house appropriations committee was forced to introduce another version of the bill tuesday after some within the democratic caucus objected to the inclusion of 1 billion for israel s iron dome defense system which uses missiles to intercept short range rockets fired into the country the israel defense issue splits democrats but delauro assured colleagues that money for the weapons system would be included in the annual defense spending bill for the next fiscal year which begins oct 1 hoyer went a step further and said he would bring a bill to the floor this week to replenish the iron dome system republicans were highly critical of the change and vowed to stand as allies with israel meanwhile behind the scenes democrats were negotiating among themselves over biden s big build back better package as the price tag likely slips to win over skeptical centrist lawmakers who view it as too much publicly the white house has remained confident the legislation will pass soon despite sharp differences among progressives and moderates in the party over the eventual size of the package and a companion 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill there has been a flurry of outreach from the white house to democrats on capitol hill and biden himself was given a call sheet of lawmakers to cajole even though his week was dominated by foreign policy including his speech to the united nations general assembly the president has been talking to a wide number of lawmakers beyond his recent meetings with sens joe manchin d w va and kyrsten sinema d ariz two key centrist votes according to a white house official familiar with the calls and granted anonymity to discuss them biden s big initiative touches almost all aspects of americans lives it would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old it would increase and expand government health education and family support programs for households children and seniors and boost environmental infrastructure programs to fight climate change with republicans opposed to biden s vision democrats have no votes to spare in the senate and just a few votes margin in the house house speaker nancy pelosi has promised a sept 27 vote on a companion bill a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill of public works projects that enjoys widespread support from both parties in the senate though house republicans mostly oppose it even though that bipartisan bill should be an easy legislative lift it too faces a political obstacle course dozens of lawmakers in the congressional progressive caucus are expected to vote against it if it comes ahead of the broader biden package and centrists won t vote for the broader package unless they are assured the bipartisan bill will also be included associated press writers darlene

washington ap the house voted tuesday night to fund the government into early december suspend the federal debt limit and provide disaster and refugee aid setting up a high stakes showdown with republicans who oppose the package despite the prospects of a looming fiscal crisis the democratic led house passed the measure by a vote of 220 211 strictly along party lines the bill now goes to the senate where it is likely to falter because of overwhelming gop opposition the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops on sept 30 the end of the fiscal year midnight next thursday additionally at some point in october the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if its borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted our country will suffer greatly if we do not act now to stave off this unnecessary and preventable crisis house majority leader steny hoyer d md said shortly before the vote the package approved tuesday would provide stopgap money to keep the government funded to dec 3 and extend borrowing authority through the end of 2022 it includes 28 6 billion in disaster relief for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other extreme weather events and 6 3 billion to support afghanistan evacuees in the fallout from the end of the 20 year war while suspending the debt ceiling allows the government to meet financial obligations already incurred republicans argued it would also facilitate a spending binge in the months ahead i will not support signing a blank check as this majority is advancing the most reckless expansion of government in generations said rep dan meuser r pa backed by the white house democratic congressional leaders pushed ahead at a time of great uncertainty in congress democrats are also trying to gather support for president joe biden s broad build back better agenda which would have a price tag of up to 3 5 trillion over 10 years senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he was not about to help pay off past debts when biden was about to pile on more he said since democrats control the white house and congress it s their problem to find the votes the debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be but it will be raised by the democrats mcconnell said in the 50 50 senate democrats will be hard pressed to find 10 republicans to reach the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster this is playing with fire said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y the treasury department has been using extraordinary measures to fund the government since the last debt limit suspension expired july 31 and projects that at some point next month will run out cash reserves then it will have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics warned if lawmakers allow a federal debt default this economic scenario is cataclysmic in a report being circulated by democrats zandi warned that a potential downturn from government funding cutbacks would cost 6 million jobs and stock market losses would wipe out 15 trillion of household wealth once a routine matter raising the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow the increase at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though he also relied on democratic votes help

psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops on sept 30 the end of the fiscal year midnight next thursday washington time growing shorter president joe biden planned to meet privately wednesday with house and senate democrats as congress worked to bridge party divisions over his big build back better agenda ahead of crucial voting deadlines the meetings at the white house come at a pivotal juncture for biden s 3 5 trillion package as lawmakers struggle to draft the ambitious effort with republicans solidly opposed democratic leaders are counting on the president to galvanize consensus between progressives and centrists in their party biden was also meeting separately with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer and the white house s communications team headed to capitol hill to huddle with other house democrats the time is now biden tweeted in a video tuesday ahead of the white house sessions the house faces a deadline monday to vote on the first part of biden s plan a nearly 1 trillion public works measure that was already approved by the senate but has become tangled in disputes over the broader package centrist democrats support the slimmer bill but have raised concerns about biden s broader vision which entails revamping federal taxes and spending to make what the president views as overdue investments in health care family services and efforts to fight climate change the 3 5 trillion package would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old house speaker pelosi has promised centrists a vote on the more modest 1 trillion public works package that bill of roads broadband and public water projects enjoys bipartisan senate support and should easily pass the house even with growing house republican opposition but has become sidelined by the bigger debate related articles no it is not an ethics violation for politicians to attend the met gala i m confident we ll have the votes said rep josh gottheimer d n j a leader of the centrist coalition who is attending the white house meeting but progressive lawmakers view the public works bill as inadequate and plan to vote against it unless it is considered alongside the bigger biden package some 50 members of the congressional progressive caucus plan to vote against the bipartisan measure rep pramila jayapal d wash chairwoman of the progressive caucus emerged from an hour long meeting with pelosi late tuesday saying its position had not changed and the two bills must move in tandem to win the progressive votes jayapal also will attend the meeting with biden publicly the white house has remained confident both bills will pass and democratic leaders are pushing ahead as they draft the details tensions are high as the biden agenda is a key campaign promise not only from the president but most of the the democratic lawmakers including those in the house who face re election next year all this as the house and senate are at a standstill over a separate package to keep the government funded past the sept 30 fiscal yearend and suspend the federal debt limit to avert what could be a devastating u s default on payments the government faces a shutdown if funding stops on sept 30 the end of the fiscal year additionally at some point in october the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if its borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted rushing to prevent that dire outcome the democratic led house passed the funding and debt measure tuesday night but republicans are refusing to give their support in the senate despite the risk of triggering a fiscal crisis our country will suffer greatly if we do not act now to stave off this unnecessary and preventable crisis said house majority leader steny hoyer d md and the administration has sent intermediaries including former treasury secretary hank paulson to meet with republican senate leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky but mcconnell said since democrats control the white house and congress it s their problem to find the votes though he had relied on bipartisan cooperation to approve debt limit measures when republicans were in charge the debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be but it will be raised by the democrats mcconnell said the measure approved tuesday night would provide stopgap money to keep the government funded to dec 3 and extend borrowing authority through the end of 2022 it includes 28 6 billion in disaster relief for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other extreme weather events and 6 3 billion to support afghanistan evacuees in the fallout from the end of the 20 year war in the 50 50 senate democrats will be hard pressed to find 10 republicans to reach the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster the treasury department has been using extraordinary measures to fund the government since the last debt limit suspension expired july 31 and projects that at some point next month it will run out of cash reserves that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments ___
house democrats approved a bill on tuesday to avert a government shut down and increase the debt limit but shot down a republican attempt to add back 1 billion in funding to israel s iron dome program the house passed the measure 220 to 211 along party lines to fund the government through december 3rd the bill also increased the debt limit until december 2022 in order to stop the government from defaulting on its debt additionally there is 28 6 billion in disaster funding to help the south after hurricane ida and the north east from severe storms and 6 3 billion to help afghan refugees relocating to the united states the bill now goes to the senate where it s expected in the 50 50 chamber where democrats will be hard pressed to find 10 republicans to reach the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster also on tuesday night house democrats batted down an attempt by republicans to send the bill back to committee so funding could be added for israel s defense system after it was removed due to the objections of progressive democratic members reps alexandria ocasio cortez of new york ilhan omar of minnesota rashida tlaib of michigan and pramila jayapal of washington instead house majority whip steny hoyer said he ll try to bring up a standalone iron dome bill this week it is my intention to bring to this floor a suspension bill before the end of this week that will fund fully iron dome i was for that i m still for it we ought to do it he said on the house floor house democrats approved a bill to avert a government shut down increase the debt limit provide disaster relief and help afghan refugees house democrats shot down a republican attempt to add back 1 billion in funding to israel s iron dome program earlier in the day hoyer told israeli foreign minister yair lapid the removal of funds from the stopgap bill was only a technical delay as democrats were forced into crisis talks over the issue in tuesday night s vote on the government funding bill democrats forced a showdown with republicans who oppose the package despite the risk of a fiscal crisis if it hadn t passed the government risked shutting down at the end of the month and the u s risked defaulting on its debt backed by the white house democratic congressional leaders pushed ahead at a time of great uncertainty in congress with lawmakers already chiseling away at the 3 5 trillion price tag of president joe biden s broad build back better agenda immediate attention focused on the upcoming deadlines to avert deeper problems if votes to shore up government funding fail speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer will meet with biden at the white house on wednesday to discuss his legislative agenda according to reports the meeting comes as senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he was not about to help pay off past debts when biden was about to pile on more with a reckless tax and spending package he said since democrats control the white house and congress it s their problem to find the votes the debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be but it will be raised by the democrats mcconnell said senate republican leader mitch mcconnell made clear he was not going to approve a bill to raise the debt limit the treasury department warned that it will soon run out of cash on hand and have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics warned if lawmakers allow a federal debt default this economic scenario is cataclysmic in a report being circulated by democrats zandi warned that a potential downturn from government funding cutbacks would cost 6 million jobs and stock market losses would wipe out 15 trillion of household wealth once a routine matter raising the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow the increase at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though he also relied on democratic votes help raise the debt ceiling when his party had the majority he explained his current thinking to senators during a private lunch tuesday still some gop senators might have a tough time voting no republican john kennedy of louisiana whose state was battered by the hurricane and who is up for election next year said he will likely vote for the increase my people desperately need the help he said white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters that in our view this should not be a controversial vote psaki said congress has raised the debt ceiling numerous times on a bipartisan basis including three times under president donald trump meanwhile behind the scenes democrats were negotiating among themselves over biden s big build back better package as the price tag likely slips to win over skeptical centrist lawmakers who view it as too much publicly the white house has remained confident the legislation will pass soon despite sharp differences among progressives and moderates in the party over the eventual size of the package and a companion 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill there has been a flurry of outreach from the white house to democrats on capitol hill and biden himself was given a call sheet of lawmakers to cajole even though his week was dominated by foreign policy including his speech to the united nations general assembly the president has been talking to a wide number of lawmakers beyond his recent meetings with sens joe manchin d w va and kyrsten sinema d ariz two key centrist votes according to a white house official familiar with the calls and granted anonymity to discuss them biden s big initiative touches almost all aspects of americans lives it would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old it would increase and expand government health education and family support programs for households children and seniors and boost environmental infrastructure programs to fight climate change biden s plan aims to not just rebuild the country after the covid 19 crisis and economic fallout but begin to change longstanding federal spending patterns in ways that provide more services to more americans and attempt to level growing income inequality with republicans opposed to biden s vision democrats have no votes to spare in the senate and just a few votes margin in the house pelosi has promised a sept 27 vote on the companion bill a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill of public works projects that enjoys widespread support from both parties in the senate though house republicans mostly oppose it even though that bipartisan bill should be an easy legislative lift it too faces a political obstacle course dozens of lawmakers in the congressional progressive caucus are expected to vote against it if it comes ahead of the broader biden package and centrists won t vote for the broader package unless they are assured the bipartisan bill will also be included
young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

chef restaurateur recipe writer and cookbook author yotam ottolenghi looked perfectly at ease in the hot seat on stage in york tonight as he talked about his extraordinary career and faced questions from a packed theatre royal audience the israeli born chef celebrated for revolutionising britain s kitchens with a plethora of middle eastern ingredients such as preserved lemons sumac and za atar proved to be a charming and entertaining raconteur during his 75 minutes on stage with host rachel cooke the observer journalist but fans were left disappointed when ottolenghi was asked if he would ever open a restaurant outside of london and come north even to york he said over the years we have had a lot of those conversations trouble is running restaurants is very hard work and i am very controlling the thought that i wouldn t be able to walk into my restaurant and see my chefs well it makes me sleep not very well at night topics covered during the evening included ottolenghi s early life in jerusalem his memories of shopping in the local food markets and watering his mother s fresh herbs he came to britain to study but loved cooking more over the past two decades he has become an international culinary superstar running his delis and restaurants as well as writing a weekly column in the guardian s feast magazine and a monthly column in the new yorker he has also published seven bestselling cookbooks with a new one based on recipes cooked during the pandemic due out at the end of this month he talked about the inspiration behind this new cookbook shelf love he explained how like everyone else during lockdown he had to cook with what he had in his cupboard and had to be creative when staples such as rice and pasta were in short supply i used barley polenta whole grain rice the book celebrates ingredients that sit in the cupboard and don t get used so what else did we discover during our evening with the great chef that he serves simple foods to his two young children we should add fresh tomatoes to any dish using tinned tomatoes to enhance the flavour and that supermarket bought hummus is not a patch on the real thing hummus is a meal in itself it should be served warm with pitta and whole chickpeas the audience were clearly ottolenghi fans with many picking up signed copies of his cookbooks after the show he wasn t doing personal signings because of covid it was announced and if they weren t already an avid follower they most likely left a convert with plans to visit the supermarket asap to stock up on some of those special ottolenghi ingredients
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington the house voted tuesday night to fund the government into early december suspend the federal debt limit and provide disaster and refugee aid setting up a high stakes showdown with republicans who oppose the package despite the prospects of a looming fiscal crisis the democratic led house passed the measure by a vote of 220 211 strictly along party lines the bill now goes to the senate where it is likely to falter because of overwhelming gop opposition the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops on sept 30 the end of the fiscal year midnight next thursday additionally at some point in october the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if its borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted our country will suffer greatly if we do not act now to stave off this unnecessary and preventable crisis house majority leader steny hoyer d md said shortly before the vote the package approved tuesday would provide stopgap money to keep the government funded to dec 3 and extend borrowing authority through the end of 2022 it includes 28 6 billion in disaster relief for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other extreme weather events and 6 3 billion to support afghanistan evacuees in the fallout from the end of the 20 year war while suspending the debt ceiling allows the government to meet financial obligations already incurred republicans argued it would also facilitate a spending binge in the months ahead i will not support signing a blank check as this majority is advancing the most reckless expansion of government in generations said rep dan meuser r pa backed by the white house democratic congressional leaders pushed ahead at a time of great uncertainty in congress democrats are also trying to gather support for president joe biden s broad build back better agenda which would have a price tag of up to 3 5 trillion over 10 years senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he was not about to help pay off past debts when biden was about to pile on more he said since democrats control the white house and congress it s their problem to find the votes the debt ceiling will be raised as it always should be but it will be raised by the democrats mcconnell said in the 50 50 senate democrats will be hard pressed to find 10 republicans to reach the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster this is playing with fire said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y the treasury department has been using extraordinary measures to fund the government since the last debt limit suspension expired july 31 and projects that at some point next month will run out cash reserves then it will have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics warned if lawmakers allow a federal debt default this economic scenario is cataclysmic in a report being circulated by democrats zandi warned that a potential downturn from government funding cutbacks would cost 6 million jobs and stock market losses would wipe out 15 trillion of household wealth once a routine matter raising the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow the increase at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though he also relied on democratic votes help raise the debt ceiling when his party had the majority he explained his current thinking to senators during a private lunch tuesday still some gop senators might have a tough time voting no republican john kennedy of louisiana whose state was battered by the hurricane and who is up for election next year said he will likely vote for the increase my people desperately need the help he said white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters that in our view this should not be a controversial vote psaki said congress has raised the debt ceiling numerous times on a bipartisan basis including three times under president donald trump rep rosa delauro the democratic chairwoman of the house appropriations committee was forced to introduce another version of the bill tuesday after some within the democratic caucus objected to the inclusion of 1 billion for israel s iron dome defense system which uses missiles to intercept short range rockets fired into the country the israel defense issue splits democrats but delauro assured colleagues that money for the weapons system would be included in the annual defense spending bill for the next fiscal year which begins oct 1 hoyer went a step further and said he would bring a bill to the floor this week to replenish the iron dome system republicans were highly critical of the change and vowed to stand as allies with israel meanwhile behind the scenes democrats were negotiating among themselves over biden s big build back better package as the price tag likely slips to win over skeptical centrist lawmakers who view it as too much publicly the white house has remained confident the legislation will pass soon despite sharp differences among progressives and moderates in the party over the eventual size of the package and a companion 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill there has been a flurry of outreach from the white house to democrats on capitol hill and biden himself was given a call sheet of lawmakers to cajole even though his week was dominated by foreign policy including his speech to the united nations general assembly the president has been talking to a wide number of lawmakers beyond his recent meetings with sens joe manchin d w va and kyrsten sinema d ariz two key centrist votes according to a white house official familiar with the calls and granted anonymity to discuss them biden s big initiative touches almost all aspects of americans lives it would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old it would increase and expand government health education and family support programs for households children and seniors and boost environmental infrastructure programs to fight climate change with republicans opposed to biden s vision democrats have no votes to spare in the senate and just a few votes margin in the house house speaker nancy pelosi has promised a sept 27 vote on a companion bill a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill of public works projects that enjoys widespread support from both parties in the senate though house republicans mostly oppose it even though that bipartisan bill should be an easy legislative lift it too faces a political obstacle course dozens of lawmakers in the congressional progressive caucus are expected to vote against it if it comes ahead of the broader biden package and centrists won t vote for the broader package unless they are assured the bipartisan bill will also be included

young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips among a certain community of individual investors on tiktok house speaker nancy pelosi s stock trading disclosures are a treasure trove shouts out to nancy pelosi the stock market s biggest whale said user ceowatchlist another said i ve come to the conclusion that nancy pelosi is a psychic while adding that she is the queen of investing she knew declared chris josephs analyzing a particular trade in pelosi s financial disclosures and you would have known if you had followed her portfolio last year josephs noticed that the trades actually made by pelosi s investor husband and merely disclosed by the speaker were performing well josephs is the co founder of a company called iris which shows other people s stock trades in the past year and a half he has been taking advantage of a law called the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades and those of their spouses within 45 days now on josephs social investing platform you can get a push notification every time pelosi s stock trading disclosures are released he is personally investing when he sees which stocks are picked i m at the point where if you can t beat them join them josephs told npr adding that if he sees trades on her disclosures i typically do buy the next one she does i m going to buy a pelosi spokesperson said that she does not personally own any stocks and that the transactions are made by her husband the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions said the spokesperson still josephs views trades by federal lawmakers as smart money worth following and plans to track a large variety of politicians we don t want this to be a left vs right thing we don t really care we just want to make money he said pelosi is hardly the only lawmaker making these stock disclosures so far this year senate and house members have filed more than 4 000 financial trading disclosures with at least 315 million of stocks and bonds bought or sold that s according to tim carambat who in 2020 created and now maintains two public databases of lawmaker financial transactions house stock watcher and senate stock watcher he says there is a significant following for his work i knocked out a very very simple version of the project in like a couple of hours and i posted it actually to reddit where it gained some significant traction and people showed a lot of interest in it carambat said dinesh hasija an assistant professor of strategic management at augusta university in georgia has been studying whether the market moves based on congressional disclosures his ongoing research suggests that it does investors perceive that senators may have insider information he said and we see abnormal positive returns when there s a disclosure by a senator in other words hasija s research shows that after the disclosures are published there s a bump in the price of stocks bought by lawmakers at least one financial services consultant matthew zwijacz is planning to set up a financial instrument that automatically tracks congressional stock picks because in his view lawmakers are probably privy to more information than just the general public both investors and government watchdogs are interested in these trades because of the possibility that lawmakers could use the private information they obtain through their jobs for money making investment decisions if the situation is that the public has lost so much trust in government that they think the stock trades of members are based on corruption and that corruption could benefit we have a significant problem said kedric payne senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center a surge of interest following congressional financial disclosures came near the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic when a flurry of reports indicated that lawmakers sold their stocks right before the financial crash npr reported how senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr privately warned a small group of well connected constituents in february 2020 about the dire effects of the coming pandemic he sold up to 1 72 million worth of personal stocks on a single day that same month a bipartisan group of senators also came under suspicion including sens dianne feinstein james inhofe and kelly loeffler after investigations by federal law enforcement none were charged with insider trading a very difficult charge to make against a sitting lawmaker congressman raja krishnamoorthi a democrat from illinois is part of a bipartisan group of house and senate members who have introduced legislation banning lawmakers from owning individual stocks he has run up against a lot of opposition to the idea as i understand it one of the perks of being a member of congress especially from the late 1800s on was to be able to trade on insider information that was a perk of being in congress and that has got to come to an end krishnamoorthi said polling shows that there is wide support for enacting this prohibition according to a survey done this year by data for progress 67 of americans believe federal lawmakers should not own individual stocks there s a deep cynicism that forms the foundation of a trading strategy based on mimicking the stock picks of lawmakers and their spouses the notion that politicians are corrupt and that you can t trust them not to engage in insider trading so if the information is public you might as well trade what they re trading but despite all the skepticism about politicians and their ethical standards the evidence doesn t show that members of congress make great stock pickers while a 2004 paper found that senators generally outperformed the market more recent academic studies in 2013 and over the last few years have suggested lawmakers are not good at picking stocks those papers have found that in fact the trades made by senators have underperformed hasija said this means if you ever take a stock tip from a lawmaker cynicism aside it might not be a very good trade copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
