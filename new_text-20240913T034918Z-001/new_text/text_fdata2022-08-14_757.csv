we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

public and private elementary middle and high schools work hard to be prepared from the orchestrated chaos of the first day to fire drills to delayed starts on snowy mornings planning and preparation are in their dna because knowing that the grownups have things under control frees children to stop worrying and learn when the unthinkable becomes a possibility however the critical challenge is to make schools secure without making children insecure administrators teachers and staff must now be ready for hostile intruders intent on mayhem knowing that lives could depend on how well they prepare and if necessary act on the plans educators shoulder the burden of life and death responsibility as part of a day at work and still must try to make learning normal society is asking much of institutions that were created to nurture young minds covid coping measures continue for the third academic year while many students are still lagging from the year of remote learning at the same time school and safety officials must walk the line between keeping students safe from violent intruders and turning schools into tense armed camps the upcoming start of this academic year marks the first time school boards and educators will implement updated security plans since a lone gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in a uvalde texas elementary school in may investigators are examining whether law enforcement on the scene failed to act as quickly or aggressively as expected of trained officers indications are that lives could have been saved had they acted sooner the horrible possibility of such a scenario has spurred other school districts to tighten security even more including arming teachers or security guards inside the schools but as some residents of lyme and old lyme told the regional district 18 school board at a meeting in june there is good reason to pause and think carefully about the unintended consequences of weapons in schools the presence of firearms in a home or business increases the possibility of accidents involving the weapons incidents of mishandling guns meant for defense could similarly occur in schools but even if that does not happen there is also an ever present threat to children s sense of security and ability to learn the constant awareness that adults don t believe they can keep schools safe without shooting back at the extreme is a decision by a north carolina sheriff and school district to stock the schools with locked cases of ar 15 assault weapons and ammunition that makes no sense the ar 15 is a war weapon favored by domestic terrorists because it can hit the most people in the least time a defender does not need one school invasions have been loner events almost always by a single gunman the lyme old lyme and montville school districts are not going to such lengths but their boards of education have directed the superintendents of schools to prepare armed response strategies ian neviaser lyme old lyme superintendent revealed that the district first considered armed security guards even before the tragedy at sandy hook elementary school in 2012 most extreme of all is the notion that teachers can and should be quickly trained to defend their classrooms and students with a firearm as beth ann fennelly a university instructor and former poet laureate of mississippi wrote recently in the new york times teachers should not be the first line of defense if we educators find ourselves nose to nose with a mentally ill child wielding an ar 15 it might look as if we re the first line but that s only because all the other lines have lain down she and many other teachers and mental health experts have described the dual dangers to school age children bodily harm but also traumatic stress from anticipating such a thing the decision to have armed guards on campus should be a community one involving school personnel parents and emergency services it should be clearly understood by all that firing shots in the building is the last resort after failed security measures keeping the intruder out in the first place should be the focus and trust the teachers who know their jobs to engage young minds in subjects they need to know in life not in fearing for their lives the day editorial board meets with political business and community leaders to formulate editorial viewpoints it is composed of president and publisher timothy dwyer executive editor izaskun e larraneta owen poole copy editor and lisa mcginley retired deputy managing editor the board operates independently from the day newsroom

four decades after a very different health crisis put a spotlight on the gay community some san diegans feel as though they ve been time warped back to the 1980s they re also calling on the support networks they have built since monkeypox has certainly transported me back to a time where i was scared for my life not only because of aids but because of the stigmas that came with it said craig bertrand advertisement forty years ago bertrand was only 23 when his partner died of aids just one year after the disease had been labeled a gay related immune deficiency the monkeypox virus is very different from hiv it is transmitted by physical contact not sex it is rarely fatal unlike aids in its early days and there is a vaccine to protect against it newsletter get our essential investigative journalism sign up for the weekly watchdog newsletter for investigations data journalism and more enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the san diego union tribune advertisement but with monkeypox spreading so far mostly among gay and bisexual men the fears and stigmas associated with it have echoed the early days of the hiv aids epidemic and for many who survived that crisis the key differences between the viruses have made the public health missteps this time all the more disappointing last month county health officials announced they d be prioritizing the monkeypox vaccine for gay and bisexual men and for transgender people just days before pride renewing frustrations among local lgbtq leaders cognizant of the stigmas their communities can face from such messaging in the month since more than 100 confirmed or probable cases of monkeypox have been reported in san diego county bringing the total to at least 134 as of friday most of them among gay and bisexual men according to county health data the state has declared a state of emergency over the outbreak as have the county and the nation advertisement san diego mayor todd gloria alongside councilmember stephen whitburn speaks at a press conference aug 2 announcing a local state of emergency on the monkeypox outbreak adriana heldiz the san diego union tribune some people like bertrand who experienced first hand the hate and ostracization that followed the aids outbreak feel as though they re reliving some of those traumas now we already paid the price 40 years ago i lost the love of my life and now this virus has just reopened all those old wounds he said i never thought i d be scared to consider myself a proudly gay man again but here we are advertisement worse he said the health crisis comes as many are still recovering from the fear and isolation sparked by the covid 19 pandemic and by the growing threat of anti lgbtq policy around the country we are already seeing the same tired hate speech targeting the lgbt community said fernando lopez executive director of san diego pride we ve heard all of these things before yet here we are fighting against going backward lessons learned and not learned longtime gay rights activist nicole murray ramirez recalls leading early protests during the aids crisis in san diego demanding more government help advertisement in one activists marched to city hall and placed some 200 black crosses on the step each a memorial to someone who had died here from the disease we had to fight for ourselves murray ramirez said nicole murray ramirez then president of the san diego county aids assistance fund addresses a rally in balboa park in 1985 marking san diego s 11th annual gay pride day george smith the san diego union tribune advertisement for all the world has learned since the aids epidemic murray ramirez believes local officials still missed early opportunities to intervene with monkeypox such as by engaging with the most vulnerable populations in the places where they gather for example or making bilingual information more readily available it s kind of stunning for me and others involved in the early dark days of aids that we didn t learn more from that he said i don t think people saw the urgency of this one monkeypox or understood it eddie reynoso executive director of the equality business alliance a chamber of commerce for the lgbtq community agreed health officials at all levels were slow to react he said slow to engage with organizations that work with the community most directly affected by it slow to make vaccines and testing available slow to educate the public in a public health crisis every day that goes by there are more infections he said advertisement both reynoso and murray ramirez say they have heard officials suggest that some of the hesitancy in messaging from officials came from a fear of stigmatizing the gay community that inadequate hushed messaging by officials has only worsened the stigma by fueling speculation said dr davey smith chief of infectious diseases at uc san diego health and an hiv aids specialist nobody wants to say the word gay afraid that it s going to stigmatize smith said when we talk about monkeypox we don t need to put it in the closet we need to talk about it openly and honestly advertisement for some health providers and advocates it s hard not to think about what might have been if monkeypox had been handled differently at the outset if we had really strong messaging early about risk and offered the vaccine early at the sites where people are at highest risk we probably would have been a little bit more successful said dr chris gordon chief medical officer at family health centers of san diego one of the county s largest providers of lgbtq and hiv services but the federal government reportedly bungled the nation s supply of monkeypox vaccine leading to an unnecessary shortage the u s could have had many more doses but waited too long to ask the manufacturer to process the bulk vaccine the government already owned into vials according to the new york times advertisement unlike hiv a vaccine that offers protection already exists and yet there aren t enough vaccines to protect all of us who need it and there could have been lopez said the power of community trust max disposti executive director of the north county lgbtq resource center has seen a generational split in how the community has responded to monkeypox for him and others around his age he s 54 it definitely triggers memories around aids even though the response today the stigmatizing has been nothing compared to what we experienced in the 80s about 400 people staged a candlelight march and rally in hillcrest in 1983 to protest a lack of funds for aids research bob ivins u t file advertisement but reynoso who works at a nightclub with a younger staff and clientele said the reactions he has seen to monkeypox are ones of fear and confusion he said he recently got a text from someone who had tested positive and didn t know what to do he was expressing enormous fear fear of the disease and fear of the stigma how am i going to tell my employer i have to take 21 days off work to isolate i can t work from home when you are not out with your sexuality all of that can be an enormous problem dispelling fear and misinformation is where lgbtq organizations like disposti s come in we are the trusted providers that can go in the community and talk to our people about prevention without stigmatizing or shaming their behavior he said informing people reduces the panic advertisement san diego pride and north county lgbtq center have been blasting information out in newsletters social media posts and other channels other groups and individuals have stepped in to share information too reynoso noted the san diego sisters of perpetual indulgence have been handing out fliers on monkeypox a local physician dr carlton thomas has been posting informational videos on tiktok and instagram and front and center on its website the san diego lgbt community center has a dedicated section filled with information and resources on monkeypox referred to as hmpxv the term for the human form of the monkeypox virus to reduce stigma according to gus hernandez the center s senior director of communications advertisement the push for education in response to monkeypox is a testament to how the lgbtq community has grown since the aids epidemic advocates agree as they put into practice the lessons they have learned over the past 40 years to get ahead of the curve more prepared and more powerful than ever to fight both the virus and the stigma those lessons have made the lgbtq community acutely aware of the risk they face with monkeypox gordon said that has led more people in it to seek care right away calling to ask to be vaccinated or seeking treatment after exposure there s a sense of urgency as we re a community who s already lived through the hiv pandemic as well as the covid pandemic hernandez said many people in the community are already accustomed to frequent testing and attuned to new concerns he added we know that we have to take proactive steps to protect ourselves advertisement that s the legacy of generations of lgbtq activists advocates and allies who ve worked through decades of systemic oppression particularly in the wake of hiv aids lopez added working together to combat the spread the information campaign is similar to what was done during the aids crisis when stigmas left those in the lgbtq community with nowhere else to turn our community has always taken care of ourselves and supported each other because we could not trust the government was going to do the right thing disposti said but for all the early failures on monkeypox the current response is a far cry from what happened during the aids crisis said lgbtq historian and san diego resident lillian faderman who lost several friends to the disease in the 80s and early 90s advertisement one thing i ll never forget is how president ronald reagan wouldn t even mention the word aids for many years she said contrasting his approach with the current president s many lives could have been saved if reagan had not only acknowledged it but put money into research and treatment lillian faderman an expert in gay and lesbian history in her la jolla home in march eduardo contreras the san diego union tribune by contrast lgbtq leaders can now be seen working alongside public health officials in a joint effort to tackle the monkeypox virus advertisement when it comes to monkeypox lopez said it s more important than ever to meet people with compassion care education and the right tools but with vaccines testing and treatments all in short supply many remain frustrated that nowhere near enough is being done while health experts and lgbtq leaders hope the local state and federal emergency declarations help to expedite more doses of the much needed vaccine the community is focused on supporting and educating one another reynoso for instance has seen gofundme pages in his social media feeds for people who have to isolate because of monkeypox and can t work but he says he d like to see health officials offer hotel rooms for people who have to isolate advertisement and although gay men recognize they re currently at higher risk of contracting monkeypox health experts say that s just where the virus is circulating right now not necessarily where it will stay smith who is gay is proud his community is so close knit but that also allows infectious diseases to spread he said i see this over and over with lots of infectious epidemics it hits vulnerable communities first especially close knit communities and then it moves on anytime there s an epidemic we re all in it together period smith said advertisement to get updates about monkeypox from the county text cosd monkeypox to 468 311 or call 211

the u s waited to order preparation of bulk stocks of monkeypox vaccine here s why share copy link copy and we are going to do everything that we can to end this outbreak that is our commitment uh and that s what we re going to make sure that we do that so as you all know the monkey pox outbreak has evolved rapidly and uniquely from prior outbreaks so we are in different it s different dynamic than it was the last couple of times because monkeypox has been here in this country before and so we have aggressively responded at different stages of this outbreak and so just wanted to give you little bit of that context because it s spreading at different phases here so first within two days of the first confirmed case of monkey pox in the us we began deploying vaccine to states and jurisdictions and prepositioning tens of thousands of additional doses in the strategic national stockpile the initial science lead us to believe this i think will answer your question little bit based on recent past monkey monkey pox outbreaks that those doses would be sufficient to meet the needs of the country as what we knew at that time because it s dynamic it s changing and so but however infectious diseases are dynamic as i just said and unpredictable uh inherently unpredictable which is why as soon as we saw that this outbreak was different and transmitting much more rapidly we quickly moved to order tens of thousands of more doses so just to give you little bit of the numbers that we have we have made more than 1 1 million doses available and shipped more than 600 000 doses those are currently out there going into jurisdictions to states and so and with more being delivered each day we also have ordered 5 5 million additional doses which are helping us get more doses out sooner knowing that more are on the way so this is this is just part of the process and what we have been following the science and making sure that we are you know we are rapidly reacting to this and that s what we ve been doing this is currently mismatch between the number of doses that the government has in bulk the number of doses that have been bottled and sent out to state local authorities and then the number of doses that are actually needed does the president feel like his administration has acted with enough urgency i mean what what we re saying to you is that i laid out how dynamic and how rapidly changing this virus has been uh and i m and also you know we we just had they just held hhs just held press conference and talked about this that s why we kind of moved the briefing so you all can have sense to hear what to hear directly from them there was 600 000 that they talked about they went from testing capacity from 6000 to 80 000 week that matters as we re trying to make sure we deal with monkeypox and we re working hand in hand with local authorities to get the resources they need and so and as you also know we took they took an additional step which is to announce public health emergency declared declaration of monkeypox and that s important because what that s gonna do it s gonna help accelerate the vaccine production and distribution this includes new dozing strategies that have the potential to increase the number of available doses by five fold so yes the president has confident in hhs and and let s not forget we just brought on the monkey pox uh coordinate coordinators the response team which is going to also make difference get national breaking news alerts the latest breaking updates delivered straight to your email inbox your email address submit privacy notice

mamurras albania with the pandemic and the ukraine conflict sending fertiliser prices through the roof albanian farmer alban cakalli has turned to coffee one of the balkan country s great loves to nourish his fields the 38 year old farmer owns only half a hectare in the town of mamurras in northwestern albania but even still is unable to afford the chemical based fertilisers imported from abroad as in other parts of the world albania s agricultural sector has been battered by rising costs with fuel and fertiliser prices soaring after russia a major producer of both commodities invaded ukraine to curb expenditures cakalli has turned to coffee grounds a natural fertiliser with readily available stocks in albania where drinking the caffeinated beverage remains a national pastime and cafes dot nearly every corner on an average day cakalli says he is able to collect up to 40 kilograms of coffee grounds the albanians are passionate about coffee he tells afp from his farm the process is time consuming requiring him to first collect the used beans before mixing the grounds with herbs and later composting the concoction for three months but the final product is rich in nitrogen magnesium and potassium and is a good substitute for chemical fertilisers and repels insects says cakalli many of albanian s 280 000 small time farmers have returned to similar traditional methods to enrich their soil rather than pay higher prices for imported fertilisers according to experts fertilisers and fuels account for more than 45 percent of the costs in agricultural production in the country for decades albania has relied on imports for fertiliser after its factories were largely abandoned and slid into disrepair following the fall of its communist government in the early 1990s russia was the top exporter of fertiliser to albania last year worth a total of 11 million according to the un s trade database by switching to coffee grounds cakalli says he saves between 1 500 and 2 000 euros 1 550 and 2 070 per year as covid disrupted global trade he has also diversified his operations in the field he now focuses on growing exotic crops including passion fruit and goji berries after the import of the fruits from south america were stopped during the pandemic just as demand began to rise these fruits were in high demand because they are known to help boost the immune system and for their antioxidant properties says his wife juli a 34 year old nurse this year alone cakalli has harvested a half tonne of passion fruit that sells for around 15 euros a kilo which is no small sum in albania where the average salary is 460 euros people like them a lot their smell is fantastic and even better than those of the countries of origin because everything is fresh here says cakalli alban zusi an entrepreneur who has been producing organic fertiliser from animal waste in northern albania s lezha said the rise in prices has also come with a silver lining and allowed farmers to return to their roots others in the industry tend to agree despite the difficulties there is no shortage of opportunities says fatmir ndoji the head chef of a well known farm to table restaurant in the region to create pleasure for the palate what counts is quality

reposted from new politics summer 2022 new politics put the following questions to andrei a member of the ukrainian socialist organization sotsialnyi rukh social movement np what is your assessment of the current military situation a russia has conceded defeat in its attempted blitzkrieg or general battle and has moved on to a war of attrition putin believes that over time support for ukraine will weaken pressure from sanctions will become less and less and ukraine will not be able to stand alone against russia as we can see he does have reasons to think so putin considers the complete obedience of the russian population to be his strategic advantage over the west which unlike the populations of western countries will not criticize him because of high inflation or economic problems for its part the ukrainian side is trying to buy the time necessary to obtain heavier weaponry and to form reserve military units from among the mobilized tactically this is turning into a slow exchange of territory for time the armed forces of ukraine afu is retreating without taking more casualties than the russian side periodically launching local counterattacks to improve its position the main problem now is that the stocks of soviet type weapons and ammunition in western countries are limited and the introduction of heavy weapons of nato standards requires time for example the immediate task of the afu is a full transition to nato standard artillery as stocks of shells for soviet artillery are running out under normal circumstances this could take six to twelve months but now it needs to be done in two to three months roughly the same will have to be done with tanks air defense systems and most importantly aviation russia has not changed its goals of destroying ukrainian statehood but it has changed its methods the future of the war cannot be clearly predicted now war in general is an unpredictable thing however it is already clear that it will be a long and bloody confrontation for a year or more np do you believe that the ukrainian government is making the decisions regarding whether to fight on or do you think this is being determined from outside a report in the ukrainian press 1 seemed to suggest that boris johnson was decisive in scuttling negotiations a two questions arise first what could boris johnson use to exert such pressure it is clear that ukraine could be forced to make concessions by refusing to provide further aid but what could be used to coerce the ukrainian authorities to escalate the fighting is not clear second how could such an escalation be sold to local elites and the population if they did not want it we are actually seeing the opposite namely that zelensky s position is quite moderate and is a compromise between polar positions in ukrainian society zelensky has officially stated2 that some western countries have pressed ukraine to make concessions to avoid a continuation of the war in this situation clearly the pro ukrainian position of such an influential country as the uk could have influenced the ukrainian leadership but rather in the sense that it gave hope that ukraine would receive support and not be left on its own because of course everyone in ukraine understands that without serious external support ukraine cannot win the long war of attrition with russia np are the ukrainian people in a position to assess whether to fight on and what concessions if any to make given that the ukrainian government doesn t release casualty figures making it very difficult to accurately judge the situation a there is much confusion about what is meant by ukrainian concessions if we are talking about the territory occupied by russia after february 24 then military losses will have little effect on the population s perception of whether to concede these territories this is simply because ukrainians have seen what the russians did in bucha and mariupol and understand that any option other than the return of these territories will result in far greater casualties than continuing the war already ukraine has lost far more civilian than military personnel according to officials and it is not clear how this can change given that the russians are not changing their attitude toward civilians the situation with the territories seized before february 24 crimea and ordlo the occupied districts of the donetsk and luhansk regions is completely different there are different opinions about these territories some believe they should be recovered by military force some believe there should not be an effort to recover them militarily but neither should they be recognized as russian territory and perhaps there is a small minority ready to recognize them as russian territory the compromise point of view promoted by the authorities at the moment is that ukraine continues to consider these territories its own but with a commitment not to try to recover them militarily zelensky keeps insisting that the return of ordlo and crimea by military means is not possible and not worth the possible military losses a position that has not changed since the war began however talk of this in any case can only come after the expulsion of russian troops to the borders that existed before february 24 which is still a long long time away and putin has never suggested anything of the sort np what is your view of the remarks3 of former us secretary of state henry kissinger negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome ideally the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of ukraine but a new war against russia itself a this is the answer to all western leftists trying to pit us imperialism against russian imperialism kissinger sees putin as his man the architect of operation condor 4 is certainly close to putin s goals of denazification the elimination of activists dissatisfied with the actions of the imperialist state like putin he is used to a world divided into spheres of influence among the big states these great powers can do whatever they want within their sphere of influence carry out genocide violate human rights and so on sometimes these spheres are redistributed as a result of negotiations or wars but for kissinger and putin the wars should never directly pit one major power against the other putin is uncomfortable with the very fact that the west is trying to promote values that claim to be universal for him it is a violation of his sovereignty by sovereignty he means the ability to kill undesirable people in his sphere of influence we must say openly that there are universal values for all people on the planet if they are violated anywhere in the world the world is obliged to intervene regardless of other powers zones of interest or spheres of influence the content of these values can and should be discussed and revised on equal footing any country can offer its vision but no one can isolate itself from this discussion under the guise of its sovereignty tyrants who kill their own citizens will sooner or later start to kill their neighbors sovereignty does not and cannot have clear permanent borders we all live in one whole world on the same planet isolationism is a failed idea used by tyrants so no one will stop them from committing crimes trump putin kissinger the monarchs of the arab world the chinese communist party radical islamists they all oppose the idea of universal values in one way or another this was not always the case in the 2000s for example putin tried to create his value system combining western consumption and soviet paternalism however the pro western protests in moscow in 2011 and the victory of the pro western revolutions in georgia and ukraine showed the complete failure of this system of values in open competition with western values this does not mean that western values in the form of liberal democracy are ideal it was only after this that putin turned to pure violence the united nations has a key role to play in the development of universal world values the un should get rid of the system of permanent members of the council and start playing the role of a platform for an ongoing discussion about the future of the world what it should be and how to get there isolationist revanchism is a very serious threat to the world we need to resist it both by repelling the external threat in the case of our country and by fighting politicians who offer us compromise with dictators based on the idea that what they do at home is none of our business np what has the impact of the war been on various left forces socialists the labor movement anarchists the women s movement is the right being strengthened or weakened what do you see as the trends the longer the war continues a the position of all political forces changed in a highly contradictory way on the one hand the war having become an existential threat united all political forces all population groups and all social classes the first month was a kind of rebirth of the nation when all the old disputes and disagreements linguistic regional class cultural political could easily be resolved for a more important and understandable purpose maybe that s what communism would look like the few political actors who tried to start scoring political points from the war were condemned even by their supporters however the withdrawal of russian tanks from kyiv made a big difference the actual existential threat has been replaced by a potential threat making it easy to ignore civic unity began to crack businesses began to look for ways to shift the costs of the war onto workers and consumers the security forces looked for ways to increase their power the population asked questions about why the authorities were not preparing for war political parties began to blame each other for ukraine s problems and language and culture wars returned all the stereotypes and prejudices have also returned feminist acquaintances for example report that they cannot rent an office simply because they say they represent a feminist organization you could say that we are going back to the way we used to live however this is compounded by a martial law which drastically reduces the scope for criticism of the authorities b mass impoverishment of people and c the loss through emigration of a huge amount of the population therefore the situation is very contradictory on the one hand there is a very strong public mobilization and solidarity which dramatically increases people s civic participation this also helps leftist organizations even in our organization many inactive members became active at the beginning of the war the mass participation of a variety of people in the army including vulnerable groups lgbt ethnic minorities roma left wing activists will make it difficult for right wing groups in the future to frame the image of the defender of ukraine as necessarily a right wing white man in general the main enemy of the left political apathy and the desire to be out of politics for the majority of the population looks largely defeated it s hard to be out of politics when that politics means rockets fired into your flat and tanks rumbling down your street also the complete break with the ideology of the former soviet union means that ukraine faces the need for rapid integration into the european union which also plays into the hands of the left as the eu is on average far more progressive than ukraine and we can campaign for progressive policies by arguing that we need to be like europe moreover the far right in ukraine has always been mostly anti european seeing europe as a haven for lgbt socialists and feminists however all this does not paint an unequivocally good prospect for the left the ukrainian government is neoliberal and the war has only made this worse amazingly while all european countries respond to even modest economic crises with leftist measures expansionary fiscal policies class redistribution to level out disparities a drive for full employment at the expense of inflation etc ukraine s crisis has been met with even greater neo liberalism and fiscal conservatism this has led to mass impoverishment which has led to an increase in crime and the interior ministry has responded by legalizing firearms both are hitting leftists hard impoverishment knocks people out of activism and mass possession of guns leads to the risk of both increasing right wing violence and police brutality which are often the same because of the affiliation of right wing street activists with security forces martial law the prohibition of protests and strikes the consolidation of the media makes it extremely difficult to fight this in many ways we are forced to actively use our western connections to at least influence the actions of our government when it comes to the long term prospects of the left the fate of the left in ukraine is closely linked to the fate of this war if ukraine ends up losing loses more territory or sovereignty suffers huge irreparable economic losses without adequate compensation loses the prospect of european integration there is a high risk of a rise in right wing sentiment without a clear perspective various extremist ideologies can easily spread in society which will of course be based on hatred of both russia which stole our country and the western world that abandoned ukraine to its fate the situation in chechnya republic of ichkeria can be given as an example before the first chechen war it was a fairly secular country but it became a center of attraction for radical islamism after the khasavyurt agreements deprived it of the chance to become an independent state such radical extremist ideas are often the consequence of an inability to defend oneself by other more reasonable and realistic means on the other hand if ukraine does not lose although we can hardly call this a victory and maintains those things necessary for decent social progress the left will have very good prospects european integration will require society to move in a more progressive direction it will be difficult for the right to frame itself as those who won the war because participation in the army was very massive and relatively inclusive we will see large numbers of people gaining experience in self organization by volunteering and helping the army these social skills are not going anywhere the demand for progressive social change in society and less influence of money on politics in ukrainian society is very strong in fact in his discourse zelensky has constantly flirted with these themes although of course his politics have little to do with his words the country will also face the question of reindustrialization and the development of science and education issues that have long been dear to the left and promoted by the left in ukraine which in the future will also be essential for the building of a strong defense sector certainly there is no guarantee that in post war construction the left will necessarily be able to win public support the same european integration can be implemented by borrowing all the worst from the eu but not by accepting the good there all this will be subject to political struggle but the trend as a whole will contribute to the growth of left wing sentiment and the success of left wing organizations np do you worry that if the west provides more and more powerful weapons to ukraine this will cause a cycle of escalating violence that will end up destroying ukraine a escalation has become the most important word in the current international debate on this war again as with the word concessions there is a very dangerous ambiguity that needs to be discussed the first issue is escalation in ukraine except for weapons of mass destruction wmds the russian federation has used all kinds of weapons including within populated areas heavy bombs heavy flamethrowers missiles including hypersonic ones cluster incendiary munitions and so on russia has no heavier weapons to use in ukraine also russia has already committed every possible war crime in effect carrying out genocide on invaded territories there are no types of targets that russia has not already attacked at the moment it has two escalatory tools left mobilization and wmds the first is impossible because of the nature of the russian regime which is based on the passivity of the people and the basic contract no one owes anyone anything the state does not owe the population and the population does not owe the state breaking this contract would most likely lead to the death of the regime many had expected a mobilization on may 9 but this didn t happen the use of wmds also does not look like a real threat at the moment neither western intelligence nor most military analysts believe that such options are actually being considered wmds will not give putin anything militarily but it will very much change the world s attitude towards the war a military intervention by nato countries in such a situation is quite possible putin tries to look like a madman but he is not his actions are quite logical for a tyrant trying to retain power but they are based on incorrect information about the world putin gets this only from reports of his subordinates who try to tell only the facts that are pleasing to him escalation in ukraine is impossible because the russian army is already fighting at its maximum capacity without any restrictions the other and much more real problem is escalation by russia outside of ukraine no of course russia will never attack nato but there are many forms of hybrid aggression that it certainly uses trade war cutting off gas in winter for example creating a food crisis or stopping humanitarian aid in syria large scale cyber attacks on critical infrastructure political assassinations and terrorist attacks as with the czech arms depots selling heavy weapons to various terrorist groups of course it seems insignificant compared to what is happening now in ukraine but it is a big problem for western politicians such actions will trigger a backlash and in the current very heated situation it could trigger an escalation spiral with unpredictable results western politicians are afraid to take the first step in this confrontation so their policies remain reactive there is nothing wrong with this attempt to protect their countries from any possible costs of this war however there is no need to cover up concern for themselves with the guise of concern for ukraine western society needs to take a sober view of the dangers posed by russia and first and foremost develop defense mechanisms and a second important point to remember is that inaction can also affect russia s ability to use hybrid attacks against western countries it was inaction and the lack of a clear strategy with the hope of what if it doesn t work that led us to this war np what are your objectives for the short term and for the longer term a the first important thing to understand is that this war could be a very long one much longer than many people currently think it will not be uniform in intensity but it will not be over completely for a long time the short term goals in these circumstances are what is needed right now in the process of war the long term goal is some kind of transition to a post war world the configuration of which is almost impossible to predict right now the main short term goal is of course to help ukraine win the war primarily for this purpose we work with our foreign friends from various progressive organizations around the world we try to make sure that the topic of ukraine does not disappear from the public discourse and try to promote the interests of ukraine we do this first of all by countering the myths created around ukraine and the war by russian propaganda and various stereotypes we support what our state is promoting in terms of arms supplies sanctions and confiscation of russian assets we also try to talk about the types of support that our government is not talking about the most important is the cancellation of the ukrainian international debt it is important not only to ease the financial situation in ukraine but also politically the debt has long been a way of stifling ukraine s development a way of keeping it on the periphery of europe this has benefited international financial institutions and ukrainian elites alike but not the people of ukraine the time has come to end it our goals within ukraine are primarily humanitarian we are a small organization and can t help everyone so we focus on helping affiliated organizations often trade unions and various workers and activist organizations although we believe that war is not the time to score political points we also have to campaign politically this is because some politicians have decided that war and martial law are a good way of pushing through unpopular bills the latest egregious example is bill 5371 that essentially destroys the rights of employees of small and medium sized enterprises which are seventy three percent of employers it is contrary to both eu and ilo international labor organization standards and was postponed until after the war due to public outcry we are trying by all available means to prevent this bill from being enacted we also help workers who have suffered from unscrupulous employers during the war with advice legal aid and publicity about their issues unfortunately the unity of ukrainian society began to crumble precisely with the desire of business owners to pass their costs onto workers for the longer term we see a place for a postwar ukraine in europe with a strong self sufficient economy a strong army a just social order and massive civic participation for this we need a political force that will unite progressive grassroots organizations it could be a political party or another form of political organization this force will have to work actively within ukraine and abroad our fate is inextricably linked to europe we want european integration but we want european integration with european trade unions labor movements and grassroots initiatives we do not want european integration with european business lobbyists and reactionary movements europe is now at a crossroads for years the wealth of the central countries has been ensured by shifting costs to the periphery the war is one consequence of the transfer of security costs to eastern europe the complete failure of this approach can no longer be ignored fair and equitable integration of ukraine into the eu may set a precedent for a redistribution of power within the eu and possibly closer integration and equalization of living standards between the different countries of europe another important topic will be framing the origins and causes of this war in public discourse it is important because we need not only to end this war but also to learn from it and eliminate its causes even now there is a political struggle over that for right wingers russia is practically a revival of communism and the soviet union but we see that the russian federation is the leader in terms of inequality and the anti leader in terms of civic engagement it s a corporate dictatorship where people are governed by the libertarian principle of do whatever you want as long as you don t touch my private life by suppressing public confrontation within the country putin has externalized the class conflict sending the poorest to fight imaginary foreign enemies so that they will not confront their real enemies the wealthy elite within the country we have to show that inequality and unresolved class conflicts are as dangerous to world security as tyranny it is not something that is an internal affair of countries inequality and related violations of people s rights should become as much a cause for various kinds of international restrictions as tyranny our era has been called globalization without values capitalists have easily invested in the businesses of tyrants and slave masters without thinking about the ethics and sustainability of such investments we should not discard globalization creating borders is what the right wingers want but we must build our global cooperation on the requirements of sustainability and respect for all human rights civil social cultural and so on the attempt to take shortcuts and go down the route of cutting costs at the expense of people must be seen as a threat to the stability and sustainability of development people must come before profits and this is exactly how russia s attack on ukraine poses the question europe and the world have to choose literally between the lives of ukrainians and the economic costs of the confrontation with russia i hope the world can make the right choice notes 1 roman romaniuk possibility of talks between zelenskyy and

menafn jordan times by barry eichengreen and poonam gupta new delhi one country stands out from the gloomy overall tone of the international monetary fund s imf recent update of its world economic outlook against the backdrop of tepid 3 2 per cent global growth in 2022 the imf expects india s gdp to expand by 7 4 per cent this is the fastest growth of any large economy except saudi arabia which is the incidental beneficiary of upward pressure on global oil prices from russian president vladimir putin s war against ukraine india may be buying russian crude at a discount but as the world s third largest oil importer it is still burdened by high oil prices one might quibble that india had an exceptionally difficult pandemic so it now has exceptional scope for bouncing back but other countries hit hard by covid 19 such as mexico are not doing nearly as well one might also note that with india s still rapid rate of population growth per capita incomes are rising more slowly than the aggregate gdp figures but a population growth rate of 1 per cent does not fundamentally change the story india s annual gdp growth in excess of 7 per cent is in fact the continuation of an ongoing acceleration from roughly 5 7 per cent in the 1990s to 6 2 per cent from the turn of the century to the 2008 global financial crisis and then to 6 9 per cent from the crisis to the eve of the pandemic the country has benefited from a buoyant tech sector surprisingly robust agricultural productivity gains and decent manufacturing growth with the worst of the pandemic now behind it the economy is firing on all cylinders the question is whether this can last unfortunately there are good reasons to believe that given current policies the answer is no to maintain its growth momentum india needs to export more the country has never been an export powerhouse to put it mildly exports of services help but the outsourcing of back office and customer facing services is now poised to slow as firms friend shore more of their operations the current government s commitment to investing in logistics seems promising but only time will tell how investment projects pan out rupee depreciation can make merchandise exports more competitive and limit consumption of imports but the reserve bank of india treating exchange rate stability as an important totem has been reluctant to let the rupee fall in the future indian exporters will face a less favorable external environment china s economy has slowed the united states may not be able to avoid recession and europe is already in one so it is not clear whence demand for india s exports will come every asian economy that has successfully expanded its manufacturing sector has scaled up by exporting but this avenue may no longer be available to india the country can of course borrow abroad to finance its current account deficit and domestic investment but india continues to underperform as a destination for foreign direct investment which is deterred by bureaucratic obstacles to doing business having discarded suggestions that it issue dollar bonds the government now seeks to encourage foreign investors to purchase local currency bonds but this revised strategy is no less risky foreign investors in local currency bonds tend to cut and run at the first sign of trouble since they otherwise will be hit by the double whammy of falling bond prices and a falling exchange rate nor does the government have space to borrow from residents to finance additional spending on the infrastructure health care and education needed to sustain long term economic growth general government debt is already 90 per cent of gdp the primary budget deficit which excludes interest payments is 3 per cent of gdp the government pays an average of 8 per cent interest on its debt but the authorities are able to keep interest rates at that level and maintain a veneer of debt sustainability only by requiring banks and other institutional investors to hold government bonds this in turn limits the banks ability to provide essential investment finance to the private sector meanwhile much of what the government takes in as revenue goes to entitlements and interest payments additional capital spending will therefore have to come from the private sector and private savings are low by international standards most fundamentally the government seems to have found it hard to implement structural reforms having experienced pushback from vested interests it has basically taken significant reforms of labor and product markets off the table given its favorable demography democratic polity and large and diversified economy india can in principle grow at 7 per cent or higher for years to come but the only route to such growth that remains open runs through structural reforms that relax all of the aforementioned constraints at a stroke barry eichengreen professor of economics at the university of california berkeley is the author most recently of

menafn web portal media the world economy is already coping with soaring inflation stock market turbulence and a grinding war are some of the causes leading to changes in the real estate market across the world as central banks throughout the globe swiftly boost interest rates skyrocketing borrowing costs mean people who were already pushing to buy property are finally reaching their limitations the consequences may be observed in canada the us and new zealand where markets for residential real estate once hot have abruptly gone cold a few properties on the market rising mortgage rates and new housing construction that cannot significantly affect demand are all variables that undoubtedly contribute to the general sentiment however this does not necessarily imply that now is the wrong moment to buy or to be a homeowner for everyone why invest in real estate investing in real estate can be one of your life s best investment decisions for example americans born between 1965 and 1979 make up the majority of homebuyers in the country 24 percent they also make up the majority of home sellers here are the main arguments for doing so even if you ve never invested in real estate many people make real estate investments to bolster their retirement income you can enhance your retirement income by owning a property you can use the monthly rental payment to supplement your income or sell a property you ve owned for a long time once you re retired and make a profit but the retirement benefits of having a home do not end here it also allows you to have regular income in your golden years through the reverse mortgage there aren t many other investments that let you put money into assets worth significantly more than what you put in as a result you can compel the value of the real estate to increase unlike stocks or bonds although it seems strange it is possible in the long run your home will end up giving you profit despite inflation and economic challenges the rewards from owning real estate improve if you buy and hold it since you can generate monthly cash flow from renting it out rather than just depending on the appreciation some of the latest trends in the real estate market real estate organizations predicted that the home market would dip when the pandemic hit but it never materialized instead the us s housing market was thriving by the summer of 2020 as first time millennial homebuyers were lured in by historically low mortgage rates as demand from homebuyers increased inventory shrank housing inventory had decreased by 32 from pre pandemic levels by the spring of 2021 they had to make an offer above the asking price if they wanted to prevail because there were more purchasers than available residences rising mortgage rates may eventually cause the housing industry to slow down for example every increase in mortgage rates drives away some potential purchasers however the short term effect is the opposite more homebuyers rush into the market out of fear that rates will continue to rise therefore despite historically low mortgage interest rates over the past two years it has been difficult for purchasers to locate homes on the market the beginning of 2022 saw this trend continue when purchasers can place an offer on a home heated competition among bidders has driven prices up although purchasers feel some relief as prices stabilize this does not mean that sellers are losing out the rate at which property values have increased over the previous two years is too high for buyers to keep up with for very long don t anticipate new buildings significantly affecting demand this summer or the remainder of this year home construction is frequently delayed due to ongoing supply chain challenges with appliances and building materials new technology and an influx of finance are causing significant changes in the real estate sector this surge in the capital should be taken as a hint that the real estate sector is getting ready for rapid change due to the emergence of new digital resources most importantly investors must be prepared for the influence of blockchain technology virtual reality smartphone apps and online property listing platforms on all facets of real estate transactions real estate property markets are anticipated to change when millennials a new wave of homebuyers enter the market moreover some markets can be booming while others are failing local employment is often the cause of this however people who couldn t afford a property in one community can move to another market thanks to the work from home option likewise it helps people who want to own a home but can t afford one in other markets and those without solid employment possibilities although suburban house developments are nothing new the real estate market may see some fascinating changes in these locations in the future it has been found that millennial homebuyers are more interested in walkable neighborhoods and close to community resources it should be good news for investors as suburban areas can represent fresh markets for mixed use and retail spaces in addition real estate investors may start to run into renters of all ages looking for more facilities in metropolitan regions

by daniel shin philanthropy is huge in america alone philanthropic donations reached 485 billion in 2021 despite the uncertainty about the continued spread of covid 19 the total amount of philanthropic giving grew by 4 percent year on year philanthropy is driven by mission purpose and passion donors are focused on building a more inclusive and equitable society they also aim to drive systemic change and sustainable social progress the majority of donations went to religion education health care and so forth gifts for arts culture humanities and environment also saw double digit growth prior to covid 19 approximately 78 million citizens of the united states volunteered and contributed 5 8 billion hours for public benefit religion sport culture and art are key areas where people were actively engaged in volunteering on top of their donations some might have done philanthropic giving to receive a charitable tax deduction though donors tend to provide their money capabilities and professional acumen to support charitable causes in ways that also sharpen up their own competitive edge philanthropy is an act of goodwill it helps to improve the well being of humankind and prevent social problems philanthropy is a driving force of social change it can be in the form of social movements for civil rights labor women s empowerment environmental and lgbtq issues philanthropy is not only providing necessary funding but also advocacy support for social change oftentimes donors do not want to let their left hand know what their right hand is doing in order to reach a critical mass it has to be done proactively and also transparently we have to learn to give we can give our time expertise love and compassion we should also educate young generations to be equipped with knowledge experience and skills to be more compassionate and engaged in various social causes we don t have to be rich to give none of us can ever run out of something worthwhile to give giving also means following the frontlines next generation leaders can catalyze entrepreneurship and innovations for philanthropy from early on in their life to strengthen citizenship organizations and communities philanthropy has long contributed to education leading research universities around the globe have produced leaders for all sectors and fields universities suit their students with a broad range of skills and the inspiration to shape the world for the better students will go on to tackle the most serious crises of humankind such as climate change with what they have learned the next generation leaders will be more representative by and large thanks to the diversity of philanthropic efforts universities can be a magnet for talent philanthropy in the form of endowment has made every part of the advanced learning experience more affordable for students from all backgrounds generosity building upon the tradition of philanthropy can help shepherd students into a brighter future philanthropic giving should be strategic so that it can prepare every mission driven student to pursue their last job not just first it would help students with intellectual frameworks competencies and digital literacies that are necessary to confront the challenges of tomorrow not just today it would help connect the dots especially for students to have meetings with mentors and advisors on potential career paths and help them to build necessary career portfolios that they are destined for philanthropy has to aim to connect people with disadvantaged backgrounds to bring their personal aspirations to fruition bearing public benefits philanthropy certainly helps embrace obligations for those who have been privileged with their achievement and reputation it will help them to leave the world just a little bit better off than they have found it science for example is not just for the elite or done by the highly educated philanthropy will open science to devise solutions innovatively engaging all backgrounds and disciplines from artists to engineers or entrepreneurs the impact of the work of philanthropy is certainly beyond business it should focus on affecting change by training the most skilled and compassionate leaders for all kinds of organizations to carry on their efforts everyone has to have a sense of belonging where their values are fully supported and encouraged and feel deeply that they are contributing to meaningful solutions for the betterment of society digital assets are poised to disrupt philanthropic donations crypto donation is like a lab for philanthropy some progressive blockchain leaders now make it possible to donate crypto currency to support science technology engineering and mathematics stem education donors tend to be young high net worth individuals making donations with crypto is also inspiring young generations to give by matching and facilitating directly between donors and recipients it provides a cause based impact investing opportunity for crypto holders in unprecedented ways blockchain projects offer donors the opportunity to easily participate in and monitor the activity of projects they support crypto donations are a growing trend tax authorities like the u s internal revenue service irs classify cryptocurrency donations as property meaning they are not subject to capital gains tax and are tax deductible hence donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law some progressive churches in silicon valley accept crypto for example which is no different than accepting a stock property or contribution in kind nonprofit leaders in education should also consider acceptance of such digital assets they should also determine whether to sell the donated crypto promptly like many other donated assets school administrators should decide if they would keep it as an investment or not being a philanthropist is like betting on how to move the needle on a social issue similarly crypto holders can appreciate the long term value of their bold investment positions they can choose to bring that approach to their supported causes as if they are investing in ideas and projects that may take years to manifest like making grants to education that take a generation to realize bringing the mindset of crypto investing to philanthropy especially in education presents uncharted opportunities to elevate new causes and potential solutions it will help bring in a fresh view on long standing social challenges donations are not simply a windfall to people poorer than donors instead it is an effective and thoughtful way to continue building the world and expanding the horizon of what crypto can do for the world daniel shin is a venture capitalist and senior luxury fashion

i love investing in real estate and it s a major reason why i was able to become a self made millionaire but i ve learned that buying a single family home to live in isn t always a great investment i realized this in 2003 when i was a newlywed with a newborn and bought my dream home in los angeles but as time went by i wasn t seeing a return on the money or time i put into my house so i sold it and used the equity to purchase a few rental properties then my family became renters again don t get me wrong i still support homeownership today i own three homes two of which i rent out and the third is my primary residence but at the end of the day for many people owning a home takes money out of their pockets here s why i believe buying a house isn t a wise investment especially right now with rising inflation and high home prices get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters 1 costs eat up profits let s say you bought a home for 100 000 and put a 5 000 down payment then 10 years later you sell the house for 200 000 it looks like you killed it you turned 5 000 into 100 000 after you pay your mortgage but you forgot to calculate the cost incurred to own that house 10 years of interest at 6 each year 60 000 60 000 10 years of property taxes at 2 each year 20 000 20 000 real estate fees of 6 6 000 total cost before maintenance 86 000 that leaves you with a net return of 14 000 or 14 of that 100 000 over 10 years your investment returned 1 4 per year and we didn t even include the cost of roof plumbing paint and other maintenance fees a good general rule to keep in mind is that you will spend about 1 of your home s purchase price on maintenance each year but those fees can be more expensive during times of high inflation tip don t buy a house expecting to make a true profit instead only buy when you have enough income whether it is passive or active to fund the cost of mortgage property taxes and upkeep 2 no cash flow makes you dependent on the market true real estate investments provide you with monthly passive income or cash flow after all the mortgage payments property taxes and maintenance when your home doesn t provide monthly cash flow its value is always tied to having a homebuyer who is qualified to buy and who likes your home you pay to live in it while you wait to maybe make a profit tough times often benefit the value of rental properties and hurt single family homeowners when i go to sell a rental property i only need to find someone who wants to make a profit and that s not hard to do tip only buy when you find a trophy property that s selling below its value can afford to pay in cash and are 99 certain there that there s a profitable exit due to the surrounding market 3 limited tax benefits compared to commercial real estate for instance you are limited to how much interest you can write off your home and you are only allowed a tax exemption of one 250 000 gain on the sale of a single family home every two years but when you go from investing in your house to investing in income producing real estate the tax benefits skyrocket while rental income is taxed there are certain expenses you may deduct on your tax return including mortgage interest property taxes operating expenses depreciation and repairs tip to make passive income off of real estate invest in rental properties with favorable tax situations so when is it a good idea to buy a home my opinion don t buy a home unless you can afford to waste money at best a home is a place to call your own and it can provide stability but if your goal is to create wealth there are so many other options such as stock market or commercial real estate investing i also don t believe that owning a home should be considered as the american dream for the most part it s simply a place to live and there are always costs attached correction this article has been updated to reflect that rental income is taxed grant cardone is the ceo of cardone capital bestselling author of the 10x rule and founder of the 10x movement and the 10x growth conference he owns and operates seven privately held companies and a 5 billion portfolio of multifamily projects follow him on twitter grantcardone don t miss sign up now get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter

augusta city councilors approved a tax break which over 30 years could return 7 8 million in tax revenues on the proposed new development of a 250 unit market rate housing complex off civic center drive to the developer councilors who have previously expressed support for the proposal said the development will help address a lack of housing in the city while bringing 250 people and their money to augusta to boost the local economy even with the tax break they said the project will still provide much more in revenues than the currently undeveloped property does now following a public hearing at which no members of the public spoke up about the project councilors approved the tax increment financing agreement in a 7 0 vote thursday councilors said the project by massachusetts based saxon partners wouldn t happen without a tax break if we stand pat this project wouldn t happen said mayor david rollins i think this is the groundbreaking development that s going to be a trigger for other development we might be the hottest real estate market in maine and we all need to be proud he added this has been a long term effort advertisement the agreement will return a larger percentage of tax revenues to the developer than the city typically grants to help fund the proposed development of a new 250 unit apartment complex off civic center drive the deal would return an estimated 312 000 a year in new property tax revenues expected to be generated by the project to the developer with 134 000 a year going to the city for 25 years and more than that the other five years over the 30 year span of the tif agreement the developer would get back about 7 8 million in taxes while the city would receive 5 6 million the city s standard tif agreements usually return no more than 50 of new revenues generated by a project to the developer an amount that keith luke the city s economic development director said is generally revenue neutral when the overall tax impacts are considered saxon initially sought a tif returning more than 77 of new revenues to it but verbally agreed to a 70 return after negotiating with the city s tif committee which unanimously recommends the tif be approved the committee includes rollins as well as ward 1 councilor linda conti and at large councilor raegan larochelle luke said saxon officials said they ve been unable to attract adequate private financing for the project without the tif because there is not a demonstrated market for this type of project in central maine augusta is really coming on said james bass a local attorney representing saxon partners the developer which is also currently working on similar developments near medical facilities in lewiston and biddeford but the outside world especially the investment community still looks at augusta as a tertiary market where they don t have the confidence they would in say portland or boston advertisement the project is expected to cost about 30 million to build and be assessed for tax purposes at a value of least 21 million luke said it would be built on what is now undeveloped land off civic center drive across from the intersection with leighton road near the augusta elks club the housing would be targeted at medical workers at the nearby mainegeneral medical center hospital and be 50 studio apartments and 50 one bedroom units according to bass the small size of the units saxon notes in its proposal to the city would make them unlikely to attract families with children and thus not add to local educational costs he said the complex would have numerous amenities onsite including common gathering areas for tenants the apartments would rent at market rates they would not be restricted to medical workers and proponents said they are expected to also attract state workers and other professionals in augusta officials noted it would help address a lack of housing in augusta the non subsidized housing would not directly address a noted lack of affordable housing in the city ward 2 councilor kevin judkins said an additional 250 units added to the local housing stock which is currently seeing low supply and high demand and thus increasing rental rates could help level off local rental rates by increasing supply related need for emergency housing expected to worsen in augusta officials have said benefits the project will bring to the city include tenants who ll pay an estimated 75 000 a year in excise taxes on their vehicles 90 000 a year in sewer and water fees to the greater augusta utility district and tenants who ll shop dine and work at local businesses advertisement tifs allow municipalities to shelter property taxes generated by new development within designated districts sheltering money through a tif means it would not be added to the city s total property valuation for state tax calculation purposes without that as a municipality s total property valuation increases its state provided revenue such as aid for education and revenue sharing decreases and its county tax bill increases new value sheltered in a tif does not count toward a municipality s property tax value so its state aid funding is not cut until the tif expires company officials said the current property only generates about 13 000 a year in property taxes councilors and the planning board previously approved a zone change to help make way for the development luke noted the tif agreement calls for specific timeframes to be met or the deal could be terminated they include breaking ground by dec 31 2021 and being complete within 36 months since the deal was first proposed city officials have made one change extending the life of the tif agreement from 25 to 30 years the maximum allowed by state rules with in the five additional years of the tif the city getting the full amount of the funds to use and none of the funds going back to the developer in each of those years municipalities can use funds collected in tif districts for a variety of uses approved by the state department of economic and community development helping to offset annual expenses send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
new york city desperately needs it workers to return to the office its economy depends on it but it s facing a particularly tricky problem after several horrific attacks in the city s subway system this year workers are telling their employers they are afraid to come back to work in two meetings this year some of the city s most powerful ceos confronted mayor eric adams demanding answers according to kathryn wylde the president and ceo of the partnership for new york city who arranged the meetings the executives came out very strong saying we can t in conscience bring our people back to work encourage them to ride the subways unless we see tangible evidence that you are doing something about this she recalls what the numbers show the ceos mobilized after a series of high profile attacks on commuters in a killing that shocked the city michelle go a 40 year old consultant for deloitte was pushed in front of an oncoming train in the times square subway station in april a gunman fired 33 rounds at commuters during rush hour in may daniel enriquez a goldman sachs executive was shot dead by a fellow passenger the killings put the city on edge and that wasn t lost on adams who addressed reporters right after go s killing to lose a new yorker in this fashion would only continue to elevate the fears of individuals not using our subway system adams said at the time so far this year the number of complaints in the transit system including assaults and harassment is almost the same as it was at this point in 2019 according to data from the metropolitan transportation authority but subway ridership is still nowhere near where it was before the pandemic it s roughly 60 of what it was in 2019 spencer platt getty images getty images new york city mayor eric adams speaks at a vigil for michelle go in new york n y on jan 18 go was killed in the times square subway station the subway attacks are contributing to a perception crime is on the rise in the city police statistics show that there have been fewer murders at this point than last year when the country was emerging from the lockdowns that characterized much of 2020 still the number of murders is sharply higher than at the same time in 2019 before the pandemic meanwhile the number of felony assaults is up year to date compared to both 2021 and 2019 and although new york city s crime numbers are still historically low almost half of registered voters who responded to a recent quinnipiac poll said crime is the most urgent issue facing new york city today wall street executives are also worried the killings of go and enriquez have also shaken wall street because they both worked for big financial institutions financial firms have also been prominent in pushing workers to return to their offices goldman sachs ceo david solomon is sensitive to the fears about crime we have to have a safe environment for people he told npr in a recent interview i think public safety is just paramount for the vitality of cities and the vitality of cities is paramount for economic activity in our country solomon who grew up in the suburbs outside of new york city said crime was higher when he was a kid in the 1970s and 1980s he remembered there were strict rules about where he could go and how late he could stay out solomon also said that when he raised his children in the city decades later it was

i love my dividend stocks and since i m still not retired market downturns let me buy more of what i own as i reinvest my dividends i have been entrusted with my family s finances it is not a task that i take lightly since a mistake on my part could leave us in the street ok that s hyperbole but it is the weight that i feel and bear markets don t make the weight any lighter however i have a playbook that i ve lived by for years and market sell offs are actually a great time for me to keep building my passive income stream here s how i make downturns work for me safety first i take my job as ensuring that my family has the financial wherewithal to handle financial adversity in relative stride to that end i have a laddered certificate of deposit cd portfolio with roughly six months worth of living expenses in it one of the six cds i own matures every two months and automatically rolls over if i don t stop that process from happening essentially i ve always got access to some cash if i really need it which makes buying stocks less stressful the key is that this vital safety net is on auto pilot i thought about it once setting it up and now i never have to think about it again i just know it s there keep it simple is a vital mantra for me because i m just not capable of juggling too many things at one time i share this because this same logic is important for my investment approach as well focus on success one of the suggestions you ll find in benjamin graham s iconic book the intelligent investor is to focus on companies with long histories of success a quick way to find such companies is to look at names with long histories of annual dividend increases dividend achievers 10 years of dividend increases dividend aristocrats 25 years and dividend kings 50 years are all great starting points from there you need to dig in a bit to find companies that are well run with modest leverage once you have a diversified list of names you like don t do anything just wait the market goes up and as we ve seen in 2022 down wait for the stocks you like to come to you i don t have a set buy point but i generally only make an addition when the dividend yield of a company i like is trading at the high end of its historical yield range it suggests that the price is at least cheap relative to historical norms during the covid 19 pandemic bear market i bought real estate investment trust reit federal realty frt 1 69 which has an over 50 year long streak of annual dividend hikes under its belt it s the longest streak in the reit space this reit owns a small retail portfolio that focuses on wealthy regions with sizable populations development and redevelopment are key company skills retail was deeply out of favor during the pandemic but this company has proven many times over that it can handle adversity and keep rewarding dividend investors like me during this year s downturn meanwhile i added texas instruments txn 0 01 and medtronic mdt 0 12 both are higher dividend growth names with long histories of annual dividend hikes that had unique issues but it took a bear to push them down to attractive levels finally that said investments pop up all the time so i also added kellogg k 0 04 in between those two bear markets when investors were downbeat on the iconic food stock because of company specific problems including a fire at a production facility and a strike kellogg s dividend hasn t increased annually but has trended regularly higher over time notably kellogg is actually up 15 or so this year as its production problems have abated mindless adherence to a plan here s the next big step i set all of those new purchases to dividend reinvest just like virtually all of my stock holdings and basically like my cd safety net it s the ultimate keep it simple move for me based on my approach i know i own companies that place returning value to shareholders high on the priority list i ve selected the dividend names i think are long term winners so i know i have great companies in my diversified portfolio and i ve set them on autopilot leaving me to watch the quarterly dividend checks transform into additional shares of great companies during bear markets i actually find it comforting to see that i m adding even more to a list of stocks that i own remember however that these are dividend stocks so every share i add actually increases the passive income i generate it s a slow process but my dividend income has headed steadily higher for years without me having to do much of anything simple is good autopilot is even better when i retire i plan to start collecting those dividend checks to supplement my social security payments slow and steady i d be lying if i said i didn t pay close attention to my portfolio i constantly monitor the news on my 20 or so stocks and listen to most of the earnings conference calls if something fundamental changes i ll rethink my commitment to a stock but what i don t do is fret constantly about the price of my holdings going up and down in the always volatile stock market i ve basically worked that out of my process by focusing on dividends dividend yield dividend reinvestment and my steadily growing stream of passive income in my investing world stock market sell offs are just another opportunity to invest and reinvest in great dividend stocks

washington nebraska examiner the u s house on friday cleared democrats long sought climate health care and tax package sending it to president joe biden for his signature the roughly 750 billion measure is much smaller than the 2 trillion reconciliation package the house originally sent to the senate in november the final product left out dozens of provisions including expanded child care tax credits and paid family leave that many left leaning democrats believe are desperately needed but democrats including progressives still championed the slimmed down version of thebill before voting 220 207 along party lines to approve the package debate on the bill friday was part of a brief one day session for house members who now will continue their august recess members aren t expected to return to washington d c until sept 13 democrats repeatedly called the legislation historic and said it showed their party putting people above politics the package would cap out of pocket expenses for medicare prescription drugs at 2 000 annually beginning in 2025 and allow the federal government to negotiate some of the more expensive prescription drugs starting in 2026 this is landmark legislation that is going to help reduce costs for american families while finally aggressively tackling the climate crisis energy and commerce committee chairman frank pallone jr a new jersey democrat said during floor debate we simply cannot wait any longer to confront the climate crisis he said extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more extreme and these extreme weather events cost families their loved ones their homes and their livelihoods maine democrat rep jared golden the sole member of his party to vote against the larger package in november announced friday just ahead of the vote that he would support this version it is fiscally responsible and is targeted on four key priorities reducing the national debt and putting our country back on a fiscally responsible path lowering the cost of prescription drugs and making health care more affordable investing in an all of the above energy strategy to significantly increase oil gas and renewable energy production to lower energy costs for americans and cracking down on the tax avoidance of billion dollar multinational corporations golden said in the statement gop slams irs funding republicans remained steadfastly opposed to the measure dubbed the inflation reduction act saying it would raise the costs of energy and boost the number of internal revenue service employees the package would provide about 80 billion in funding for the internal revenue service to boost tax enforcement a change that democrats argued during debate friday would not affect americans making less than 400 000 annually michigan republican rep fred upton weighed in against the bill saying that while he s no stranger to working on bipartisan legislation he simply couldn t support the package democrats brought to the floor friday our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic upton said we ve seen decades high inflation that is crushing main street and squeezing the middle class rep don bacon r neb who represents the omaha based 2nd congressional district echoed that criticism about the bill s timing he said raising taxes would not help americans who are already dealing with high prices supply chain issues and a recession this reckless and partisan bill is bad for nebraska families bad for nebraska businesses and bad for america s energy sector bacon said we can t keep asking the american taxpayers to shoulder the burden for the democrats reckless spending bacon and rep mike flood r neb who represents eastern nebraska s 1st district focused part of their post vote statements on the bill s funds to hire more help at the internal revenue service people who know the agency have said the bill would restore irs staffing to levels from previous decades flood said he emphatically voted no on this bill and that he would continue to push back on president biden s tax and spend agenda as the nation s economy slides further into recession and inflation wreaks havoc on household budgets congressional democrats are only making life harder for working americans who are trying to put food on the table and make a better life for their families flood said rep adrian smith r neb who serves nebraska s sprawling and largely rural 3rd district wrote in a recent column to his constituents that people who are serious about reducing inflation understand you can t achieve this by spending hundreds of billions upfront and allowing deficit reduction to trickle in over the next decade house gop whip steve scalise a louisiana republican rebuked democrats for advancing the bill speaking out against the energy climate health care and tax provisions he also chastised democrats for including the 80 billion to bolster staff and technology at the internal revenue service let s talk about these 87 000 irs agents you think of just about any nfl stadium in america filled completely with new irs agents that s right more than doubling the size of the irs scalise said house budget chairman john yarmuth a kentucky democrat called republicans statements about the irs hiring 87 000 new agents nonsense and noted that the current irs commissioner has said the agency won t increase audits on people making less than 400 000 annually it seems to me that republicans just don t want people to pay taxes even if they re owed yarmuth said noting that hundreds of billions of dollars in owed taxes go unpaid every year this is an attempt to try to recover some of that money that is owed and is not being paid by taxpayers who are in many cases cheating yarmuth added swifter house action house debate on the measure was nowhere near as long or tedious as it was in the u s senate where members spent saturday night into sunday debating 37 amendments beforevoting 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie to approve the package on aug 7 the bill primarily negotiated by senate majority leader chuck schumer and west virginia sen joe manchin iii would dedicate 370 billion to clean energy programs including electric vehicle tax credits and tax incentives for energy companies to produce renewable energy it would provide 1 5 billion to the environmental protection agency to help companies reduce methane a greenhouse gas and would impose a fee on companies for certain methane emissions as part of the deal with manchin the legislation requires the u s government to lease 2 million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of federal waters for oil and gas development in order to lease other federal lands and waters for solar or wind production the bill would boost funding for a federal trust fund thathelps coal miners diagnosed with black lung pay for their health care if the company they worked for doesn t do so virginia democratic rep bobby scott lauded the provision during floor debate saying that extending the tax will protect the long term sustainability of the black lung disability trust fund while ensuring that the coal industry does not shift the cost of benefits from coal companies to miners families or the taxpayer in other health provisions the package would require pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates if they raise the cost of some prescription drugs within medicare faster than inflation it would extend subsidies for three years for individuals who purchase health insurance as part of the affordable care act or obamacare to stave off a price hike that was expected to begin at the end of the year those enhanced subsidies were first approved as part of democrats covid 19 bill last year and were set to expire insulin cap in medicare the measure would cap the cost of insulin for medicare recipients at 35 but wouldn t apply a similar cap on co pays for people with private health insurance after republicans in the u s senate successfully blocked that provision house democratic whip jim clyburn a south carolina democrat said he was especially pleased with the bill s insulin provisions having experienced my late wife s 30 year battle with diabetes i m especially pleased that this bill would cap insulin costs at 35 a month for those on medicare clyburn said this is a giant step forward but we will continue to work to overcome the republican opposition that blocked extending the same life saving measures to those on private insurance the bill would be fully paid for by instituting a 15 minimum tax on corporations with incomes more than 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks as well as by allowing medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices democrats advanced the measure through the 50 50 senate and the narrowly divided u s house by using the budget reconciliation process a complicated path that requires the bill to comply with several rules democrats used the same legislative process to approve their 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief package last year republicans used budget reconciliation to pass their 2017 tax bill and the gop tried to use it to repeal and replace obamacare the same year but didn t have the votes in the senate to pass their proposal congress has used the process to enact 22 laws since 1980 according to the congressional

alan guebert writes farm and food in 1970 paul samuelson became the first american awarded the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences the honor came to the massachusetts institute of technology economist because he had simply rewritten considerable parts of economic theory true that samuelson had already written what would become the best selling college textbook on the subject economics now translated into 45 languages and soon would enjoy success as a magazine columnist writing about the dismal science with both wit and wisdom a hallmark of his writing was clever wisecracks like the pointedly true the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions and the economically profane every good cause is worth some inefficiency both jabs sting yet today inside the profession samuelson was known for sparring with the equally famous nobelist too milton friedman and boy didgovernment supporting samuelson disagree with old free markets friedman when it came to public policy however friedman usually won because his biggest economic convert ronald reagan rose to power preaching the friedman doctrine of government is the problem markets are the answer a generation of reagan acolytes then dominated conservative politics for 40 years samuelson however never bought into the friedman tenet that markets can regulate themselves on the contrary he said there can be no solution without government that s not so much a partisan statement as a simple fact of life the last several weeks confirm it again for example in late july congress finally approved the chips and science act which authorizes the government to invest 52 billion in u s based semiconductor manufacturing the final senate vote was decidedly bipartisan 49 democrats and 24 republicans why are taxpayers giving some of the richest u s corporations 52 billion because under free market globalism american semiconductor companies invested billions in cheap labor offshore manufacturing facilities to virtually abandon the u s under chips taxpayer billions will flow to companies that invest in essential american technology and national security here noted the boston globe aug 8 farmers know how this works entire sectors in u s agriculture like ethanol high fructose corn syrup crop insurance biodiesel supplemental food aid foreign export markets and natural resource conservation have thrived under protective government umbrellas for decades in the name of national security additionally extraordinary federal farm programs costs like the trump administration s recent trade war assistance arise periodically that spending separate from the standing farm bill cost totaled 115 5 billion between 2018 and 2021 and that type of additional spending is neither unique nor unusual just last week another 40 billion in climate change spending for the u s department of agriculture usda was pushed through congress by democrats a large chunk of that still baking pie will go to alternative farm based fuels such as ethanol biodiesel wind and solar while more billions will go directly to farmers and ranchers who adopt climate friendly changes in farming practices almost every national state and local ag group endorsed the climate bill while rural america s overwhelming republican congressional delegation ran from it only one major ag group the american farm bureau federation opposed it in explaining the opposition afbf president zippy duvall sounded more like milton friedman than any farmer and rancher farmers and ranchers support voluntary market driven programs he announced not an increase in taxes at a time when the country is entering a recession duvall is partly right farmers and ranchers do support voluntary market driven programs but they also support government ag spending that underwrites key sectors of u s agriculture such as alternative fuels crop insurance exports and food aid and it s not just agriculture this industrial policy reality is a key element in u s business sectors like energy defense infrastructure finance banking and now tech samuelson accepted this basic truth but friedman never did in fact after friedman died in 2006 the still sassy samuelson noted i wish friedman were still alive so he could witness how his extremism led to the defeat of his own ideas which in classic samuelson wit proved yet another of his oft quoted axioms funeral by funeral theory advances alan guebert is an agricultural journalist see past columns at farmandfoodfile com this article originally appeared on south bend tribune farm and food samuelson vs friedman economics

cnn whether you are afraid of being ripped off or just feel out of your depth in conversations with auto mechanics taking your car in for maintenance can be stressful jessica chou knows that stress and how it can be compounded by gender stereotypes around car knowledge when she was younger she would fake a call to her father or boyfriend while at a mechanic in the hopes it would help her avoid overpaying for repairs eventually chou decided studying up on her vehicle might help her more she has amassed 30 000 plus followers on youtube since she began posting videos in 2016 to document how she s learned to work on her car now chou is director of brand marketing for repairsmith an auto repair company and works with hundreds of mechanics due to her experience on both sides of the industry chou understands consumers as well as the behind the scenes work that goes into car maintenance when i started my youtube channel i was frustrated i was angry chou said i didn t bash mechanics openly on my channel but i had this feeling that oh they re always trying to take advantage of me especially because i m a woman and that s not the case mechanics may not be trying to rip you off but a little knowledge about maintenance can help you save money and avoid stress here s what you should know when you take your car in don t skimp on the details even if you know nothing about the technical aspects of your car you likely know more about the way it typically runs than a mechanic a weird sound coming from a certain location can mean many things but if you are able to explain when it happens where it s coming from and what it s like you can help the mechanic find the issue faster you can also make things easier by telling the mechanic when the problem began chou said if you hit something be honest about it mechanics aren t fortune tellers chou said diagnostics are required and oftentimes places charge for diagnostics it takes an hour two hours if not more to find where the issue s coming from it can also be helpful to tell the mechanic your car history including problems you may have experienced and whether you have been putting off routine maintenance avoid pretending or essentially lying to them about whether you ve taken care of your car or not chou said give them more helpful clues so that they can pinpoint the issue when describing problems try to refrain from diagnosing the issue said california based mechanic rebekah fleischaker the best thing to do is give as much detail as possible so the mechanic can properly diagnose and fix the problem going to a mechanic is like going to a doctor fleischaker said one may know the symptom but not the cause of the problem in my experience the more information you give your doctor or mechanic the better and less costly the result ask questions one of the best ways to avoid getting ripped off is to ask questions fleischaker said some questions recommended to ask before maintenance include what are you going to do can you explain why asking the level of how complicated the repair might be will give you a better understanding of why they re charging four hours for labor chou said asking the level of how complicated the repair might be will give you a better understanding of why they re charging four hours for labor chou said what parts will you be using can i see the before and after parts sometimes mechanics will charge you for parts they did not replace so asking to see the replaced parts can help you avoid overpaying fleischaker said sometimes mechanics will charge you for parts they did not replace so asking to see the replaced parts can help you avoid overpaying fleischaker said can you explain what this part does why do i need it replaced before paying fleischaker and chou advise asking the mechanic to break down the charges for you doing so helps ensure you are only paying for the maintenance actually done on your car and will allow you to avoid hidden costs i appreciate when people ask me so why is it so expensive fleischaker said great gives me an opportunity to break down why and the why for me is different than other people if you don t understand the answers don t be afraid to ask follow up questions if the person who s giving you the estimate cannot explain why the price is that that s not your person fleischaker said just remember to ask your questions respectfully and not be accusatory chou said at the end of the day mechanics are people too chou added and people love talking about themselves and what they do get a second opinion google is your best friend chou said if you are afraid of being ripped off you can use google to match prices and find reviews of mechanics reach out for a second opinion it s ok to call around and talk to other shops and say oh i got a quote for 500 how much would you charge chou said a lot of people do that and it doesn t offend us we want you to be able to afford the repair when getting second opinions make sure to compare apples to apples and not apples to oranges fleischaker said adding it s one of the reasons to ask exactly what mechanics are charging you for learn the basics of your car a way to avoid being ripped off is to know the basics of your car chou said it can be helpful in general as well as save a trip to a mechanic you don t need to be an expert but foundational knowledge about your vehicle and an understanding of basic maintenance items can help you with mechanics she added in case you don t have time to memorize your owner s manual here are some basics which can vary by make and model what temperature your car runs at normally what the parts and lights on your car s gauge cluster and dashboard mean it is good practice for drivers to look at their dashboard to check that their fuel levels and temperatures are normal fleischaker said drivers should also make sure that the check engine air bag sometimes reads as srs tire pressure oil and abs anti lock braking system lights are not on it is good practice for drivers to look at their dashboard to check that their fuel levels and temperatures are normal fleischaker said drivers should also make sure that the

few things such as inflating your tires and changing your air filters windshield wiper blades oil and spark plugs you can fix on your own but of course there are many other repairs such as fuel leaks battery installation anything brake related and electrical and engine work you ll want to leave to a professional these areas if not fixed properly can lead to further damage chou said and worse make

new york city desperately needs it workers to return to the office its economy depends on it but it s facing a particularly tricky problem after several horrific attacks in the city s subway system this year workers are telling their employers they are afraid to come back to work in two meetings this year some of the city s most powerful ceos confronted mayor eric adams demanding answers according to kathryn wylde the president and ceo of the partnership for new york city who arranged the meetings the executives came out very strong saying we can t in conscience bring our people back to work encourage them to ride the subways unless we see tangible evidence that you are doing something about this she recalls what the numbers show the ceos mobilized after a series of high profile attacks on commuters in a killing that shocked the city michelle go a 40 year old consultant for deloitte was pushed in front of an oncoming train in the times square subway station in april a gunman fired 33 rounds at commuters during rush hour in may daniel enriquez a goldman sachs executive was shot dead by a fellow passenger the killings put the city on edge and that wasn t lost on adams who addressed reporters right after go s killing to lose a new yorker in this fashion would only continue to elevate the fears of individuals not using our subway system adams said at the time so far this year the number of complaints in the transit system including assaults and harassment is almost the same as it was at this point in 2019 according to data from the metropolitan transportation authority but subway ridership is still nowhere near where it was before the pandemic it s roughly 60 of what it was in 2019 spencer platt getty images getty images new york city mayor eric adams speaks at a vigil for michelle go in new york n y on jan 18 go was killed in the times square subway station the subway attacks are contributing to a perception crime is on the rise in the city police statistics show that there have been fewer murders at this point than last year when the country was emerging from the lockdowns that characterized much of 2020 still the number of murders is sharply higher than at the same time in 2019 before the pandemic meanwhile the number of felony assaults is up year to date compared to both 2021 and 2019 and although new york city s crime numbers are still historically low almost half of registered voters who responded to a recent quinnipiac poll said crime is the most urgent issue facing new york city today wall street executives are also worried the killings of go and enriquez have also shaken wall street because they both worked for big financial institutions financial firms have also been prominent in pushing workers to return to their offices goldman sachs ceo david solomon is sensitive to the fears about crime we have to have a safe environment for people he told npr in a recent interview i think public safety is just paramount for the vitality of cities and the vitality of cities is paramount for economic activity in our country solomon who grew up in the suburbs outside of new york city said crime was higher when he was a kid in the 1970s and 1980s he remembered there were strict rules about where he could go and how late he could stay out solomon also said that when he raised his children in the city decades later it was extraordinarily safe the city is certainly less safe he said talking about the present i would say it s a little grittier and a little dirtier he said new york city is not alone in dealing with public safety issues billionaire ken griffin recently decided to move citadel s headquarters from chicago to miami citing the city s longstanding problems with crime in a statement to npr the hedge fund said it was having a hard time recruiting top talent from across the world to chicago given the rising and senseless violence in the city spencer platt getty images getty images people walk outside of the new york stock exchange nyse on july 25 in new york city wall street firms including goldman sachs have been pushing their workers to return to work the worries about the city s future of course everyone s sense of safety is different what worries wylde of the partnership for new york city is how this will affect young people with polls showing they feel more apprehensive about riding the subway and crime more generally when wall street executives talk about return to office plans they often emphasize how important it is for young people to get back to the office so they don t miss out on mentoring and other career opportunities wylde who lived in new york since the late 1960s remembers when crime rates were much higher than they are today but she notes that many of today s residents came at a time when the city was safer a whole generation of new yorkers never gave a thought to their personal safety and security because we were the safest big city in america perhaps the world says wylde and executives like wylde worry that new york city could lose some of its appeal to companies and workers if the worries about safety continue to take hold copyright 2022 npr to see

this year workers are telling their employers they are afraid to come back to work in two meetings this year some of the city s most powerful ceos confronted mayor eric adams demanding answers according to kathryn wylde the president and ceo of the partnership for new york city who arranged the meetings the executives came out very strong saying we can t in conscience bring our people back to work encourage them to ride the subways unless we see tangible evidence that you are doing something about this she recalls what the numbers show the ceos mobilized after a series of high profile attacks on commuters in a killing that shocked the city michelle go a 40 year old consultant for deloitte was pushed in front of an oncoming train in the times square subway station in april a gunman fired 33 rounds at commuters during rush hour in may daniel enriquez a goldman sachs executive was shot dead by a fellow passenger the killings put the city on edge and that wasn t lost on adams who addressed reporters right after go s killing to lose a new yorker in this fashion would only continue to elevate the fears of individuals not using our subway system adams said at the time so far this year the number of complaints in the transit system including assaults and harassment is almost the same as it was at this point in 2019 according to data from the metropolitan transportation authority but subway ridership is still nowhere near where it was before the pandemic it s roughly 60 of what it was in 2019 spencer platt getty images getty images new york city mayor eric adams speaks at a vigil for michelle go in new york n y on jan 18 go was killed in the times square subway station the subway attacks are contributing to a perception crime is on the rise in the city police statistics show that there have been fewer murders at this point than last year when the country was emerging from the lockdowns that characterized much of 2020 still the number of murders is sharply higher than at the same time in 2019 before the pandemic meanwhile the number of felony assaults is up year to date compared to both 2021 and 2019 and although new york city s crime numbers are still historically low almost half of registered voters who responded to a recent quinnipiac poll said crime is the most urgent issue facing new york city today wall street executives are also worried the killings of go and enriquez have also shaken wall street because they both worked for big financial institutions financial firms have also been prominent in pushing workers to return to their offices goldman sachs ceo david solomon is sensitive to the fears about crime we have to have a safe environment for people he told npr in a recent interview i think public safety is just paramount for the vitality of cities and the vitality of cities is paramount for economic activity in our country solomon who grew up in the suburbs outside of new york city said crime was higher when he was a kid in the 1970s and 1980s he remembered there were strict rules about where he could go and how late he could stay out solomon also said that when he raised his children in the city decades later it was extraordinarily safe the city is certainly less safe he said talking about the present i would say it s a little grittier and a little dirtier he said new york city is not alone in dealing with public safety issues billionaire ken griffin recently decided to move citadel s headquarters from chicago to miami citing the city s longstanding problems with crime in a statement to npr the hedge fund said it was having a hard time recruiting top talent from across the world to chicago given the rising and senseless violence in the city spencer platt getty images getty images people walk outside of the new york stock exchange nyse on july 25 in new york city wall street firms including goldman sachs have been pushing their workers to return to work the worries about the city s future of course everyone s sense of safety is different what worries wylde of the partnership for new york city is how this will affect young people with polls showing they feel more apprehensive about riding the subway and crime more generally when wall street executives talk about return to office plans they often emphasize how important it is for young people to get back to the office so they don t miss out on mentoring and other career opportunities wylde who lived in new york since the late 1960s remembers when crime rates were much higher than they are today but she notes that many of today s residents came at a time when the city was safer a whole generation of new yorkers never gave a thought to their personal safety and security because we were the safest big city in america perhaps the world says wylde and executives like wylde worry that new york city could lose some of its appeal to companies and workers if the worries about safety continue to take hold copyright 2022 npr to see

these high growth stocks are down notably but could make a roaring comeback there s arguably no better way to supercharge an investment portfolio than investing in growth stocks considering that tech stocks which are commonly looked to for their opportunities for high growth have been absolutely crushed this year today s market dip is a fantastic time to buy here s a closer look at vici properties vici 1 29 exp world holdings expi 1 22 and wework we three real estate growth stocks that different motley fool contributors believe could supercharge your portfolio over the next ten years or more a casino reit with no vacancies and tons of growth mike price vici properties when i think of growth stocks i usually think of software companies developing the next big thing or biotech businesses with a new drug you wouldn t think of a casino real estate investment trust reit that owns some of the most well known properties in the world as a high growth stock but vici properties fits the bill vici has grown adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from 690 million in 2017 to 2 5 billion today and did 29 billion worth of deals in that time and that growth is still coming total revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was 76 higher than in q2 2021 the company now owns 43 properties with several on the las vegas strip it collected 100 of rent during the pandemic and has zero vacancies and 96 of its leases have escalators based on the consumer price index over the long term perhaps the most impressive stat of all is that the stock is actually up this year while most reits are down 15 and some are down as much as 60 vici is up over 10 year to date and its dividend currently yields 4 2 that performance means it isn t quite in the same contrarian boat as the other stocks in this article but at 18 times its estimated 2022 adjusted funds from operations affo the stock still looks cheap if you re not convinced yet vici has more potential growth and diversification in the pipeline in q2 it entered into loan agreements totaling 259 million with bigshots golf cabot another golf company and great wolf resorts an operator of water parks these agreements provide diversification from the casino business while staying within the reit s wheelhouse of recreation in general the cabot and bigshots agreements also give vici the option to purchase real estate once it has been developed and lease it back flipping the switch on real estate brokerages liz brumer smith exp world holdings exp world holdings has completely flipped the way that real estate brokerages operate as the first and only 100 virtual brokerage this cloud based company has amassed close to 83 000 agents from 21 different countries across the globe this is undoubtedly thanks to its unique operational and commission structure which allows commercial and residential agents to earn more with an 80 20 split for commissions equity based incentives and capped transaction fees since 2017 it s provided an incredible 58 annualized return growing by over 893 its revenue has increased by over 3 500 while net income and earnings per share eps have grown by over 600 this is all absolutely staggering and its past growth isn t an anomaly the earnings report for q2 2022 showed revenue growing by 42 to 1 4 billion while gross profit increased by 34 and the company has zero debt being in such a healthy financial position at a time of accelerated growth makes this one of my top growth stocks to buy on the market dip the stock is down 80 from recent highs and trading at a price to earnings ratio of roughly 43 which is cheap compared to most growth stocks the company also raised its dividends by 13 this past quarter putting its current dividend yield at just under 1 down but far from out kristi waterworth wework although covid 19 was a complete kick in the pants causing wework s stock price to collapse on uncertainty about the future of in office work and the demand for flexible work spaces the business has remained surprisingly robust wework has been undergoing some severe restructuring that has changed some things about its business but this extra effort has also caused the company to examine what kinds of properties and lease arrangements are the most profitable and desirable we work is far from being gone and is still making strategic purchases that better serve its pandemic era business model for example in march 2022 it acquired common desk a competitor in the co working space along with that company s 23 locations in texas and north carolina these markets are still in high growth mode making the 21 million price tag seem pretty palatable of course a spending spree is hardly a reason to buy a stock but what s come of this restructuring has been a significant gain in revenue and a decrease in total expenses for the six month period ending june 30 2022 wework saw an overall gain of 33 in revenue coupled with a 36 decrease in total expenses versus the same period a year prior although workstation capacity in june 2022 was down 2 year over year to about 917 000 memberships increased 39 from 517 000 to 720 000 physical occupancy has also increased dramatically from 53 in june 2021 to 72 in june 2022 this is due in part to the decrease in workstation capacity but is far more attributable to that huge jump in memberships free cash flow also continues to climb with fcf for the six months ending june 30 2022 at negative 710 million compared to negative 1 33 billion one year earlier although wework is still far from being in the black this is a 46 increase in free cash flow which is definitely a sign of recovery wework has a long way to go before it s back on solid ground but it s undoubtedly headed in that direction this is why it s such a good buy right now while the price is down as workers continue to return to offices and co working spaces this stock is destined to become a jewel in the portfolio of anyone lucky enough to pick it up at a discount
