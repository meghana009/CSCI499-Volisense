between the us and iran to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement was the catalyst for the price rise if talks are successful it may allow iran to lift crude supplies on the global market however on the weekend britain france and germany warned against moves to exploit the iran nuclear negotiations despite almost sealing a deal to revive the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa to contain iran s nuclear activities talks stalled after russia said it was demanding guarantees that the western sanctions imposed on its economy following its invasion of ukraine would not affect its trade with iran nobody should seek to exploit jcpoa negotiations to obtain assurances that are separate to the jcpoa spokespersons for the british french and german foreign ministries said in a ststement

the government to cut the excise tax on petrol which currently stands at 44 cents per litre it comes at a time when prices are hovering around the 2 20 mark in city and suburban centres and are even higher in regional centres the fuel excite is a flat tax that pays for infrastructure south australian liberal premier steve marshall is using his re election campaign to call for the cut while members of the federal parliament including queensland liberal national senator susan mcdonald said the idea of pausing the fuel excise or a portion of it i think is something that we re going to have to look at because we just can t afford to absorb the prices that we re looking at currently victorian nationals mp anne webster contacted the treasurer to see what could be done i contacted the treasurer s office last week about this notion of the excise being reduced to ease the burden for residents she said the information i got back on that was that at that point in time it was not on the table the argument against a cut is the damage it would do to infrastructure spending the road network is very important to my constituents and that fuel excise goes towards the maintenance and construction of country roads nationals mp mark coulton said so it may be a discussion but i wouldn t be rushing into this deloitte access economics economist chris richardson says it is too early to make the call these sort of tax bandaids are easy to go on but they are horrendously hard to come off he said it may already be last week s problem the prices people are paying at the pump today are because of where oil was at the start of last week it s already about us1 a litre lower a barrel in markets if it stays there that could be anything up to 15c a litre lower in the next week or two in australia prime minister scott morrison is pointing to the upcoming budget to guidance on the matter he says he is looking to ease cost of living pressures but petrol prices must be addressed at a global level us market inflation and the higher cost of living is also the talk of the town in the us as the federal reserve gets sets to raise interest by 25 to curb inflationary pressures after a 25bp hike at the march meeting we see the fed delivering an additional five 25bp rate hikes this year followed by four hikes in 2023 to end the year at 2 625 morgan stanley nyse ms s economics team said in a note as with most countries the us is managing surging prices for fuel food and housing which has led inflation to its highest point in four decades the rate hike is complicated by the current war and wide ranging sanctions imposed on russia that have disrupted trade flows and undermined the county s economic recovery the announcement to raise rates is set for wednesday the fed is being tugged in two different directions by the massive increase in energy prices that s taken place over the last few weeks david wilcox a former senior advisor to three successive fed chairs told afp higher inflation justifies the tightening moves however the reduction in purchasing power that households are experiencing would call for a more accommodative stance of policy a more cautious approach wilcox who is now with the peterson institute for international economics and bloomberg economics said i suspect the fed will buy themselves some time to see how the ukraine situation unfolds said andrew mitchell a portfolio manager at ophir asset management this meeting is one of the quarterly ones where they update their projections or dot plots and we ll probably see that double to six 0 25 rate hikes this year up from just three expected last december on the market side technology fell the most with apple down 2 4 and tesla down 5 1 european markets rose on friday with banks

unveiled a 2 billion euros 3 billion package to help consumers struggling with soaring fuel prices french prime minister jean castex announced the french government would reduce petrol and diesel prices by 15 centimes per litre the state reimburse gas station owners for the difference that means every time you fill up for 60 euros you save around nine euros castex said like australia the french government is under pressure to cut fuel taxes ahead of presidential elections next month more than half of prices at the pump in france are made up of taxation
new haven connecticut monday september 17 2018 debate between candidates for governor republican bob stefanowski left and democrat ned lamont right monday evening at the shubert theatre in new haven the gubernatorial debate is sponsored by the connecticut association of realtors in partnership with wtnh news 8 peter hvizdak hearst connecticut media after walking a budget tightrope with no safety net for most of the past two decades connecticut state government has socked away almost 4 8 billion since 2018 and could nearly double that by mid 2023 but while that s three and half times what connecticut saved in the prior 25 years combined the state s debt has somehow gotten worse by a lot state officials secured short term prosperity and less volatile finances for the foreseeable future

article continues below this ad lamont who took office in january 2019 has some good reasons to say that taking advantage of a new savings program the legislature ordered in 2017 the democratic governor has kept the budget balanced and avoided major tax hikes that s a sharp contrast from the 2010s a decade plagued by deficit forecasts and remembered for two of the largest tax hikes in state history connecticut which muddled through most of the past decade with no fiscal cushion achieved the legal maximum rainy day fund allowed by law under lamont 15 percent of annual operating expenses which amounts to about 3 1 billion advertisement article continues below this ad equally unprecedented connecticut is poised to dump billions of extra dollars into its cash starved pension funds in just a few years with the rainy day fund full the state hit another first under lamont last fall shifting a 1 6 billion surplus from the 2020 21 budget year into the pensions that s on top of the 2 9 billion in regular contributions already budgeted for pensions for state employees and municipal teachers and with analysts projecting another 4 4 billion in black ink across this fiscal year and next combined the pension funds could see a short term infusion of cash like never before the governor predicted that once those extra payments are made the state s regular required pension contributions could drop significantly that means hundreds of millions of dollars that could support education health care transportation municipal aid or tax relief advertisement article continues below this ad those surplus projections have been fueled in part by a stock market that has largely been robust since 2018 despite a rough first month in 2022 connecticut s economic recovery and fiscal health continue to improve state treasurer shawn wooden a hartford democrat said in february adding that the state s cash flow and not just the surplus is at a historic high as well this gives us the potential to continue to responsibly pay down connecticut s pension liabilities at an accelerated rate even as it saves more ct s debt increases but there s another side to that coin advertisement article continues below this ad connecticut reported 95 billion in unfunded obligations last fall a combination of bonded debt and unfunded pension and retirement health care responsibilities that s almost 30 percent more debt than the state reported in 2016 before five years of balanced budgets careful savings and an unprecedented supplemental pension payment connecticut which already ranked as one of the most indebted states in the nation appears to have gotten worse this is why people have a hard time trusting the people currently running our state government said madison republican bob stefanowski who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to lamont and is hoping for a rematch this year politicians making political calculations to protect their headlines rather than protecting the state s taxpayers and the bottom line advertisement article continues below this ad some of that extra debt was really always there the legislature adopted more conservative assumptions about pension fund investment returns over the past few years dropping them from an annual average of 8 percent or more to about 7 percent pension debt is calculated over 25 or 30 years and lowering the assumed revenue from investments means more contributions must come from the taxpayers but that wasn t the only change that affected pension debt governors and legislatures also refinanced the state s pension obligations three times in the past four years debt payments involving both retirement benefit programs and bonding consumed only 12 percent of the annual budget in the mid 1990s but were eating nearly 30 percent by 2017 the state had failed to properly save for its pensions for more than 70 years forfeiting billions of dollars in potential investment earnings needed to cover benefits and leaving the present generation to make up the difference advertisement article continues below this ad analysts warned finances would hit bottom around 2030 when spiking payments could be quadruple what they were in the mid 2010s likely crippling most other programs and forcing unprecedented tax hikes lamont and his predecessor gov dannel p malloy worked with legislatures to smooth out those spikes shifting billions of dollars in debt plus interest onto taxpayers in the late 2030s and 2040s but they didn t just lower required contributions for the spike years that are still to come they also restructured payments in the near term making their own budgets easier to manage while shifting even more burdens onto future taxpayers for example lamont restructured the teachers pension so that connecticut actually contributed 128 million less during his first two years in office than it had during malloy s last year on the job advertisement article continues below this ad and the 2 9 billion connecticut must contribute this year to the two major pension funds combined this fiscal year also is roughly 630 million less than the payments the state would be facing had it not refinanced both pensions in 2019 according to actuaries projections from three years ago in other words some portion of the big surpluses connecticut now enjoys stems from slowing down its payment of pension debt it s incomprehensible that our debt obligations have gone from 75 billion to 95 billion over the last five years while gov lamont and the democrats in charge of the legislature take their victory laps stefanowski said connecticut s businesses are keeping a close watch on debt levels but the jury is still out on whether everyone feels good about them advertisement article continues below this ad our larger businesses are very aware of the long term liabilities connecticut has and that it s been a little bit of a noose around the neck said chris dipentima president and ceo of the connecticut business and industry association and while the cbia applauds the supplemental pension payments made over the past year and a half he added anything that makes state debt levels and potentially future tax rates likely to climb remains an impediment to business confidence and job growth house republicans questioned whether pension refinancings couldn t have been delayed until the late 2020s saving connecticut s children huge burdens in the future politicians memories are limited to the election cycle said house minority leader vincent j candelora they fail to look holistically where we are as a state advertisement article continues below this ad democrats fiscal good news extends way beyond surpluses but while the overall debt level has increased lamont says connecticut has gained something very valuable fiscal stability for the first time in decades state officials can look at the planned pension payments significant though they are and imagine a scenario in which connecticut can manage them when the state is making its full pension payment plus supplemental payments it demonstrates to residents and businesses that the state is creating a predictable sustainable and structural budget environment to increase attractiveness as a great place to establish roots melissa mccaw who stepped down earlier this month as lamont s budget director said in february advertisement article continues below this ad the two year budget lamont and lawmakers enacted last june increases aid to cities and towns by nearly 200 million per year on average without imposing any major tax hikes without refinancing those funds would likely have gone into the pension system or taxes would have gone up and while other states are fearful of what will happen when billions of dollars in emergency federal pandemic relief expires two years from now connecticut has relatively little to worry about analysts now project state finances for 2023 24 have a built in hole of 520 million but that doesn t include another 680 million they expect to be captured by the volatility adjustment those funds plus the 3 1 billion in the state s rainy day fund would enable the next governor and legislature to easily manage state finances even without lost federal pandemic relief advertisement article continues below this ad we haven t had a recession in a long time and some of this prosperity is going to be throttled back eventually lamont told business leaders with the exception of the pandemic induced economic slump of 2020 connecticut has not faced a traditional recession since early 2010 but with probably the biggest rainy day fund per capita in the country lamont added we re relatively well prepared part 2 of the update to a legacy of debt to be published on ctmirror org on march 20 will examine proposals to reduce the state s savings habits and invest more in education health care tax cuts and other programs that sacrificed for years as debt payments gobbled up resources
giorgio trovato unsplash why did the trilateral commission the imf and world bank all decide not to launch their digital currency in the late 1970s opting for just scanning products at grocery stores instead because they didn t have wi fi and cell towers they had lasers as they do now in check outs in stores butso banks could know your credit rating when you walk through the door they could only use lasers at that time and lasers are visible and intimidating it was also the fact thatin the late 1970s the rollout of the laser checkouts was slow asbut with time and a lack of public vigilance everyone is getting a dose of radiation at the self checkout machine the american oligarchs simply waited until they had past media consolidation in the 1990s and completely took over the media creating the system of censorship by omission if you don t report the story it doesn t exist but as the internet was becoming a realityappeared out of the journalist collective in the wto protests in 1999 in seattle washington that s when theso as not to raise eyebrows completely amongst the civil society groups with the success of indymedia org worldwide the fbi was set upon indymedia org hard drives everywhere were confiscated in fbi raids using george w bush s new terrorism infrastructure being pointed at americans i still can t find all of my articles that i wrote over the last 20 years thanks to the destruction by the federal government of the united states of the indymedia org system they were able to get a black president to murder africans for the george w bush agenda this is how powerful the corporate control the military control of the media and the messaging has become this is exactlythis is how they got everyone at the legislative level to march in lockstep withlying to the public about the number of those that died of covid bylumping those that died with covid in with those that died of covid inflating the numbers and therefore committing fraud medical fraud is a serious charge and that fraud in attempting to impose a digital architecture on aspects of our lives in which we give up all privacy is fascism and i don t doubt there was a great deal of arm twisting of officials by corporate private contractors or mercenaries as we used to call them to get the ramp built tothe problem with the bosses is logic in imposing a digital infrastructure on all of society with a digital only currency is that it doesn t take into the account human behavior humans relish their privacy and when they are starting a business based on profound intellectual properties that must be kept secret in their development humans will revert to unsanctioned methods of keeping their s secret most human beings do not like the invasion of privacy but will accept some of itas punishment for what the digital infrastructure determines is antisocial behavior such as attending a protest against the digital infrastructure the reason the digital infrastructure and digital currency will fail is simply thatpeople will revert to precious metals jewels and property swaps as workarounds to the data hungry digital infrastructure thatthe cia perfected digital spying in order to steal intellectual property intangible or patented from small business before they can become big business and competitors to the corporate oligarchy the cia has always been there for the fossil fuel industry as america ran out of light sweet crude to sell the world it set its sights on taking control of foreign oil with false flag armed invasions and political subterfuge run directly by the cia this launched the petrodollar when nixon took america off the gold standard and put the dollar on the oil standard today howeverwhat the digital infrastructure represents is what i like to callgovernments and corporations as well as the military will know exactly how much money you make and how much taxes you must pay and they will know exactlyat any given time as longabsolute accounting means the irs whom americans pay their taxes to voluntarily according to the constitution of the united states can simply take your money claiming you owed more they will also be able to impose fines for jaywalking and fines for being at a protest that didn t have a permit absolute accounting means exactly what it sounds like as long as you are in the digital infrastructure you will have no privacy to work on ideas inventions and other intellectual properties tangible and intangible without being spied upon based oni read holly sklar s book trilateralism in the early eighties and have been tracking the digital enterprise ever since my father was deeply involved in developing much of the digital infrastructure prior to 1980 as he was involved in top secret cold war projects through atomic energy of canada and before that through an electronic instruments company that was a norad cover for his highest of all security ratings work the one things he told me as i was playing chess against one of his computers at the whiteshell nuclear research facility is thathe even told me about technology the russians were developing where they could simplywi fi simply amounts to a military corporate coup in order to spy on everyone this is what they actually mean bygathering intelligence not through clairvoyance but absolute spying on every detail of everyone s life wi fi has made the digital infrastructure and a digital only currency a possibility in the simple minds of the ruling class who are not geniuses but unfortunately money has a way of fooling people into thinking they are geniuses and having extra judicial rights over the lives of their employees or potential employees the investor class and their corporate and military minions are infantilizing digital technology into a base animal to maintain wealthy elite income streams whilethis cannot stand and because of human behavior it will not stand as humans will simply revert to gold other precious metals and jewels and the wealthy will become targets of thieves who will steal their gold and jewels to fuel a black market economy on top of that i have no doubt that revolutionary guerrilla armies will be formed everywhere to sabotage the digital infrastructure the possibility of interrupted commerce has stalled the digital infrastructure in the past with corporate leaders who felt the system was too vulnerable to disturbance and therefore cash flow well if you thought rolling out thewas difficult to get to the digital infrastructure they re trying to impose on us today i wish the digital infrastructure mavens good luck attempting to putting up their digital infrastructure and maintaining it without serious interruptions to many businesses cash flow in the 1970s my father and i game theoried the driverless car and we realized very quickly that it was impossible especially at 75 miles an hour to account for all the variables that can come into play da said the computing power that would be needed we are a thousand years away from this is the problem with the digital infrastructure today is that there are far too many variables that can come into play that can cause disruptions in cash flow the businesses and workers everywhere as a result of a vulnerable digital system in fact russia turned off a us destroyer in the black sea with an unarmed su 27 fighter jet that flew over the destroyer 12 times before setting it free from the electronic nightmare it dropped on the destroyer simply putthe idea of a digital only currency system can only be described as the work of someone that grew up in absolute privilege and who didn t like thinking that they didn t get all the marbles they were entitled to this is what i mean by infantilizing the digital infrastructure it is simple minded thinking sheltered thinking they have pulled down the internet to just being a crass profit center for corporations from the high intellectual value it had when it started it was inevitable with the deregulation of the financial markets in the us that paper billionaires would flourish and oligarchic fascism would appear and now that it has it wants to run our lives at the touch of their digital infrastructure device god help them if they have to actually meet any of the slaves and the digital currency system they are planning will not survive at all for the simple fact that is outside normal human behavior that has never changed regardless of how much propaganda people have been fed people are the same today that they were 20 000 years ago you might think you have the public lined up in your cues but under their breath they re cursing you for your ridiculous ideas of total control when you re wealthy sitting around with other wealthy people like john d rockefeller did with jp morgan henry ford thomas edison etc it is easy to manipulate a minority amongst the public into incentive streams or world war i or world war ii butand the working class will always resent and distrust the ruling class until the class war is finally won by the working class i prefer to see all my fellow human beings as equals which to me means food shelter and love for everyone sure people come with baggage and differing opinions but that doesn t give anybody else the right to limit anybody else from the pursuit of happiness and this is exactly what the lazy oligarchs are up to absolute control will never be achieved as we will always rebel
like many employers out there amazon does not appreciate outside investigators or any other curious observers having a peek inside its fulfilment centres fcs of course it propagates images and videos of efficiency happy employees and high quality products to the outside world sometimes it even gives us a look inside but always only on its own terms the amazon fc less than a factory yet more than a warehouse is a strictly controlled work environment these centres are used for receiving items from vendors and manufacturers processing and packing them into orders then finally sending them out to customers using drivers who provide the amazon prime service there are over 175 of these places across the world more than 40 of which are based in europe according to amazon these fcs should be a clear testament of their technological innovation the reality however is much less glamorous than the corporation s promotional materials at one particular fc there have been issues with running water for months even after the place was closed for an entire day due to maintenance taps in staff toilets continue to regularly cease running and some on the upper floors simply never have hot water which becomes especially unpleasant in the winter months not being able to wash your hands a basic and crucial aspect of workplace hygiene makes absurd amazon s firm anti coronavirus measures face masks have to be worn by workers for the entire duration of their 10 hour shift a rule which remained in effect at fcs even before the arrival of the omicron variant when restrictions in the country were greatly easing up other technical troubles included leaks in the roof cracks and gaps in the floor frequent it and machinery issues and many others all of this does not really inspire confidence in amazon s image as a company of pioneering technological advances there are different types of fcs ranging in size from about 400 000 to 1 000 000 square feet but within each standard the layout remains largely identical across continents in this one there is a ground floor p1 for shipping and receiving packing hr staff canteen first aid main entrance etc and three more floors p2 p3 p4 primarily for stowing picking and packing it is these upper floors that feature the ar amazon robotics floor a massive caged area where robotic devices called drives transport and store pods metallic frames with a softer interior divided up into compartments that carry products the drives used at this fc weigh 136 kg each and can carry pods weighing hundreds of kilos more this part of the process is fully automated but stowing inbound items into and picking outbound ones from pods is done by humans at stations located around the edges of the ar cage some of these are arsaws amazon robotics semi automated workstations amazon did not actually start using so much automation in its warehouses until 2012 when bezos acquired the massachusetts based manufacturer of mobile robotic fulfilment solutions kiva systems later renamed to amazon robotics this move has allowed the american giant to increase productivity in its fcs making it possible to store 40 more inventory with kiva s stations and drives utilised at some of the amazon workplaces faster product transportation throughout the facility means a quicker pace of work all amazon associates workers often called amazonians by the company are issued with a badge that has their unique login barcode and photographic id on it and must be carried by the worker at all times the vast majority of the tasks performed by human labourers at this fc are done through stations and thus closely monitored as everyone must log into a station with their badge in order to commence each employee s performance is tracked via takt times how long it takes to scan a picked or stowed item how fast totes are replaced how much idle time occurs and so on associates are told to not sign out when going for toilet breaks this means that if the time spent away from the station is too long or wc breaks happen too often then a team leader will come to ask you what is going on two breaks of 30 minutes each one paid the other unpaid are given for a 10h 30m shift in reality breaks are closer to 20 minutes as they are tracked from last to first scanned product and walking times are long due to the sheer size of the fc your performance is measured against set targets although leadership make a big show of not caring about you meeting your targets in the first few weeks so that you can focus on quality as speed will come with time after a certain period they do certainly care about how fast you work for them however it is not hard to tell that the bad press amazon has been getting for its horrendous treatment of workers among other reasons has led to some changes in company policy working at amazon every step of the way you are reminded that this corporation apparently cares so much about you and your well being seasonal events halloween christmas etc and themes based around identity black history month lgbt pride military veterans often feature some kind of giveaway with cupcakes and pins or a free t shirt one wonders why anyone would fall for these cheap tricks when the wealth of jeff bezos grew by 58 52 billion during the covid 19 pandemic so he could in fact give all of his nearly 1 3 million employees 250 000 of which work full time in these centres a bonus of 43 000 and still be left with a few billion more pounds than he had when the crisis started regardless the charade of a friendly corporate entity is maintained throughout the fc in other ways a voice of associates voa board is located near the hr and leadership areas on p1 where employees can write down suggestions though the illusion of being listened to falls apart rather quickly when the voa board is flooded with blunt messages from staff fed up with nothing being done about ongoing issues not being able to take additional days off during the extra demanding winter holidays season when everyone is expected to do mandatory overtime also takes its toll the extent to which one can be honest and confrontational at amazon is however quite limited if they intend to keep their job a file is kept on every single worker and employees are encouraged to inform on each other safety is listed as the main concern but in truth this goes straight out the window whenever associates rush to meet their goals amnesty floor monitor afm staff deal with much greater risk as only they and reliability maintenance engineering rme are allowed on the ar floor to collect fallen amnesty products and fix basic drive issues even among them health and safety is secondary when it comes to keeping your response times low and sorting out problems as quickly as possible so that efficiency is not greatly affected in training everyone is told to not lift drives after an amnesty responder at another fc lost their fingers in the procedure but practically all afms end up having to lift the robots at least a little in order to get the job done everyone in amnesty knows this but officially pretend it is absolutely forbidden and never takes place one day at the fc an afm had an accident on the ar floor and the whole level was brought to an emergency stop after which the worker was rushed to hospital actually even before the amnesty responder left the premises leadership began looking for ways to pin the blame onto the injured employee a disgusting but sadly all too typical reaction of our bourgeois overlords bodily strains physical and mental exhaustion small cuts on the hands and all sorts of other injuries are commonplace at this workplace but many are never reported the amazon stance towards or against trade unions is familiar to most unions are not a tool of revolutionary struggle despite their loud claiming otherwise as they were created to mediate worker disputes with the ruling class and today those deeply involved within trades unions are often too preoccupied with their own careers to not sell out the workers they claim to represent even the smaller and apparently more radical unions are limited to lesser and more reformatory actions instead of making any progress in the fight for a better future nevertheless at amazon direct workers action and organising together with proletarians from other sectors is not only the more radical and effective option but in effect the only real choice an amnesty floor monitor armed with a kindle tablet and logged into the application through which they can view a virtual map of the amazon robotics cage has the ability to basically put an entire floor of the fulfilment centre out of service an effort like this coordinated with other afms could greatly reduce the amount of workers unpaid labour at least for a time a simple blockade of the fc entrances to stop trucks from entering or leaving the area especially if carried out with the involvement of amazon associates can also effectively render the facility useless as far as receiving merchandise and sending out orders goes even with all the draconian measures used to keep a watchful eye over them in the end just like with any other industry it is the hundreds of thousands of amazon staff who have the power to make a real difference it is they who are being exploited it is their labour power that makes all these services possible and it is they who guided by a new internationalist revolutionary organisation can push our species into a new era soon it might be too late as our planet screams for mercy no amount of greenwashing and bragging about electronic vans can change the fact that amazon like many other capitalist goliaths out there is contributing to this devastation massively stock that does not sell is not stored at fcs as it takes up space for items that could still be sold for a profit amazon offers to send these unwanted products back to the original vendors manufacturers presumably for a price otherwise the items are disposed of in practice this means that mountains of things are chucked out just because no one bought them in a specific time window automated facilities like these fcs when utilised properly with the planet and people in mind have great potential as centres for distribution of food and other goods in a global society that produces for human need instead of profit capitalism abuses these systems to achieve increased productivity thus greater exploitation but we could instead make them serve us as they could reduce the amount of time people would need to contribute in order for society s real needs to be met whether such places continue to be managed by greed and used to destroy life on earth is ultimately up to all of us the

history connecticut which muddled through most of the past decade with no fiscal cushion achieved the legal maximum rainy day fund allowed by law under lamont 15 percent of annual operating expenses which amounts to about 3 1 billion advertisement article continues below this ad equally unprecedented connecticut is poised to dump billions of extra dollars into its cash starved pension funds in just a few years with the rainy day fund full the state hit another first under lamont last fall shifting a 1 6 billion surplus from the 2020 21 budget year into the pensions that s on top of the 2 9 billion in regular contributions already budgeted for pensions for state employees and municipal teachers and with analysts projecting another 4 4 billion in black ink across this fiscal year and next combined the pension funds could see a short term infusion of cash like never before the governor predicted that once those extra payments are made the state s regular required pension contributions could drop significantly that means hundreds of millions of dollars that could support education health care transportation municipal aid or tax relief advertisement article continues below this ad those surplus projections have been fueled in part by a stock market that has largely been robust since 2018 despite a rough first month in 2022 connecticut s economic recovery and fiscal health continue to improve state treasurer shawn wooden a hartford democrat said in february adding that the state s cash flow and not just the surplus is at a historic high as well this gives us the potential to continue to responsibly pay down connecticut s pension liabilities at an accelerated rate even as it saves more ct s debt increases but there s another side to that coin advertisement article continues below this ad connecticut reported 95 billion in unfunded obligations last fall a combination of bonded debt and unfunded pension and retirement health care responsibilities that s almost 30 percent more debt than the state reported in 2016 before five years of balanced budgets careful savings and an unprecedented supplemental pension payment connecticut which already ranked as one of the most indebted states in the nation appears to have gotten worse this is why people have a hard time trusting the people currently running our state government said madison republican bob stefanowski who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to lamont and is hoping for a rematch this year politicians making political calculations to protect their headlines rather than protecting the state s taxpayers and the bottom line advertisement article continues below this ad some of that extra debt was really always there the legislature adopted more conservative assumptions about pension fund investment returns over the past few years dropping them from an annual average of 8 percent or more to about 7 percent pension debt is calculated over 25 or 30 years and lowering the assumed revenue from investments means more contributions must come from the taxpayers but that wasn t the only change that affected pension debt governors and legislatures also refinanced the state s pension obligations three times in the past four years debt payments involving both retirement benefit programs and bonding consumed only 12 percent of the annual budget in the mid 1990s but were eating nearly 30 percent by 2017 the state had failed to properly save for its pensions for more than 70 years forfeiting billions of dollars in potential investment earnings needed to cover benefits and leaving the present generation to make up the difference advertisement article continues below this ad analysts warned finances would hit bottom around 2030 when spiking payments could be quadruple what they were in the mid 2010s likely crippling most other programs and forcing unprecedented tax hikes lamont and his predecessor gov dannel p malloy worked with legislatures to smooth out those spikes shifting billions of dollars in debt plus interest onto taxpayers in the late 2030s and 2040s but they didn t just lower required contributions for the spike years that are still to come they also restructured payments in the near term making their own budgets easier to manage while shifting even more burdens onto future taxpayers for example lamont restructured the teachers pension so that connecticut actually contributed 128 million less during his first two years in office than it had during malloy s last year on the job advertisement article continues below this ad and the 2 9 billion connecticut must contribute this year to the two major pension funds combined this fiscal year also is roughly 630 million less than the payments the state would be facing had it not refinanced both pensions in 2019 according to actuaries projections from three years ago in other words some portion of the big surpluses connecticut now enjoys stems from slowing down its payment of pension debt it s incomprehensible that our debt obligations have gone from 75 billion to 95 billion over the last five years while gov lamont and the democrats in charge of the legislature take their victory laps stefanowski said connecticut s businesses are keeping a close watch on debt levels but the jury is still out on whether everyone feels good about them advertisement article continues below this ad our larger businesses are very aware of the long term liabilities connecticut has and that it s been a little bit of a noose around the neck said chris dipentima president and ceo of the connecticut business and industry association and while the cbia applauds the supplemental pension payments made over the past year and a half he added anything that makes state debt levels and potentially future tax rates likely to climb remains an impediment to business confidence and job growth house republicans questioned whether pension refinancings couldn t have been delayed until the late 2020s saving connecticut s children huge burdens in the future politicians memories are limited to the election cycle said house minority leader vincent j candelora they fail to look holistically where we are as a state advertisement article continues below this ad democrats fiscal good news extends way beyond surpluses but while the overall debt level has increased lamont says connecticut has gained something very valuable fiscal stability for the first time in decades state officials can look at the planned pension payments significant though they are and imagine a scenario in which connecticut can manage them when the state is making its full pension payment plus supplemental payments it demonstrates to residents and businesses that the state is creating a predictable sustainable and structural budget environment to increase attractiveness as a great place to establish roots melissa mccaw who stepped down earlier this month as lamont s budget director said in february advertisement article continues below this ad the two year budget lamont and lawmakers enacted last june increases aid to cities and towns by nearly 200 million per year on average without imposing any major tax hikes without refinancing those funds would likely have gone into the pension system or taxes would have gone up and while other states are fearful of what will happen when billions of dollars in emergency federal pandemic relief expires two years from now connecticut has relatively little to worry about analysts now project state finances for 2023 24 have a built in hole of 520 million but that doesn t include another 680 million they expect to be captured by the volatility adjustment those funds plus the 3 1 billion in the state s rainy day fund would enable the next governor and legislature to easily manage state finances even without lost federal pandemic relief advertisement article continues below this ad we haven t had a recession in a long time and some of this prosperity is going to be throttled back eventually lamont told business leaders with the exception of the pandemic induced economic slump of 2020 connecticut has not faced a traditional recession since early 2010 but with probably the biggest rainy day fund per capita in the country lamont added we re relatively well prepared part 2 of the update to a legacy of debt to be published on ctmirror org on march 20 will examine proposals to reduce the state s savings habits and invest more in education health care tax cuts and other programs that sacrificed for years as debt payments gobbled up resources

traditional car companies desire more online orders and fixed pricing while dealers see a threat to their role tesla sells directly to customers online or from retail stores reuters as car companies go electric some are trying to wrest control from dealers on how those vehicles will be priced and sold aiming to make the experience closer to the direct selling model used by tesla inc ford motor co executives recently outlined plans for a system in which dealers wouldn t stock any evs on their lots but rather customers would place factory orders at a no haggle price the dealership is still involved but mostly to deliver the vehicle general motors co is requiring its gmc brand dealers to follow similar guidelines to sell the recently introduced hummer electric pickup truck the agreement stipulates that the dealers will be shipped only hummers ordered by customers through gmc s website a gm spokeswoman said carlos tavares chief executive of jeep maker stellantis nv said the company is working in europe on a new retail model for evs that he described as a direct sales approach which still would involve dealers it is a dual effort that aims to improve customer service which he said lags behind other industries and defray the auto maker s high costs associated with moving to evs which require pricey lithium ion batteries the additional costs of electrification cannot be paid by the consumer mr tavares said during a recent media briefing the moves mark a significant change from the traditional model where buyers typically choose from hundreds of vehicles on the dealership lot and negotiate pricing with a salesperson the proposals have sparked concern among dealers some auto executives view the industry s pivot to evs as a chance to modernize the entrenched way in which americans have bought cars for generations the ev customers are not like our customers ford chief executive jim farley said during an investor conference last month while plans are still taking shape car executives emphasize that the process needs to be simpler and more digital they want to offer relatively few models and feature combinations and want vehicle orders placed remotely either through a dealer or manufacturer s website some auto makers also are urging dealers to sell evs at the manufacturer s suggested retail price although by law they can t dictate the final price the dealer charges a consumer attorneys say state franchise laws generally prohibit traditional car companies such as gm and ford from selling directly to consumers the new approach comes as consumers vent frustration on social media some even appealing directly to auto chief executives about being charged sometimes thousands of dollars above the manufacturer s suggested retail price or msrp some auto makers have said they are worried about alienating customers and are trying to crack down on dealer markups but they concede that the final price is the dealership s call the success of tesla s retailing strategy is becoming a threat for traditional car companies which are trying to increase ev sales while selling through independent dealerships tesla sells directly to customers online or from retail stores after waging a yearslong battle across states to sidestep franchise laws that protect dealerships startups such as luxury car maker lucid group inc and electric truck company rivian automotive inc also sell directly emulating tesla s no dealership approach volkswagen ag has been relying solely on online customer orders for its recently launched id 4 electric sport utility vehicle rather than shipping them to stock dealer lots said vw u s sales chief ray mikiciuk we looked at the competition that had gone before us and frankly that s predominantly tesla they created this online order system he said the shift is fueling tensions with some dealers who say they are worried auto makers are using the transition to evs to insert themselves more into the customer experience potentially usurping the dealers traditional middleman role bill wallace who owns 10 dealerships in florida said he is concerned ford is trying to change the rules around which he built his business including millions of dollars spent on showrooms and real estate to park hundreds of cars it sounds like their plan is to start all over again with a different retail formula that s a scary thing said mr wallace who has been in auto retailing for decades and owns a lincoln franchise ford s luxury brand i think they re going to run into tremendous resistance from dealers he said ford executives have said they plan to work with ford s dealers over the next two months to draw up a new ev sales agreement viewing the company s network of roughly 2 500 u s dealerships as an advantage in the transition to battery powered vehicles the industry s move to evs still is in its infancy plug in vehicles today account for only about 4 of overall u s sales but changes to the retail model for electrics are significant for dealers because evs are expected to rapidly become a bigger slice of their sales in coming years phil maguire who owns a group of dealerships in upstate new york said the current inventory crunch on new cars and trucks has shown dealers that there can be benefits to stocking fewer cars but he sees potential pitfalls to a zero inventory approach to evs when supply gets back to normal a lot of consumers aren t going to want to wait weeks for their car mr maguire said

conclusion of the event for 30 days about transcon pth 1 transcon pth is an investigational once daily long acting prodrug of parathyroid hormone pth in development as a treatment for adult hypoparathyroidism hp transcon pth is designed to restore pth at physiologic levels for 24 hours each day to address both the short term symptoms and long term complications of the disease transcon pth has been granted orphan drug designation in the united states and european union for the treatment of hp about hypoparathyroidism 2 3 4 5 6 7 hypoparathyroidism also called hypopara or hp is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone pth resulting in low calcium and elevated phosphate levels in the blood hp affects approximately 200 000 patients in the united states europe and japan most of whom develop the condition following damage to or accidental removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery conventional treatment with calcium supplements and active vitamin d also called calcitriol does not effectively address the short term symptoms long term complications or quality of life impacts of hypoparathyroidism short term symptoms include weakness severe muscle cramps tetany abnormal sensations such as tingling burning and numbness paresthesia memory loss impaired judgment and headache patients often experience decreased quality of life and over the long term this complex disorder can increase risk of major complications such as calcium deposits in the brain blood vessels eye and other soft tissues including the kidneys which can lead to impaired renal function current standard of care with active vitamin d and calcium supplements does not fully control the disease and may contribute to risk of renal disease patients with hp have an estimated 4 fold to 8 fold greater risk of renal disease compared to healthy populations the disease is also associated with a 2 fold increased risk of depression or bipolar disorder compared to healthy populations hp remains among the few hormonal insufficiency states without a replacement therapy that restores the missing hormone at physiologic levels about

on february 24 russia launched a military operation in ukraine the move has changed the landscape of global politics and economics as the world is reacting to the decision in varied ways despite the differences in opinions on whether or not the military operation was warranted reality is value chains have been disrupted due to emerging uncertainties and effects are being felt everywhere including zimbabwe our senior reporter leroy dzenga ld had an interview with russian ambassador to zimbabwe nikolai krasilnikov nk discussing russia zimbabwe relations in the wake of these developments below is the full text interview ld ambassador russia recently launched a military operation in ukraine what necessitated this move nk the special military operation by the armed forces of the russian federation was undertaken to prevent escalation of aggression perpetrated by the kiev regime against the russian speaking people of the ukrainian region of donbass after the coup d etat in ukraine in 2014 which was strongly supported by western countries the regime in kiev started openly promoting neo nazism and facilitated establishment of nazi organisations their members marched with torches paying tribute to hitler s criminals chanting nazi and anti russian slogans the west just sat back and watched many even supported and encouraged this movement that our grandfathers fought and defeated back in 1941 1945 during the great patriotic war russia had been trying for years to raise attention of western countries including the united states which failed to vote for the un general assembly resolution condemning the glorification of nazism and all forms of racism xenophobia discrimination and intolerance under the pretext of avoiding infringement on freedom of speech the crimea region made a decision through referendum to become part of the russian federation in donbass people who refused to support the coup were persecuted forced ukrainisation and language discrimination against a considerable part of the society including flagrant violations of the rights of russian speakers became an integral element of the kiev regime it started war in donbass using heavy weapons and combat aircraft since april 2014 the ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement agencies have been ignoring the international agreements by massively shelling donbass communities killing and wounding thousands of civilians using indiscriminate lethal weapons prohibited under the international humanitarian law apart from killing people in donbass kiev enforced an economic and transport embargo bringing the region to the brink of a humanitarian disaster minsk agreements were concluded they showed the way to a peaceful settlement of this conflict there were no special demands by the people of donbass just basic things the right to speak their mother tongue this is the russian language and to follow their traditions and culture but donbass remained under siege switched off from the banking system food supplies and payments of pensions and other social benefits shelling continued more than 14 000 people have been killed over eight years the ukrainian law has consistently been adjusted to prohibit the use of any language other than ukrainian in the public sector the education system and the media the adoption of several laws including on education and on ensuring the functioning of the ukrainian language as the state language has introduced discriminatory restrictions against the russian language other laws were also adopted to ensure the forced ukrainisation of public life the so called civilised west preferred to turn a blind eye to all those events instead talks renewed about admitting ukraine to nato amid a catastrophic decline in global security caused primarily by the united states that encouraged and supported kiev s russophobic policy the official statements by ukrainian politicians including president zelensky about seeking nuclear weapons demonstrated clearly their aggressive intentions ukraine has had nuclear competencies since the soviet times it was capable of launching nuclear enrichment projects they have missile competencies they would be able to keep russia at the nuclear gunpoint long standing fears which russia has expressed multiple times over many years regarding the development in ukraine of the military grade biological materials under the guidance of the relevant us special services were confirmed recently during the special military operation it was found that the ukranian regime had been concealing traces of a military biological programme funded by the us department of defence it is evident that components of biological weapons were being developed in ukrainian laboratories in the direct proximity to the territory of the russian federation ld what are the timelines for the operation how long is it going to run nk russia could have simply helped the independent republics of donbass the donetsk people s republic dpr and lugansk people s republic lpr by reinforcing them with our army but in this case the western countries would have provided endless support to the regime in kiev with the material resources ammunition equipment and so on therefore it was decided to take a different road the russian armed forces destroyed the ukranian military infrastructure not completely but most of it arms and ammunition depots aircraft and air defence systems this work has been practically finished the goals of returning ukraine to the origins of its sovereignty which are enshrined in the declaration of independence that proclaimed its neutral status will be achieved it is best to do so by way of peaceful negotiations concurrently with the special military operation talks in belarus are being held with the kiev regime in order to end as soon as possible the resistance by the ukranian armed forces and senseless bloodshed the third round of talks was on march 7 some progress has been made in particular on humanitarian corridors for the civilians to leave war zones russia called on the ukrainian side to do everything possible to ensure the safe passage of civilians the discussion of political military and humanitarian issues will continue on march 10 on the sidelines of the antalya diplomatic forum at turkey s initiative and in accordance with the agreement reached during a telephone conversation between the presidents of russia and turkey there was a trilateral meeting of foreign minister of russia sergey lavrov foreign minister of turkey mevlut cavusoglu and foreign minister of ukraine dmitry kuleba the russian side highlighted that during the latest round of talks in belarus the russian delegation had made specific proposals in the form of a draft legally binding document and that the ukrainian delegation had said that they would take it to kiev for discussion and would provide a concrete reply soon ld what needs to happen for russia to call the operation a success nk the special military operation is not designed to occupy ukraine destroy its statehood divide the country or topple its government it is not directed against civilians the goals are to protect the residents of donbass to demilitarise and denazify ukraine to eliminate the military threat to russia emanating from ukraine flooded with weapons provided by nato countries we want to see ukraine demilitarised with the neutral status fixed in its constitution russia must have guarantees that weapons able to change the security balance in europe cannot be deployed in ukraine we need a list of specific offensive weapons that will never be deployed or manufactured in ukraine at the same time it is obligatory to eradicate nazism that made a comeback in ukraine over seven decades after world war ii what russia proposes is an arrangement that will ensure the legitimate rights of all nationalities living in ukraine all ethnic minorities without exception if the current government in kiev agrees to the terms that are now being negotiated they will be formalised as an arrangement ld there have been sanctions and a lot of criticism against russia with the west seeking to isolate your country how are you going to work around the exclusion nk the western countries have launched financial and economic war against russia announced a default on their financial liabilities to russia and frozen our gold and currency reserves they are trying to stop foreign trade and export of goods inflicting damage on global trade there are attempts to create a shortage of imported essentials in russia and to compel successful businesses with foreign capital to shut down the government of the russian federation takes measures to stabilise financial market support state industries and the private sector to ensure uninterrupted functioning of enterprises without disruptions in logistics and production chains and to maintain employment russia has many friends and allies zimbabwe is in the forefront numerous partners in the international arena who did not lose their independence and ability to put their interests first so it is impossible to isolate my country or to exclude us from the world community for russia sanctions will be yet another driver of the economy just as an impetus was made to the agricultural sector some time ago last year russia made us 25 billion from agricultural exports that seemed impossible only a short while ago but my country did it take another sphere aviation over the past few years our competitors including americans have included in their sanctions lists certain materials necessary for manufacturing aircraft we ended up making what they tried to strip us of invented our own innovative materials even better than foreign made ones unfortunately that led to a shift in schedules up to eighteen months but we did it and will do the same in other areas ld will zimbabwe russia trade be affected by these sanctions how much is the current trade between the two countries nk the current russia zimbabwe trade does not correspond to the high level of political coordination between moscow and harare in case trade is affected with sanctions an impact on the whole mechanism of our partnership will be insignificant ld in the face of these sanctions and uncertainties will investment projects in zimbabwe being financed by russian companies like alrosa and great dyke investments continue nk two flagships of our investment cooperation great dyke investment for developing platinum group of metals and alrosa zimbabwe for exploring diamonds are well on track with very good prospects i m sure that other projects will follow due to the great interest in russia to do business in the safe conducive environment of zimbabwe under the new dispensation ict agriculture energy transport pharmaceutics are the spheres in the focus of attention the bilateral agenda includes preparing the fourth session of the joint commission on economic trade scientific and technical cooperation as usual within this framework we will discuss ways of enhancing partnership between our independent and sovereign states ld how safe are zimbabwean students in russia nk the zimbabwean students in russia have always been safe their security is guaranteed by my country s law enforcement in the current academic year 76 students enrolled in the higher education institutions due to scholarships provided by the russian government initially the quota for zimbabwe was 65 but we increased it because of the great interest among the zimbabwean youth to go study in russia for 2022 23 the quota for zimbabwe is 80 and the embassy has already received 230 applications i encourage those young people who will not qualify for the next academic year to start learning russian at the on line courses launched recently by the embassy so they would be better prepared for long term studies in russia as for the zimbabwean students in ukraine we have provided the ministry of foreign affairs and international trade of the republic of zimbabwe with access to the hotline established by the russian ministry of defence in order to solve problems with evacuation and other humanitarian issues it is well known that many of foreign citizens who attempt to cross the ukrainian border heading to europe encounter immense difficulties we have taken note of a statement on this matter issued by the senegalese chair of the african union reports on ruthless attacks by the ukrainian nationalists on african students are appalling ld how does russia interpret zimbabwe and other african countries abstaining from the recent vote at the united nations general assembly nk the western countries led by the united states made incredible efforts to make sure the un general assembly resolution on ukraine was widely approved in new york and in various capitals they used blackmail attempts of bribery and threats of sanctions however they failed adoption of that document does not represent the unified voice of the general assembly dozens of the un members refused to vote for the anti russian resolution among them are the republic of zimbabwe and some other african states which follow independent and balanced foreign policy the statement on the issue by the ministry of foreign affairs and international trade is very clear we agree with the zimbabwean friends that the resolution poured more fuel to the fire it is obvious that it emboldened the ukrainian radicals to continue their criminal actions the anti russian resolution of the un general assembly runs counter to the direction of dialogue for the russian side we are ready to continue the talks with ukraine in order to prevent further bloodshed ld zimbabwe relies on russian wheat and part of the world s crude oil comes from russia are there ways that the zimbabwean citizenry can be cushioned from potential shortages of these critical commodities nk everything that russia is scheduled to supply it is supplying to consumers worldwide even the ukrainian gas transit system is filled to 100 under our contracts prices of gas oil and petroleum products are going up but not because of russia for example the united states announced that they were shutting down imports of russian oil to the us market and the fact is that the russian oil distribution to the us does not exceed 3 this is a negligible amount but their prices are up while the ban on russian oil imports had nothing to do with it inflation rates in the us are all time high still they are trying to blame us for the consequences of their own problems on march 10 at a meeting by president putin with the government the russian minister of agriculture dmitry patrushev confirmed that the food security of the country had been guaranteed and that russia would continue to service its export obligations for foreign agricultural markets including export of wheat and fertilisers ld there are fears that this may degenerate into world war three which will result in major loss of lives does russia have measures to avoid a full scale global war outbreak nk world war iii could only be fought with nuclear weapons in june last year president putin and president biden met in geneva to reaffirm what the ussr and the us leaders stated back in the 1980s in a nuclear war everybody loses it must never happen in january this year all five permanent member states of the un security council signed a joint statement expressing the same idea just recently president biden announced that the only alternative to a new anti russian sanctions package was a third world war it is a very dangerous way of thinking russia has always called for resolving all issues with the us and other nato countries diplomatically through negotiations i d like to draw your attention to my country s efforts to ensure safety and security of nuclear facilities in ukraine as part of the special military operation control was taken of the chernobylskaya and zaporozhskaya nuclear power plants and the adjacent areas this measure was taken to prevent ukrainian nationalists and foreign mercenaries from taking advantage of the current state of affairs to carry out nuclear provocations the situation at the chernobylskaya and zaporozhskaya nuclear power plants is being monitored jointly by ukrainian specialists and russian military background radiation at both nuclear power plants is normal
russia s invasion of ukraine is nearly 3 weeks now and the conventional wisdom still hasn t settled on an outlook a combination of poor russian performance has run across the grain of stout ukrainian resistance creating a military picture that no one had expected along with a heft shock to the world s commodity and stock prices but there are some possible bright spots for investors looking for a hedge against the geopolitical turmoil cybersecurity defense and certain energy stocks are likely gainers in the coming months as the war situation and its economic fallout will put a premium on these services with this in mind we ve used tipranks database to pinpoint three such stocks each has earned a strong buy consensus rating from the analyst community and brings strong growth prospects to the table let s take a closer look crowdstrike holdings crwd let s start in cybersecurity a field that is getting plenty of press as black hat hacking is known to be a non kinetic military strength of the russians and for that matter of ukraine too crowdstrike was an early entrant to the cybersecurity niche and has become a leader in the field the company s falcon endpoint protection product line is an industry standard and offers customers a wide range of options in solutions for online and network security with 22 cloud modules available on the popular saas model crowdstrike s services and its revenues and earnings have all been gaining traction over the past year with the increases starting long before russia embarked on ratcheting up the tensions with ukraine the pandemic inspired push to remote work with a consequent increased need for network security supported the gains the ukraine situation will only increase the spotlight on the need for proactive digital safety measures a look at the company s recent earnings report for fiscal 4q22 will clarify the story the top line came in at 431 million up 63 year over year and well above the forecast expectations of 412 million at the bottom line non gaap eps was reported at 30 cents more than double the 13 cents reported in the year ago quarter eps was up for the third quarter in a row revenues have been recording sequential gains for the past two years the consistently strong revenues and earnings are reflected in the company s cash position crowdstrike reported 442 million free cash flow fcf for its q4 a company record and had 2 billion in liquid assets on hand to close out its fiscal year covering crowdstrike for rbc analyst matthew hedberg sees the strong performance continuing into the company s fiscal 2023 he writes with a record pipeline into q1 23 aided by the recent russia ukraine situation and consistent track record of outperformance we believe the bias is towards additional upside to estimates through fy 23 overall another strong quarter as crowdstrike remains in rare air with outsized growth and impressive margin and fcf expansion story continues these comments support hedberg s outperform i e buy

crwd stock analysis on tipranks raytheon technologies rtx for the second stock we ll shift over to the defense industry raytheon has a long history in aerospace and intelligence technology designing

and provides important weapons systems such as the javelin and stinger missiles that have been making headlines in the ukraine conflict the iron dome anti missile system the tomahawk cruise missiles and the famous patriot surface to air missile the defense industry is one of the modern world s major cash cows that was an established fact long before the russian attack on ukraine raytheon has been showing revenue and earnings increases for the last couple of years and the company s 4q21 report released in january was no exception while the top line of 17 04 billion was up just 4 year over year earnings were stronger adjusted eps at 1 08 beat the 1 02 forecast and rose 45 from the year ago quarter among the bulls is morgan stanley analyst kristine liwag who writes of raytheon s current situation the us and nato allies in europe continue to deliver anti tank and anti aircraft weapons to ukraine and look to replenish stocks in 2017 the us state department also cleared a 10 5bn sale of higher end missile defense systems to poland including rtx s patriot system we see the situation in ukraine potentially spurring additional fms for similar higher end systems we also see conviction

stock we ll turn to the natural gas sector of the hydrocarbon industry the impact of the ukraine conflict here should be clear to anyone who has been following the news russia is western europe s single largest provider of the fuel and the russian and german governments prior to the ukraine war were working on the nordstream 2 gas pipeline a russian project that was intended to provide gas to europe while bypassing ukraine since the invasion started the german government has halted cooperation on that pipeline and western sanctions generally are preventing russia from getting oil and gas products to the world markets cheniere energy a houston based liquified natural gas firm is ideally positioned to gain in this environment the company s business is as its ticker suggests liquifying natural gas prior to long distance transport cheniere s assets include three gas pipelines totaling over 300 miles and two export terminals at sabine pass la and corpus christi tx the export terminals

the company showed a net loss for shareholders of 5 22 a far cry from the 1 85 profit that had been expected the company attribute the losses to the use of commodity derivative instruments and

analyst for evercore isi notes that the ukraine conflict will have the effect of driving european gas consumer toward the us and that cheniere is well situated to gain from that in the long term the unfortunate news of a ramped up russian invasion of ukraine has led european leaders to question the future of their energy supply stack in the short run europe remains utterly dependent on russian

gasoline prices were nearing record levels in the united states in february even before the russian invasion of ukraine now the price at the pump is higher than ever prices have also soared for the heating oil and natural gas that millions rely on to heat their homes in the u s and europe but in america the availability of gasoline and the price at the pump are the ultimate modern wartime hostages that is why gas stations displaying eye popping prices this summer and fall will matter more than all the campaign billboards put together in affecting the november midterm elections russian president vladimir putin lost his initial gamble on a quick victory in ukraine but his subsequent moves carry even greater risks for all concerned he is now betting his military can bleed his neighbor country into submission he is also counting on his own russian people to endure the economic sanctions imposed by the west longer than citizens of the west can tolerate the soaring energy costs they face as blowback americans have shown resilience in the face of such challenges before but the fallout from such crises has been devastating both economically and politically for now americans are telling pollsters they support sanctions on russia including a ban on russian energy imports to the u s even it means higher prices for gasoline that may show resolve or it may demonstrate what pollsters call social acceptability bias after all who wants to admit their moral objections to russian atrocities in ukraine might be so easily overcome by selfish interest but where will attitudes be when more people need to go back to work or as the summer driving season arrives where will we be if oil goes to 150 a barrel or beyond in the weeks ahead or if gasoline heads for 6 a gallon these are hard choices for individuals and policymakers alike and yet we have been here before we have confronted stark challenges posed by hostile foreign actors using oil as a cudgel we have struggled and even staggered in these moments and we have survived them but we have also been changed in the process the arab oil embargo marty lederhandler ap ap on dec 23 1973 cars line up at a gas station in new york city to this day the phrase arab oil embargo packs a memory wallop for all who remember the 1970s few events in the 20th century mattered more for the remainder of that century or for the lives we lead in this one until that time americans typically assumed their gas came from refineries and wells in the good old usa or from friendly countries nearby that had been generally true since the first automobiles appeared in the early 1900s but cheap oil from the middle east produced in some cases for less than 1 a barrel contributed ever larger shares of the u s supply after world war ii the investments of american oil giants in the region were among the most lucrative in history and then came a war although limited in scope it swiftly involved the superpowers and portents of nuclear confrontation and its effects would linger for decades in october 1973 the armies of syria and egypt attacked israel on the yom kippur holiday seeking to regain territory lost in the 1967 six day war

union was just as actively arming and urging on the arab allies for days the prospect was quite real of a nuclear confrontation with the soviet union a key backer of the arabs in the region as nixon doubled down on the u s commitment to israel oil producing states in the persian gulf region rallied to the arab side and announced an embargo on oil sales to the u s and several other countries the price of oil delivered in the u s shot up from about 3 a barrel before the embargo to nearly 12 shortages developed and prices at the pump roughly doubled seemingly overnight gas lines and rationing had not been seen in the u s since world war ii and in this case there had been no pearl harbor no declarations of war and little sense of what the sacrifice was about suddenly every adult in america knew the letters opec meant the organization of petroleum exporting countries although some questioned the cost of u s loyalty to israel most blamed the shadowy arab oil sheiks there were calls for retaliation it was an era of increasing uneasiness in the country the vietnam war was winding down but the economy was slowing and inflation pressures growing even before the gasoline spike in that same october nixon s attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned rather than fire the special prosecutor investigating the watergate scandal which involved nixon covering up for illegal campaign tactics the so called saturday night massacre set in motion a chain of events that led nixon to resign the following year but the oil shock would have even greater effects in the long term as the veteran scholar of energy policy daniel yergin has observed the 1973 oil embargo remade the international economy millions of americans for example came to an entirely different relationship with such metrics as average miles per gallon millions bought their first four cylinder automobile as japanese cars in particular took on a new appeal congress imposed a 55 mile per hour speed limit on all four lane highways the long postwar era of cheap gas interstate highway construction and ever larger and more powerful passenger vehicles seemed to be at an end iran creates a second shock ap ap a no gas sign is seen at a gas station in an unknown location during the 1979 gas crisis as the 1970s wore on high oil prices contributed to more inflation and an unfamiliar sense of energy insecurity then in 1979 events in the persian gulf region again triggered a jarring and disruptive crisis when revolution toppled the government in iran which had been one of the top five oil producing countries islamic clerics and their followers rebelled against the modernist leadership of shah reza pahlavi in 1979 forcing him from power oil production dropped and while worldwide supply only fell by about 5 the oil markets reacted in panic shortages developed and competition in the spot market drove the price of crude barrels up through the 20 and 30 ranges to break 40 as the 1970s came to a close adjusted for inflation that would be equivalent to nearly 140 today the shortages also led to long gas lines and a sense of national frustration in his memoir president jimmy carter s domestic policy adviser stuart eizenstat recalled waiting half an hour at a station near his suburban washington home to get enough gas to travel to the white house to try to deal with the crisis and then not very well carter tried to address the mood in an oval office speech that was widely panned as a malaise speech even though he never used the word matters only got worse when iran went to war with iraq in 1980 depressing oil output in that country as well the second oil shock not only spurred inflation but pushed the global economy into recession as well needless to say the combination contributed substantially to carter s plunge in the polls and his landslide loss to ronald reagan in the 1980 election zuhair saade ap ap iraqi troops are beside a roadway in iran on oct 17 1980 the smoke in the background is from fires along pipelines used to carry oil from the giant refinery at abadan to ahwaz and tehran big adjustments bring big changes the 1980s and 1990s brought a welcome hiatus from energy crises and oil shocks a combination of factors even produced a surplus in oil markets as a global recession depressed demand and price conscious conservation began to matter these years also showed what higher crude prices could do for sources of supply outside the middle east more oil from the north sea alaska and siberia came on line in the 1980s the soviet union became the world s largest producer increased output also came from the gulf of mexico and smaller non opec countries such as brazil and india in the u s carter had set a date in the future for lifting price controls on all petroleum products replacing him reagan lifted the controls immediately for all these reasons non opec countries were outproducing the opec countries by 1981 and efforts by opec to maintain high prices failed later in the decade differences over strategy divided the group which has since had difficulties maintaining a solid front all this led to an oil price collapse in 1986 that was a significant boon to the economy of that time and the popularity of reagan and the above aided the election of his vice president texas oil man george h w bush as his successor oil and gas prices did spike again in bush s term when iraq invaded its oil rich neighbor kuwait in 1990 but other producers stepped up and the u s led a military operation in that drove the iraqis out so the price effects were relatively minimal and short lived as were economic effects of oil well fires that burned for most of a year global output continued to push prices down in the early 1990s in inflation adjusted dollars gasoline at points during the decade was cheaper than it had been since the federal government started keeping track in 1929 that set of circumstances combined with the personal computer boom gave rise to a frothy stock market and an era of economic confidence two decades going mostly higher but that era did not last the price of gas leaped back to 1 50 in 2000 as the global economy was strengthening and opec was having more success at controlling production curiously the terror attacks of sept 11 2001 did not have an appreciable effect on oil or gas prices which averaged slightly less that year than in 2000 but a period of rising prices was at hand the rise continued as the u s invaded and occupied the oil producing nation of iraq that war which came to dominate the presidency of george w bush saw the average price of gasoline in the u s rise back above 1 50 in its first year 2003 and above 2 in 2005 prices kept rising ahead of the 2006 midterm elections and bush s republicans lost their majorities in the house and senate for the first time in a dozen years in the year bush left office 2008 the average was 3 27 and the peak in june was 4 11 adjusting for inflation that would be over 5 a gallon today frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images a man pumps gas into his vehicle at a gas station in monterey park calif on oct 5 2012 there were many factors affecting the elections in the 2000s to be sure but the rising cost of energy was felt in each particularly as support for the iraq war waned bush was reelected in 2004 although by the second smallest electoral college margin of any reelected president but his republican party could not hold the white house four years later against the challenge of democrat barack obama thereafter however the global recession brought on by the collapse of mortgage backed securities and other investment devices in late 2008 brought the price of oil crashing down again in the depths of that recession gas at the pump fell below 2 again and averaged just 2 35 for all of 2009 prices recovered along with the world economy nearing 4 per gallon of gas in the u s in spring 2012 adjusted for inflation that would be higher than the price of gas today given that some elements of the economy remained sluggish it was surprising to many that obama was able to win a second term with unemployment higher than any other reelected president but in obama s second term world conditions changed again and substantial increases in output brought prices down rapidly by the start of 2016 the price of gas was just half what it had been at its recent peak the price was back above 2 by election day that year but still low enough to have been a positive factor had obama been eligible to seek a third term gas prices bounced around around in the 2 range in the first year of president donald trump but when covid hit and global economic activity contracted sharply crude prices collapsed and briefly went negative gasoline prices bottomed at about 2 but soon recovered they have continued to climb reaching the mid 3 range even before russia s move into ukraine although russia has recently been the third largest supplier of oil to the u s after canada and mexico it has contributed less than 10 of total u s oil imports but cutting back on russia s ability to supply the overall global market will make everyone else s oil more expensive for some time to come will the world market and american sensibilities prove as resilient as they have in the past the answer will largely determine the direction of energy politics and international law in the years ahead copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
at lifehacker we independently select and write about stuff we love and think you ll like too we have affiliate and advertising partnerships which means we may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting marvel and dc have plenty of comic book movies and tv shows coming out in the next 12 months but not all superheroes are good guys and you ll know that if you ve watched the boys prime video s adaptation of the hit graphic novel has spawned two successful seasons of the boys the show is a graphic raunchy drama about the corporatisation of superheroes and it s been a huge hit amongst audiences it should come as no surprise that amazon is bringing out a third season of the boys but what can we expect from this new batch of episodes and more importantly when can we expect them spoilers for the boys season 1 and 2 ahead the boys season 3 plot when we last left the boys things were getting as usual pretty hectic in an attempt to stop stormfront homelander s son ryan used his laser eyes and accidentally killed his mother becca in the process he then turned against his father and chose to stay with billy butcher after the boys were pardoned hughie took a job in neuman s office not realising she is the mysterious superpowered assassin they ve been looking for that sets things up for a pretty exciting season 3 so what do we know about it so far it appears season 3 will be picking up some notable storylines from the comics it ll be interesting to see how the herogasm miniseries is adapted considering it s one of the most controversial storylines the boys has come up with essentially herogasm is an annual event for vought s superheroes to gather at a remote retreat and partake in a weekend of anything goes sex drugs and partying are no strangers in the boys but herogasm takes it to a new level executive producer eric kripke told vanity fair in an interview there will be no topping up herogasm now that i ve seen the dailies of this thing i m like what have we done it s just so crazy advertisement another big addition to season 3 is jensen ackles soldier boy who is described as the world s first superhero and fought during world war ii parallels to marvel s captain america are obvious but soldier boy is in no way the same beacon of truth and justice that steve rogers is according to eric kripke soldier boy is a huge part of the direction of the new season season 3 delves a lot more into the history of how we got here through this character of soldier boy we were able to dig into both the history of the country and also really look at toxic masculinity and masculine roles and what a shit show that s overall caused another tease for what s coming up comes from the new poster for the boys season 3 soon it ll be time to level the playing field pic twitter com ssbjxggsut the boys theboystv march 10 2022 the image shows billy butcher with glowing eyes similar to homelander s this seems to suggest the boys tv series will be picking up another notable plot aspect from the graphic novels which sees the boys inject themselves with compound v to give them an advantage against the supes they are hunting we also have the official synopsis which gives us an idea of where things pick up it s been a year of calm homelander s subdued butcher works for the government supervised by hughie of all people but both men itch to turn this peace and quiet into blood and bone so when the boys learn of a mysterious anti supe weapon it sends them crashing into the seven starting a war and chasing the legend of the first superhero soldier boy the boys season 3 cast as mentioned the most notable addition to the cast is supernatural star jensen ackles as soldier boy but he s not the only newcomer this season sean patrick flanery is playing a judge dredd inspired superhero known as gunpowder who s very much about second amendment rights nick wechsler and gaston villanueva are playing blue hawk and supersonic respectively who are two new superheroes to the world of the boys it appears the boys is also adding another notorious comic character to season three with katia winter reported to be playing russian mob boss little nina the walking dead s laurie holden will also appear as crimson countess a member of soldier boy s crew who has heat powers amazon recently released a photo of holden in costume and she s giving off very scarlet witch vibes advertisement you can also expect a number of regular cast members to show up in season 3 of the boys including karl urban jack quaid karen fukuhara laz alonso tomer capone erin moriarty antony starr jessie t usher dominique mcelligott and chace crawford claudia doumit who played victoria neuman and vought s hero pr manager ashley barrett played by colby minifie have also been upped to series regular status for season 3 aya cash s stormfront appeared to be done for at the end of season 2 but we may not have seen the last of her yet however we will probably see more of giancarlo esposito s stan edgar is there a trailer as of march 2022 we finally have a trailer for the boys season 3 gaze upon it below it looks like season 3 will have more of pretty much everything the boys is known for lots of sex blood and superpowers the second full trailer for season 3 is even wilder it puts homelander front and centre who seems to be taking the betrayal of his son quite badly he promises that the people will meet the real me which we all know can t be good meanwhile the boys seem to be back on the straight and narrow but it doesn t take long before things kick off again jensen ackles soldier boy is far more prominent in this trailer and it seems like he might be the one person who stands a chance against homelander s reign of terror is season 3 good with the release of the first episodes of the boys season 3 imminent reviews have hit the internet the new season currently has a 97 rating on rotten tomatoes empire magazine wrote the boys third season doesn t forget to deepen its characters while delivering its requisite bloodbaths and holy shit moments advertisement inverse called it the best superhero show saying the boys season 3 is still the best superhero show by a longshot it s fun weird dark emotional and often extremely gross there s an entire episode called herogasm that would make the folks at disney lose their lunches and it s still plenty relevant too the boys season 3 release date now that you re all excited about the new season of the boys you re probably wondering when it s coming out filming took place in 2021 in canada and the cast revealed shooting had wrapped in september prime video announced when we can see the boys season 3 with the

this article is more than 2 years old getty december s sharp increase in stock market volatility favored even more in 2022 but it reached new extremes last week the decline on monday of almost 3 led to more selling on tuesday but then surprisingly the s p rose 2 57 on wednesday hopes for even more gains did not last as stocks were lower the rest of the week as the latest cpi report did not help it has been a rough two months for investors as things have only gotten worse in march the sort of bidding war on how many rate hikes it would take to corral inflation started in december when some were looking for three hikes in 2022 by january goldman sachs was looking for four rate hikes with bank of america looking for seven in early february later in february jpmorgan raised the bid to nine rate hikes by march 2023 this was all before the sharp spike in crude oil prices and russia s invasion of ukraine these events have slowed down the rate hike bidding war which i feel did a disservice to many investors do i think eight or nine hikes is likely no but in analyzing the economy and stock market one needs to accept that anything is possible my point is there is no way to tell in advance but the ever escalating worse case number of rate hikes is dependent on possible future not current data these discussions can influence average investors to act emotionally which is never a good idea often a large bank s opinion is held in higher esteem by some investors tom aspray viperreport com it is not surprising with the invasion of ukraine and soaring crude oil prices that investors have become less positive on the stock market and economy the weekly chart of the s p 500 shows that despite the 2 9 decline last week it is still above the three week low at 4114 65 on a break of this

revealed that the ratio of bulls bears dropped below one as it did at the 2020 and 2018 lows these low levels of bullishness is a positive sign for the market as similar past readings have corresponded to correction lows in the stock market the naaim exposure index dropped to a low of 30 30 a week ago point 3 and rose slightly last week to 42 58 it dropped to below 20 at the march 2020 lows point 1 before it turned higher by early april 2020 the exposure index had risen back above the 50 level a move back above the 13 week ema at 58 16 will be a sign these managers are adding new exposure to the stock market on friday the preliminary reading on sentiment from the university of michigan came in at 59 7 this data point is not reflected on the chart from the st louis fed but it was the lowest reading since september 2011 many headlines then reflected the growing fear in the financial press that the us was starting a new recession the sentiment data rebounded by the end of the month and moved higher for the rest of the year in february 2020 consumer sentiment peaked at 101 the low reading was in response to the sharp decline in the spyder trust spy of 18 7 in july and early august as us debt was downgraded the chart shows that the volatility was high for the rest of august and september as a broad trading range developed the stock market reversed to the upside on

russia squeezes kyiv as unimaginable tragedy looms in ukraine two men carry a corpse in a body bag to lay it next to others in a snow covered yard in mykolaiv a city on the shores of the black sea that has been under russian attack for days on march 11 2022 kyiv russian forces inched towards kyiv and pounded civilian areas in other ukrainian cities friday drawing warnings of unimaginable tragedy as the us and the eu moved to tighten the economic noose around the kremlin sixteen days after moscow shocked the world by invading ukraine the united nations and others said it may be committing war crimes in cities such as mariupol which for days now has been besieged by vladimir putin s forces on friday officials in the southern port said more than 1 500 people have been killed during 12 days of russian siege survivors have been trying to flee russian bombardment in a freezing city left without water or heating and running out of food the situation is desperate a doctors without borders official said hundreds of thousands of people are for all intents and purposes besieged stephen cornish one of those heading the medical charity s ukraine operation told afp in an interview sieges are a medieval practice that have been outlawed by the modern rules of war for good reason as russia widens its bombardment and talks between moscow and kyiv seemingly go nowhere ukrainian president volodymr zelensky s pleas for nato to intervene have grown increasingly desperate but on friday us president joe biden again ruled out direct action against nuclear armed russia warning that it would lead to world war iii instead washington added more layers of sanctions to those already crippling russia s economy this time ending normal trade relations and announcing a ban on signature russian goods vodka seafood and diamonds the us and the european union also suspended the export of their luxury goods to russia putin must pay the price he cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundation of international peace and stability and then ask for help from the international community biden said from the white house he spoke as the united nations said some 2 5 million people have now fled ukraine and around two million more have been internally displaced by the war nobody buries them yulia a 29 year old teacher who fled mariupol said her mother in law was still there and told them the attacks don t stop there are many corpses on the street and nobody buries them she told afp in ukraine s second city kharkiv doctors at a hospital described spending two days pumping ash from the stomach of an eight year old child whose home was blasted by a russian missile he still has cinders in his lungs dima kasyanov s doctor told afp dnipro an industrial hub of one million inhabitants saw its image as a relatively safe haven shattered when three missiles hit civilian buildings friday images of its charred or destroyed buildings including a kindergarten with windows blown out now join those from kharkiv and mariupol as testimony to the brutal conflict today we were supposed to host people who need a lot of support said svetlana kalenecheko who lives and works in a clinic that was damaged now we can t help anyone the attacks on civilians prompted a new flurry of warnings from the hague and the united nations friday that russia is committing war crimes we are really heading towards an unimaginable tragedy cornish of doctors without borders warned insisting that there is still time to avoid it and we must see it avoided catastrophe meanwhile the kremlin is slowly surrounding kyiv with ukrainian presidential adviser mykhailo podolyak calling it a city under siege he tweeted that it was ready to fight with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place adding kyiv will stand until the end the ukrainian military has said russia is trying to take out kyiv s defences to the north and west where suburbs including irpin and bucha have already endured days of heavy bombardment russian armoured vehicles are also advancing on the capital s northeast as the slow but steady advance continues so has the tide of refugees around 100 000 people have been able to leave the northeastern city of sumy the eastern city of izyum and areas northwest of kyiv in the last two days ukrainian officials said zelensky warned living conditions were deteriorating fast in the sumy kyiv and donetsk regions there is no more electricity yes there are problems with heating there is no gas no water he said it s a humanitarian catastrophe murderers from syria foreign combatants have already entered the ukrainian conflict on both sides and on friday the kremlin ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements particularly from syria a furious zelensky accused russia of hiring murderers from syria a country where everything has been destroyed like they are doing here to us the global ripple effects of the conflict continued elsewhere last minute russian demands related to the conflict threatened to derail the near complete process of reviving the iranian nuclear deal friday and the fighting spurred vows to bolster the european union s defences with eu leaders describing the invasion as a wake up call there s no denying the fact that two weeks ago we woke up in a different europe in a different world european council chief charles michel said russia also moved friday to block instagram and launch a criminal case against its owner meta as moscow fired back at the tech giant for allowing posts calling for violence against russian forces we will not fight talks have so far made no progress towards ending the fighting putin has said that negotiations are being held almost daily and us and european stock markets rose friday on his comments that there had been certain positive shifts but us vice president kamala harris speaking in bucharest said the russian leader has shown no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy at the united nations western countries accused russia of spreading wild conspiracy theories after moscow s envoy told diplomats that america and ukraine had researched using bats to conduct biological warfare the us envoy said russia had made the claims as part of a false flag effort for using chemical weapons of its own in ukraine biden warned russia would pay a severe price if it used chemical weapons but he again carefully steered clear of any indication that such an attack would be a red line that could draw direct us military action we will not fight a war against russia in ukraine he

song chen china daily in his book the economic consequences of the peace published in 1919 john maynard keynes a uk economist and father of keynesian economics compared the stance of the victors of world war i to that of the romans toward the carthaginians after the end of the punic wars 264 146 bc at that time rome dealt carthage an extremely cruel defeat virtually eliminating the mediterranean influence of that ancient phoenician city in north africa keynes took part in the paris conference that negotiated the terms of the central powers surrender and witnessed the revanchism of france and britain against germany and former us president woodrow wilson s weakness in containing the vengeful fury of the two allies in practice the main objective of the treaty of versailles was to completely liquidate germany s industrial capacity and impose on it a heavy war debt that would serve as an iron ball for many years the treaty also created the league of nations but it was born dead as the united states refused to participate in the organization the famous economist foresaw that the treaty s terms would harm the winning nations themselves he analyzed the level of interconnection between the european economies before the war of which germany was the leading trading partner of many of them including france and britain he also predicted that the collapse of germany would be the economic collapse of the entire continent as happened in the 1920s and more drastically after the new york stock exchange crash in 1929 another prediction made by keynes was that germany would take revenge the moment it managed to rebalance itself economically as happened after the rise of the third reich when world war ii ended in 1945 the attitude of the victorious powers was different the tehran 1943 bretton woods 1944 yalta potsdam and san francisco 1945 conferences served as an institutional framework for the new order that emerged in the postwar period the beginning of the cold war between the us and the soviet union did not shake the central structures even though the socialist countries organized an economic system apart from the west specifically concerning the two defeated powers the us treatment was different from before it supported the reconstruction of japan and germany and incorporated them into the economic system it led the marshall plan served not only for reconstruction but also for the modernization of european economies bretton woods institutions and the new monetary system based on the gold standard allowed the return to convertibility of several european currencies and the formation of the european monetary system which decades later would be the basis for the euro the overcoming of rivalries between germany and france also contributed to creating the foundations of the european union finally the adoption of keynesian economic policies enabled economic development and the incorporation of the working masses into the consumer market when looking at the policy of the us and europe at the end of the cold war when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the posture of the victors it again resembled that of the romans in imposing the carthaginian peace the adoption of the shock therapy and the ideas of the washington consensus served as a means for a minority to appropriate a wide range of public owned assets and businesses in eastern european countries including russia and led to the breakdown of the social assistance structure of states and an unprecedented increase in unemployment and misery the main indication of this tragedy is the decrease in the population s life expectancy specifically concerning russia this indicator decreased from 70 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2000 another aspect of the draconian treatment of the defeated russia occurred with the enlargement of the north atlantic treaty organization toward the east in the negotiations between mikhail gorbachev and george bush and later between boris yeltsin and bill clinton there was a commitment that nato would not expand the bloc toward russia s borders between 1999 and 2005 many countries from the former socialist bloc joined nato including lithuania estonia and latvia there were attempts to incorporate georgia but moscow acted energetically to prevent this process there have also been attempts to destabilize various countries through the so called color revolutions most recently in belarus in 2020 and in kazakhstan last january considering the context related to the current crisis the great powers must learn from history the carthaginian peace strategy is extremely dangerous because should a humiliated country manage to regain its strength it will seek to reestablish its former power condition and claim the rights that have been suppressed in this regard it is important to recall a new type of relations between major powers which seeks to create a more cooperative international environment through a multilateral order that contemplates the vital interests of each stakeholder of the international community it is necessary to overcome the logic of the cold war to build a world that responds to the real challenges facing human societies such as the climate crisis hunger and poverty the author is a professor of international political economy at sao paulo state university the author contributed this article to china watch a

gained something very valuable fiscal stability for the first time in decades state officials can look at the planned pension payments significant though they are and imagine a scenario in which

gained something very valuable fiscal stability for the first time in decades state officials can look at the planned pension payments significant though they are and imagine a scenario in which connecticut can manage them when the state is making its full pension payment plus supplemental payments it demonstrates to residents and businesses that the state is creating a predictable

february advertisement article continues below this ad the two year budget lamont and lawmakers enacted last june increases aid to cities and towns by nearly 200 million per year on average without

russia s ongoing military invasion of ukraine which began on february 24 and still continues has been described as a turning point in the modern history of europe russia s aggression has catalysed european rearmament galvanised the european and american arms industry rejuvenated the north atlantic treaty organization nato caused germany to reassert european leadership and galvanised tentative japanese militarism for india which has been enjoying the advantages of an arms buyer s market and invoking the atmanirbhar bharat slogan to bargain hard for setting up production of western weaponry in the country this unwanted shift towards a seller s market spells bad news
by hrishabh sandilya and zhivka deleva prague berlin russia s invasion of ukraine has already generated more than two million refugees many of whom have been welcomed in poland and other central and eastern european countries the humanitarian response has been heartening notwithstanding these countries past resistance to providing similar support to asylum seekers from the middle east and north africa ordinary citizens civil society organisations and government agencies have come together to stock border towns with emergency rations first aid supplies clothing shelter and transportation options the european union has announced that all ukrainian refugees will receive temporary one to two year protected status regardless of where they apply for it the dublin convention which requires the first country of entry to assess migrants asylum applications has been tossed out one hopes the eu will now follow the same process for all future asylum seekers regardless of their skin color the hope is also that peace will soon prevail making the latest influx of refugees into europe temporary and reversible but given the vast scale of the destruction in ukraine and the lingering effects the war and the pandemic will have on its economy eu member states should be prepared to host refugees for the medium to long term and to avoid the backlash that has followed from previous refugee influxes they should already be taking steps to integrate the new arrivals into their societies an influx of human capital could be immensely beneficial to many eu economies provided that the resettlement process is managed properly in this respect the current situation raises two important considerations first unlike western european countries the eu s newer member states still have very little experience with large scale immigration having hitherto remained insular and unwelcoming their institutions and populations are largely unprepared second the influx of ukrainians into these countries has mostly consisted of women and children because fighting age men have remained behind inclusion mechanisms therefore will need to be gender and age responsive as ukrainian refugees are relocated within europe the first priority will be to help them find safe affordable and suitable housing emergency residences and shelters are not viable long term arrangements and national and municipal governments will have to work with private housing providers to find lasting solutions a task made more complicated by the recent meteoric rises in property prices repurposing properties intended for short term stays could be a good place to start given that tourism within the eu has yet to recover to its pre pandemic level and activist minded municipalities could even demand the use of apartments from speculators and mega landlords as berlin recently attempted to do these initial moves could then be reinforced with innovative public private partnerships like refugee housing labs co living arrangements and transitional apartments and subletting schemes with children making up a large share of the displaced programmes to help them catch up on lost schooling will be crucial governments should reach out to volunteers pedagogical institutions and ngos to help fill the gaps while they work to expand existing school facilities a good example is berlin s back on track project which has seen much success with a decentralised approach to educational catch up for young syrian refugees in prague the ukrainian one class project has already mobilised a network of schools to provide ukrainian speaking teachers for incoming ukrainian pupils efforts like this will need to be replicated across the eu beyond providing housing education and financial support governments will also need to facilitate ukrainian women s entry into eu labor markets in addition to offering training for occupational skills and entrepreneurship activities eu governments should focus on eliminating the red tape that keeps able and willing refugees from working project phoenix s own work in cyprus along with numerous studies confirms that female financial empowerment leads to better outcomes for migrants but among the biggest hurdles to migrant women s empowerment are inadequate language training and a lack of access to childcare here the pandemic experience offers lessons for how to proceed through online learning institutions should be able to start providing language classes as soon as refugees arrive and while traditional daycare centers may be overwhelmed digital tools to pool caring solutions and share responsibilities among migrant mothers could serve as a stopgap european labour ministries should work closely with companies recruiters and job matching services to ensure that skilled workers are quickly placed artificial intelligence driven translation and screening can help as would an easing of the process for recognising diplomas and technical qualifications similarly universities and technical training institutions will need to be flexible to accommodate late starts missing paperwork and coursework submitted in multiple languages this will be worth it to ensure that female refugees acquire the knowledge and experience they need to enter the workforce finally refugees who want to be entrepreneurs will need sustained technical support access to finance and perhaps most important mentors to guide them through the process of starting a business here governments could collaborate with refugee entrepreneurship incubators like singa and tern both of which have perfected their approach over multiple migration waves in europe these are only a few suggestions for policymakers to consider as the focus shifts beyond humanitarian assistance other challenges like helping victims of war address trauma and ensuring adequate mental health support are equally urgent and essential to help rebuild lives so far europe s track record on migrant and refugee inclusion has been spotty but given the outpouring of support for ukrainians one hopes that this is the dawn of a new europe one that lives up to its claim of defending liberal democracy and valuing human life perhaps the unexpectedly solidary response of the eu s eastern bloc can show the rest how to respond to all refugees in the future hrishabh sandilya is co founder and head of

the woodlands texas march 13 2022 prnewswire huntsman corporation nyse hun today announced that leading independent proxy advisory firm glass lewis has recommended that shareholders vote for all of huntsman s director nominees on the white proxy card at its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders annual meeting scheduled to be held on march 25 2022 with less than two weeks before the annual meeting glass lewis concluded1 in considering whether the dissident s campaign represents an opportunity to further enhance the composition of the board we would first note our belief that starboard s four alternative nominees as a slate are inferior to the four directors targeted for replacement given the implications of the two proxy card system as well as our determination that starboard has not satisfied the first criterion of our framework for contested elections we do not believe sufficient cause exists for investors to vote on the dissident s proxy card for shareholders who might be thinking along these lines we would caution that voting on the dissident s proxy card with the aim of effecting a very specific voting outcome could have unintended consequences and result in an entirely different outcome than desired in light of these factors we recommend shareholders vote on the company s white proxy card for all board nominees glass lewis also noted that successful execution of huntsman s strategy and performance is driving the company forward we believe huntsman s recent financial and stock price performance indicate the company is on the right track and ultimately we fail to see a compelling case that further changes beyond those the board has already made are either warranted at this time or likely to result in incremental improvement further the dissident s campaign appears to be backwards looking in several respects in our view and we believe it lacks new ideas or a detailed plan to improve huntsman s performance going forward although starboard seeks to replace directors who it believes lack true independence or qualifications for the board not only do we find insufficient cause to remove current directors we also aren t convinced that starboard s nominees have particularly relevant timely or incremental experience to add to the board at this time echoing arguments huntsman has been making since the outset glass lewis further wrote that starboard s campaign might have resonated better two years ago but since the spin off ipo and divestitures of huntsman s commodity businesses our analysis indicates huntsman s stock price and financial performance have improved markedly on the governance front the company has recently completed a near complete refresh of the board with all but one remaining legacy non executive director transitioning off the board at this annual meeting starboard s added pressure may have inspired the board to follow through with the board overhaul this year but we have a generally favorable view of the six new directors the company has added since 2019 and we believe the current composition of the board aligns well with huntsman s business portfolio strategy and positive trajectory commenting on the glass lewis recommendation the huntsman board of directors the board issued the following statement the recommendation from glass lewis to support all of huntsman s highly qualified nominees reaffirms that our refreshed board is best equipped to continue driving the company s transformed product portfolio strategy with the expertise necessary to drive enhanced value for shareholders as glass lewis recognizes the huntsman of today is vastly different than the huntsman of even five years ago the board has taken meaningful actions to oversee the company s value over volume strategy transform its balance sheet and enhance its governance through an extensive refreshment plan as a result of these actions 2021 was the best year in our history with our current portfolio and the strongest profit and margin performance we have ever achieved over the last five years the company has generated total shareholder returns of 98 nearly 13 better than the s p 500 during the same period 2 we believe that replacing any of the company s director candidates with starboard s nominees would disrupt huntsman s value creating strategy and risk destroying substantial and accelerating momentum all of huntsman s director nominees have the superior skillsets required to effectively oversee the company s sustainable long term growth including necessary expertise across differentiated chemicals and industrials experience r d and customer focused innovation focus and portfolio management expertise each of huntsman s directors is vastly superior to starboard s four nominees we urge shareholders to protect the value of their investment and disregard starboard s unwise and unnecessary campaign by following glass lewis unqualified recommendation and voting for all of the company s highly qualified directors on the white proxy card today huntsman reminds shareholders that every vote is important no matter how many or few shares it represents shareholders are urged to discard any blue proxy materials they may have received and only vote using the white proxy card huntsman shareholders who need assistance in voting their shares may call toll free huntsman s

song chen china daily in his book the economic consequences of the peace published in 1919 john maynard keynes a uk economist and father of keynesian economics compared the stance of the victors of world war i to that of the romans toward the carthaginians after the end of the punic wars 264 146 bc at that time rome dealt carthage an extremely cruel defeat virtually eliminating the mediterranean influence of that ancient phoenician city in north africa keynes took part in the paris conference that negotiated the terms of the central powers surrender and witnessed the revanchism of france and britain against germany and former us president woodrow wilson s weakness in containing the vengeful fury of the two allies in practice the main objective of the treaty of versailles was to completely liquidate germany s industrial capacity and impose on it a heavy war debt that would serve as an iron ball for many years the treaty also created the league of nations but it was born dead as the united states refused to participate in the organization the famous economist foresaw that the treaty s terms would harm the winning nations themselves he analyzed the level of interconnection between the european economies before the war of which germany was the leading trading partner of many of them including france and britain he also predicted that the collapse of germany would be the economic collapse of the entire continent as happened in the 1920s and more drastically after the new york stock exchange crash in 1929 another prediction made by keynes was that germany would take revenge the moment it managed to rebalance itself economically as happened after the rise of the third reich when world war ii ended in 1945 the attitude of the victorious powers was different the tehran 1943 bretton woods 1944 yalta potsdam and san francisco 1945 conferences served as an institutional framework for the new order that emerged in the postwar period the beginning of the cold war between the us and the soviet union did not shake the central structures even though the socialist countries organized an economic system apart from the west specifically concerning the two defeated powers the us treatment was different from before it supported the reconstruction of japan and germany and incorporated them into the economic system it led the marshall plan served not only for reconstruction but also for the modernization of european economies bretton woods institutions and the new monetary system based on the gold standard allowed the return to convertibility of several european currencies and the formation of the european monetary system which decades later would be the basis for the euro the overcoming of rivalries between germany and france also contributed to creating the foundations of the european union finally the adoption of keynesian economic policies enabled economic development and the incorporation of the working masses into the consumer market when looking at the policy of the us and europe at the end of the cold war when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the posture of the victors it again resembled that of the romans in imposing the carthaginian peace the adoption of the shock therapy and the ideas of the washington consensus served as a means for a minority to appropriate a wide range of public owned assets and businesses in eastern european countries including russia and led to the breakdown of the social assistance structure of states and an unprecedented increase in unemployment and misery the main indication of this tragedy is the decrease in the population s life expectancy specifically concerning russia this indicator decreased from 70 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2000 another aspect of the draconian treatment of the defeated russia occurred with the enlargement of the north atlantic treaty organization toward the east in the negotiations between mikhail gorbachev and george bush and later between boris yeltsin and bill clinton there was a commitment that nato would not expand the bloc toward russia s borders between 1999 and 2005 many countries from the former socialist bloc joined nato including lithuania estonia and latvia there were attempts to incorporate georgia but moscow acted energetically to prevent this process there have also been attempts to destabilize various countries through the so called color revolutions most recently in belarus in 2020 and in kazakhstan last january considering the context related to the current crisis the great powers must learn from history the carthaginian peace strategy is extremely dangerous because should a humiliated country manage to regain its strength it will seek to reestablish its former power condition and claim the rights that have been suppressed in this regard it is important to recall a new type of relations between major powers which seeks to create a more cooperative international environment through a multilateral order that contemplates the vital interests of each stakeholder of the international community it is necessary to overcome the logic of the cold war to build a world that responds to the real challenges facing human societies such as the climate crisis hunger and poverty the author is a professor of international political economy at sao paulo state university the author contributed this article to china watch a

person in nashville tennessee from march 13 16 2022 these data will also be presented at the rna leaders world congress in basel on march 17th sandra rojas caro m d chief medical officer of neubase said dm1 is a significant unmet medical need characterized by myotonia muscle weakness and wasting and cognitive impairments we are excited to present new preclinical data for our lead candidate nt 0231 f to support our differentiated approach for dm1 systemic administration of nt 0231 f achieves clinically relevant molecular and functional rescue in the muscle in the hsalr model which reproduces many components of the disease initial pharmacokinetic data supports a whole body solution to the disease and additional preclinical work is in progress to assess biodistribution in key tissues these data are an important milestone in our dm1 development program and support our pursuit of a best in class therapeutic profile for the disease a single intramuscular dose confirmed that nt 0231 f is pharmacologically active in the muscle and drives molecular and functional rescue in the hsalr model including splice rescue nuclear aggregate resolution and myotonia delayed muscle relaxation after contraction reversal a single intravenous iv dose of nt 0231 f or multiple subcutaneous sc doses over a 28 day period broadly rescued splicing including the chloride channel clcn1 transcript and reversed myotonia in the model a single iv dose of nt 0231 f provides initial splice rescue at around two weeks with significant splice rescue around three weeks myotonia reversal was achieved at around four weeks with effects enduring to at least six weeks the longest time point tested so far a time course of multiple sc doses across increasing concentrations of nt 0231 f was also investigated and showed splice rescue and myotonia reversal in a dose responsive manner illustrating feasibility of the differentiated and patient friendly sc route in pharmacokinetic studies of nt 0231 f in wild type balb c mice a single iv or sc dose showed high volume of distribution suggesting wide tissue distribution dietrich a stephan ph d founder chief executive officer and chairman of neubase said we now have preclinical data in the gold standard animal model for our development candidate demonstrating robust reversal of myotonia as measured by muscle relaxation in these studies we believe we are the only company that has shown improved muscle relaxation after systemic routes of administration the hsalr model is also a high bar for human disease in that it contains at least 10x more mutant gene cug repeat targets than patients giving us further conviction in the robustness of our approach not only does this data support the further advancement of our lead program in dm1 and

bretton woods 1944 yalta potsdam and san francisco 1945 conferences served as an institutional framework for the new order that emerged in the postwar period the beginning of the cold war between the us and the soviet union did not shake the central structures even though the socialist countries organized an economic system apart from the west specifically concerning the two defeated powers the us treatment was different from before it supported the reconstruction of japan and germany and incorporated them into the economic system it led the marshall plan served not only for reconstruction but also for the modernization of european economies bretton woods institutions and the new monetary system based on the gold standard allowed the return to convertibility of several european currencies and the formation of the european monetary system which decades later would be the basis for the euro the overcoming of rivalries between germany and france also contributed to creating the foundations of the european union finally the adoption of keynesian economic policies enabled economic development and the incorporation of the working masses into the consumer market when looking at the policy of the us and europe at the end of the cold war when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the posture of the victors it again resembled that of the romans in imposing the carthaginian peace the adoption of the shock therapy and the ideas of the washington consensus served as a means for a minority to appropriate a wide range of public owned assets and businesses in eastern european countries including russia and led to the breakdown of the social assistance structure of states and an unprecedented increase in unemployment and misery the main indication of this tragedy is the decrease in the population s life expectancy specifically concerning russia this indicator decreased from 70 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2000 another aspect of the draconian treatment of the defeated russia occurred with the enlargement of the north atlantic treaty organization toward the east in the negotiations between mikhail gorbachev and george bush and later between boris yeltsin and bill clinton there was a commitment that nato would not expand the bloc toward russia s borders between 1999 and 2005 many countries from the former socialist bloc joined nato including lithuania estonia and latvia there were attempts to incorporate georgia but moscow acted energetically to prevent this process there have also been attempts to destabilize various countries through the so called color revolutions most recently in belarus in 2020 and in kazakhstan last january considering the context related to the current crisis the great powers must learn from history the carthaginian peace strategy is extremely dangerous because should a humiliated country manage to regain its strength it will seek to reestablish its former power condition and claim the rights that have been suppressed in this regard it is important to recall a new type of relations between major powers which seeks to create a more cooperative international environment through a multilateral order that contemplates

song chen china daily in his book the economic consequences of the peace published in 1919 john maynard keynes a uk economist and father of keynesian economics compared the stance of the victors of world war i to that of the romans toward the carthaginians after the end of the punic wars 264 146 bc at that time rome dealt carthage an extremely cruel defeat virtually eliminating the mediterranean influence of that ancient phoenician city in north africa keynes took part in the paris conference that negotiated the terms of the central powers surrender and witnessed the revanchism of france and britain against germany and former us president woodrow wilson s weakness in containing the vengeful fury of the two allies in practice the main objective of the treaty of versailles was to completely liquidate germany s industrial capacity and impose on it a heavy war debt that would serve as an iron ball for many years the treaty also created the league of nations but it was born dead as the united states refused to participate in the organization the famous economist foresaw that the treaty s terms would harm the winning nations themselves he analyzed the level of interconnection between the european economies before the war of which germany was the leading trading partner of many of them including france and britain he also predicted that the collapse of germany would be the economic collapse of the entire continent as happened in the 1920s and more drastically after the new york stock exchange crash in 1929 another prediction made by keynes was that germany would take revenge the

march 8 2022 the president good morning folks sorry to keep you waiting i was on a couple of phone calls today i m announcing the united states is targeting the main artery of russia s economy we re banning all imports of russian oil and gas and energy that means russian oil will no longer be acceptable at u s ports and the american people will deal another powerful blow to putin s war machine this is a move that has strong bipartisan support in the congress and i believe in the country americans have rallied support have rallied to support the ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing putin s war this made we made this decision in close consultation with our allies and our partners around the world particularly in europe because a united response to putin s aggression has been my overriding focus to keep all nato and all of the eu and our allies totally united we re moving forward on this ban understanding that many of our european allies and partners may not be in a position to join us the united states produces far more oil domestically than all of european all the european countries combined in fact we re a net exporter of energy so we can take this step when others cannot but we re working closely with europe and our partners to develop a long term strategy to reduce their dependence on russian energy as well our teams are actively discussing how to make this happen and today we remain united we remain united in our purpose to keep pressure mounting on putin and his war machine this is a step that we re taking to inflict further pain on putin but there will be costs as well here in the united states i said i would level with the american people from the beginning and when i first spoke to this i said defending freedom is going to cost it s going to cost us as well in the united states republicans and democrats understand alike understand that republicans and democrats alike have been clear that we must do this over the last week i ve spoken with president zelenskyy several times to hear from him about the situation on the ground and to consult and continuing to consult with our european allies and about u s support for ukraine and the ukrainian people thus far we ve provided more than 1 billion in security assistance to ukraine shipments of defensive weapons are arriving in ukraine every day from the united states and we the united states are the ones coordinating the delivery of our allies and partners of similar weapons from germany to finland to the netherlands we re accom we re we re working that out we re also providing humanitarian support for the ukrainian people both those still in ukraine and those who have fled safely to a neighboring country we re working with humanitarian organizations to surge tens of thousands of tons of food water and medical supplies into ukraine and with more on the way over the weekend i sent secretary blinken to visit our border between the border poland and ukraine and to moldova to see what the situation was firsthand and report back general milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of our defense department is also was also in europe meeting with his counterparts and allies on nato s eastern flank to reassure them those countries bordering russia nato countries that we will keep our nato commitment a sacred commitment to article of article 5 the vice president harris is going to be traveling to meet with our allies in poland and romania later this week as well i ve made it clear that the united states will share in the responsibility of caring for the refugees so the costs do not fall entirely on the european countries bordering ukraine and yesterday i spoke with my counterparts from france germany and the united kingdom about russia s escalating violence against ukraine and the steps that we re going to take together with our allies and partners around the world to respond to this aggression we are enforcing the most significant package of economic sanctions in history and it s causing significant damage to russia s economy it has caused the russian economy to quite frankly crater the russian ruble is now down to 50 percent by 50 percent since putin announced his war one ruble is now worth less than one american penny one ruble is less than one american penny and preventing russia s central bank from propping up the ruble and to keep its value up they re not going to be able to do that now we cut russia s largest banks from the international financial system and it s crippled their ability to do business with the rest of the world in addition we re choking off russia s access to technology like semiconductors that are and sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come major companies are pulling out of russia entirely without even being asked not by us over the weekend visa mastercard american express they all suspended their services in russia all of them joining a growing list of american and global companies from ford to nike to apple they ve suspended their operations in russia the u s stock exchange has halted trading of many russian securities and the private sector is standing united against russia s vicious war of choice the u s department of justice has assembled a dedicated task force to go after russian the crimes of russian oligarchs and we re joining with our european allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets and all their ill begotten gains to make sure they share in the pain of putin s war these by the way are giant yachts you put some of them in your press i mean some of them are i think i read one was over 400 feet long i mean it s this is worth hundreds of millions of dollars the decision today is not without cost here at home putin s war is already hurting american families at the gas pump since putin began his military buildup on ukrainian borders just since then the price of the gas at the pump in america went up 75 cents and with this action it s going to go up further i m going to do everything i can to minimize putin s price hike here at home in coordination with our partners we ve already announced that we re releasing 60 million barrels of oil from our joint oil reserves half of that 30 billion million excuse me is coming from the united states and we re taking steps to ensure the reliable supply of global energy and we re also going to keep working with every tool at our disposal to protect american families and businesses now let me let me say this to the oil and gas companies and to the finance firms that back them we understand putin s war against the people of ukraine is causing prices to rise we get that that s self evident but but but but it s no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit this situation or ameri or american consumers exploit them russia s aggression is costing us all and it s no time for profiteering or price gouging i want to be clear about what we ll not tolerate but i also want to acknowledge those firms in oil and gas industries that are pulling out of russia and joining other businesses that are leading by example this is a time when we have to do our part and make sure we re not taking we re not taking advantage look let me be clear about two other points first it s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production that s simply not true even amid the pandemic companies in the united states pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor s first year we re approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the united states and we re on track to set a record of oil production next year in the united states 90 percent of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn t owned by the federal government and of the remaining 10 percent that occurs on federal land the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased they have 9 000 permits to drill now they could be drilling right now yesterday last week last year they have 9 000 to drill onshore that are already approved so let me be clear let me be clear they are not using them for production now that s their decision these are the facts we should be honest about the facts second this crisis is a stark reminder to protect our economy over the long term we need to become energy independent i ve had numerous conversations over the last three months with our european friends of how they have to wean themselves off of russia russian oil it s just not it s just not tenable it should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy this is a perspective as i said that our european allies share and the a future where together we can achieve greater independence loosening environmental regulations or pulling back clean energy investment won t let me explain won t will not lower energy prices for families but transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy with tax credits to help american families winterize their homes and use less energy that will that will help and if we can if we do what we can it will mean that no one has to worry about the price at the gas pump in the future that ll mean tyrants like putin won t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations and it will make america a world leader manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies of the future to countries all around the world this is the goal we should be racing toward over the last two weeks the ukrainian people have inspired the world and i mean that in a literal sense they ve inspired the world with their bravery their patriotism their defiant determination to live free putin s war putin s war has caused enormous suffering and needless loss of life of women children everyone in ukraine both ukraine and i might add russians ukrainian leaders as well as leaders around the world have repeatedly called for a ceasefire for humanitarian relief for real diplomacy but putin seems determined to continue on his murderous path no matter the cost putin is now targeting cities and has been targeting cities and civilians schools hospitals apartment buildings last week he attacked the largest nuclear power plant in europe with an apparent disregard for the potential of triggering a nuclear meltdown he has already turned 2 million ukrainians into refugees russia may continue to grind out its advance at a horrible price but this much is already clear ukraine will never be a victory for putin putin may be able to take a city but he ll never be able to hold the country and if we do not respond to putin s assault on global peace and stability today the cost of freedom and to the american people will be even greater tomorrow so we re going to continue to support the brave ukrainian people as they fight for their country and i call on congress to pass the 12 billion ukraine assistance package that i have asked them for of late the ukrainian people are demonstrating by their physical courage that they are not about to just let putin take what he wants that s clear they ll defend their freedom their democracy their lives and we re going to keep providing security assistance economic assistance and humanitarian assistance we re going to support them against tyranny oppression violent acts of subjugation people everywhere and i think it s maybe even surprised some of you all people everywhere are speaking up for freedom and when the history of this war is written putin s war on ukraine will have left russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger may god bless all those heroes of ukraine and now i m off to texas thank you very very much cross talk by reporters i know there s a lot of que q mr president will you cut off trade with russia will you cut off trade with russia the president i know i know there s a lot of questions but there s a lot more that has to be made clear and i m going to hold on that until we get more information thank you appreciate it
review and preview prices rose 0 8 in the month of february the fastest rate in four months that s 7 9 over the last 12 months and 8 4 over the last three months that s the bad news from thursday s consumer price index report and the white house can t blame vladimir putin for this one though it is trying it s joe biden s inflation he blames putin but his policies and the federal reserve are at fault wall street journal editorial march 11 2022 in the week that witnessed gold and crude oil testing their all time highs while stocks and treasuries continued to be pressured by the relentless bombardment of ukraine by russian military forces as well as further economic signs of rising inflation our three star geocosmic critical reversal period of march 4 7 3 trading days has coincided with at least a pause if not a major reversal in several financial markets however with the war carnage continuing and more geocosmic conflict signatures on the horizon it is unclear if these reversals will be any more lasting than the great bear s promises of cease fires and protection of humanitarian evacuation routes the cosmic picture is currently supportive of an effort towards resolution but leaders have to make and honor that choice in order for these cosmic indicators to work as they could and should geocosmics are only half the equation of a result choice on the part of world leaders and actors is the other half but deception and lies and posturing as the victim are all good roles for the approaching conjunction between jupiter and neptune in pisces this also seems to be a central part of a military execution model just as assassination of one s enemies is part of the business model according to a recent wall street journal editorial for further insights on the i am the real victim propaganda or i am doing this because i love mother russia you may want to read putin s people by heidi blake it is available through amazon as a printed or audio book but let s get back to the markets and their performance under the important geocosmic signatures of february 16 march 6 and especially march 3 6 several world stock indices made new multi month and even yearly lows last week in europe the german dax crashed to a low of 12 438 on monday march 7 a loss now of 23 6 off its all time highs of november 18 and january 5 the netherlands aex fell to 652 80 a new yearly low and off 21 3 from its all time high of november 18 switzerland s smi and england s ftse indices also bottomed on march 7 down 16 35 and 12 2 from their all time highs recorded earlier this year in asia and the pacific rim the hang seng of hong kong has now fallen to its lowest level in nearly 6 years the japanese nikkei fell to a new yearly low and down 19 85 from its 31 year high recorded on september 14 2021 china s shanghai composite fell to 3147 its lowest mark since july 2020 and 15 1 from its triple top on december 13 2021 india s nifty is down nearly 15 from a high made january 18 in australia however it wasn t so bad there was a low on march 9 but it was higher than the low of february 24 which was higher than the low of january 27 the pattern of higher lows is encouraging the american indices have all held above their february 24 lows although the djia s p and nasdaq came close to breaking them on their weekly lows of march 8 the bovespa of brazil is still trading closer to its multi month highs than lows the performance of the commodity markets was even more stunning than equity markets crude oil soared to a new 14 year high of 130 50 on our march 7 critical reversal date two days later it was down to 103 63 gold soared to 2078 80 one day later on march 8 just slightly below its all time high of 2089 20 recorded in august 2020 three days later it traded as low as 1960 silver rallied to 27 49 its highest price since june 2021 but there was even more drama in the grain markets wheat posted a new all time high of 1425 on the spot market on the march 7 geocosmic reversal date and by friday it recorded a low of 1020 with the geocosmic signatures coming up in the next 10 days the volatility is likely to continue short term geocosmics this will be another power packed week of geocosmic activity first the sun will conjoin neptune on sunday march 13 completing the first translation of the forthcoming jupiter neptune conjunction in pisces of april 12 the sun neptune conjunction is a level 1 signature the most consistent and powerful type of signature it has a 79 historical rate of frequency to sudden and sharp price swings within 4 trading days plus a 79 correspondence to primary cycles within a time band of 14 trading days but in pisces it can also relate to deception and lies in negotiations violations of promises and agreements it is a time to be cautious of whom you trust for people are naïve and vulnerable with romantic and misguided notions of reality just as important will be venus and mars entering into a square aspect with uranus march 19 22 venus rules taurus money and is in aquarius uranus rules aquarius chaos and disruptions and a sudden turn of events and is in taurus in other words venus and uranus are in each other s signs which is known as a mutual reception making it even more pronounced in terms of events and behaviors this is a classic reversal signature for financial markets historically it too has a 79 rate of frequency corresponding to sudden changes of direction in stock markets within a period of 4 trading days based on current studies this may have a pronounced effect also on the crypto currency markets like bitcoin and ethereum three days later mars then makes its square to uranus from aquarius to taurus this is totally different for it smacks of a sudden and unexpected burst of new military outbreaks or even cyber attacks it is also indicative of violent moves in financial markets and possibly world affairs mars is the god of war and aggression and uranus is the ruler of smart weapons terrorism unexpected surprises and cyber attacks of course it doesn t have to be that way it can be a time for inventive new solutions if those involved act in good faith with regard to the safety and well being of the masses aquarius otherwise in today s climate we have to read this as more likely a dangerous period for the masses and investors as well the danger may even continue into april 5 when another aspect of frustration and anger arises when mars conjoins saturn this can also be a period of long term cycle highs or lows reversals in grain prices within 1 3 weeks after april 5 the theme of the cosmos switches again towards resolution and peace we just have to protect ourselves until then to a great extent the themes of jupiter and neptune in pisces are already evident these are cosmic indicators of inflation they also contain themes of speculative frenzies which we see happening in gold and crude oil the latter even more so because it is ruled by jupiter neptune and pisces but with speculative frenzies come the presence or aftermath of hysteria and even panic on another level altogether jupiter neptune and pisces point to the importance of faith in a greater power the belief in miracles and existential acts of heroism against all odds to the emergence of a new world martyr and or hero this is the time to be a hero and not a despot to be a saint and person of virtue and not one cynically betraying the faith that others place onto him or her through deception manipulation and betrayal it is a conjunction with conjunctions especially we have the choice as to which role we want to play and which people we choose to admire are we going to be soldiers of truth willing to sacrifice for the healing of the planet and helpers of those who suffer or are we going to play the role of deceivers presenting and supporting false narratives that lead others into suffering that is the challenge of jupiter conjunct neptune in pisces at the same time mars conjoins saturn in aquarius square uranus in taurus this is all happening following the conjunction of venus peace and mars war in 0 degrees of aquarius last sunday march 6 which is also the cosmic point of the new era represented by the december 21 2020 conjunction of jupiter and saturn in the same degree of zero aquarius either this is the dawning of the age of aquarius and the start of a brilliant renaissance or it is a regression back into the age of the neanderthal through collective self destruction through complacency and unwillingness to make the decision for fear of angering others who come from the camp of the primal neanderthal given all these fixed signs they aren t going to change by our acts of appeasement it is easy to dismiss this as an exaggeration unless you understand the importance of

bluefin don t swim alone don t look for a lake cuyamaca stocking schedule old glory sportfishing it took angler robert tressler over an hour to get this 147 5 pound bluefin tuna to the boat and three gaffs to haul it aboard dock totals 3 6 3 12 1 003 anglers aboard 48 half day to 1 5 day trips out of san diego landings this past week caught 1 bluefin tuna 20 calico bass 120 halfmoon 3 halibut 11 lingcod 10 lobster 26 released 1 perch 3 012 rockfish 76 sand bass 21 sanddab 363 sculpin 161 sheephead 1 triggerfish 731 whitefish and 115 yellowtail saltwater the weather cleared enough for boats to extend their range and the old glory out of h m landing decided to check out the waters some 60 to 70 miles west of ensenada while out on a 1 5 day trip last friday saturday with 23 anglers aboard the gable paid off with limits of yellowtail and one 150 pound bluefin tuna though one may assume that like all tuna species bluefin tuna are annual migrators and will be gone from our waters when they spawn through the summer in a small area of the sea of japan the truth is that they are around all year and at the same time they spawn annually sponsored sponsored this is due to their feeding grounds while juveniles being here off the coast of north america from off oregon south to off the southern stretches of the baja peninsula as pacific bluefin are endothermic or warm blooded they are not subject to certain temperature ranges that triggers migrations of other pelagic species that the san diego fleet targets with freedom from the bonds that keep cold blooded fish more predictable bluefin tuna can be hard to find that they become sexually mature at a broad age range from 3 to 9 years and can be 120 300 pounds or more in that age range means some stay in the eastern pacific and some return to japan travelling over 5 000 miles to spawn every year once they return to spawn in the sea of japan pacific bluefin remain on that side of the ocean and they can live up to 25 years as they continue to grow throughout their lives they can reach upwards of 900 pounds this is why we don t see many caught over 400 pounds the world record pacific bluefin tuna landed unassisted igfa requirement for a record was caught in the western pacific by angler donna pascoe on february 19 2014 the california record was caught this past summer by san diego angler floyd sparks and weighed 395 4 pounds larger fish weighing just over 400 pounds in us waters but those did not qualify for record submittal though pacific bluefin are from the same stock there are many schools that migrate annually based on sexual maturity think cattle from one bloodline on a ranch you can have one stock but many herds studies were few before the turn of the century but more recent tracking efforts using pop up beacons that can be monitored by satellite shows that the bluefin tuna schools that remain in the eastern pacific can be just about anywhere from a couple miles off the coast to over a thousand and anywhere between eugene oregon and cabo san lucas that they are widely ranged and relatively unaffected by water temperature is why we don t see many caught during the winter months when fewer boats are running and weather and distance makes looking for them unsustainable for sportfishing vessels but as with the old glory when there is a sighting or a catch within range they will go take a look bluefin tuna are not solitary swimmers and are typically caught in schools that migrated together so where there is one in the hundred and fifty pound range there are more in that area the one fish caught aboard the old glory was plucked out of a large metered school of fish 250 feet below a hot yellowtail surface bite it may have been just one fish hooked and landed but seasoned old glory captain kley williams decision to go offshore paid off with a brute as we had our first week of the season with over a thousand anglers and spring break is near along with the great seasonal rockfish numbers i expect we will see more yellowtail bonito and bluefin in the counts in the coming weeks with more boats out looking freshwater as the trout season is winding down anglers who want to continue catching the tasty stockers through spring and into summer can focus on the one lake in our county that stocks trout 10 months out of the year lake cuyamaca trout fishing is still good at the other county lakes being stocked but that bite will wane quickly once the last plants are delivered by late march through early april and the lower elevation lake waters warm cuyamaca does not publish their trout stocking schedule as do most county lakes though as they stock most of the year and has cooler water at over 4 600 feet in elevation trout can be caught there in any month the lake also offers good largemouth bass fishing along with small a small population of smallmouth bass plenty of channel catfish bluegill crappie and occasionally white sturgeon are caught there as well making cuyamaca one of the more species diverse lakes in our area fish on fish plants march 20 lake wolhford trout 1 500 march 21 lake jennings trout 2 000 march 24 lake poway trout 1 500

global stocks of diesel and other middle distillates have fallen to the lowest seasonal level since 2008 when similar shortages of these transport and industrial fuels helped to propel oil prices to a record high distillate fuel oil inventories in the united states are 30 million barrels 21 below the pre pandemic five year seasonal average and at the lowest level since 2005 the u s energy information administration said stocks in europe are 35 million barrels 8 below the pre pandemic five year average at the lowest level since 2008 euroilstock which compiles inventory data on behalf of the european union found and middle distillate stocks in singapore are 4 million barrels 32 below the pre pandemic five year average and also at the lowest since 2008 according to the country s ministry of trade and industry combined inventories across the three locations have fallen by 110 million barrels compared with the same point last year as consumption has persistently outpaced production demand for diesel and other middle distillates is highly geared to the economic cycle since they are mainly used in freight transportation manufacturing farming mining and oil and gas extraction the rapid rebound in economic activity after the first wave of the pandemic and associated lockdowns and its focus on diesel intensive manufacturing and freight has boosted use of the fuel at the same time refiners have restrained crude processing to deplete the excess stocks that built up during the coronavirus recession and adapt to lower demand from passenger airlines for jet fuel but the continued depletion of distillate inventories has become unsustainable russia s invasion of ukraine and the subsequent boycott of russian fuel threatens to make diesel shortages worse shell bp halt spot german diesel sales on scarcity fears reuters march 10 actual or potential fuel shortages have been reported in france germany hungary and sweden austria s omv restricts hungary fuel sales as supply fears grip europe reuters march 11 distillate production will have to be raised above consumption for a period to rebuild stocks to a more comfortable level there is some scope for refiners to boost distillate output by increasing crude processing back to pre pandemic rates but that will transform a shortage of distillate into a shortage of crude oil pressure to stabilise and rebuild distillate inventories will cause refiners crude consumption to accelerate later this year and into 2023 but the global crude market is already exceptionally tight and the extra crude demand will cause it to tighten further the global distillate shortage is threatening to create a severe spike in oil prices just as it did in the first half of 2008 if prices are adjusted for inflation and converted to 2022 values brent crude surged from an already high 135 per barrel at the end of february 2008 not far from recent prices to 187 per barrel at the end of june and briefly above 196 in july if something cannot go on forever it will stop economist herbert stein who had been u s president richard nixon s chief economic adviser said in 1986 in this case the only question is how the depletion of distillate stocks will be turned around faster production slower consumption or both either the oil industry must find a way to boost crude and distillate supplies or the economic expansion must slow to ease diesel demand source reuters editing by barbara lewis

energy supply diversification to china has been at the core of russia s eastern pivot while russian gas is central to china s energy diversification away from the middle east and australia russia has become the third largest natural gas supplier to china including both pipeline gas and lng and is currently its second largest crude supplier after saudi arabia making beijing s geopolitical stance somewhere between moscow and washington increasingly important in the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine when the preliminary power of siberia gas pipeline deal was signed in 2014 the spot price of lng was around 10 50 mmbtu but prices have risen manifold since then making pipeline gas much cheaper for china economics alone will make it tougher for beijing to cut russian gas supply

the cost of russia s invasion of ukraine will become a lot clearer next week with a previously unthinkable sovereign default looming more emergency central bank measures likely and a stock market crash guaranteed if it reopens moscow s special operation in its former soviet neighbour has cut russia off from key parts of the global financial markets by the west triggering its worst economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the soviet union wednesday could mark another low the government is due to pay 117 million on two of its dollar denominated bonds but it has been signalling it will not or if its does it will be in roubles tantamount to a default technically it has a 30 day grace period but that is a minor point if it happens it would represent its first international default since the bolshevik revolution over a century ago default is quite imminent said roberto sifon a top analyst at s p global which has just hit russia with the world s biggest ever sovereign credit rating downgrade that state run energy giants gazprom and rosneft have made international bond payments in recent days and around 200 billion of still unsanctioned government reserves does leave a sliver of hope that might not happen though those odds look grim wednesday could be busy for other reasons as well russia s vedomosti financial newspaper reported central bank and moscow exchange sources as saying this week that suspended local equity and bond trading could resume by then it would be chaotic at least in the short term russia s big firms which also listed on the london and new york markets have saw those international shares slump virtually to zero when the crisis broke out and have now been stopped there are many financial institutions that are sitting on russian assets that they want to get rid of but they can t said rabobank currency strategist jane foley they have no real option but to sit on them but that means that when they are allowed to trade the selling could be quite persistent recession it will not finish there russia s central bank is scheduled to meet on friday having already more than doubled interest rates to 20 and brought in widespread capital controls to try and prevent a full blown financial crisis western investment banks like jpmorgan now expect the economy to plunge 7 this year due to the combination of bank run worries sanctions damage and the instant inflation surge caused by a 40 slump in the rouble that compares to predictions of 3 growth at the beginning on the year it also means a peak to trough dive of around 12 which would be larger than the 10 tumble in the 1998 rouble crisis the 11 lost during the global financial meltdown and the 9 slump of the covid 19 pandemic the cbr might hike rates a bit further that would be safest assumption right now said arthur budaghyan chief emerging market strategist at bca research the more crucial moves as this stage however could be further capital control measures to try and keep the financial system cocooned ensuring the banks can function can still process payments and keep credit flowing to the economy so it can at least function in some capacity is much more important budaghyan said source reuters reporting by marc jones editing by david gregorio
cai meng china daily foreign institutions have increased their holdings of domestic yuan denominated bonds for 10 consecutive months rising by 66 3 billion yuan 10 49 billion to 4 07 trillion yuan in late january china s bond connect program showed among them foreign institutions bonds under custody with china central depository clearing increased by 50 1 billion yuan to 3 73 trillion yuan in september rising for 38 consecutive months the economic situation has become more complex and changeable and the country is facing multiple pressures amid high inflation and strong expectations for further monetary policy tightening overseas however international investors are fully confident in china s long term economic prospects choosing to continue increasing their holdings of yuan denominated assets for the whole of 2022 the gap between the gdp growth rates in china and the united states may hit a new low since the 1990s china s 2022 economic growth will start high and end low while us economic growth may slow down quarter by quarter in 2022 compared with the gradually weakening effect of the us stimulus policy there will be many positive factors that will boost china s economic growth in 2022 to some extent the narrowing spread between 10 year chinese and us government bond yields will impact foreign capital inflows into china high inflation and tightening monetary policy in europe and the us will push up yields on bonds while chinese government bond yields may easily dip and barely rise with easing monetary policy as of feb 15 the yield spread between chinese and us 10 year treasurys shrank 51 basis points from the end of last year to 74 5 bp lower than the comfort zone spread of between 80 and 100 bp however the narrowing spread is to be expected affected by this the net increase in foreign holdings of domestic yuan denominated bonds fell by 5 percent month on month in january on a yearly basis the net increase decreased by 70 percent in january even so foreign investors rarely reduce their holdings of domestic bonds as yuan denominated bonds may still be under allocated in the asset allocations of foreign investors data from china central depository clearing showed bonds held by foreign institutions under custody only account for 4 24 percent of total bonds under custody lower than the 30 percent in the us in addition the structure of yuan denominated bonds held by foreign investors is relatively simple as government bonds and bonds issued by financial policy institutions account for 68 percent and 29 percent of bonds held by foreign investors respectively there are many overseas risks foreseeable this year including the covid 19 pandemic inflation risks energy crisis food crisis and supply chain disruptions and expected us fed policy tightening on the contrary domestic policies and economic situations point to stability which is attractive to foreign investors looking to reduce volatility for asset allocation investors at home and abroad said yuan denominated assets are useful to hedge risks in overseas markets high inflation and fed policy tightening may trigger further selling of us treasurys and the rising yields will undoubtedly put pressure on equity market valuations domestically the people s bank of china s moves such as required reserve ratio reductions showcased that they have become a necessity to stabilize growth the international monetary fund has repeatedly warned that emerging markets should be wary of foreign investors pulling money out of those markets amid fed policy tightening and china will also be affected however the imf also said china is the ballast stone of emerging markets and china s relatively strong currency has further boosted foreign investors motivations to stay early in 2019 china became the world s second largest bond market after the us in january the average daily trading transaction volume of the interbank market reached 5 3 trillion yuan exceeding the amount held by foreign investors in recent years china has continuously promoted two way opening up of the financial market according to the 14th five year plan 2021 25 china will comprehensively improve the level of opening up to the outside world and promote liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment in february 2020 us based financial group jpmorgan chase co included chinese government bonds in its benchmark emerging market indexes in november 2020 chinese government bonds and policy bank bonds were fully included in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index in october 2021 chinese government bonds were included in the ftse world government bond index in just two years chinese government bonds have been included in the three major global bond indexes further enhancing the appeal of yuan denominated bond assets currently developed countries excluding japan are making tighter monetary policy moves even the european central bank recently changed its tune to warn of high inflation this will have an adverse effect on the levels of emerging economies currencies imf studies have found negative correlations between the fed s broad dollar index and capital flows to emerging economies capital flows to emerging economies weakened when the us dollar appreciated relative to other major currencies in 2021 in addition as the 10 year us treasury yield still has room to move up and the anticipated tightening monetary policy may cause turmoil in international financial markets most emerging economies are having a difficult time when it comes to china us yield spreads domestic investors are still the main force to determine the yields with a key factor also being decisions made by the people s bank of china the country s central bank while foreign investors pay more attention to global asset allocation fed moves and us treasury yields they have a relatively limited impact on yuan denominated bond yields at the same time the above logic may vary as investor consensus changes for instance divergent policies between china and the us and trade frictions between the two countries led to the continuous depreciation of the yuan and narrowing spread between chinese and us government bond yields in 2018 while china saw a net inflow of foreign investment despite headwinds in 2018 china has a solid foundation to keep a stable renminbi exchange rate china has a relatively large current account surplus and a relatively low external debt especially in foreign currencies and it is able to cope with exchange rate fluctuations affected by the tightening of global dollar financing conditions and a stable exchange rate environment will help reduce the exchange rate risk cost for foreign investment in yuan denominated bonds

why china is still attractive to foreign investors 10 06 march 14 2022 by cai meng china daily foreign institutions have increased their holdings of domestic yuan denominated bonds for 10 consecutive

depository clearing increased by 50 1 billion yuan to 3 73 trillion yuan in september rising for 38 consecutive months the economic situation has become more complex and changeable and the country is facing multiple pressures amid high inflation and strong expectations for further monetary policy tightening overseas however international investors are fully confident in china s long term economic prospects choosing to continue increasing their holdings of yuan denominated assets for the whole of 2022 the gap between the gdp growth rates in china and the united states may hit a new low since the 1990s china s 2022 economic growth will start high and end low while us economic growth may slow down quarter by quarter in 2022 compared with the gradually weakening effect of the us stimulus policy there will be many positive factors that will boost china s economic growth in 2022 to some extent the narrowing spread between 10 year chinese and us government bond yields will impact foreign capital inflows into china high inflation and tightening monetary policy in europe and the us will push up yields on bonds while chinese government bond yields may easily dip and barely rise with easing monetary policy as of feb 15 the yield spread between chinese and us 10 year treasurys shrank 51 basis points from the end of last year to 74 5 bp lower than the comfort zone spread of between

after walking a budget tightrope with no safety net for most of the past two decades connecticut state government has socked away almost 4 8 billion since 2018 and could nearly double that by mid 2023 but while that s three and half times what connecticut saved in the prior 25 years combined the state s debt has somehow gotten worse by a lot state officials secured short term prosperity and less volatile finances for the foreseeable future by adding billions in long term obligations and as november s state wide elections near the battle to frame the state s financial outlook is only expected to intensify huge surpluses and extra pension payments at the connecticut business and industry association s jan 21 economic summit gov ned lamont was optimistic we ve had a surplus three years in a row that doesn t very often happen he said right now we re strong we ve had a surplus three years in a row that doesn t very often happen right now we re strong said gov ned lamont photograph by mark mirko mmirko courant com lamont who took office in january 2019 has some good reasons to say that taking advantage of a new savings program the legislature ordered in 2017 the democratic governor has kept the budget balanced and avoided major tax hikes that s a sharp contrast from the 2010s a decade plagued by deficit forecasts and remembered for two of the largest tax hikes in state history connecticut which muddled through most of the past decade with no fiscal cushion achieved the legal maximum rainy day fund allowed by law under lamont 15 of annual operating expenses which amounts to about 3 1 billion equally unprecedented connecticut is poised to dump billions of extra dollars into its cash starved pension funds in just a few years with the rainy day fund full the state hit another first under lamont last fall shifting a 1 6 billion surplus from the 2020 21 budget year into the pensions that s on top of the 2 9 billion in regular contributions already budgeted for pensions for state employees and municipal teachers and with analysts projecting another 4 4 billion in black ink across this fiscal year and next combined the pension funds could see a short term infusion of cash like never before the governor predicted that once those extra payments are made the state s regular required pension contributions could drop significantly that means hundreds of millions of dollars that could support education health care transportation municipal aid or tax relief those surplus projections have been fueled in part by a stock market that has largely been robust since 2018 despite a rough first month in 2022 connecticut s economic recovery and fiscal health continue to improve state treasurer shawn wooden a hartford democrat said in february adding that the state s cash flow and not just the surplus is at a historic high as well this gives us the potential to continue to responsibly pay down connecticut s pension liabilities at an accelerated rate state treasurer shawn wooden even as it saves more ct s debt increases there s another side to that coin connecticut reported 95 billion in unfunded obligations last fall a combination of bonded debt and unfunded pension and retirement health care responsibilities that s almost 30 more debt than the state reported in 2016 before five years of balanced budgets careful savings and an unprecedented supplemental pension payment connecticut which already ranked as one of the most indebted states in the nation appears to have gotten worse this is why people have a hard time trusting the people currently running our state government said madison republican bob stefanowski who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to lamont and is hoping for a rematch this year politicians making political calculations to protect their headlines rather than protecting the state s taxpayers and the bottom line some of that extra debt was really always there the legislature adopted more conservative assumptions about pension fund investment returns over the past few years dropping them from an annual average of 8 or more to about 7 pension debt is calculated over 25 or 30 years and lowering the assumed revenue from investments means more contributions must come from the taxpayers but that wasn t the only change that affected pension debt governors and legislatures also refinanced the state s pension obligations three times in the past four years connecticut state capitol credit rolf schulten ullstein bild via getty images debt payments involving both retirement benefit programs and bonding consumed only 12 of the annual budget in the mid 1990s but were eating nearly 30 by 2017 the state had failed to properly save for its pensions for more than 70 years forfeiting billions of dollars in potential investment earnings needed to cover benefits and leaving the present generation to make up the difference analysts warned finances would hit bottom around 2030 when spiking payments could be quadruple what they were in the mid 2010s likely crippling most other programs and forcing unprecedented tax hikes lamont and his predecessor gov dannel p malloy worked with legislatures to smooth out those spikes shifting billions of dollars in debt plus interest onto taxpayers in the late 2030s and 2040s but they didn t just lower required contributions for the spike years that are still to come they also restructured payments in the near term making their own budgets easier to manage while shifting even more burdens onto future taxpayers for example lamont restructured the teachers pension so that connecticut actually contributed 128 million less during his first two years in office than it had during malloy s last year on the job and the 2 9 billion connecticut must contribute this year to the two major pension funds combined this fiscal year also is roughly 630 million less than the payments the state would be facing had it not refinanced both pensions in 2019 according to actuaries projections from three years ago the minimum pension contributions the state had to make grew by almost 52 between 2012 and 2017 but over the last five years they are up 36 in other words some portion of the big surpluses connecticut now enjoys stems from slowing down its payment of pension debt it s incomprehensible that our debt obligations have gone from 75 billion to 95 billion over the last five years while gov lamont and the democrats in charge of the legislature take their victory laps stefanowski said connecticut s businesses are keeping a close watch on debt levels but the jury is still out on whether everyone feels good about them our larger businesses are very aware of the long term liabilities connecticut has and that it s been a little bit of a noose around the neck said chris dipentima president and ceo of the connecticut business and industry association our larger businesses are very aware of the long term liabilities connecticut has and that it s been a little bit of a noose around the neck said chris dipentima president and chief executive of the connecticut business industry association courant file photo and while the cbia applauds the supplemental pension payments made over the past year and a half he added anything that makes state debt levels and potentially future tax rates likely to climb remains an impediment to business confidence and job growth house republicans questioned whether pension refinancings couldn t have been delayed until the late 2020s saving connecticut s children huge burdens in the future politicians memories are limited to the election cycle said house minority leader vincent j candelora they fail to look holistically where we are as a state politicians memories are limited to the election cycle they fail to look holistically where we are as a state said house minority leader vincent j candelora ap photo jessica hill file democrats fiscal good news extends way beyond surpluses but while the overall debt level has increased lamont says connecticut has gained something very valuable fiscal stability for the first time in decades state officials can look at the planned pension payments significant though they are and imagine a scenario in which connecticut can manage them when the state is making its full pension payment plus supplemental payments it demonstrates to residents and businesses that the state is creating a predictable sustainable and structural budget environment to increase attractiveness as a great place to establish roots melissa mccaw who stepped down earlier this month as lamont s budget director said in february the two year budget lamont and lawmakers enacted last june increases aid to cities and towns by nearly 200 million per year on average without imposing any major tax hikes without refinancing those funds would likely have gone into the pension system or taxes would have gone up and while other states are fearful of what will happen when billions of dollars in emergency federal pandemic relief expires two years from now connecticut has relatively little to worry about analysts now project state finances for 2023 24 have a built in hole of 520 million but that doesn t include another 680 million they expect to be captured by the volatility adjustment those funds plus the 3 1 billion in the state s rainy day fund would enable the next governor and legislature to easily manage state finances even without federal pandemic relief we haven t had a recession in a long time and some of this prosperity is going to be throttled back eventually lamont told business leaders with the exception of the pandemic induced economic slump of 2020 connecticut has not faced a traditional recession since early 2010 but with probably the biggest rainy day fund per capita in the country lamont added we re relatively well prepared editors note in january and february 2017 the connecticut

you re reading entrepreneur middle east an international franchise of entrepreneur media excitement aside pursuing a business opportunity in a new city with almost no network and limited knowledge of its inner workings can be quite overwhelming however mishaal al gergawi founder of axis a new york based enterprise platform for accurate and instant information on countries and industries wanted his entrepreneurial journey to unroll in that specific manner personally i moved to new york because i wanted to build axis without any particular advantages that i may have had as a uae national in dubai al gergawi says it was a very personal choice to experience building this business in the biggest city in the world with little connections and zero differentiators and now that axis has been accepted into the winter 2022 startup batch of the internationally acclaimed accelerator program y combinator yc with al gergawi currently gearing up to present his startup at its demo day on march 29th to an invite only audience of 1 500 investors and media it s safe to say that moving to new york was the right choice y combinator is a very special place because it s an extremely supportive and open minded community he says the only advice i can really give to other entrepreneurs is that yc is looking for people with strong conviction and defensible insights at axis we ll be looking forward to raising our seed round and spending the next two years iterating on the product building some key features and expanding coverage to many markets and countries dubai born al gergawi started out his career in 2005 as an analyst at hsbc and deutsche bank having earned a bachelor s degree from the american university in dubai and an msc in international finance from ceram sophia antipolis in france some years later he joined his family s building materials business and eventually became its ceo i started off as an investment banker but my career was cut short when i was pulled into a family business during which i found time to write columns in the local papers he says i enjoyed writing and quickly established myself as a voice on dubai related economic and social topics i expanded my interest to the uae the gcc and eventually the middle east by 2010 it was clear to me that i wanted to do this in a more organized fashion so i set up the delma institute a political risk consultancy in abu dhabi which i ran till 2017 al gergawi considers researching and writing an obligatory precondition for any entrepreneurial venture and this habit has definitely contributed to him launching not only the delma institute but also his current startup axis it s very hard to build a startup if you re not curious he says founders are not musicians they re djs who take seemingly unrelated insights dynamics and data and turn them into new concepts in my process i like to dig into a space in order to fully understand it so i usually have one or two things i m really getting into for 12 to 18 months after that staying up to date requires 2 3 of that effort al gergawi credits the new york times bestseller atomic habits by james clear for fueling his stamina to complete several of his deep dives on various topics over the years including on middle eastern contemporary art and independent film 2008 2010 geopolitics of the middle east and political islam 2011 2013 russian literature 2013 2014 modern history 2015 2016 energy 2017 enterprise software as a service saas and sci fi 2018 2020 the summaries of these learnings can be found on his medium profile where he s currently looking into topics relating to web3 ranging from non fungible tokens nfts to decentralized finance defi and machine learning becoming a successful entrepreneur usually requires a setback if not a few that one would have to overcome and start anew and al gergawi went through a distressing experience of his own in 2012 before launching the delma institute in abu dhabi through a failed business venture that i was involved in i personally went into significant debt in 2008 al gergawi says for several months it felt like i would never get out of that situation it changed me in various ways including building my inner strength and patience reorienting my perspective of time and my relationship to money it really sucked but i don t think i d be here if it didn t in his time leading the delma institute al gergawi was at the helm of a company providing insights on west asia and north africa to governments and corporates i learned a lot about communication recruiting and managing people and fiscal discipline al gergawi recalls one of the most counterintuitive things is that more people equals more productivity at delma we were consistently investing our resources into expanding the team which meant we were always onboarding new people which in retrospect was very time consuming and reduced productivity and momentum related the changing face of business in the middle east mishaal al gergawi founder of axis a new york based enterprise platform for accurate and instant information on countries and industries source mishaal al gergawi he took this lesson with him when building his next business and as a result axis today maintains a small team and low burn rate as the team continues to iterate the product in line with user feedback al gergawi adds that the delta institute was a true precursor of axis in a more literal sense as well in my banking days i saw how the bloomberg terminal was the go to place to get varied data on financial markets e g bonds derivatives stocks commodities and so on which are mostly quantitative data he explains at delma we advised governments and corporates on developments in the region and this was a very qualitative type of work i e reports and presentations so i had an epiphany that perhaps there was a technology enabled version of what we did perhaps we could build a bloomberg terminal not for hedge funds but for companies a terminal that would capture not just financials and news but also other information like bilateral relationships government bodies regulatory ecosystems competitive landscape and industry trends all in a single place through a visual interface that mirrors how our mind thinks about these issues and with tools like search filter bookmark export chat and many others that we plan to launch this year to further explain the premise of axis he adds that executives in companies today check their email inboxes to find out what happened inside their companies but when it comes to anything outside of them they don t have an obvious and comprehensive place to look toward we want axis to be that to them al gergawi says we want to be their operating system that allows them to consume the world according to them with trust delight and agency insisting on a lean approach to building a business al gergawi points out that the axis team became 14 people strong only very recently for most of the company s life we ve been a handful of people tinkering away he adds this approach was especially propitious when al gergawi had to navigate his startup through the fallout from the covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 period was both good and bad for axis he says on the positive side due to people working from home we were able to talk to a lot of users who d probably be a lot less available pre covid 19 on the other hand covid 19 really froze budgets and decision making capacity so that slowed down growth having experienced building a business in the uae and now in new york he finds the two ecosystems very different two specific juxtapositions are that new york city is chaotic while abu dhabi and dubai are orderly and that new york city s public sector plays a much smaller role in shaping the city than abu dhabi and dubai s public sectors do he says at the end of the day though al gergawi says that the uae will forever remain his home and therefore he highlights his bias when sharing his thoughts on on the uae as a place to do business everything that i am and what i have brought to new york was forged there he says my hustle curiosity ideas and perspective comes from being a citizen of a young country that achieved so much in so little time with no preexisting credentials beyond hard work and clarity of vision i carry that with me every day i want to be like my country in the uae entrepreneurial opportunities are infinite he notes at the very base of it is building incredible experiences for consumers in the region who grew up with the internet and understand what their peers in other markets are getting al gergawi says the menasa region is so young and is so excited about the future specifically markets like egypt saudi arabia and pakistan are very exciting due to their size and urbanism in conclusion when asked to share his advice for entrepreneurs keen on seizing those aforementioned opportunities al gergawi replies that one thing that will work out in their favor is for them to always think of the user of their products or services and define them in the narrowest way possible it will help you to understand how to really rock their world al gergawi explains you don t want your product to be liked or considered interesting you want it to be loved and needed trep talk axis founder mishaal al gergawi s tips for entrepreneurs 1 figure out your users develop a very deep understanding of who your user is and very specifically how their life can improve if they used your product 2 get the right people around you start a company with people you really intellectually like and ethically respect 3 raise revenue instead of funds raising venture capital and spending it is not impressive making revenue with a small team is 4 focus on the right kind of feedback ignore the no s because people dislike things for many reasons and lean into the yes s because most people like things for a few specific reasons and then improve your product 5 maintain your mindset statistically your startup will fail but there is a tiny chance that with enough nobody knows how much hard work and some luck you could make a dent in some specific universe the world isn t rooting for your success or failure actually most of the world isn t aware of you so be strong push hard and don t take setbacks personally related the middle east is ripe for technology entrepreneurship

ninth largest holding diversified conglomerate itausa itvmf also holds itau as its flagship subsidiary the central bank of brazil s sharp interest rate increases over the last year taking the target rate from a low of 2 to 10 75 in less than a year bodes well for large banks like itau similarly the rise in oil prices has lifted the price of all large energy producers all over the world however itausa which operates in many more sectors ranging from real estate to chemicals to it has been showing some weakness over the last two weeks along with the broad market index while the etf s price has not similarly some manufacturing sectors of the bovespa have had painful losses since the start of the year like aeroplane manufacturer embraer erj and shoemaker alpargatas most known for the havaianas sandals both losing over 30 since the start of the year rumo otcpk rumof owns and operates rail networks to transport agricultural commodities and intermediate goods like automotive parts petrochemicals and steel its activities are closely linked to brazil s extractive and manufacturing economy and yet its shares are down about 12 year to date this points to further weakness under the surface for now however these weaknesses are overshadowed by heavily weighted outperformers the msci brazil etf lost over usd 5 million in rumo since the start of the year on a position just shy of 1 5 of the fund but this loss is overshadowed by the usd 11 million that it made on vale 18 of the fund growth in prices since the start of 2022 for ewz and some of its components with the bovespa index for reference bloomberg msci keep looking and you ll notice some other strange things below the surface what is the best performer by far year to date in brazil s equity index the stock of the stock exchange brasil bolsa balcao or b3 which accounts for 4 25 of the fund s holdings in fact the etf is not so much a bet on brazil s economy as a whole but rather a concentrated bet on a miner of hard commodities a state owned oil major and large cap financials sectors of exposure provided by the msci brazil etf source msci commodities demand is not everything a prevailing story in financial publications is that a growing world and particularly a growing china will produce strong demand for commodities and therefore be good for countries like brazil it s not wrong just reductionist for one brazil is much more than a simple commodity exporter even if exports have been a growing share of gdp for the past few years evolution of contributions to gdp by account bloomberg in fact brazil has had a persistent current account deficit for over a decade the last time that brazil had a current account surplus was before the great recession of 2007 2009 import and exports of goods by value and current account balance bloomberg the reason for this is the very large credit of primary income in the balance of payments essentially wealth that flows out to foreign investors on face value this is not a problem until one considers how fertile this issue is for populists the risk which may not be fully appreciated by investors is that in a crowded political field in a year of general elections someone will hatch a plan to do something about it if elected and sometimes those people get elected like in peru where president castillo did do something about it he got to power pledging to squeeze more money from peruâ s miners his government already proposed a new tax on profits for mining companies and an end to tax breaks according to a financial times article from november 2021 also reporting that a miner s shares dropped 27 on the day that peru s government decided to close mines on environmental grounds it is also pushing a tax reform that increases the fiscal burden of mining companies when ore prices are rise although the proposal was rejected by the peruvian congress in late december 2021 the intelligent investor knows that the political forces pushing for more wealth to remain in the country to fund social programs to alleviate poverty have not vanished there is a non negligible risk that brazilian political hopefuls will take inspiration from their neighbours two commodity prices reflect supply and demand and higher commodity prices do not guarantee higher export revenues brazil s principal exports by value are soy iron ore petroleum corn sugar and coffee all of these have increased since the start of 2020 but none like arabica coffee which is up nearly 100 in u s dollar terms growth of prices in commodities that brazil exports bloomberg oec of course this sounds like fantastic news for a major global producer of arabica coffee until one learns that drought then frost decimated shrubs in brazil and harvests will be disappointing this year and next brazil is the world s largest producer of soybeans soy prices are surpassing nine year highs but this is because the harvest in south america will be reduced due to drought in addition to a little boost from the ukrainian supply now being at risk petroleum is up and so are prices at the pump and leading politicians are toying with the prospect of modifying the constitution in order help the population struggling to pay global rates charged by the state owned petrobras corn is up too brazil is looking to barter five million tons directly to iran in exchange of fertilizers yes commodity prices are increasing globally but the commodity windfall for which several investors are placing bets needs closer examination and ironically the investors pouring money into brazil are strengthening the currency with their investment capital inflows which is decreasing incentives to sell commodities priced in us dollars further global crimping supply and increasing prices bottom line when something is too good to be true it probably is brazil has immense potential but it also faces a hefty amount of challenges stay prudent
1980s american cars are a bit like that awkward kid in grade school that wets themselves in front of the whole class while they all point and laugh they re so unbelievably easy to make fun of that it s almost not fair not the least bit because it seemed like general motors had no idea how to make horsepower while strangled by new emissions restrictions photo hanksters hot rods but maybe just maybe there are a handful of solid selections from america in this time frame the most famous example is likely the buick regal turbo but we re bold enough to say this 1986 pontiac grand prix also deserves to be amongst that group hailing its name from the iconic 60s muscle car that helped spawn the iconic gto the grand prix sure did have one nasty fall from grace especially as the 1973 oil crisis and subsequent new epa regulations caused the muscle car era to come to a crashing halt abruptly by the mid 1980s the grand prix was an entirely different beast it was smaller lighter and much more practical than its forbearers as a result clearly people had stopped tolerating automobiles that averaged two or three gallons to the mile in the u s by this point the 305 cubic inch 5 liter v8 under the hood in this example may not have been a fuel sipper in its own right but with 18 combined miles per gallon on offer it is at least leaps and bounds more economical than its 60s namesake but let s be real that isn t saying much this is of course a good thing in this case mainly because the two tone light and dark grey paint with red accenting on this example do at least make it a handsome looking thing even if the stock 150 horsepower isn t going to beat anything less than a city bus but the wonderful thing about american cars is no one looks at you like a fool when you modify them the way they would if you did the same to a european car of the same vintage performance parts for the gm 305 engine are readily available from reputable retailers like summit racing with enough skill and a little bit of money it s possible to remove the archaic 80s emissions restrictions to make for an engine that can sing as it should the fact that the grey cloth interior and fake wood grain are in fantastic shape for a car with 53 225 miles 85 657 3 km means you can spend more money tuning the engine a check for 32 900 to hanksters hot rods of homer city pennsylvania will award you that privilege

global last friday saw us stocks close lower again though equity futures this morning are looking positive so it looks as if we might be in for another whipsaw day despite the international backdrop remaining grim among news items that may weigh on sentiment are claims by the us that russia has asked china for military aid an iranian missile attack on iraq linked to the breakdown of nuclear talks and the lockdowns in shenzen as china struggles to maintain its grip on its zero covid policy with the us fed kicking off its rate tightening cycle later this week thoughts about an aggressive removal of global accommodation may also weigh on risk assets the eurusd drifted a little lower on friday starting at just under 1 10 and trading around 1 0930 now us treasury yields saw further rises at the front end of the curve with the 2y yield rising more than 5bp to 1 74 but 10y yields were little changed at just under 2 0 it is not clear how much longer this sort of flattening can continue though with there seeming to be more upside on inflation expectations than downside on real yields asian fx was broadly weaker against the usd on friday and that looks likely to be the theme at the start of the week as well friday s data releases saw the university of michigan consumer sentiment index losing ground though the medium term inflation expectations survey remained constant at 3 0 it is a quiet day for macro releases in the g 7
cai meng china daily foreign institutions have increased their holdings of domestic yuan denominated bonds for 10 consecutive months rising by 66 3 billion yuan 10 49 billion to 4 07 trillion yuan in late january china s bond connect program showed among them foreign institutions bonds under custody with china central depository clearing increased by 50 1 billion yuan to 3 73 trillion yuan in september rising for 38 consecutive months the economic situation has become more complex and changeable and the country is facing multiple pressures amid high inflation and strong expectations for further monetary policy tightening overseas however international investors are fully confident in china s long term economic prospects choosing to continue increasing their holdings of yuan denominated assets for the whole of 2022 the gap between the gdp growth rates in china and the united states may hit a new low since the 1990s china s 2022 economic growth will start high and end low while us economic growth may slow down quarter by quarter in 2022 compared with the gradually weakening effect of the us stimulus policy there will be many positive factors that will boost china s economic growth in 2022 to some extent the narrowing spread between 10 year chinese and us government bond yields will impact foreign capital inflows into china high inflation and tightening monetary policy in europe and the us will push up yields on bonds while chinese government bond yields may easily dip and barely rise with easing monetary policy as of feb 15 the yield spread between chinese and us 10 year treasurys shrank 51 basis points from the end of last year to 74 5 bp lower than the comfort zone spread of between 80 and 100 bp however the narrowing spread is to be expected affected by this the net increase in foreign holdings of domestic yuan denominated bonds fell by 5 percent month on month in january on a yearly basis the net increase decreased by 70 percent in january even so foreign investors rarely reduce their holdings of domestic bonds as yuan denominated bonds may still be under allocated in the asset allocations of foreign investors data from china central depository clearing showed bonds held by foreign institutions under custody only account for 4 24 percent of total bonds under custody lower than the 30 percent in the us in addition the structure of yuan denominated bonds held by foreign investors is relatively simple as government bonds and bonds issued by financial policy institutions account for 68 percent and 29 percent of bonds held by foreign investors respectively there are many overseas risks foreseeable this year including the covid 19 pandemic inflation risks energy crisis food crisis and supply chain disruptions and expected us fed policy tightening on the contrary domestic policies and economic situations point to stability which is attractive to foreign investors looking to reduce volatility for asset allocation investors at home and abroad said yuan denominated assets are useful to hedge risks in overseas markets high inflation and fed policy tightening may trigger further selling of us treasurys and the rising yields will undoubtedly put pressure on equity market valuations domestically the people s bank of china s moves such as required reserve ratio reductions showcased that they have become a necessity to stabilize growth the international monetary fund has repeatedly warned that emerging markets should be wary of foreign investors pulling money out of those markets amid fed policy tightening and china will also be affected however the imf also said china is the ballast stone of emerging markets and china s relatively strong currency has further boosted foreign investors motivations to stay early in 2019 china became the world s second largest bond market after the us in january the average daily trading transaction volume of the interbank market reached 5 3 trillion yuan exceeding the amount held by foreign investors in recent years china has continuously promoted two way opening up of the financial market according to the 14th five year plan 2021 25 china will comprehensively improve the level of opening up to the outside world and promote liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment in february 2020 us based financial group jpmorgan chase co included chinese government bonds in its benchmark emerging market indexes in november 2020 chinese government bonds and policy bank bonds were fully included in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index in october 2021 chinese government bonds were included in the ftse world government bond index in just two years chinese government bonds have been included in the three major global bond indexes further enhancing the appeal of yuan denominated bond assets currently developed countries excluding japan are making tighter monetary policy moves even the european central bank recently changed its tune to warn of high inflation this will have an adverse effect on the levels of emerging economies currencies imf studies have found negative correlations between the fed s broad dollar index and capital flows to emerging economies capital flows to emerging economies weakened when the us dollar appreciated relative to other major currencies in 2021 in addition as the 10 year us treasury yield still has room to move up and the anticipated tightening monetary policy may cause turmoil in international financial markets most emerging economies are having a difficult time when it comes to china us yield spreads domestic investors are still the main force to determine the yields with a key factor also being decisions made by the people s bank of china the country s central bank while foreign investors pay more attention to global asset allocation fed moves and us treasury yields they have a relatively limited impact on yuan denominated bond yields at the same time the above logic may vary as investor consensus changes for instance divergent policies between china and the us and trade frictions between the two countries led to the continuous depreciation of the yuan and narrowing spread between chinese and us government bond yields in 2018 while china saw a net inflow of foreign investment despite headwinds in 2018 china has a solid foundation to keep a stable renminbi exchange rate china has a relatively large current account surplus and a relatively low external debt especially in foreign currencies and it is able to cope with exchange rate fluctuations affected by the tightening of global dollar financing conditions and a stable exchange rate environment will help reduce the exchange rate risk cost for foreign investment in yuan denominated bonds

the trade perspective pairing dow bullish to nasdaq 100 bearish gbpnzd bullish above 1 9000 audjpy bearish below 86 risk assets like the nasdaq 100 rebuked a full tilt unwind this past week in part thanks to a reprieve from the surge in commodity prices while the fallout from russia s ukraine assault remains a top concern moving forward monetary policy will be a top scheduled concern with the fomc decision in the lead menafn dailyfx qqq nasdaq 100 etf fomc gbpnzd eurusd and usdjpy talking points risk trends have consolidated and there will be serious anticipation next week though this past week started with some extreme volatility from the likes of the nasdaq 100 and s p 500 the sharp monday drop didn t translate into a persistent trend through the five day stretch looking back on the period i see consolidation that reflects well the market s reticence to commit to trend while also long suffering a high level volatility resultant of indecision while russia s invasion of ukraine enters its third week with the subsequent fear of global war and the blowback of harsh sanctions the most acute financial fallout via commodity prices seemed to plateau this past week that offered a breather for battered speculative benchmarks but it doesn t absolve the underlying issues growth forecasts are sliding inflation is rising central banks will be forced to tighten and the outlook for financial markets is seriously uncertain traders and investors would do well to progress cautiously to keep tabs on speculative appetite the us equity indices remains my benchmark threshold last week s price action was a consolidation pattern for the qqq nasdaq 100 etf and dow jones industrial average yet if you looked at a higher time frame chart such as the weekly as larger money managers often do via papers and wrap reports they will see that the former has officially closed the week in a technical bear market 20 percent from all time highs and the dow slipped year long support around 33 250 chart of qqq nasdaq 100 etf with 20 and 200 day mov avgs gaps 20 day atr daily chart created on tradingview platform while i will be on the lookout for tactical opportunities through technical and fundamental means market conditions will be a principal influence over my approach to the coming week s landscape there are a host of high profile events scheduled for the first 48 hours of trade in the week ahead but it doesn t rise to the qualification of being systemically important that higher class of event risk starts to hit the wires on wednesday with the fomc rate decision due in the new york afternoon session a symbolic turning point that degree of anticipation can often have an anesthetizing effect on the markets as few major investors are willing to take a significant exposure ahead of the such definitive event risk yet the potential for a full blown risk view to develop before the fed issues its forecasts is certainly possible via the influence of the ukraine russia war that can come during the weekend for which i m monitoring bitcoin or in the days preceding the central bank run through mere headlines if you re looking for something more tangible around russia it is due to pay over 100 million in a foreign coupon payment on its sovereign debt wednesday there is a 30 day grace period on a missed payment but the market likely registers that there is little benefit to paying sovereign debt holders amid severe sanctions calendar of major economic events calendar created by john kicklighter where the ukraine crisis is having a real market impact the situation in the ukraine is terrible with loss of life that is unconscionable and an escalated global geopolitical risk that could rise to the level of a possible nuclear war yet the market s don t really consider the worst case scenario a consideration in the portfolio analysis money doesn t matter in a nuclear winter instead the rubber meets the road when it comes through commodity inflation that is in part a result of ukraine s being taken offline for production but also the subsequent impact from western sanctions on russia i am monitoring crude oil just as close as anyone but i m also interest in softs and industrial metals there are some interesting fundamental relations to draw here gbpnzd represents just such a situation where we have witnessed an extraordinary three week plunge that is largely the result of rapid commodity inflation a snap back is probable but that call is best left to fundamental and technical confirmation chart of gbpnzd with bollinger bands 20 day disparity and bb width daily chart created on tradingview platform another victim of the higher commodity prices is japan the country has to import the vast majority of the raw materials it consumes which means the natural flow of risk aversion to encourage japanese investors to repatriate their foreign carry holdings to local currency is heavily overridden it has no doubt registered among frequent fx traders that usdjpy and the other yen crosses have not slid under the very tangible risk aversion pressures in the open financial market that is largely due to the fact that japan has to import the vast majority of its commodities from trade partners and the transactions are done principally in us dollars that has made for an exceptional development in usdjpy through the very end of the week the pair has broken through a multi year wedge formation and posted one of its biggest daily rallies in a year and a half and biggest weekly charge in two years i am very dubious of follow through as that would insinuate true risk appetite or an unrelenting commodity inflation both of which are improbable chart of usdjpy with 100 day sma 20 day atr and historical range daily chart created on tradingview platform on the scheduled side of the fundamental ledger ukraine and commodity inflation are top concerns moving into the new trading week but by the time we hit wednesday the absence of overriding headlines will put us at the mercy of scheduled event risk it actually start in the morning when russia is due to make a coupon payment on foreign holdings of its sovereign debt a payment that the government is very likely to miss we still have a grace period after that rubicon is crossed but there is no benefit for the government to make a payment to keep access to a market that is otherwise cutting it out of the system the real fundamental impact comes on wednesday at 18 00 gmt the fomc rate decision is expected to result in a 25 basis point rate hike but the markets will be processing the official forecast monetary policy statement and fed chairman press conference to see what kind of outlook the group is going to offer against more than six 25 basis points of rate hikes priced into swaps and fed fund futures table of fomc rate decision scenario table table created by john kicklighter a run of us inflation data and the fed s actions will carry a lot of potential for the dollar and its crosses i am of course very interested to see if the greenback s rally will persist should the group meet expectations with the usdjpy already well above its technical break and eurusd back below 1 1000 to star the new week that said there is plenty more scheduled event risk due for release through the back half of the trading week other major central banks ready to update include the authorities in the uk brazil turkey japan and event russia the bank of england boe tops my list of most interest central bank outside the fed as it is expected to hike 25bps that isn t so extraordinary when you consider the brazilian group is due to increase 100 basis points and russia has already made liquidity stabilizing adjustments don t underestimate the influence of monetary

while most of the world recoils in horror at putin s invasion of ukraine a handful of fellow dictators have been loyal to the kremlin one is the unspeakable alexander lukashenko the semi literate dictator of belarus and putin s lapdog who has even threatened to use nuclear weapons presumably given to his country by russia to fend off the west lukashenko has said that his country would use such weapons and more as conflict escalated against its ally russia according to afp if such stupid and mindless steps are taken by our rivals and opponents we will deploy not only nuclear weapons but super nuclear and up and coming ones to protect our territory lukashenko said last week got that lukashenko will stand by his man vladimir putin and is prepared to deploy on his territory not just russian nuclear weapons but super nuclear and up and coming ones to protect our territory protect our territory against whom it s the russians who have been doing all the invading in lukashenko s neighborhood no member of nato has threatened belarus no nato member has any intention of invading belarus and then there is bashar assad who was saved from defeat in the syrian civil war by the russians who in 2015 began to bombard the rebels who were then close to winning the war thus assad owes his victory in the civil war and very likely his life to his friend vladimir putin a report on assad s expression of fealty to putin and support for russia s invasion of the ukraine is here assad says russia s ukraine invasion a correction of history afp february 26 2022 syrian president bashar assad in a telephone call with his russian counterpart vladimir putin on friday praised the russian invasion of ukraine saying it was a correction of history assad s description of the russian invasion of ukraine as a correction of history must have pleased putin for it fits his world historical view his insistence that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century greater apparently than world war ii which resulted in 60 million dead greater than the holocaust with its six million dead even though during the breakup of the soviet union so devoutly wished for by all the non russian republics in the soviet empire no one was killed damascus is a staunch ally of moscow which intervened in the syrian civil war in 2015 by launching airstrikes to support the assad regime s struggling forces assad spoke to putin a day after russian forces invaded ukraine on the orders of the russian president drawing strong international condemnation president assad stressed that what is happening today is a correction of history and a restoration of balance in the global order after the fall of the soviet union said a statement from the syrian presidency assad also said that syria stands with the russian federation based on its conviction that its position is correct and because confronting nato expansionism is a right for russia though one hates to use obama s favorite phrase about being on the right side of history here it seems to fit the entire civilized world is against putin s invasion even if in the end ukraine will be forced to surrender to the overwhelmingly more powerful russian military the russians will not be able to hold ukraine with its 45 million citizens in the long term ukrainians who were not able to resist the invasion will in their humiliation and rage be determined to resist a russian occupation russia s intervention in syria marked a turning point in the conflict it enabled pro regime forces to wrest back lost territory in a series of victories against rebels and jihadists involving deadly bombardments and massive destruction more than 63 000 russian military personnel have deployed to syria moscow says assad has 63 000 reasons to be grateful to russia no wonder he s in putin s pocket during friday s phone call assad said western nations bear responsibility for the chaos and bloodshed accusing them of using dirty methods to support terrorists in syria and nazis in ukraine in the topsy turvical moral universe of bashar assad the western nations that have not put a single soldier in the ukraine are the ones who bear responsibility for the chaos and bloodshed in that country rather than the 200 000 russian soldiers who invaded ukraine with tanks and planes and missiles to satisfy the crazed will of president putin who wants to reunite as much of the former soviet empire as he can and what dirty methods were used by the western nations in syria did they use such methods when they fought the fanatics of the islamic state a fight which assad must surely have approved of were dirty methods used by the american troops when they protected the kurds from being murdered by turkish forces sent into syria by erdogan or did western nations use dirty methods to pressure assad to stop using chemical weapons on his own people as he did in 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 weren t those chemical weapons dirty methods used by syria and not by the western nations that tried to end their use as for accusing the west of supporting terrorists in syria and nazis in the ukraine in syria it was assad s government that terrorized his own people with chemical weapons and bombardments of civilians it is assad who supported and was supported by the terror group hezbollah there are no nazis in the ukrainian government as putin likes to claim and so too does his puppet assad ukraine s president is volodymyr zelensky who is jewish and whose three great uncles were murdered by the nazis if assad wants to accuse governments of harboring nazis he should start with his own country which for years gave refuge and jobs to such nazi war criminals as the s s man alois brunner during his long residence in syria brunner was reportedly granted asylum a generous salary and protection by the ruling ba ath party in exchange for his advice on effective torture and interrogation techniques used by the nazis he was also employed by the assad family itself to teach its loyalists the same skills he was teaching syria s secret police the war in syria is estimated to have killed nearly half a million people and displaced millions more since it began with assad s brutal crackdown on anti government protests in 2011 bashar assad has now tied his own political fate even tighter to that of vladimir putin moscow has made clear to bashar al assad that russia remains his main hope of staying in power if putin s gamble in the ukraine where he is betting he can not only conquer the country but keep it subject to russian occupation does not pay off putin will face a real challenge at home too many russians have lost overnight much of their wealth because of western sanctions the collapse of the russian stock market and the deep slide in the value of the ruble have been dramatic the russians may rally around putin just now but for how long will they support him given that the western nations have promised to keep those crippling economic sanctions in place as long as the russians stay in the ukraine putin seems impregnable but so did colonel qaddafi zine ben ali hosni mubarak and many others who were then toppled with ease and if vladimir putin were to be deposed what would happen to his loyal spaniel assad in damascus who called to

historically pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew this one is no different it is a portal a gateway between one world and the next we can choose to walk through it dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred our avarice our data banks and dead ideas our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us or we can walk through lightly with little luggage ready to imagine another world and ready to fight for it arundhati roy april 2020 this weekend marks two years since covid knocked on our collective door and uprooted our global lives those early days were filled with so much fear and so many unknowns the week the pandemic became official many americans had no idea that covid had even been heading our way it was a shock to our system and the american government s inability to give us straight answers on things as basic as whether we should mask or not only added to the confusion remember the early rush on toilet paper hand sanitizer and all things bleach related those early days were terrifying because we didn t know anything and our government at the time was headed by an incompetent and cruel man yet even at that moment the american government mustered enough pretense to look like it cared a halt on evictions a pause on student loan payments stimulus payments loans to keep business afloat those temporary actions gave us a brief glimpse into what could be possible if we turned away from the heartless nature of capitalism and embraced a culture of caring for all if as arundhati roy said we took this pandemic as the opportunity to examine an unspeakable horror and turn it into a portal for change however human nature is what it is often not seeking the highest states a problem further exacerbated by living in a society that values the individual over the collective furthermore this is a place where our elected officials tend to care more about winning than well being and they assume themselves to be wise even when they are ignorant of public health and they made an important and terrible decision after those first few months of the pandemic they decided the goal was not to change for the better but rather to fight to get us back to normal as soon as possible by late 2020 masks and mandates had become divisive and any sense of the collective was deeply fractured but with the presidential election looming we held hope that a new president would tamp down the divisions and we would follow the science perhaps we could listen to the epidemiologists and others who understand that a new virus such as covid means we have to adjust as needed as new information becomes available sadly that would not be the case make no mistake the biden administration fought a valiant fight as did numerous democratic governors across the country to keep people safe but the vitriol and the lingering duration of the pandemic became too much their will faltered which is no doubt why a few weeks ago in his first state of the union address president biden essentially told the american people that it was time to move on beyond covid it is time to enter the post pandemic phase of life despite less than stellar vaccination rates across the country and variants brewing in the background variants that are currently creating surges in other countries that since the arrival of covid have served as a harbinger of things to come for us no it s no longer a time to be diligent and concerned with the collective good or long term physical and societal health rather it was time to unmask and get our butts back in our offices since even though many of us can do our jobs just as well and with less adverse impact to ourselves or the environment from our homes we can t let rich people who sell or rent commercial real estate suffer suddenly masking is a thing of the past the cdc which less than a month ago said most of america was swimming in covid is now telling us that most of america is at low risk for covid to really carry out the ruse that all is well it seems funding for covid is being cut so all the covid related safety items that biden told us about in his sotu address are in jeopardy according to jen psaki the white house press secretary by may the current supply of monoclonal antibody drugs used to treat covid will stock out by july the administration will run out of another antibody drug evoshield that was recently authorized to prevent covid in people with immune deficiencies i will be the first to say that i am so tired of pandemic life i find masks to be uncomfortable especially the n95s i started wearing when omicron arrived i miss being able to get up and have brunch in a restaurant i miss the carefree days of just going places and having conversations with people in crowded spaces while i don t wish to return to the life i lived in 2019 which involved 130 days of travel there are days when homeschooling and working from home are hard and i would like to be working around other people yet these are not normal times and part of keeping myself and others safe is making sacrifices for the greater good especially when there are no approved vaccines for humans under the age of 5 and millions of immuno compromised people in two years time we have lost almost a million americans to covid millions more are living with the disabling effects of long covid and only now is it becoming common knowledge that covid is not just a respiratory issue but also a vascular one knowing a few folks with long covid including one of my employees i am scared of following in their footsteps right now the projections are that anywhere from 10 to 40 of covid survivors are dealing with lingering issues related to their initial covid infection that has serious implications not just for personal well being and lifespans but for the health of a country that doesn t really have a proper healthcare safety net in place for the masses the thing that makes this moment so heartbreaking is the mass assumption and delusion that if the democratic party was in charge the pandemic would be handled more humanely but watching biden tell us it is time to move on chilled me to my core and to see democratic governors now walking back their care and concern for the sake of the upcoming midterm elections was a masterclass in watching whiteness work whiteness lacks the ability to care for the collective unless it involves capitalism it sells its soul to maintain the status quo because it lacks the ability to lean into uncertainty and discomfort it is safe to say that as days became weeks weeks became months and months became two years whiteness reared its head and said enough despite the clear evidence that declaring a premature victory over a virus racing across the planet is foolish at best and would lead to countless more infections and thus more death and permanent disability it is even more troubling because it was just last year that the biden administration and the cdc declared victory only to have to deal with a variant that could suddenly penetrate the protection of our vaccines the current downturn in covid is more about the precautions that were re enacted in the wake of the omicron variant than the virus magically dying out yet magical thinking is another hallmark of whiteness when it comes to dealing with the uncomfortable as i have written before our approach to covid is very reminiscent of our approach to racism and in the end very little changes except that we are talking about a pathogen that can kill us a bit quicker than racism or leave us disabled for life history shows us that pandemics are painful because humans are resistant to change therefore it will take more than two years and a presidential proclamation to end this thing given that 57 of americans have not been infected by covid global vaccination efforts are appalling and we have a deluded emphasis on getting back to normal something tells me covid has a lot more bodies to play with however on this second anniversary of pandemic life i take a moment to honor the lives lost globally both directly and indirectly from covid i honor our collective sorrow and pain as well as the growth and resilience of the human spirit that has also surfaced over the last two years to sit with pain and to allow ourselves to feel is to say no to this white supremacist capitalist system which strives to steal our humanity and souls we can still do better and find a new and better world on the other side of covid but will we if this piece

this article is more than 2 years old sopa images lightrocket via getty images the invasion of ukraine has brought sanctions and economic isolation to russia halting the era of globalization russians enjoyed after the end of the soviet union countries have gone from little integration with the global economy to becoming closely integrated however this might be the first time a country s inhabitants have experienced an abrupt end to globalization after enjoying it for many years to better understand the impact of this monumental change i interviewed brian d taylor a professor of political science at syracuse university and the author of the highly acclaimed book the code of putinism stuart anderson can you explain what russia s participation in the global economy looked like prior to the breakup of the soviet union brian d taylor during the soviet period the country s economy was peripheral to the global capitalist economy despite being one of the two superpowers soviet style centralized planning was premised more on autarky or economic self sufficiency than on participation in global trade and financial flows most soviet exports to the outside world were natural resources and they used the proceeds to buy food and industrial equipment anderson after the fall of communism particularly in the past 10 years what did globalization look like for many russians and russian companies i e travel access to western luxury goods taylor the collapse of the soviet union marked the return of russia to the global economy the early russian economic reformers understood that only through exposure to international competition and opening up to international trade could russia make the transition to a modern capitalist economy for average middle class russians this meant the opportunity to buy foreign clothing brands consumer electronics foodstuffs and so on russian companies became much more integrated into international trade and capital markets and tens of millions of russians could travel overseas anderson how do you think russians are going to feel being cut off from globalization after experiencing those benefits for so many years taylor being cut off will be easier for some and devastating for others only around 30 of russians have international passports poorer russians in rural areas and small towns already are largely cut off from globalization and its benefits for younger and better off urbanites the ability to renovate their apartments at ikea stream netflix on their ipads and easily hop on a plane to europe or asia is fundamental to their identities all of this will become much harder now given the massive economic shock that russia will experience anderson in your book you define putinism what is putinism how did it influence the invasion of ukraine and how will it potentially decide the course of future events taylor i argue that putinism is a mentality shared by putin and his close associates what i call team putin this mentality includes ideas such as anti americanism and russia as a strong state and great power habits of order control and loyalty and feelings of russia being humiliated and disrespected by the west and being vulnerable to destabilization i believe it influenced the invasion of ukraine in a couple of crucial ways first of all in putin s mind russia can only be a strong state and great power if it dominates the new states along its periphery and ukraine is particularly important for his vision of historic russia second putin has long maintained that the united states is determined to weaken russia and even undermine it from within putin feels that he is fighting for russia s historic destiny against more powerful enemies which is why he is not inclined to back down indeed the strong military resistance of ukraine and the unprecedented sanctions imposed by the united states and its allies just reinforce his view that there is a determined and long standing campaign to destroy russia in that respect we are in a very dangerous moment anderson a key pillar of vladimir putin s support at least through 2008 was the improvement in living standards after the country s relative economic chaos during the immediate years after the end of the soviet union how does the current economic situation in russia change that for people in russia taylor the first thing to note is that russia economic performance has been stagnant for a while after growing at around 6 5 between 1999 2008 its growth has slowed considerably since then from 2014 2020 annual growth was under half a percent per year and living standards declined by 10 for many russians times were already hard and the pandemic made this worse this is all before the war and sanctions now due to sanctions imposed over putin s war russians are facing high inflation the collapse of the ruble and the departure of many western businesses from the russian market living standards will decline further putin has totally undermined whatever remained of his image as the man who brought relative prosperity and stability to russia anderson dmitri alperovitch recently said because of sanctions and the closing of airspace the ability of people to visit russia or for russians leave is going to harken back to the stalin era while former top russian economic official sergey aleksashenko said if putin stays in power another 10 or 15 years russia will be more isolated from the global economy than it was in the time of the soviet union what do you think of those assessments taylor the situation is indeed dire experts are simply debating how far the clock is being turned back 20 years 30 years 50 years i ve even heard 1918 invoked in terms of the consequences for russian economy when it was in the midst of a civil war after the russian revolution some of that is probably hyperbole but multiple expert agencies are predicting a looming russian default some russian officials are seriously talking about nationalizing the property of companies that are leaving as if the russian state is capable of running mcdonald s or ikea inside the country the stock market has been closed for two weeks and capital controls are being introduced a big question that people are asking is will russians stand for it many of them have gotten used to living in a modern twenty first century economy people under the age of 45 have no adult memories of living under soviet socialism the wealthy the middle class and the poor will all suffer other regimes have survived under harsh sanctions for quite a while such as venezuela and iran however sanctions like this have not been imposed on an economy as big as russia s russians have endured a lot of suffering in their history but those were different people living in a different time many russians today have gotten used to being part of the global economic and information space over the last 30 years i don t think they are ready to go back to the ussr in terms of being economically and culturally cut off from the world

become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more this article was originally published on fool com all figures quoted in us dollars unless otherwise stated warren buffett is well known as one of the world s all time great investors he made his fortune as a value focused investor someone who looks to buy stocks when they re cheap and profit as they recover as the recent market downtrend reminds us that s often easier said than done as falling stocks tend to make it feel like your money is evaporating with every down day still if buffett s success shows us anything it s that a strong company that survives a down market can often come out the other side in a much better spot to deliver solid long term returns for its shareholders with that in mind we asked three successful investors to pick strong warren buffett stocks that are worth considering in today s volatile market they picked coca cola nyse ko visa nyse v and berkshire hathaway nyse brk a nyse brk b read on to find out why and decide for yourself whether those companies deserve a spot in your portfolio volatility goes better with coke barbara eisner bayer coca cola nyse ko if anyone knows how to make money in all markets including volatile ones it s buffett the famous nonagenarian who has an approximate net worth of 114 billion and one of the oracle of omaha s favorite stocks is his oldest stock position which he started purchasing 34 years ago the coca cola company buffett is so in love with the company that he s known to consume five cans of coke each day he even joked to fortune magazine back in 2015 that his body is made up of one quarter coca cola it s no surprise then that berkshire hathaway owns about 22 billion worth of its shares or 10 of the company it s great that buffett is so fond of coke but that in and of itself doesn t make it a great buy for a volatile market so let s look at what does first coca cola s products are consumed worldwide and embrace more than its fizzy namesake drink its portfolio of beverages has expanded to include changing and healthier tastes and according to the company includes 200 brands and thousands of beverages around the world from soft drinks and waters to coffee and tea you ve probably heard of many of them dasani fairlife fanta fuze tea schweppes powerade smart water and minute maid because these drinks are worldwide staples people aren t going to stop drinking them when the stock market goes on a wild ride the company has survived extreme volatility in the past back in october 2018 during an extremely turbulent period coca cola was up 2 while the s p 500 was down 9 this happened because the company was and continues to be a huge stable conglomerate with a solid dividend and continuing growth prospects while the company struggled during the coronavirus pandemic it has finally returned to growth during its recent fourth quarter 2021 earnings report coca cola said net revenue had grown 10 year over year and earnings per share eps were up 65 per share and management sees brighter days ahead 2022 revenue growth of 7 5 and eps growth of 9 are numbers investors can get excited about for such a stable company but the cherry on top of these reasons why coca cola is a great buffett stock to own during volatile times is its dividend which currently offers investors a 3 dividend yield coca cola is also a dividend aristocrat and has been raising its payout for 59 years in a row if stocks start plummeting investors will still be earning income from the dividend which is vital when all you re seeing is red every day in your portfolio if buffett put down his bottle of coke and spoke directly to you he might just say that coca cola with its stable business continuing growth prospects and mighty fine dividend may be the perfect stock to survive and even thrive through volatile times the power of plastic eric volkman visa nyse v one of buffett s favorite sectors if not the favorite is finance witness berkshire s immense stakes in banks wells fargo and bank of america for example among this crowd one company that should continue to thrive no matter how wild global volatility becomes is one of berkshire s many finance industry holdings visa the payment card processor has a brand that is ubiquitous throughout the world and a business model that continually produces oversize profits to understand why we first have to make the distinction between open loop card processors and their closed loop peers visa and mastercard fall into the former category which essentially means they are payment network operators only and not card issuers i e the entities such as banks that actually extend the credit on a credit card or draw funds from an existing account in the case of a debit card this contrasts with closed loop card companies most prominently american express a longtime buffett favorite by the way these entities act as both the issuer and the network operator there are pluses and minuses to both business models but i tend to favor the open loopers by sticking to facilitating transactions only a company like visa is basically a huge middle man collecting a small piece of every purchase effected through its network it assumes no credit risk while doing so that s for the issuer to worry about like any effective middle man visa s profitability is sustainably and consistently high lately it s boasted 50 plus net margins and as the world keeps moving away from cash into plastic and digital means of payment the company s growth engine keeps humming the card giant s first quarter was typical of its recent performance net revenue surged 24 higher year over year to 7 1 billion while non gaap adjusted net income enjoyed a 25 rocket ride to 3 9 billion no matter how jittery the world economy gets people are always going to need to buy things one of the most popular instruments in doing so in this increasingly cashless environment we shop in is a visa card this company is going to continue to thrive you can bet on that why not buy buffett s business chuck saletta berkshire hathaway nyse brk a imagine a company that was built from the ground up to be exactly the fortress like investment that warren buffett likes to own now imagine that with one purchase you can not only buy shares in a company like that but also hire buffett and his hand picked successors to manage it for you believe it or not you can do just that with an investment in berkshire hathaway stock berkshire hathaway is the insurance and investment conglomerate that buffett runs between the strong insurance businesses the wholly owned subsidiaries and the substantial stakes in solid public companies it is built like a fortress to withstand tough times in addition to the great collection of businesses and world class investment management team at the helm you can buy your shares at a reasonable price berkshire hathaway stock recently traded hands at less than nine times trailing earnings and only around 1 1 2 times its accounting book value that means buffett s company can be purchased at a reasonable price making it the sort of thing buffett himself would be interested in owning of course even with a great business run by one of the greatest investors of all time there are risks in particular berkshire hathaway trades at what looks like a cheap valuation in part because of something known as the conglomerate discount in essence large and diversified companies are viewed as less focused and nimble than smaller ones as a result the market doesn t often put a rich valuation on companies structured like berkshire hathaway still that s a small price to pay for a chance to own an incredibly strong company at a reasonable valuation in incredibly volatile times great companies in troubled times regardless of whether coca cola visa or berkshire hathaway ever make their way into your portfolio they are all certainly strong businesses that are built to survive a tough market and emerge stronger on the other side that makes them worth considering as investments to help you navigate these volatile times and with a stamp of approval from no less an investor than warren buffett they certainly deserve every bit of that consideration

rio de janeiro agricultural powerhouse brazil is nervously watching the impact of russiaâ s war on ukraine uncertain whether the upside an expected boost to brazilâ s corn exports will outweigh the hit to its crucial fertilizer imports brazil a top exporter of agricultural products including beef chicken soy and corn stands to gain a windfall from surging commodities prices driven higher worldwide by the war but the country also depends heavily on imported fertilizer and is facing a collapse in stock from top supplier russia whose exports have been hit hard by western sanctions corn has been particularly affected by the war ukraineâ s invasion by russia on february 24 has cast doubt on whether either country the worldâ s fourth and fifth biggest corn exporters respectively in 2019 20 will be able to make expected deliveries this year that is causing prices to soar and could be a boon for brazil the number three exporter its corn crop was hit hard last year by bad weather including the worst drought in nearly a century but the harvest stands to increase by 29 percent in 2021 22 according to the latest forecast from the national supply company conab â the corn price has hit one of the highest levels ever seen making it attractive for brazilian producers a factor driving an increase in planting areaâ for the second harvest the biggest of the year said joao pedro lopes of commodity market analysis firm stonex strong global demand and a favorable exchange rate â should allow an increase of 67 percent in exportsâ of brazilian corn in 2022 conab said the us agriculture department meanwhile has predicted that if brazilâ s harvest is as big as expected the country could pass neighboring argentina to become the worldâ s number two corn exporter this year trailing only the united states â international demand has suddenly appeared for immediate shipment of brazilian corn which is unusual for the first half of the year and demand for the second half has accelerated too â said analyst paulo roberto molinari of agribusiness consultancy safras e mercado fertilizer problem but there is a big downside â thereâ s no guarantee on the key question of shipping merchandise â with the maritime transport sector upended by the war said cesario ramalho head of the brazilian association of corn producers abramilho â and fertilizer supplies are uncertain too â he told afp brazil imports around 80 percent of its fertilizers 20 percent of that from russia its leading supplier belarus another key supplier and which has supported russia in the ukraine crisis has also been hit hard by western sanctions agriculture minister tereza cristina said earlier this month that brazil had enough fertilizer stocks to last until october she has been negotiating with other major exporters to source more farmers are already feeling the pinch the price of a ton of imported fertilizer skyrocketed in brazil by 129 percent from february 2021 to february 2022 mining indigenous lands the fertilizer issue got swept up in a politically loaded debate last week when president jair bolsonaro called the russia ukraine war an â opportunityâ to pass a controversial bill to legalize mining on indigenous reservations backers argue the bill would allow brazil to fully exploit its mineral wealth including reserves of potassium a key fertilizer ingredient opponents warn mining would be disastrous for protected indigenous lands including in the amazon rainforest where they say there is little potassium anyway bolsonaro said friday the proposed legislation would help â integrate our indigenous brothers into society â adding â theyâ re almost like us â his administration launched a plan the same day seeking to nearly halve brazilâ s dependence on foreign fertilizer by 2050 with tax incentives loans and other measures to spur domestic production meanwhile the market turmoil is also sending shock waves through other sectors of the agriculture industry it has caused prices to rise for corn and soy based animal feed hitting brazilâ s chicken and pork producers the country was the number one and number four exporter worldwide in 2020 respectively â that could have an impact on production since profit margins will be weaker â said fernando ferreira of xp investimentos afp
the aspiration or ambition of reaching out beyond safe limits may be attributed to the culture or spirit of adventure but it can also be an indicator of a peculiar human propensity having to do with vanity there is a great difference between undertaking an activity or venture because of a biting need expediency or urgency which can include a life threatening situation and doing things to impress or create an impact which may be borne of vanity the fact that 99 aspirants or contestants cannot become presidents of a country at the same time may be viewed as a valid democratic option of fielding a large number of contestants for the electorate to choose from over reaching safe limits would include a very brilliant lawyer or lecturer with less than n250 000 balance in his bank account vying for the office of a president in nigeria in the united states of america a barack obama may undertake such a venture and receive mass support from those who believe in his ability and mission but that would hardly be the case in nigeria therefore the issue of over reaching safe limits has to do with matching personal ability or mission with the situations of an environment as well as the prospect of such intended venture making a relevant social impact peculiarities of politics as practised in nigeria would make it a fool hardy project for a capable but independent candidate with little money for campaign purposes to vie to become president even if such capable candidate joins one of the existing political parties there would rarely be any prospect that the party machinery would field him as a viable contestant thus money politics is for no one else but money bags or those that money bags can sponsor the same goes for power politics it would be difficult for nigeria to rise above money and power politics whose peculiarities include acts of gangsterism and exclusiveness under such peculiar circumstances political parties become deep waters where any rash adventure can be a costly venture it cannot be said that nigeria cannot produce one individual who can turn around the current position of the country for the better the challenge is how to identify reach out to and allow such capable person to preside over the affairs of the country safe limits within the nigerian context would include staying away from the booby traps and artificially constructed constraints which money and power politics entail decent people stay away from it it is obvious that the state of maturity development and consciousness among human beings differ widely neither is there an evenness equality or uniformity at any given time the pity is that finer qualities like the mind s constructions are not written on faces of individuals what we find more common is a situation where money and power become instruments of blusters making it impossible to identify or pick out the cream of the human stock particularly in politics it can be said that the beautiful ones are not yet born no nation like a chain can be stronger than its weakest link in this sense the status and standing of the masses constitute what is known as mean average in statistics above and below the mean average there are several citizens moving about without anyone knowing the status of their consciousness the earth like a farmland is a vast field of developmental activities and exertions where widely different participants carry out various ventures thus we have the good the bad and ugly mixed up on earth over reaching safe limits is a situation where an individual out of vaulting ambition and vanity seeks to undertake a venture or task beyond his capacity this is so because people move and function within the limits set by their own sate of maturity unfortunately many people over rate their ability or capacity and in undertaking tasks beyond the limits of their maturity plunge themselves and the society into jeopardy this unfortunate situation is more so in politics where the ambition for power and wealth predominate and with obstinacy and narrow mindedness making power hustlers to lead unsuspecting masses astray politics of brigandage it is in human nature that when an individual finds out that he is missing out on the real purpose of life he resorts to various cosmetic measures to compensate for the loss such cosmetic measures include the pursuit of wealth and power or some other ego dominated ventures largely for the purpose of getting public attention in that process the temptation of over reaching safe limits often comes as an ego booster whereby caution can be thrown to the wind results of ventures undertaken under the impulse of ego are usually sad it is hardly true that the issues of drug and mental aberrations are peculiar to young persons alone because the youths who get addicted to drugs today become adult soon with such addiction remaining with them neither is it true that hard economic conditions are responsible for wide spread abuse of hard drugs and mental abnormality without going into the history of drug abuse in nigeria it would suffice to say that fighting against hard drug culture would be like fighting against other social ills continuous engagement neither can there be a society without ills and challenges one inescapable issue that must be explored by anyone who wants to understand why people over reach safe limits is the importance of meaning in life like purpose meaning clarifies what life is all about whereby personal experiences assume different meanings one viktor frankl a jewish psychiatrist while in nazi detention camp developed logotherapy as a philosophy whose emphasis is that the search for meaning is the driving force in man to find core meaning makes for a stable satisfying life but those who miss out in this task over reach themselves to create impressions what is known as self actualisation has to do with finding the core meaning or purpose of life politics is not the route to it a nation where a politician or lawmaker would boast publicly of having 28 children and which ranks 154 out of 180 in corruption index is a nation that must learn to cruise within safe limits and cut down on flamboyant lifestyle natural immune system works effectively where individuals recognise their safe limits which differ from one person to another thus anyone reaching out beyond individual safe limits as determined by his state of personal maturity and consciousness would be exposed to avoidable dangers use of hard drugs and extraneous aids to enhance personal capacity are some of the means of over reaching safe limits no one can give what he does not have personally why fake it by bright amirize dr amirize is a retired lecturer from the rivers state university port harcourt
a colorado springs school district is going on the offensive in the fight against the fast growing fentanyl crisis in the city the state and the nation district 11 which has been impacted by overdose deaths in recent years has launched its fake and fatal campaign an initiative focused on educating and training staff members students and families about the dangers of the synthetic opioid we are hoping to get out ahead of this crisis and hopefully avoid more deaths district spokeswoman devra ashby said of the project the initial phase of the campaign ashby said is to educate and train teachers and other employees about the seriousness of the fentanyl crisis and what they can do to combat it the district has produced a comprehensive awareness video outlining the scope of the crisis in colorado springs and el paso county the lethality of the drug and how easy it is to obtain it also alerts staff members to the warning signs of an opioid overdose and what to do if one occurs we recognize that we must start to prepare ourselves and be ready for an increased rise within our own community said cory notestine d 11 s executive director of student success and wellness we want to get in front of this as the video explains the rise in opioid deaths among teens is too complex to pin on a single cause but many health care professionals believe the emotional upheaval caused by the covid 19 pandemic to be a major factor colorado children s hospital has identified a growing mental health crisis in children and teens across the state exacerbated by feelings of isolation and hopelessness brought on by the pandemic because many youths haven t yet developed coping mechanisms their mental health struggles often manifest in complex and harmful ways some youths internalize their pain some act aggressively taking their pain out on others and some turn to drugs we ve seen an elevated use of illegal substances to cope with the world that teens are living through notestine said several of our youth have engaged in illegal drugs that have caused overdoses both in our community and within our school communities and several of those students have lost their lives a drug that the centers for disease control and prevention says is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine fentanyl has become frighteningly simple to buy many drugs are being sold on social media meaning just about any teen with a little money and a working wi fi connection can obtain illegal drugs the d 11 video explains as easy as ordering a pizza additionally because drug dealers are now selling fentanyl in the guise of other drugs like oxycontin and xanax many people are ingesting the deadly drug without knowing it fentanyl is being manufactured at extremely low cost distributed to cartels and other nefarious individuals to be pressed into other pills such as percocet notestine says in the video sign up for free springs am update your morning rundown of the latest news from colorado springs and around the country overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day delivered to your inbox each evening sign up view all of our newsletters success thank you for subscribing to our newsletter view all of our newsletters these other drugs are now being laced with lethal doses of fentanyl unbeknownst to the purchaser law enforcement officials believe this is how five people died in a commerce city apartment last month in what is thought to be the largest mass fentanyl overdose in the u s the victims thought they were using cocaine officials said the 2021 statistics are expected to be available in may but colorado s 2020 overdose numbers are staggering state health data show there were 10 times as many overdoses involving fentanyl in 2020 than there were just four years earlier opioid deaths saw a 54 increase in 2020 and fentanyl was a factor in nearly 70 of opioid deaths in the state the next phase of the fake and fatal initiative beginning this week will be to make students and their families aware of the size and breadth of the problem district 11 is trying to combat notestine said during its feb 23 meeting d 11 s board of education unanimously approved revisions to its first aid and emergency medical care policy to allow narcan to be stored in district schools and used by trained employees in case of an opioid overdose narcan or naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse the effects of an overdose if administered properly and soon enough after the event this is a serious issue throughout el paso county said board president parth melpakam we wanted to make sure our students are safe and protected on our campuses narcan is an important resource our staff can use to keep our students safe and healthy the board also recommended a policy revision that includes the administration of narcan in the liability exemptions listed under the good samaritan law which exists to shield people from being sued if they give emergency aid to an injured person narcan is not yet available in all d 11 schools but school nurse lead bobbi lahey said several schools have already requested to have a supply on campus and many district employees have requested to be trained in its proper use obviously we hope never to have to use it lahey said but it s important to have it in stock and to have staff members trained to use it we hope to eventually have it in every building district officials hope that increased awareness of the seriousness and proximity of the fentanyl crisis will help avoid unnecessary deaths notestine said yes this has become a national problem but we need to fight it at the local level he said the fentanyl crisis is very real and it s right here in our community
