president joe biden issued a budget proposal friday that called for a 39 6 top capital gains tax rate in line with what had been previously proposed to help fund the american families plan it would apply to taxpayers with income of more than 1 million combined with a 3 8 medicare surtax the richest americans would pay a 43 4 top rate on capital gains president joe biden proposed a 39 6 top tax rate on capital gains and dividends for millionaires when he released his fiscal 2022 budget request to congress on friday that s in line with the top rate the administration outlined in april as part of tax increases on the rich to help fund the american families plan capital gains tax is owed on assets like stocks bonds mutual funds and homes that have appreciated in value get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters more from personal finance dividing cryptocurrency in a divorce settlement is complicated what advocates say biden gets wrong about student loan forgiveness parents should start planning now for monthly child tax credit payments the wealthiest americans currently pay a top federal tax rate of 20 on those returns if the asset is held for more than a year they also pay a 3 8 medicare surtax on investment earnings bringing the top rate to a total 23 8 biden s proposal aims to bring that capital gains tax rate more in line with that of their job income the white house plan creates a top rate of 43 4 when factoring in a medicare surtax on investment earnings that s a bit higher than the 39 6 top tax rate on ordinary income biden proposed it would apply to taxpayers whose income exceeds 1 million or 500 000 for couples filing separate tax returns the capital gains rate would be retroactive to the date of announcement according to the treasury document it s unclear whether that means friday s announcement or perhaps biden s outline of the american families plan in april that would effectively mean millionaires who sell appreciated assets going forward would be subject to the 43 4 rate of course the plan must still be approved by congress which isn t assured biden also proposed eliminating an existing tax break at death the step up in basis that allows appreciated assets to pass to heirs tax free investors therefore can t necessarily avoid capital gains tax outright by holding until death reforms to the capital gains tax will raise about 322 billion over a decade according to the white house correction president biden proposed a 39 6 top capital gains tax rate in his fiscal 2022 budget request to congress an earlier version misstated the figure

see some sexual licentiousness some loosening of sexual mores such prognostications have tantalized many eager for the fabled liberation of a century ago what fitzgerald described as the most expensive orgy in history outside of the 1960s perhaps no decade looms larger in the collective imagination than the 1920s thanks in part to the emerging mass culture that captured the time the swinging speakeasies the harlem renaissance the first talkie in 1927 s the jazz singer over time the mythology has only grown glitzier see baz luhrmann gatsby 2013 there s truth in that portrait of the 20s but mainly to wealthier white americans the decade was punishing to farmers for the first time more people lived in cities membership surged for the ku klux klan which targeted african americans immigrants jews and catholics anyone who didn t meet its definition of a real american in 1921 one of the worst incidents of racial violence occurred the tulsa race massacre three years later the immigration act of 1924 restricted immigrants from asia and eastern europe the 1920s in short were not all they were cracked up to be we have today in the united states cheek by jowl prosperity and depression the author and civil rights activist w e b du bois wrote in 1926 it s not hard to see many of the same threads today racial injustice economic inequity convulsive technological change the 1921 campaign slogan of warren g harding a return to normalcy sounds very familiar and even appealing to those who have had it with the new normal forecasts on wall street of course vary the united nations last month raised its global economic forecast to 5 4 growth in 2021 while many analysts are predicting the pace to quicken in the months and years ahead tina fordham partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a disillusioned emancipated youth the young have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic on behalf of the older generation moore says there was a sense of that after the war and after the spanish flu the war was very much young people being sent off to die by an older generation they d been taught to trust but then felt very let down by whether the same response will happen in the aftermath of this pandemic is something to watch for the crisis is far from over christakis cautions we don t want to spike the ball at the 5 yard line he says but throughout history christakis sees a pattern common to prolonged calamity plagues are followed by boom times after the black death came the erosion of feudalism the roaring twenties is just a metaphor christakis says grief walks the streets during times of plague so people will rightly be relieved when this period of loss is behind us

jeannette gregor never thought a thin lizzy song would send her into a full on breakdown but it s been that kind of year the mohawk bartender turned advocate for austin s live music industry has been busy pushing for relief for the city s pandemic battered venues but as covid restrictions loosen and live music steadily roars back she s getting back to running the bar ahead of mohawk s first in person show thursday night she and the venue s staff set up the p a system they put on the boys are back in town to test it sound rattled through the mohawk for the first time more than a year she buckled we re all exhausted and dirty because we d been cleaning bar and floors and all that she said and i just broke just immediately started bawling everybody s cheering and cheers ing and i m just crying tears of dust and stale beer gregor and the mohawk staff scrambled to get liquor on the shelves and beer in the coolers ahead of welcoming 450 people ready for a show and a drink the indoor bar chalkboard displayed an emphatic scrawl all are welcome back a pandemic themed take on the club s longtime mantra michael minasi kut a message written thursday on a blackboard at mohawk bar in downtown austin reads all are welcome back mohawk reopened with a sold out performance of heartless bastards with the tender things mohawk s sold out show with the tender things opening for the heartless bastards dovetails with the reemergence of in person events at austin s iconic live music venues stubb s kicked off a five day set of shows that will draw thousands of show hungry austinites to see black pumas continental club and c boy s are opening up over memorial day but reopening won t necessarily be a silver bullet for all the problems that snowballed after more than a year of inactivity venues will be able to start making back some of their lost revenue but first they face hiring and inventory related expenses just to reboot their operations not to mention the back rent that some still owe many venues had hoped federal funding from the shuttered venue operators grant program would help them pay those bills but it s been months and they re still waiting willing to wait rebecca reynolds an attorney who also heads up the music venue alliance of austin said her clients have been floating along on that promise of relief the small business administration administered program is part of a larger relief package the save our stages act which was the victim of partisan gridlock for months before finally passing in december the bill which set up a fund specifically reserved for music and arts venues was signed into law just before the end of the year applications didn t open until april 26 in effect there s still no money reynolds said so those relationships are becoming more and more strained we re not sure how much longer landlords are going to be willing to wait absent that relief the city of austin offered programs to assist venues which reynolds said was a lifeline but it wasn t enough to pay down the mountain of debt faced by some venues that have been closed or operating on a limited capacity for 15 months of the 52 venues reynolds works with only two of them own the property where they sit while venues are covered by austin travis county s eviction moratorium for commercial renters impacted by the pandemic the measure is set to expire this summer renters with five months of back rent could face evictions starting in june venues are expected to be fully operational because covid restrictions are being lifted reynolds said and they don t have the funds to pay their rent and re hire staff and order inventory so it s putting them in an even worse situation u s rep lloyd doggett d austin said the deafening silence at the city s music venues will end soon doggett who officially opened mohawk s doors thursday night told kut he expects venues will start getting news about their grant applications this week the bureaucratic delay has been long doggett said so we keep pressing on trying to get the resources knowing that have hung on this long but they do need help michael minasi kut u s rep lloyd doggett is greeted thursday by mohawk security manager vincent tompkins as he opens the doors of the venue to the public for the first time since they closed due to the coronavirus pandemic ashley morales a public information officer with the sba s san antonio office said that venue operators can expect notices that they ve received funding within the next week or so i can t say it ll be two days after you send it back three days you know morales said we re doing our best to make sure they do receive that funding as quick as possible according to the sba more than 13 000 venue operators applied for relief which comprises 14 billion out of the 16 billion authorized in the save our stages act morales said applicants should sign the notices when they receive them and send them back after that they should receive their grants if you see me crying gregor said mohawk received a notification that their application is under review on thursday she said she understands the delay processing the grants but she wonders why it took so long to get to this point since the pandemic she has vaulted into advocacy pushing for city state and federal relief money for venues and workers through the nonprofit amplified sound coalition but even though more than 40 of the state s population has been vaccinated and a semblance of normalcy has started to return venues are still waiting for federal aid if the global pandemic had been a tornado or if it had been a hurricane and you could see with your eyes the utter destruction that it left in its wake people would be so angry that no one was stepping into help she said and that was us for the last year thursday night ahead of the opening set from tender things and the ceremonial reopening with doggett things felt like they were back normal for gregor kind of she was promoted to manager after coming back to work so she wasn t behind a bar that has been an adjustment an update on mohawk s mask policy was thrown into the usual litany of service related updates along with a notice on bugs in the point of sale system that keeps track of bar tabs and a heads up that the venue doesn t stock dr pepper anymore it s menial stuff like that the staples of normalcy she and the rest of her team had been waiting for everybody was back gathered around the inside bar before an actual honest to god live music show if you see me crying she told the mohawk staff it s not because i m sad

wealthier white americans the decade was punishing to farmers for the first time more people lived in cities membership surged for the ku klux klan which targeted african americans immigrants jews and catholics anyone who didn t meet its definition of a real american in 1921 one of the worst incidents of racial violence occurred the tulsa race massacre three years later the immigration act of 1924 restricted immigrants from asia and eastern europe the 1920s in short were not all they were cracked up to be we have today in the united states cheek by jowl prosperity and depression the author and civil rights activist w e b du bois wrote in 1926 it s not hard to see many of the same threads today racial injustice economic inequity convulsive technological change the 1921 campaign slogan of warren g harding a return to normalcy sounds very familiar and even appealing to those who have had it with the new normal forecasts on wall street of course vary the united nations last month raised its global economic forecast to 5 4 growth in 2021 while many analysts are predicting the pace to quicken in the months and years ahead tina fordham partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a disillusioned emancipated youth the young have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic on behalf of the older generation moore says there was a sense of that after the war and after the spanish flu the war was very much young people being sent off to die by an older generation they d been taught to trust but then felt very let down by whether the same response will happen in the aftermath of this pandemic is something to watch for the crisis is far from over christakis cautions we don t want to spike the ball at the 5 yard line he says but throughout history christakis sees a pattern common to prolonged calamity plagues are followed by boom times after the black death came the erosion of feudalism the roaring twenties is just a metaphor christakis says grief walks the streets during times of plague so people will rightly be relieved when this period of loss is behind us

washington president biden on friday unveiled 3 6 trillion in tax increases on wealthy americans and big corporations to pay for his plans to combat climate change reduce income inequality and significantly expand the nation s social safety net for the wealthiest taxpayers the proposals would mean higher taxes on their income the sale of their investments and the transfer of their assets when they die starting at the end of 2021 the top individual income tax rate would rise to 39 6 percent from 37 percent reversing the trump administration s tax cuts for the highest income taxpayers the new rate would apply to income over 509 300 for married couples filing jointly and 452 700 unmarried individuals taxes on capital gains the proceeds of selling an asset like a stock or a boat for people earning more than 1 million would be taxed as ordinary income effectively increasing the rate wealthy individuals pay on that money to 39 6 percent from 20 percent because capital gains income would also still be subject to a 3 8 percent surtax that helps fund the affordable care act the conservative tax foundation estimated that high earning taxpayers in some states could face tax rates on their capital gains that are above 50 percent the highest such tax burden in a century

a geodesic is the shortest path on earth s surface between two given locations from a professional trader s point of view the locations that nowadays matter most are not exchanges historic city centre headquarters but a couple of dozen unremarkable mainly suburban buildings in the americas europe and asia buildings that usually could pass for a warehouse most of today s frantic automated transactions take place in these anonymous computer datacenters making the geodesics among them the site of intense technological competition the participants in that competition measure time in nanoseconds billionths of a second a nanosecond is an almost unimaginably short time during it the fastest physically possible signal such as a pulse of light passing through the vacuum of deep space can travel only around 30 cm or roughly a foot up until 2010 the quickest way of sending information from one datacenter to another was through fibre optic cable and a new more direct fiber optic cable had just been laid to connect chicago s futures markets to the new jersey datacenters in which shares currencies and sovereign bonds are traded but a light signal in a fiber optic cable is slowed by the glass of its core to around two thirds of its speed in a vacuum in contrast a pulse of light or a radio signal travels through the atmosphere at almost that maximum speed signal attenuation and the earth s curvature though mean that only the closest pairs of datacentres can be directly linked in this way in other cases for example between chicago and new jersey and often too among the new jersey datacenters repeater equipment on towers or tall buildings is needed if you own a structure of this kind that just happens to be at the right point on one of the crucial geodesics even if it is for example deep in the rural midwest or in an unprepossessing postindustrial district of new jersey you ve got a winning lottery ticket competition to get as close as possible to the geodesic means that the speed race competitors will be prepared to pay a lot to get their wireless antennas or atmospheric lasers installed in precisely the right location a particular focus of the competition is on where exactly the final antennas in a wireless link are because everyone wants to minimize what they call fiber tail the unavoidable last few meters of slow fiber optic cable that take the signal from those antennas into the datacenter building you would like those antennas to be on the pole or tower that s closest to the datacentre and restrictions on access to that structure can cause sharp dispute best of all is to be able to place antennas on the datacenter s roof some exchanges however prohibit that while others allow only certain firms to have access to their datacenters roofs nor are all places on a roof equal some are closer than others to points at which cable can be run down into the building while a particular corner may be ideal for transmitting and receiving signals along a crucial geodesic i ve been told that when one exchange made spaces on its roof available for rent those that were best for pointing in the right direction went very very quickly a small number of firms bought all up it was like a land grab the speed race along the geodesics brings with it a surprising sensitivity of today s financial trading to contingencies of the physical world such as weather because the microwave radio frequencies least vulnerable to rain are congested in the vicinity of the geodesics higher frequencies often have to be used meaning that links can fail when it rains heavily for example as the links between chicago and new jersey pass over ohio and pennsylvania the lasers that flash financial data above the heads of the residents of northern new jersey are vulnerable to something even more mundane bird droppings can stick to the glass of the lasers although i m told that at considerable cost and in tests using honey as a close substitute for bird drop a coating has been developed to which those droppings will not stick when ten years ago i started researching today s automated high frequency trading or hft i assumed that trading algorithms actions would be informed by subtle complex patterns of data discovered using sophisticated machine learning that s sometimes so but the signals crucial to hft are often much simpler if for example the prices of futures contracts on the standard poor s 500 share index which are traded in chicago suddenly rise then a tiny fraction of a second later so too will the prices of the exchange traded funds that track the same index these etfs are traded in new jersey even something as simple as a growing imbalance between the number of bids to buy a financial instrument and the number of offers to sell it can be highly informative the existence of simple signals of this kind is public knowledge in the world of hft and this largely explains the extent of the pressure on hft firms to have the fastest possible technologies and communication links the algorithms that are quickest to react to such a signal can profit while a slower algorithm may lose heavily speed races of this kind happen far more often than you might think using london stock exchange messaging data that are not normally accessible to researchers matteo aquilina and peter o neill of the uk financial conduct authority along with the university of chicago economist eric budish found that a race of this kind takes place on average about once a minute in each of the leading 100 stocks traded on that exchange they estimate that across stock markets globally around 5 billion is won or lost annually in these races and that forces participants to give speed a huge priority the prize doesn t by any means all take the form of profit for hft firms much of it ends up being spent on ultrafast computing and communications and the need for speed means that exchanges are able to charge trading firms high fees for services such as the fastest datafeeds and provision of the crossconnect cables within its datacenter that trading firms computer servers need in order to be able to communicate with the exchange s system it shouldn t be imagined that expensive speed races are somehow inherent in sophisticated high tech trading as budish has argued speed races are fueled by how markets are configured in particular by the fact that trading is continuous in time an algorithm can trade any nanosecond even though the vast majority of nanoseconds witness no trading whatsoever rather than taking the form of auctions that occur at specific points in time a comparison that shows this is between financial trading and online advertising the latter is also a huge high tech automated business but if i google something of commercial interest visit a news website or browse a social media platform what gets triggered is an auction not continuous trading billions of these auctions happen every day but because each of them is a point in time event in which algorithms can have as much as a tenth of a second or more in which to bid an eternity on hft s timescale online advertising is not characterized by the extreme speed race found in finance the issues that are of concern in digital advertising such as intrusive data collection and oligopoly are different among the lessons i would draw is the importance of what i call material political economy we are used to the idea that economic systems are political in a broad sense how economic life is organized influences and is influenced by the distribution of income and wealth while government regulatory bodies for example are not simply neutral referees but the object of often intense lobbying but politics can also be found woven deeply into the fabric the material fabric of economic life my book trading at the speed of light tells the story of how that entanglement has played out in the world s most important financial markets

partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a disillusioned emancipated youth the young have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic on behalf of the older generation moore says there was a sense of that after the war and after the spanish flu the war was very much young people being sent off to die by an older generation they d been taught to trust but then felt very let down by whether the same response will happen in the aftermath of this pandemic is something to watch for the crisis is far from over christakis cautions we don t want to spike the ball at the 5 yard line he says but throughout history christakis sees a pattern common to prolonged calamity plagues are followed by boom times after the black death came the erosion of feudalism the roaring twenties is just a metaphor christakis says grief walks the streets during times of plague so people will rightly be relieved when this period of loss is behind us

cell lung cancer nsclc the company has commenced non good laboratory practices glp toxicology studies with rutherrin in animals to help determine the maximum recommended human dose of the drug when

proven to be effective in the destruction of influenza h1n1 and zika viruses at low nanomolar concentrations these studies were expanded to include coronavirus bio safety level bsl 2 as a note covid 19 is caused by coronavirus bsl 3 not coronavirus bsl 2 a new assay was established to measure coronavirus destruction and using this new assay the theralase pdc technology was able to destroy coronavirus bsl 2 with drug doses 5 times lower than what was used to kill influenza h1n1 and zika viruses these drug doses demonstrated a 99 995 destruction rate of the bsl 2 coronavirus and are significantly lower than those used by the company to treat cancers hence considered safe for human use coronaviruses are considered similar in their structure and these new results strongly suggest that theralase s pdc will be highly effective against the sars cov 2 bsl 3 virus responsible for covid 19 in april 2021 theralase executed a collaborative research agreement cra with the national microbiology laboratory public health agency of canada phac for the research and development of a canadian based sars cov 2 covid 19 vaccine under the terms of the agreement theralase and phac are collaborating on the development and optimization of a covid 19 vaccine by treating the sars cov 2 virus grown on cell lines with theralase s patented pdc and then light activating it with theralase s proprietary tlc 3000a light technology to inactivate the virus and create the fundamental building blocks of a covid 19 vaccine this inactivated virus would then be purified and used to inoculate naive animals followed by challenge with the sars cov 2 virus to ascertain the efficacy of the vaccine the project is entitled photo dynamic compound inactivation of sars cov 2 vaccine and commenced in mid april 2021 the company does not claim or profess that they have the ability to treat cure or prevent the contraction of the covid 19 coronavirus about study ii study ii utilizes the therapeutic dose 0 70 mg cm2 of tld 1433 and is focused on the enrollment and treatment of approximately 100 bcg unresponsive nmibc cis patients in up to 20 clinical study sites located in canada and the us study ii has a primary endpoint of efficacy defined by complete response cr at any point in time secondary endpoint of duration of cr at 360 days post initial cr approximately 450 days post initial study treatment assuming cr is achieved at the 90 day assessment tertiary endpoint of safety measured by incidence and severity of adverse events aes grade 4 or higher that do not resolve within 450 days post initial treatment the fda in its 2018 guidance to industry has stated that for single arm trials of patients with bcg unresponsive disease the fda defines a cr as at least one of the following negative cystoscopy and negative including atypical urine cytology positive cystoscopy with biopsy proven benign or low grade nmibc and negative cytology for intravesical therapies without systemic toxicity the fda includes in the definition of a cr negative cystoscopy with malignant urine cytology if cancer is found in the upper tract or prostatic urethra and random bladder biopsies are negative intravesical instillation does not deliver the investigational drug to the upper tract or prostatic urethra therefore the development of disease in these areas cannot be attributed to a lack of activity of the investigational drug thus sponsors can consider patients with new malignant lesions of the upper tract or prostatic urethra who have received intravesical therapy to have achieved a cr in the primary analysis however sponsors should record these lesions and conduct sensitivity analyses in which these patients are not considered to have achieved a cr 1 about theralase technologies

abating the trend signals that the banks are starting to put the pandemic behind them according to scotiabank analyst meny grauman the economy came through this pandemic on a better footing so credit losses turned out to be a fraction of what we were worried about last year grauman said in an interview even though the pandemic is not over in canada we re behind the u s and we re still under lockdowns here in canada we still have good sightline to be able to take those reserves off the pandemic also brought opportunities to certain divisions mortgages surged as homebuyers eager to lock in

on earnings while mortgages boosted personal loans commercial loans largely remained flat and credit card spending while increasing slightly has been slow to rebound analysts questioned whether excess deposits as consumers and businesses tucked away extra cash would cause a lag in demand for loans especially with commercial clients rbc s chief financial officer rod bolger said that while people may first spend their extra cash rather than take on debt that should change as the economy reopens and spending on big items resumes meanwhile the trend toward savings benefitted some segments with an uptick in clients investing with its wealth management division and companies looking to meet their merger and acquisition goals in its capital markets division from a commercial standpoint we don t believe that that is a long term impact on loan growth that it should work its way through over the next couple of quarters bolger said in an interview clients have more funds to invest in the market

to continue to release further loan loss provisions as the economy re opens analysts are watching for how the lenders will allocate that cash at the outset of the pandemic canada s banking regulator temporarily restricted banks from raising dividends and buying back shares the lenders reported increases in their common equity tier 1 cet1 ratios with td s jumping to 14 2 per cent and rbc s climbing to 12 8 per cent across the board bank executives said that they plan to send some of those funds to investors once the limitation is lifted some banks also have other plans for those funds in addition to paying shareholders after a year of not being able to raise dividends they ll all put through some pretty health dividend increases but there are some differences in preferences or thoughts between capital allocation toward organic growth m a and buybacks cibc analyst paul holden said in an interview adding that td has been the most vocal about using its capital to potentially make acquisitions to grow its business td chief executive officer bharat masrani said that the bank would certainly consider returning capital to shareholders but that canada s second largest bank has

the shortage is in part due to a microchip shortage the colorado auto dealers association said wheat ridge colo even though there s a light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic the economic impacts that it left behind remain one of which is a microchip shortage that has led to a supply chain issue paving the way for a car shortage at dealerships that sell new cars normal year we d probably have five or six hundred chevrolets on the ground right now i have about 100 said josh letsis the managing partner of medved autoplex in wheat ridge the ongoing shortage is continuing right into one of the most popular times to buy a car memorial day weekend it s one of the four busiest weekends of the entire year he said statewide issue letsis isn t alone in the current struggle to fill up lots with new cars to sell the colorado auto dealers association cada which represents around 400 dealerships says several others are in a pinch but business is still technically up well the big thing right now is inventory sales are up and we had another record month just reported for april of this year and it looks like may will set a new record as well which is really a little bit hard to explain because our inventories are so low said tim jackson the president and ceo of cada we have dealerships that would typically have seven to eight hundred new cars on the ground available for consumers that today only have 70 to 80 so they re literally running 10 of their normal inventory he adds that another dealership he talked to this week said they would normally have more than 300 cars on the ground but they currently have fewer than 30 but that shortage of new cars because of the microchip shortage is causing inventory levels to be low and will eventually make it so consumers won t be able to get the car they want or need and they may have to wait a few months for those he said for letsis he says that shortage leading to wait times can prove to be difficult on a consumer obviously we want to sell a car to everybody who walks in the door so sometimes when we have to explain to them that there s an inventory shortage you know we don t want to sound like that prototypical car salesman hey you better buy right now but unfortunately it is that way he said on the other hand he says prices are still in a good range which is a positive for consumers the good news is rates are still really low and the manufacturers still have some incentives out there so that s really good i anticipate some of the incentives going away as the inventory really starts to dry up and that ll change your summer shopping for sure said letsis sometimes you ll see some ups and downs with used cars but new cars the factories have always been able to crank them out however many you want and right now they just can t they re still playing catch up from covid overall letsis is optimistic that the issue will eventually recover but likely not until some time in the second half of the year so when it does come back it s not going to be like covid where we had to ramp up the factories again it s going to come back with a vengeance and what that means with the used car values is they re probably going to drop pretty significantly but hopefully our new car inventory it will stock back up really quickly unfortunately i think it s going to be q3 q4 when that finally happens he said what about used cars explained both by letsis and jackson the shortage for new car lots is also having an impact on used car lots the best way to describe the used car situation is that when new car inventories go down as low as they are right now that causes consumers that can t buy because they can t find the exact new car that they re looking for to stay in the late model used car market and then it puts a greater demand on that used car market and causes the price of those to go up and that s exactly what s happening in the current marketplace it s bad for consumers on the car they re purchasing but it s good for consumers on the car that they have ready for trade on their next new car jackson explained letsis has a similar explanation adding that the shortage is also impacting trade in values so one of the big things is is the trade values i mean trade values i sold a vehicle to a friend of mine he bought his truck two years ago put 30 000 miles on his truck i gave him more than what he paid for it two years ago and thirty thousand miles so if you can find that vehicle that you re looking for your trade value is never going to be worth more than it is right now he said advice jackson elaborated on the shortage explaining some advice for new or used car customers if they do go to a dealer right now definitely shop the market shop around if you can t get what you want at your closest dealer shop the next dealer because somebody is going to have the car that you want and the car that you have for trade is really in demand more so now than ever before so in that regard if you have the late model trade now is a great time to take the remaining inventory off the new car dealer slot get that car traded in and make another happy customer out there when they get the older car jackson said letsis also offers some tips now if you re in the market i would recommend looking because the only thing that s going to change down the road is going to be the selection so if you re willing to make a couple of compromises now you might find the vehicle that you re looking for versus if you wait even a couple of weeks it might be we might have to place that order and you might have to wait four months to get that vehicle he said

protect against such risks the use of options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives a fund may invest in flex options that reference an etf which subjects a fund to certain of the risks of owning shares of an etf as well as the types of instruments in which the reference etf invests because a fund may hold flex options that reference the index and or reference etfs a fund has exposure to the equity securities markets the flex options

instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government the fund does not invest directly in flex options rather it invests in a wholly owned subsidiary which will have the same investment objective as the fund but unlike the fund it may invest without limitation in flex options the subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 act and is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 act thus the fund as an investor in the subsidiary will not have all the protections offered to investors in registered investment companies commodity prices can have significant volatility and exposure to commodities can cause the value of a fund s shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and unpredictable manner as the use of internet technology has become

scott fitzgerald some of the parallels are legitimate says nicholas christakis professor of sociology and medicine at yale university and author of apollo s arrow the profound and enduring impact of coronavirus on the way we live after an interim period of coping with the clinical psychological and economic shock of the virus he says we ll see an uplift this summer with a post pandemic period taking root by 2023 it will he says be a bit of a party understandably people will be very relieved when this is all finally over people have been cooped one way or another for a very long time christakis says we re going to see people relentlessly seeking out social opportunities in nightclubs and restaurants and bars and sporting events and musical concerts and political rallies we might see some sexual licentiousness some loosening of sexual mores such prognostications have tantalized many eager for the fabled liberation of a century ago what fitzgerald described as the most expensive orgy in history outside of the 1960s perhaps no decade looms larger in the collective imagination than the 1920s thanks in part to the emerging mass culture that captured the time the swinging speakeasies the harlem renaissance the first talkie in 1927 s the jazz singer over time the mythology has only grown glitzier see baz luhrmann gatsby 2013 there s truth in that portrait of the 20s but mainly to wealthier white americans the decade was punishing to farmers for the first time more people lived in cities membership surged for the ku klux klan which targeted african americans immigrants jews and catholics anyone who didn t meet its definition of a real american in 1921 one of the worst incidents of racial violence occurred the tulsa race massacre three years later the immigration act of 1924 restricted immigrants from asia and eastern europe the 1920s in short were not all they were cracked up to be we have today in the united states cheek by jowl prosperity and depression the author and civil rights activist w e b du bois wrote in 1926 it s not hard to see many of the same threads today racial injustice economic inequity convulsive technological change the 1921 campaign slogan of warren g harding a return to normalcy sounds very familiar and even appealing to those who have had it with the new normal forecasts on wall street of course vary the united nations last month raised its global economic forecast to 5 4 growth in 2021 while many analysts are predicting the pace to quicken in the months and years ahead tina fordham partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a disillusioned emancipated youth the young have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic on behalf of the older generation moore says there was a sense of that after the war and after the spanish flu the war was very much young people being sent off to die by an older generation they d been taught to trust but then felt very let down by whether the same response will happen in the aftermath of this pandemic is something to watch for the crisis is far from over christakis cautions we don t want to spike the ball at the 5 yard line he says but throughout history christakis sees a pattern common to prolonged calamity plagues are followed by boom times after the black death came the erosion of feudalism the roaring twenties is just a metaphor christakis says grief walks the streets during times of plague so people will rightly be relieved when this period of loss is behind us
by yasin ebrahim investing com the wild swings in bitcoin continued friday but business activity on the blockchain has never been better and will eventually help part the clouds of fear uncertainty and doubt propelling the popular crypto to 100 000 by year end fell 6 to 36 115 i expect to see 100 000 this year we should be close to that level already based on the halving cyclical but we re not there because there s confusing narratives that haven t shown up yet michael venuto chief investment officer for toroso investments said in an interview thursday with investing com the recent price action in btc will calm down because the business part of this the part where bitcoin other cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance are being used to revolutionise finance is in a better shape than it s ever been in history venuto added a halving event that halves the reward for mining bitcoin transactions and the supply of newly minted bitcoin occurs roughly every four years to keep a lid on inflation halving events in both 2012 and 2016 had preceded previous bull runs for btc the most recent halving event in may last year cut the block reward for mining bitcoin from 12 5 btc to 6 25 btc and helped bring the supply and demand narrative into focus a quick look at where we are in the current cycle suggests there is plenty of room for bitcoin to run higher based on the halving cycle supply and demand and the retail sentiment i don t think we re anywhere close to the end of the bull run venuto said during the recent selloff the smaller novice investor on a trading diet of leverage and greed was widely signaled out for panic selling adding fuel to the downside but the hedge funds and institutions trading on leverage may have been caught up in fomo fever and ultimately also fell victim to the margin squeeze regulation or the lack thereof may have something to do the with the bearish institutional bets the dearth of options available to institutions to buy and hold bitcoin in an investment vehicle that fits their world gives more access and ability for traditional finance to short bitcoin than they have to be buy and hold investors venuto said unlike retail investors institutions are typically not permitted to directly buy bitcoin on crypto exchanges or hold it in a wallet many have touted a bitcoin etf in the u s as a solution to plug the gap but it s unlikely to come anytime soon even with an sec chairman who has a strong grasp of blockchain technologies e re in a world where the laws that govern how we treat financial instruments were written in 1940 and 1933 venuto said the u s government needs to make a much bigger statement about what is to them and whether it should or shouldn t be subject to these securities laws concerns about the environmental impact of mining btc has also played a role in souring institutional sentiment on bitcoin a narrative that was given credence in the wake of remarks by tesla nasdaq chief executive elon musk in recent weeks it was precipitated by the esg movement and this notion which was exacerbated by elon musk that there are some real environmental problems with the mining of bitcoin ark investment management founder cathie wood said thursday at coindesk s consensus 2021 conference but the notion that bitcoin is a dirty crypto given the energy used up to mine blocks on the blockchain is somewhat of misnomer at least in the u s as most american miners use clean renewable energy venuto said
the elliott family sat down with lesli foster to discuss their family s story and the implications of this tragic coverup in our nation s history example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington back in 1921 black wall street was a prosperous community in tulsa oklahoma black people in the greenwood district were well to do and confident about their self made success all that changed when a white mob fueled by a false accusation set fire to their safe haven killing hundreds who lived and worked there no one has ever been held accountable for the violence and destruction 100 years later we are still trying to awaken the truth about the massacre that went largely unknown by the masses wusa9 anchor lesli foster sat down recently with some descendants at the gathering spot in d c a private club for black people to have these kinds of discussions to talk about their family s story and the implications of a tragic coverup in our nation s history but first there s someone you should meet mr tj elliott once called this country s merchant prince owned the largest african american owned department store in the united states at the time the elliott family was part of the oklahoma land rush back in the 1890 s they saw it as a frontier for freedom and in time they would build on what was once indian territory they were able to acquire 300 acres of land a hotel a bank a theater a chain of department stores mary elliott descendant and family historian said they owned office buildings their supply for the department stores came in from europe from mexico from all over the nation their clientele was black white and native american the 10 000 square foot elliott department store drew in people clamoring to see the marble floors and chandeliers the finest goods money could buy and the celebrated fashion shows it was a respite of sorts from the harsh realities of life a space for black people to imagine during a time of racism and segregation to be able to go in a store and go up to the counter and try on a hat something that s seemingly mundane mary elliott said but not only are you able to try on a hat you re trying on a hat in a business where it s owned by black people run by black people and it s supporting the black community this community would come to be known as black wall street but it was bigger than just commerce it was an entire apparatus of equity they found ways to become educated used their skills to build up their community the dollar circulated within the community several times over they supported one another mary elliott said there was not this distinction between the haves and the have nots what happened to the least happened to all a 1910 photograph shows some of the elliott family outside of their homestead in muskogee oklahoma a black community just outside of tulsa there is love in the image power agency and a certain assurance that comes from knowing who you are mary elliott dr tollie elliott and his son tollie elliott junior are the beneficiaries of that legacy they were unabashed about who they were as people and what they had dr tollie elliott said his son tollie jr notes the pride and excellence captured in the photo mary elliott is the family historian and curator at the national museum of african american history and culture her brother tollie elliott is the chief medical director for the mary s center and his son tollie jr elliott is a student at howard university you knew that you were literally like they say standing on the shoulders of giants tollie elliott said you knew that you were right there that you come from that stock you come from that expectation a century ago the elliott s were expecting to expand their chain of department stores and pass them down through the generations that dream would have to wait everything changed on may 31 1921 on that day a 19 year old black man and shoe shiner dick rowland stepped into an elevator on the other side of town that s when mary said rowland encountered a young lady he had seen and talked to before her name was sarah as he entered the elevator he tripped mary elliott said and when he tripped he reached for her and she screamed witnesses saw the whole thing but there was someone who worked in the store who claimed that dick rowland had attacked this young woman sarah ultimately said that he had not attacked her mary elliott said but at this point he was already taken off to the prison to the courthouse white mobs gathered to lynch rowland black men newly back from world war 1 gathered to protect him the groups clashed and that set off a two day frenzy white residents essentially raze the black community mary elliott said they plow through 40 blocks of black community razing it they loot the homes they shoot the residents they beat people to burn their homes down they burned the churches they destroyed the schools there were black bodies in the streets but that s not all the white residents had planes they dropped dynamite onto homes and businesses pulverizing them but before they demolished the homes many in the mob took items that came to symbolize black affluence and put them into their own homes black people who ended up having to work for some of these very families would see their own belongings in the homes of their new employers as yet another infusion of trauma to come the people who escaped were rounded up and put into internment camps among the thousands taken from their homes and livelihoods was cernoria nora mcgowan johnson she was a young child during the massacre and her family was subjected to all that violence mary elliott said they were forced into an internment camp and it was a white woman who her mother worked for who came out and got them out of the camp johnson went on to lead the washington bureau of the national urban league and worked with big 6 leaders and president lyndon johnson to get civil rights laws passed but aunt nora never talked about the trauma of tulsa and the history books left this entire chapter to be forgotten an effort by the local state and federal government to conceal the truth one hundred years after the deadliest race riot in this country s history most people still have no idea it even happened how is that possible the elliott s have some thoughts tollie elliott jr grew up hearing about these tumultuous times and the strength it took to keep going i believe it has everything to do with school systems today he said history is written by the victors they don t want to look bad especially now and it was just part of a growing narrative about black people in this country one that has gone unchecked for generations by design it s ripped out from under them and then you have someone say see they re lazy they don t appreciate education they don t want a business mary elliott said and they don t tell the history about in fact there was a time that they did all these things and now they re forced to rebuild as head of the national negro business league tj elliott was at the center of the effort to restore homes and livelihoods tollie elliott keeps an image of his inspirational namesake from a promotional calendar in his home it s the one item the family has from their department store that was burned during the violence it s a reminder to keep going it s telling you you can t fail tollie elliott jr said your family hasn t failed so why would you keep moving it s just like fuel the tollie who graduated from high school four years after the tulsa race massacre likely shared that same sentiment the family still has his framed diploma from 1925 so where do we go from here as a nation tollie elliott believes we have to start by speaking the truth i like the perspective of calling people out he said i think it s okay i think it forces people to acknowledge the horrors of who they were but it doesn t mean who they have to be mary elliott says we have work to do but it requires all of us to move our nation forward we were able to bring the nation out of the bondage of slavery she said we still have work to do to bring a nation out of the bondage of racism one hundred years later tulsa descendants are left to wrestle with what justice might look like for the loss of loved ones property and community they were never made whole again and they never got the insurance money they paid for these elliott s intend to make sure this story continues to be told and they are committed to continuing the work of their ancestors and the conversation around who we are as a nation and the obligations we have to each other

fish creek gushes along the skyline trail the snowmelt brought the yampa river flow to 1 730 cubic feet per second on sunday afternoon which very well could be the peak flow last year the river peaked a day earlier at 3 110 cfs there are two spots on mount werner that erin light looks at each spring to get a rough estimate about when the yampa river may see peak stream flow a lot of times it is very close when those two spots come together it is probably within a day or two that it will peak said light the regional division engineer for the colorado division of water resources looking at the steamboat stream flow gauge i would say we are probably done stream flows for the elk and yampa rivers likely have already peaked light said pointing to high flow marks friday and sunday it is possible this isn t the peak as a spring storm could bolster water levels but light said it seems unlikely that is the case this year this spring has many remembering the 2002 drought year which is one of the worst in recent history for colorado light was new to the yampa valley then when calls on the river simply were not talked about i figured i would never see the yampa river go on call during my career said light who has now had to place a call on the river twice once in 2018 and last year still this year is looking better than 2002 on may 25 2002 there was just 2 3 inches of water in the snowpack in the mountains of the yampa river basin where on tuesday the snow water equivalency was still about 4 7 inches but ranchers in the county are preparing for the worst irrigating earlier than normal and contemplating taking measures like bringing livestock water in tanks and even selling off part of their herd because they don t have enough pasture land with water flowing through it to raise them all we kind of knew this thing was coming mid winter said doug monger longtime local rancher who represents routt county on the colorado river district board of directors it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out you cannot dump enough water on this ground right now it is just thirsty monger said he started irrigating about two weeks earlier than normal hoping to get as much water out of the river as he can now while the river has strong water flows he said many of the tributaries used for stock watering are already dropping down to really low levels the dry weather has led to less health issues like pneumonia with his calves but it could also cause monger to sell off cows earlier than planned something he has never done before i am right on the verge of having to sell cows too monger said we re underpopulating a lot of our pastures and we still have to try to make it to september and october a pasture monger has just south of stagecoach reservoir normally could sustain cows through the whole season but last year they ran out of pasture and had to get the herd out early he anticipates having to do that again this year on tuesday colorado parks and wildlife closed a small stretch of the yampa river directly below the reservoir to fishing an effort to reduce stress on fish while stream flows are low on tuesday afternoon flows entering the reservoir had dropped to about 8 cubic feet per second the same day last year flows were over 60 that is just unheard of light said there is more water flowing out of stagecoach right now than going in which happens every year but rarely this early there are already calls on various ditches in the yampa valley and light said she expects more light is relatively confident there will be a call on the elk river which has happened almost every year since 2012 as for the yampa it could be different as the colorado river district has a 50 000 grant for strategic releases to hopefully avoid a call on the river without that a call would almost be certain light said the river is pitiful above morrison creek said todd hagenbuch whose water rights come from the yampa just below stagecoach i think it depends on where you are in the yampa valley right now as to what kind of access to water you ve got the upper basin is particularly tough right now said hagenbuch who is the director and agricultural agent for the routt county csu extension office he said he hopes return flows from irrigation will boost water levels in the coming weeks but he doesn t have an optimistic outlook given what snowpack is left and the temperatures we re seeing and the lack of natural moisture that has come i think we are in for a rough irrigation season hagenbuch said without a rainy summer kelly romero heaney water resource manager for the city of steamboat springs said there could be recreational river closures before labor day last year the main stretch of the yampa was put on call in late august the 2002 drought year sticks out for her too but what is different now is how much has been learned about water management in the past 19 years in preparation of a really dry year romero heaney said there is enough water to support municipal customers in town but the more they use the less there is in fish creek which is an important spawning stream for mountain whitefish she said she hopes steamboat residents minimize outdoor watering to take some pressure off the resource keeping an eye out for water leaks around the house faucets toilets and outdoor spigots especially is also important she said as these seemingly insignificant trickles can really add up we all need to pitch in romero heaney said when we all do it or when most of us do it then we can see a real benefit from the stream and we can see a real benefit to our water supply

in 2017 several cases emerged where images of public celebrities were photoshopped for illicit purposes a ceo was scammed out of 243 000 using a voice deepfake an imitated video of president ali bongo was released to convince the public about his good health and the list goes on such hybridization of human bodies and faces through deepfakes is likely to erode trust among people in media and technology platforms deepfakes is one of the subsets of artificial intelligence ai a synthesis of deep learning and fake the deepfake algorithm works on deep machine learning which examines the facial expressions and movements of a person and superimposes face images of a target person over the video of a source person for falsification purposes although it has proven beneficial in the fields of education art self expression and in solving various issues in the computer vision domain it is problematic owing to its indistinguishable nature between real and tampered images and videos the process of tqmpering footages through deepfakes can be performed by professionals and even novices having minimal photoshop or programming skills it can also be produced with a static image the issue lies in its strikingly convincing results where it is almost impossible to discern a real video from a fake one even high tech computer programmes including ai have proven ineffective to mark difference including any variance in pixels of a deepfake and a realistic video the inability to determine a deepfake has given way to numerous unprecedented problems they are a harbinger to threats in the future such as exploiting political and religious tensions among countries by re contextualizing and re staging original videos into fabricated political and religious deepfake weapons affecting electoral campaigns by manipulating public opinion creating chaos in the financial market and spreading unusually persuasive fake videos and speeches of both public figures and ordinary people the prospects of increased spread of misinformation and hate speech are also heightened political and religious tensions and chaos among public are probable to stimulate as a result of deepfakes due to its ability to alter the ways in which the media was interpreted it is also blurring the line between hybridized and evidentiary videos used in court rooms the concern becomes more urgent because research has confirmed that hoaxes and fabricated news tends to reach people ten times faster to people than an authentic piece of information in 2018 a video was circulated on whatsapp by re contextualizing a nerve gas attack in syria in 2013 to manipulate viewers of rural india to buttress false claims of child kidnapping and violence us intelligence has been using deepfakes as a weapon to create political instability and chaos among public and political figures deepfakes such as an american politician taking a bribe a soldier exterminating civilians overseas a us official purportedly confessing to a conspiracy etc are only a fraction of examples where deepfakes have been utilized as tools of de stabilization and spreading fake information among public not only this the ability of deepfakes to manipulate words and facial expressions of someone also helps suppress political opposition in this regard portraying female politicians and activists in a sexualized way has been the prime target again a fake illicit video of a female journalist rana ayyub who critiqued the excesses of the indian government was circulated via whatsapp in 2018 by the bhartiya janata party such an intense uptick in the creation of deepfake videos is leading to legal implications such as privacy harms identity sabotage and threats of defamation can technology platforms play a role in minimizing the spread of deepfakes the non stop pace of content transmission and the platform s mandate to provide an opensource distributive system is making content moderation and fact checking a real challenge the encryption models of certain applications like whatsapp makes the detection of fake videos even harder to accomplish these events are causing an information apocalypse which will alter the ways in which individuals consume information it is also akin to distorting reality and eroding trust among people on online technology platforms this raises the concern about whether the right to information also includes the right to misinformation the proliferation of deepfakes has also triggered the need for laws and regulations prohibiting such behavior however any such regulation is likely to be hit by the right to free speech and expression incorporated in the constitution of almost every country the writer is a lahore based lawyer

vice president harris cites challenges of fragile world in speech to naval academy graduates share copy link copy good morning acting secretary thomas harker general david berger admiral mike gilda looking out at these mid shipment i know we are all filled with pride vice admiral it s sean buck captain tr buchanan faculty and staff thank you for educating such a fine crew alumni thank for the support you have shown over these years to this great institution and to my military aid lieutenant colonel frank mack who graduated in 2004 i m very proud to have you with me here today family and

will not be forgotten and finally to the class of 2021 congratulations congratulations and look how far you ve come so you endured zero 530 pt and prone exams you excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises you enjoyed the fair at dillard s i know karaoke at harvest you guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated and you made it to this day you made it to this day and this day this day that is not only a commencement this day that is a commissioning and in a few minutes you will take an oath and it s actually the same oath i took as vice president an oath to support our constitution and defend it against all enemies an oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation and no matter what changes in our world the charge in this oath is constant remember that as you walk out into the world because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing in fact we are at a significant turning point just look at the last several months and you know what i m talking about and look at several moments in our nation s history for perspective think about it there was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the world after the world before the attack on pearl harbor in 1941 and the world after the world before the civil rights act in 1964 and the world after the world before the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the world after some of these critical moments our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness and another turning point was september 11th 20 years ago this year when airplanes hit the twin towers and our pentagon when flight 90 3 crashed pennsylvania that day shaped your entire life and it shaped our entire nation it tested our systems our structures our very standing in the world well mitch shipman we are now entering the next era a new age a new ep with its own tests with it s own challenges and with its own opportunities the global pandemic you see of course has accelerated what was happening before and it has accelerated our world into a new era it has forever impacted our world it has forever influenced our perspective and if we weren t clear before we know now our world is interconnected our world is interdependent and our world is fragile just think a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months a gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard one country s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole earth shipment is the era we are in and it is unlike any era that came before so the challenge now the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats so let me share with you for example a personal experience a few years ago when i was in the united states senate i visited the uss scranton it was outside of san diego california and at the time i was also a member of the senate intelligence committee so when i was aboard the vessel i asked the officers i said hey tell me what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyber attacks and they me you know it s pretty simple equipment and experts well the way i see it my shipment you you you are those experts on the issue of cybersecurity foreign adversaries have their sights set on our military technology our intellectual property our elections our critical infrastructure the ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month well that warning shot in fact there have been many warning shots so we must defend our nation against these threats and at the same time we must make advances in things that you ve been learning things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics and things that will put our nation at strategic advantage and you will be the ones to do it you will be the ones to do it because the united states military is the best the bravest and the most brilliant and just think from walkie talkies to the internet to satellite navigation the united states military has been on the forefront of research development and technological advancement that is a point of american pride and as i look out at all of you i know you will build on that leadership and then of course there is climate change which is a very real threat to our national security and i look at you and i know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat you are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice you are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking base you are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power convert solar and wind energy into combat power and just ask any marine today would she rather carry twenty pounds of batteries or rolled up solar panel and i am positive she will tell you a solar panel and so would he the american people are depending on you the best the bravest the most brilliant we saw this during covid 19 when americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another in this era and you are confronting this threat our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible naval researchers also figured out how to use threed knitting machines to make masks naval labs monitored the spread of the disease and the marine corps and the navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future class of 2021 you are prepared for all of this you are prepared for any threat and you are prepared for this new era and it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here for those you will continue to learn but it s because of something more it s because of who each of you is it is because of who collectively you are so as i conclude today that s what i want to talk about i want to talk about you as vice president i ve come to know the united states navy quite well every day in fact i m surrounded by sailors and marines and your tradition and your history and i mean that literally so i often travel on marine too in fact that s how i arrived today my residence is on the grounds of the united states naval observatory my west wing office features a desk built by cbs from of the uss constitution my sermon in my office my ceremonial office was once occupied by the secretary of the navy and displayed there i have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander mid shipman sidney barber and so here s what i know mid shipment you are tireless you are ambitious you are a fierce fighting force you are ideals in the truest sense are the embodiment of american aspiration so hold on to that because in your career you may witness some of the worst of humanity but promise that you will never forget the best of who we are that you will never forget the you stand for duty honor loyalty fight for those ideals and fight for our democracy and remember our constitution is not only something to defend it is a guide it is a guide for your service it begins with three simple words the people not i our nation was designed to be a team sport and we are in this together so you know finally i ll just share with you on my way to the stadium this morning i stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague a great and courageous american senator john mccain and yes so most people don t know he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the yard admiral chuck larson that is the ultimate example of what i mean in it together so mid shipment throughout our history officers in the united states navy officers in the united states marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms today you will swear to do the same you are the next links in the chain and so mitch shipman when you stand to take the oath i want you to know that as we embark on this new era president joe biden and i our entire nation have great faith in you and we are proud of you so very very proud congratulations again may god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

vice president harris cites challenges of fragile world in speech to naval academy graduates share copy link copy good morning acting secretary thomas harker general david berger admiral mike gilda looking out at these mid shipment i know we are all filled with pride vice admiral it s sean buck captain tr buchanan faculty and staff thank you for educating such a fine crew alumni thank for the support you have shown over these years to this great institution and to my military aid lieutenant colonel frank mack who graduated in 2004 i m very proud to have you with me here today family and friends of these graduates thank you for the sacrifices you have already made and make and i also want to acknowledge kim and john johnson your son was taken far too soon and i promise you that he will not be forgotten and finally to the class of 2021 congratulations congratulations and look how far you ve come so you endured zero 530 pt and prone exams you excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises you enjoyed the fair at dillard s i know karaoke at harvest you guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated and you made it to this day you made it to this day and this day this day that is not only a commencement this day that is a commissioning and in a few minutes you will take an oath and it s actually the same oath i took as vice president an oath to support our constitution and defend it against all enemies an oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation and no matter what changes in our world the charge in this oath is constant remember that as you walk out into the world because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing in fact we are at a significant turning point just look at the last several months and you know what i m talking about and look at several moments in our nation s history for perspective think about it there was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the world after the world before the attack on pearl harbor in 1941 and the world after the world before the civil rights act in 1964 and the world after the world before the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the world after some of these critical moments our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness and another turning point was september 11th 20 years ago this year when airplanes hit the twin towers and our pentagon when flight 90 3 crashed pennsylvania that day shaped your entire life and it shaped our entire nation it tested our systems our structures our very standing in the world well mitch shipman we are now entering the next era a new age a new ep with its own tests with it s own challenges and with its own opportunities the global pandemic you see of course has accelerated what was happening before and it has accelerated our world into a new era it has forever impacted our world it has forever influenced our perspective and if we weren t clear before we know now our world is interconnected our world is interdependent and our world is fragile just think a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months a gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard one country s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole earth shipment is the era we are in and it is unlike any era that came before so the challenge now the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats so let me share with you for example a personal experience a few years ago when i was in the united states senate i visited the uss scranton it was outside of san diego california and at the time i was also a member of the senate intelligence committee so when i was aboard the vessel i asked the officers i said hey tell me what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyber attacks and they me you know it s pretty simple equipment and experts well the way i see it my shipment you you you are those experts on the issue of cybersecurity foreign adversaries have their sights set on our military technology our intellectual property our elections our critical infrastructure the ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month well that warning shot in fact there have been many warning shots so we must defend our nation against these threats and at the same time we must make advances in things that you ve been learning things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics and things that will put our nation at strategic advantage and you will be the ones to do it you will be the ones to do it because the united states military is the best the bravest and the most brilliant and just think from walkie talkies to the internet to satellite navigation the united states military has been on the forefront of research development and technological advancement that is a point of american pride and as i look out at all of you i know you will build on that leadership and then of course there is climate change which is a very real threat to our national security and i look at you and i know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat you are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice you are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking base you are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power convert solar and wind energy into combat power and just ask any marine today would she rather carry twenty pounds of batteries or rolled up solar panel and i am positive she will tell you a solar panel and so would he the american people are depending on you the best the bravest the most brilliant we saw this during covid 19 when americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another in this era and you are confronting this threat our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible naval researchers also figured out how to use threed knitting machines to make masks naval labs monitored the spread of the disease and the marine corps and the navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future class of 2021 you are prepared for all of this you are prepared for any threat and you are prepared for this new era and it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here for those you will continue to learn but it s because of something more it s because of who each of you is it is because of who collectively you are so as i conclude today that s what i want to talk about i want to talk about you as vice president i ve come to know the united states navy quite well every day in fact i m surrounded by sailors and marines and your tradition and your history and i mean that literally so i often travel on marine too in fact that s how i arrived today my residence is on the grounds of the united states naval observatory my west wing office features a desk built by cbs from of the uss constitution my sermon in my office my ceremonial office was once occupied by the secretary of the navy and displayed there i have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander mid shipman sidney barber and so here s what i know mid shipment you are tireless you are ambitious you are a fierce fighting force you are ideals in the truest sense are the embodiment of american aspiration so hold on to that because in your career you may witness some of the worst of humanity but promise that you will never forget the best of who we are that you will never forget the you stand for duty honor loyalty fight for those ideals and fight for our democracy and remember our constitution is not only something to defend it is a guide it is a guide for your service it begins with three simple words the people not i our nation was designed to be a team sport and we are in this together so you know finally i ll just share with you on my way to the stadium this morning i stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague a great and courageous american senator john mccain and yes so most people don t know he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the yard admiral chuck larson that is the ultimate example of what i mean in it together so mid shipment throughout our history officers in the united states navy officers in the united states marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms today you will swear to do the same you are the next links in the chain and so mitch shipman when you stand to take the oath i want you to know that as we embark on this new era president joe biden and i our entire nation have great faith in you and we are proud of you so very very proud congratulations again may god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

friends of these graduates thank you for the sacrifices you have already made and make and i also want to acknowledge kim and john johnson your son was taken far too soon and i promise you that he will not be forgotten and finally to the class of 2021 congratulations congratulations and look how far you ve come so you endured zero 530 pt and prone exams you excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises you enjoyed the fair at dillard s i know karaoke at harvest you guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated and you made it to this day you made it to this day and this day this day that is not only a commencement this day that is a commissioning and in a few minutes you will take an oath and it s actually the same oath i took as vice president an oath to support our constitution and defend it against all enemies an oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation and no matter what changes in our world the charge in this oath is constant remember that as you walk out into the world because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing in fact we are at a significant turning point just look at the last several months and you know what i m talking about and look at several moments in our nation s history for perspective think about it there was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the world after the world before the attack on pearl harbor in 1941 and the world after the world before the civil rights act in 1964 and the world after the world before the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the world after some of these critical moments our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness and another turning point was september 11th 20 years ago this year when airplanes hit the twin towers and our pentagon when flight 90 3 crashed pennsylvania that day shaped your entire life and it shaped our entire nation it tested our systems our structures our very standing in the world well mitch shipman we are now entering the next era a new age a new ep with its own tests with it s own challenges and with its own opportunities the global pandemic you see of course has accelerated what was happening before and it has accelerated our world into a new era it has forever impacted our world it has forever influenced our perspective and if we weren t clear before we know now our world is interconnected our world is interdependent and our world is fragile just think a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months a gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard one country s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole earth shipment is the era we are in and it is unlike any era that came before so the challenge now the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats so let me share with you for example a personal experience a few years ago when i was in the united states senate i visited the uss scranton it was outside of san diego california and at the time i was also a member of the senate intelligence committee so when i was aboard the vessel i asked the officers i said hey tell me what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyber attacks and they me you know it s pretty simple equipment and experts well the way i see it my shipment you you you are those experts on the issue of cybersecurity foreign adversaries have their sights set on our military technology our intellectual property our elections our critical infrastructure the ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month well that warning shot in fact there have been many warning shots so we must defend our nation against these threats and at the same time we must make advances in things that you ve been learning things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics and things that will put our nation at strategic advantage and you will be the ones to do it you will be the ones to do it because the united states military is the best the bravest and the most brilliant and just think from walkie talkies to the internet to satellite navigation the united states military has been on the forefront of research development and technological advancement that is a point of american pride and as i look out at all of you i know you will build on that leadership and then of course there is climate change which is a very real threat to our national security and i look at you and i know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat you are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice you are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking base you are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power convert solar and wind energy into combat power and just ask any marine today would she rather carry twenty pounds of batteries or rolled up solar panel and i am positive she will tell you a solar panel and so would he the american people are depending on you the best the bravest the most brilliant we saw this during covid 19 when americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another in this era and you are confronting this threat our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible naval researchers also figured out how to use threed knitting machines to make masks naval labs monitored the spread of the disease and the marine corps and the navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future class of 2021 you are prepared for all of this you are prepared for any threat and you are prepared for this new era and it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here for those you will continue to learn but it s because of something more it s because of who each of you is it is because of who collectively you are so as i conclude today that s what i want to talk about i want to talk about you as vice president i ve come to know the united states navy quite well every day in fact i m surrounded by sailors and marines and your tradition and your history and i mean that literally so i often travel on marine too in fact that s how i arrived today my residence is on the grounds of the united states naval observatory my west wing office features a desk built by cbs from of the uss constitution my sermon in my office my ceremonial office was once occupied by the secretary of the navy and displayed there i have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander mid shipman sidney barber and so here s what i know mid shipment you are tireless you are ambitious you are a fierce fighting force you are ideals in the truest sense are the embodiment of american aspiration so hold on to that because in your career you may witness some of the worst of humanity but promise that you will never forget the best of who we are that you will never forget the you stand for duty honor loyalty fight for those ideals and fight for our democracy and remember our constitution is not only something to defend it is a guide it is a guide for your service it begins with three simple words the people not i our nation was designed to be a team sport and we are in this together so you know finally i ll just share with you on my way to the stadium this morning i stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague a great and courageous american senator john mccain and yes so most people don t know he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the yard admiral chuck larson that is the ultimate example of what i mean in it together so mid shipment throughout our history officers in the united states navy officers in the united states marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms today you will swear to do the same you are the next links in the chain and so mitch shipman when you stand to take the oath i want you to know that as we embark on this new era president joe biden and i our entire nation have great faith in you and we are proud of you so very very proud congratulations again may god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

the renminbi strengthened against the us dollar to reach 6 3858 on friday a record high since may 2018 but experts said the chinese currency s rapid appreciation may not last long as market forces will result in a two way fluctuation of the exchange rate the latest signals from policymakers indicated that china will let the market demand and supply relationship determine the rmb s value and appreciation is neither a tool to stimulate exports nor to offset the impact of rising commodity prices they said after the currency soared to multiyear highs the rmb has gained more than 10 percent over the past year buoyed by china s economic rebound from the covid 19 pandemic and foreign capital flows into the country a meeting between the people s bank of china the nation s central bank and participants in the foreign exchange market warned on thursday that any one way bet on the rmb should be avoided and predictions on the exchange rate would mislead the market china should stick to a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies in the long term said a statement issued on the central bank s website after the meeting a great deal of market and policy factors will impact on the forex market in the future and the rmb is likely to appreciate or depreciate no one can accurately predict the exchange rate it said the main risk of such a stronger yuan is that it hurts exports and therefore producers in the same way as high commodity prices during a period in which exports are still very important to china as western countries are recovering from covid 19 shocks said chris turner an economist with dutch bank ing the central bank would not intervene as long as the rmb s exchange rate is consistent with economic fundamentals and one way speculation remains contained said robin xing chief economist in china with morgan stanley reflecting this the so called countercyclical factor in the daily fixing a tool that the central bank uses to flatten foreign exchange market volatility has been neutral during recent fluctuations in the onshore rmb exchange rate against the us dollar xing added many analysts agreed that the rmb s value is primarily driven by economic fundamentals in which china still faces many challenges over the medium to long term implying that it is unlikely to see an outperforming currency liu guoqiang vice governor of the central bank pledged in an interview last week that china will maintain the exchange rate of the rmb at basically stable levels two way fluctuations either appreciation or depreciation will become the norm in the future with the exchange rate continuing to depend on market supply and demand as well as changes in global financial markets said liu the official statements suggested china s monetary authorities want to maintain a prudent policy and see the forex policy as being in line with a broad policy framework which includes economic growth prices jobs and financial stability said economists at commerzbank discussions have been heated recently on whether a strengthened rmb in terms of percentage gains against the dollar will offset the increase in commodity import prices following a senior central bank official s comments that rmb appreciation is a result of economic growth and the rising purchasing power of the currency amid monetary easing policy in major economies the impact should be minimal said turner who added that the chinese government needs multiple tools to limit the increase in production costs brought about by higher commodity prices which is partly due to the expected infrastructure projects resulting from aggressive stimulus measure in the united states it is possible for the pboc to let the yuan move by itself

in the months since hipocampo children s books has reopened to in person browsing a group of pre teens and teens have made the space a regular stop on their wanderings through the rochester n y neighborhood where it opened two years ago their relationship to the store is as new as the store itself but their ties to the owners go much deeper all were kindergarten students of co owner henry i padrón morales in the dual language immersion program at the nearby anna murray douglass academy school no 12 one is the son of padrón morales s business partner pamela bailie for bailie and padrón morales the bookstore s existence is a tribute to changes in the world of children s books they met through the school as padrón morales was headed toward retirement both excited at the existence of ownvoices children s books that were never on the shelves of bookstores when they were kids we were both seeing that there was starting to be a change in some of the literature that was coming out bailie said it was becoming a little more reflective of the many cultures and the many backgrounds of people in the united states that change took on particular significance for the two given the diversity of rochester where nearly 40 of the population is african american and almost 20 are latino so instead of retiring padrón morales teamed up with bailie to create a bookstore where they could celebrate books by authors about cultures reflected in their own community neither had any experience in bookselling but they knew picture books and early readers and most importantly they knew their community starting in 2017 they began planning the store and started scouting locations for the right spot time and again they came back to the neighborhood near the school the school sits atop the site where civil rights leaders frederick douglass and anna murray douglass made their home and the alleyways of the nearby streets are lined with murals honoring the deep heritage of the place one day padrón morales walked inside a storefront that was up for lease on a highly trafficked street in the neighborhood and knew it was the place to open the bookstore the plaque says it s an 1857 building and all of a sudden it hit me padrón morales said frederick douglass may have walked into this when it was an apothecary in his day he walked up and down this street how many places are there where there is a history that goes back to the industrial age where all these buildings were brick and mortar it gave me a nostalgic feeling it gave me a feeling of connection bailie and padrón morales originally hoped to open in november 2018 but their small business loans were held up by the government shutdown they opened in spring 2019 instead with board books picture books early readers chapter books middle grade and ya titles mixing in an abundant stock of multicultural and ownvoices books with classics and new releases but as they neared their first anniversary the pandemic ground their operations to a halt still they persevered and settled into a division of roles bailie handles logistics and finances while padrón morales works the counter and plans events and hit the targets in their business plan pre pandemic hipocampo drew customers by inviting authors artists and musicians who crafted storytimes performances and sing alongs during the pandemic padrón morales opened a covid safe micro school program in the bookstore that immediately attracted 20 applicants from which he picked four pupils emerging from the pandemic the store has enough sales foot traffic and demand that the co owners are adding some adult titles and preparing to make their first hire they are also looking to grow as readers themselves padrón morales is a nuyorican from brooklyn bailie is irish and turkish from belfast neither had read the new wave of ownvoices ya books until they opened hipocampo i didn t know that the whole ya world had developed into something so strong bailie said when you re reading these books it s so rare that you re just having one feeling you ve got this whole wide full range of emotions and feelings and thoughts i love it it feels more realistic now padrón morales and bailie want more hoping that publishers will continue to expand what they publish for the children they see taking those books down off the shelves at hipocampo for both owners those readers experiences are where everything begins and ends there s an energy we re seeing that comes at us when people walk in in how they feel the space padrón morales said we love that energy we love the physical composition of the brick and mortar we love the community dynamic that s occurring i don t mean to get mushy but we come at this from a perspective of love
forget about new protections for california kids cruising the internet there will be no new requirements for crime labs to process old rape kits and some households behind on their water bills won t get more time to pay them back before their pipes get shut off those were some of the more than 200 bills california lawmakers killed on may 20th in the rapid fire and often mysterious procedure known as the suspense file officially the procedure promotes fiscal responsibility allowing lawmakers to consider costly bills together and weigh their priorities but it s well known at the state capitol that the suspense file is also a political tool that allows the most powerful legislators to keep controversial bills from reaching the assembly or senate floor typically with no explanation and sometimes without a public vote it s driven by a hundred different factors some of which we can never explain and maybe the transparency is weak on said assemblymember lorena gonzalez the san diego democrat who chairs the appropriations committee but i ve never once had the speaker come to me and say this isn t politically feasible with more than 350 bills on the senate s suspense file and more than 500 on the assembly s the lobbying leading up to today is intense everybody but god himself has contacted me on a bill gonzalez said though she downplayed the role of politics one of her predecessors said the job is like being the speaker s henchman they can use the suspense file to prevent an idea they don t like from becoming law exact revenge on a fellow lawmaker or shield their colleagues from having to take a position on a controversial proposal you ve got to be prepared to take really tough decisions for the caucus former assemblymember mike gatto said on a recent podcast governors also try to bottle some things up in the suspense file gatto said adding that when he left office in 2016 then gov jerry brown thanked him for keeping legislation from reaching his desk the suspense file of course is not the only tool for slaying bills lawmakers can also kill them simply by doing nothing for the last two years the assembly has allowed policy committee chairpersons to decide whether to give bills a hearing that means they can silently snuff them just by not taking them up for a vote this is how democrats who control the legislature have killed some of the most progressive bills introduced this year including proposals to develop a single payer health care system ban fracking and levy a wealth tax it s also what doomed an attempt to repeal a ban on local soda taxes gov gavin newsom has said he will not sign tax increases this year with the state awash in covid 19 relief money from the federal government and taxes paid by wealthier residents benefiting from a booming stock market when you re enjoying a 76 plus billion and growing operating surplus i don t think it s the time to do tax increases newsom said last week as he presented his updated budget still one major tax increase survived the suspense file today a proposal to increase taxes on international corporations to fund homeless services here s a look at some key proposals that stalled in today s massive culling criminal justice a year after protests across the country over police accountability and racism lobbying by law enforcement groups effectively watered down or stopped a handful of bills aimed at policing the police a proposed requirement that background checks explore if law enforcement officers have been affiliated with hate groups in the past stalled amid opposition from the california correctional peace officers association a bill requiring police departments to pull in different agencies to investigate police shootings of armed people is on hold until next year the biggest police reform bill of the year which would allow the state to kick bad cops out of the profession for certain types of misconduct and make it easier for people to sue officers and departments for civil rights violations survived the suspense file but only after it was watered down the version that s moving ahead is more limited in when a person can sue the police a change the bill s author state sen steve bradford said was difficult to accept but the gardena democrat said in a statement compromise requires us to work together to find common ground for the second year in a row the appropriations committee killed a bill requiring law enforcement agencies to process their backlogged rape kits the california public defenders association argued the bill would take away resources to test other types of evidence byrhonda lyons and robert lewis housing an effort to streamline affordable housing funding by creating one place for developers to apply for tax credits bonds and subsidies is on hold until next year uc berkeley s terner center and the state auditor argued this approach would cut the cost and time it takes to build affordable housing but state treasurer fiona ma whose office would have given up some power called the overhaul risky assemblymember buffy wicks third attempt to create a registry making it easier to determine who owns rental housing died amid opposition from the california association of realtors which argued the registry would burden property owners the realtors a political powerhouse in sacramento spent nearly 350 000 on lobbying between january and march and also opposed a measure to curb evictions and another to help first time homebuyers by ending a mortgage interest deduction on second homes which died before they even got to the assembly appropriations committee manuela tobias poverty and inequality a proposal to shield more californians who are late on water bills from having their water shut off stalled in the face of opposition from municipal water agencies but hope is not lost for those late on water bills newsom wants to spend 1 billion to bail out consumers and providers crushed by water debt and another bill to create a water assistance program survived today s bloodbath a number of proposals aimed at using the tax system to help low income consumers also died including a bill to make parents without income eligible for california s tax credit for young children of as much as 1 000 a proposal to help low income workers maximize their tax refund by choosing from the last three years of income and a plan to create a state tax credit for employers who hire people who are disabled veterans on public assistance or formerly incarcerated for each legislative analysts questioned whether the benefits outweigh the cost to the state jackie botts health care insurance companies prevailed in killing a bill that would have allowed the state to require health plans to issue emergency payments to struggling health providers in public health crises the legislation was backed by doctors and dentists who said the pandemic left many medical and dental practices cash strapped because of fewer patient visits a bill to hire a chief school nurse at the state level also failed even though as calmatters reported last year california is one of only 10 states without someone in that position ana b ibarra and barbara feder ostrov environment an attempt to streamline permitting for residential solar systems died amid opposition from unions representing electrical workers environmental groups supported the bill that would have required cities and counties to establish online permitting and automated approvals for residential solar systems a response to the often sluggish permitting process and the associated costs that has caused consumers to cool toward adopting solar systems environmentalists also lost out with the stalling of a bill to require companies doing business in california with more than 1 billion in annual revenues to publicly report their greenhouse gas emissions from both direct sources such as manufacturing and indirect such as from their supply chain the bill s delay until next year shows just how much control corporate polluters still have in california the head of the california league of conservation voters said in a statement julie cart higher education legislation aimed at preventing universities from reducing students financial aid when they receive private scholarships is on hold until at least next year a bill that would have dedicated 20 million to expand mental health services to students attending the state s public colleges and universities also stalled but assemblymember kevin mccarty said he ll try to fund it through the state budget legislation to ensure support staff at california state university campuses get 5 merit raises failed amid opposition from university leaders another measure that stalled would have barred the university of california from entering into contracts with health providers that forbid uc medical staff from providing reproductive healthcare and gender affirming care for transgender patients it was pulled to give the uc until next year to establish its own policies said a spokesperson for the bill s author sen scott wiener of san francisco the proposal was also opposed by catholic hospitals which have partnerships with uc hospitals left to live another day is arguably the most consequential higher education bill a massive expansion of state financial aid felicia mello and mikhail zinshteyn broadband access and internet safety the pandemic induced shift to remote work and distance learning prompted a slate of proposals aimed at closing the digital divide two of them died today concern that kids can too easily drift into violent or inappropriate content online prompted a bill that would have prohibited features such as auto play videos and in app purchases unless parents opt in for their children but it died for a second year in a row even after being narrowed to address the tech industry s opposition to an earlier version jackie botts ben christopher and zayna syed calmatters reporters rachel becker nigel duara and jocelyn wiener contributed to this story

history repeats itself but do decades duplicate as hopes rise that the pandemics ebbing in the united states and europe visions of a second roaring twenties to match last century s post pandemic decade have proliferated months of lockdown and restrictions on social life have given way to dreams of a new era of frivolity and decadence for some it feels like party time in many parts of the world such thoughts are unthinkable india is engulfed in crisis the virus is raging in south america japan is grappling with a punishing new wave of cases and even in places where cases are falling and vaccinations are expanding deep wounds remain from more than a year of death illness and isolation covid 19 won t disappear more infectious variants are circulating herd immunity may be elusive long term health effects will linger there will be no hollywood ending but a coming summer and a soaring stock market have lifted optimism and fueled predictions of a new roaring twenties this time bill maher has suggested we do it without the depression at the end of it the new yorker joked that prohibition in the new roaring twenties should be on company mandated virtual happy hours madison avenue has turned up the heat suitsupply a men s fashion brand is running a suggestive ad campaign with writhing models and the tagline the new normal is coming summer travel is booming a summer of

20s both decades that follow closely on the heels on of worldwide pandemic could two 20s really roar do we all need to start buying flapper dresses and brushing up on our f scott fitzgerald some of the parallels are legitimate says nicholas christakis professor of sociology and medicine at yale university and author of apollo s arrow the profound and enduring impact of coronavirus on the way we live after an interim period of coping with the clinical psychological and economic shock of the virus he says we ll see an uplift this summer with a post pandemic period taking root by 2023 it will he says be a bit of a party understandably people will be very relieved when this is all finally over people have been cooped one way or another for a very long time christakis says we re going to see people relentlessly seeking out social opportunities in nightclubs and restaurants and bars and sporting events and musical concerts and political rallies we might see some sexual licentiousness some loosening of sexual mores such prognostications have tantalized many eager for the fabled liberation of a century ago what fitzgerald described as the most expensive orgy in history outside of the 1960s perhaps no decade looms larger in the collective imagination than the 1920s thanks in part to the emerging mass culture that captured the time the swinging speakeasies the harlem renaissance the first talkie in 1927 s the jazz singer over time the mythology has only grown glitzier see baz luhrmann gatsby 2013 there s truth in that portrait of the 20s but mainly to wealthier white americans the decade was punishing to farmers for the first time more people lived in cities membership surged for the ku klux klan which targeted african americans immigrants jews and catholics anyone who didn t meet its definition of a real american in 1921 one of the worst incidents of racial violence occurred the tulsa race massacre three years later the immigration act of 1924 restricted immigrants from asia and eastern europe the 1920s in short were not all they were cracked up to be we have today in the united states cheek by jowl prosperity and depression the author and civil rights activist w e b du bois wrote in 1926 it s not hard to see many of the same threads today racial injustice economic inequity convulsive technological change the 1921 campaign slogan of warren g harding a return to normalcy sounds very familiar and even appealing to those who have had it with the new normal forecasts on wall street of course vary the united nations last month raised its global economic forecast to 5 4 growth in 2021 while many analysts are predicting the pace to quicken in the months and years ahead tina fordham partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a disillusioned emancipated youth the young have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic on behalf of the older generation moore says there was a sense of that after the war and after the spanish flu the war was very much young people being sent off to die by an older generation they d been taught to trust but then felt very let down by whether the same response will happen in the aftermath of this pandemic is something to watch for the crisis is far from over christakis cautions we don t want to spike the ball at the 5 yard line he says but throughout history christakis sees a pattern common to prolonged calamity plagues are followed by boom times after the black death came the erosion of feudalism the roaring twenties is just a metaphor christakis says grief walks the streets during times of plague so people will rightly be relieved when this period of loss is behind us

rmb climbs to three year high against dollar china daily 09 28 may 29 2021 a teller counts cash at a bank branch in hangzhou capital of east china s zhejiang province the renminbi strengthened against the us dollar to reach 6 3858 on friday a record high since may 2018 but experts said the chinese currency s rapid appreciation may not last long as market forces will result in a two way fluctuation of the exchange rate the latest signals from policymakers indicated that china will let the market demand and supply relationship determine the rmb s value and appreciation is neither a tool to stimulate exports nor to offset the impact of rising commodity prices they said after the currency soared to multiyear highs the rmb has gained more than 10 percent over the past year buoyed by china s economic rebound from the covid 19 pandemic and foreign capital flows into the country a meeting between the people s bank of china the nation s central bank and participants in the foreign exchange market warned on thursday that any one way bet on the rmb should be avoided and predictions on the exchange rate would mislead the market china should stick to a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies in the long term said a statement issued on the central bank s website after the meeting a great deal of market and policy factors will impact on the forex market in the future and the rmb is likely to appreciate or depreciate no one can accurately predict the exchange rate it said the main risk of such a stronger yuan is that it hurts exports and therefore producers in the same way as high commodity prices during a period in which exports are still very important to china as western countries are recovering from covid 19 shocks said chris turner an economist with dutch bank ing the central bank would not intervene as long as the rmb s exchange rate is consistent with economic fundamentals and one way speculation remains contained said robin xing chief economist in china with morgan stanley reflecting this the so called countercyclical factor in the daily fixing a tool that the central bank uses to flatten foreign exchange market volatility has been neutral during recent fluctuations in the onshore rmb exchange rate against the us dollar xing added many analysts agreed that the rmb s value is primarily driven by economic fundamentals in which china still faces many challenges over the medium to long term implying that it is unlikely to see an outperforming currency liu guoqiang vice governor of the central bank pledged in an interview last week that china will maintain the exchange rate of the rmb at basically stable levels two way fluctuations either appreciation or depreciation will become the norm in the future with the exchange rate continuing to depend on market supply and demand as well as changes in global financial markets said liu the official statements suggested china s monetary authorities want to maintain a prudent policy and see the forex policy as being in line with a broad policy framework which includes economic growth prices jobs and financial stability said economists at commerzbank discussions have been heated recently on whether a strengthened rmb in terms of percentage gains against the dollar will offset the increase in commodity import prices following a senior central bank official s comments that rmb appreciation is a result of economic growth and the rising purchasing power of the currency amid monetary easing policy in major economies the impact should be minimal said turner who added that the chinese government needs multiple tools to limit the increase in production costs brought about by higher commodity prices which is partly due to the expected infrastructure projects resulting from aggressive stimulus measure in the united states it is possible for the pboc to let the yuan move by itself web editor liang jun bianji

vice president harris cites challenges of fragile world in speech to naval academy graduates share copy link copy good morning acting secretary thomas harker general david berger admiral mike gilda looking out at these mid shipment i know we are all filled with pride vice admiral it s sean buck captain tr buchanan faculty and staff thank you for educating such a fine crew alumni thank for the support you have shown over these years to this great institution and to my military aid lieutenant colonel frank mack who graduated in 2004 i m very proud to have you with me here today family and friends of these graduates thank you for the sacrifices you have already made and make and i also want to acknowledge kim and john johnson your son was taken far too soon and i promise you that he will not be forgotten and finally to the class of 2021 congratulations congratulations and look how far you ve come so you endured zero 530 pt and prone exams you excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises you enjoyed the fair at dillard s i know karaoke at harvest you guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated and you made it to this day you made it to this day and this day this day that is not only a commencement this day that is a commissioning and in a few minutes you will take an oath and it s actually the same oath i took as vice president an oath to support our constitution and defend it against all enemies an oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation and no matter what changes in our world the charge in this oath is constant remember that as you walk out into the world because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing in fact we are at a significant turning point just look at the last several months and you know what i m talking about and look at several moments in our nation s history for perspective think about it there was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the world after the world before the attack on pearl harbor in 1941 and the world after the world before the civil rights act in 1964 and the world after the world before the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the world after some of these critical moments our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness and another turning point was september 11th 20 years ago this year when airplanes hit the twin towers and our pentagon when flight 90 3 crashed pennsylvania that day shaped your entire life and it shaped our entire nation it tested our systems our structures our very standing in the world well mitch shipman we are now entering the next era a new age a new ep with its own tests with it s own challenges and with its own opportunities the global pandemic you see of course has accelerated what was happening before and it has accelerated our world into a new era it has forever impacted our world it has forever influenced our perspective and if we weren t clear before we know now our world is interconnected our world is interdependent and our world is fragile just think a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months a gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard one country s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole earth shipment is the era we are in and it is unlike any era that came before so the challenge now the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats so let me share with you for example a personal experience a few years ago when i was in the united states senate i visited the uss scranton it was outside of san diego california and at the time i was also a member of the senate intelligence committee so when i was aboard the vessel i asked the officers i said hey tell me what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyber attacks and they me you know it s pretty simple equipment and experts well the way i see it my shipment you you you are those experts on the issue of cybersecurity foreign adversaries have their sights set on our military technology our intellectual property our elections our critical infrastructure the ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month well that warning shot in fact there have been many warning shots so we must defend our nation against these threats and at the same time we must make advances in things that you ve been learning things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics and things that will put our nation at strategic advantage and you will be the ones to do it you will be the ones to do it because the united states military is the best the bravest and the most brilliant and just think from walkie talkies to the internet to satellite navigation the united states military has been on the forefront of research development and technological advancement that is a point of american pride and as i look out at all of you i know you will build on that leadership and then of course there is climate change which is a very real threat to our national security and i look at you and i know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat you are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice you are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking base you are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power convert solar and wind energy into combat power and just ask any marine today would she rather carry twenty pounds of batteries or rolled up solar panel and i am positive she will tell you a solar panel and so would he the american people are depending on you the best the bravest the most brilliant we saw this during covid 19 when americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another in this era and you are confronting this threat our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible naval researchers also figured out how to use threed knitting machines to make masks naval labs monitored the spread of the disease and the marine corps and the navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future class of 2021 you are prepared for all of this you are prepared for any threat and you are prepared for this new era and it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here for those you will continue to learn but it s because of something more it s because of who each of you is it is because of who collectively you are so as i conclude today that s what i want to talk about i want to talk about you as vice president i ve come to know the united states navy quite well every day in fact i m surrounded by sailors and marines and your tradition and your history and i mean that literally so i often travel on marine too in fact that s how i arrived today my residence is on the grounds of the united states naval observatory my west wing office features a desk built by cbs from of the uss constitution my sermon in my office my ceremonial office was once occupied by the secretary of the navy and displayed there i have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander mid shipman sidney barber and so here s what i know mid shipment you are tireless you are ambitious you are a fierce fighting force you are ideals in the truest sense are the embodiment of american aspiration so hold on to that because in your career you may witness some of the worst of humanity but promise that you will never forget the best of who we are that you will never forget the you stand for duty honor loyalty fight for those ideals and fight for our democracy and remember our constitution is not only something to defend it is a guide it is a guide for your service it begins with three simple words the people not i our nation was designed to be a team sport and we are in this together so you know finally i ll just share with you on my way to the stadium this morning i stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague a great and courageous american senator john mccain and yes so most people don t know he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the yard admiral chuck larson that is the ultimate example of what i mean in it together so mid shipment throughout our history officers in the united states navy officers in the united states marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms today you will swear to do the same you are the next links in the chain and so mitch shipman when you stand to take the oath i want you to know that as we embark on this new era president joe biden and i our entire nation have great faith in you and we are proud of you so very very proud congratulations again may god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

on main street in man west virginia a woman marched through the front door of uncle sam s loans a cavernous pawn shop packed with hunting bows fishing lures and camping supplies for the residents of this small appalachian town behind the counter hung the linchpin of uncle sam s business guns the woman flashed her credentials which revealed that she was an investigator with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the nation s gun industry watchdog she was here to make sure uncle sam s had cleaned up its act this was the atf s third inspection of uncle sam s in seven years the two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers at one point atf records show more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found a red flag for gun trafficking in both cases the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping uncle sam s of its license to sell guns according to atf records but agency officials decided to spare the shop issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules as the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014 she discovered that things had hardly improved sales records were incomplete the store failed to report required information to law enforcement and safety notices still weren t going out the inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors their decision issue yet another warning months later the atf learned that uncle sam s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme witnesses told the agency that steven adkins a longtime shop employee who d purchased a stake in the business had enlisted a host of people including a colleague s girlfriend and his brother in law to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions according to court records in reality the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay to play scheme at a local mine others were sold on the black market witnesses said one accomplice told investigators hundreds if not thousands of firearms had been trafficked through uncle sam s according to court records he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon another accomplice said he drove guns from uncle sam s to adkins s home where adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to august 2014 he was sentenced to 10 months in prison no one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme everybody knew where to get a firearm adkins said roger d b muncy whose father founded uncle sam s in 1975 we re all human but you don t send guns out the back door the atf is facing intense scrutiny as the senate considers president joe biden s pick for the agency s first permanent director in six years the confirmation of david chipman a former atf agent who has advocated stricter gun laws is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the white house to clamp down on easy access to firearms in one of the most sweeping examinations of atf inspection records the trace and usa today found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as uncle sam s and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the usa the trace and usa today s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries gun sellers fear crack down from biden s nominee for atf read more reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2 000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017 the reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct in many cases when the atf caught dealers breaking the law the agency issued warnings sometimes repeatedly and allowed the stores to operate for months or years others are still selling guns to this day more than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results more than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them dozens made false statements in official records a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases a florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot and an arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he d failed the background check because of an active restraining order in ohio one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times another was missing some 600 firearms a pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the atf but the store was allowed to remain in business and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members including his 7 year old half brother the reports were obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit by the gun control group brady and shared with the trace and usa today reporters who conducted an independent analysis the reports detail inspections of brick and mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers including home based sellers independent mom and pops and big box retailers such as walmart and dick s sporting goods others cover gun manufacturers and importers investigate read this story at the trace the data is extensive but may not be comprehensive the agency provided brady roughly 2 000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters warning conferences and license revocations over the two year span from july 2015 through june 2017 however annual fact sheets published by the atf include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 a period that overlaps with the brady documents the atf repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating a single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if atf officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations in the vast majority of the cases analyzed by the trace and usa today the atf gave violators the lightest penalty available a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to reduce violent crime and protect the public the agency revoked a gun dealer s license in less than 3 of cases gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear one owner told an atf investigator that he was busy and didn t give a s the agency records show another said he did not like being told what to do the owner of a pawn shop in northeastern kansas became very belligerent and hostile when questioned about falsifying records shaking his finger in the investigator s face as he told her to do her job and stop messing with him the atf allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives headquartered in washington d c is the main line of defense against firearms ending up in the black market rich clement bloomberg via getty images joseph bisbee a retired atf agent in seattle said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity there s really no teeth to the laws and gun dealers know that he said they can see that nobody gets prosecuted that nobody gets held accountable and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it the problems extend high into the management ranks of atf the trace and usa today s review found that the managers of on the ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments reporters identified 138 reports in which atf officials acknowledged that a dealer s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses the agency revoked 56 of those licenses just over 40 a majority were granted lesser penalties ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters in the reports atf officials justified backing off by citing the dealer s age recent health problems intentions to retire and in one case affluent clientele one dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year another because he had been in business for decades sometimes the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue in 2017 an inspector advocated pulling the license for back acre gun works after reporting the gun shop west of orlando florida had falsified records related to the transfer of an ar 15 style rifle a supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning noting substantial legal liabilities because the inspection had been conducted prematurely current and former atf officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency s enforcement powers some also say the atf has increasingly adopted an industry friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority tweet facebook

shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much quote icon they hardly do any inspections and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much said mark jones who held various supervisory positions at the atf before retiring in 2012 the proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across america ripe for targeting by criminals kris brown brady s president said the atf bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity and americans every day pay the price brown said particularly black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers goal is to gain compliance not punish the coronavirus pandemic protests against police brutality and the election of biden spurred americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020 shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the atf can adequately police such a booming industry the most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands said john crecca a former atf inspector who worked in new york and pennsylvania before retiring in 2011 crecca recalled the case of bull s eye shooter supply a gun store in tacoma washington that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 beltway sniper attacks in which two gunmen armed with a bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people one of the beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from bull s eye the shop hadn t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling a subsequent atf inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns bull s eye settled the lawsuit for 2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings in the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license the process is slow often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns sometimes the atf holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory reports show the atf is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market the agency s weaknesses have prompted illinois new jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs in illinois the atf held warning conferences with 1st class firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of waukegan had failed to conduct background checks kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out of state residents records show allowed to remain in business 1st class firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the u s from mexico according to court records inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st class firearms for 12 more violations this time agency officials determined that the store s license should be revoked according to records one supervisor railed against the owner craig bricco for displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees who ran the store while he was working another job during the day have tips about inspections at gun stores contact us at gunstoreinspections thetrace org email us i got bamboozled bricco said there wasn t much i could do instead of revoking his license bricco said the atf allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer s license after that period but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer he rebranded as 1st class ammo and transferred the shop s leftover gun inventory to himself a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales in much of the country private sales require no background checks in january 2016 1st class ammo shared a facebook post directing people to gunbroker com where bricco was selling four sig sauer pistols so it s a private sale one facebook user asked yes all private sales 1st class ammo responded you can see them on display in the ammo store some current and former atf officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers

defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases brandon said brandon who now works in sales for a ballistics technology firm that contracts with the atf and law enforcement said the agency focuses its limited resources on the 1 doing it wrong in an emailed response to questions atf spokesman andre miller portrayed the penalties as tools to guide dealers into correcting violations and ensure future compliance he said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide the nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as atf s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action miller said dealers inspected once every seven years a division of the justice department the atf is responsible for policing the 78 000 gun dealers manufacturers and importers in the u s it employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn t have them the goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years but federal data shows the agency has averaged 15 of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019 this means dealers were visited about once every seven years of all the inspections during that decade at least a third 35 500 found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws the agency data shows more than 81 of violators received no penalty or a written warning the atf sought revocation of only 580 violators or 1 6 in the 2020 fiscal year as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations

licenses revoked tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records according to the reports analyzed by the trace and usa today former atf officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales but even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes whenever you hear people say there s plenty of laws on the books there really aren t what there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper said scot thomasson the atf s former chief of public affairs but what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection former atf officials attributed the agency s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability over the past 35 years gun groups have successfully pressured congress to limit the frequency of inspections restrict atf from consolidating and computerizing records and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers licenses away in 1986 the national rifle association successfully lobbied for the passage of the firearm owners protection act which prevents the atf from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year after 9 11 congress required that the atf audit each of the nation s 9 400 explosives dealers once every three years effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections the number of gun dealer inspections plunged falling from an average of nearly 12 000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7 000 a year in the 2000s atf is a very small agency a very unpopular agency and as a result there are a lot of people trying to push them around said howard wolfe a former atf supervisor who oversaw inspections in pittsburgh pennsylvania until he retired in 2006 wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the atf s inspection goals there was no way wolfe said people went years without being inspected and that s a big problem because how do you know how somebody s doing if you don t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records atf investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by the trace and usa today one particularly taxing case in houston took 995 hours the equivalent of half a year of workdays the investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director who cited the length of time taken to complete the assignment in another case in kansas a pawn shop transferred an ak 47 type rifle and a glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon court records indicate in february 2016 he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of newton and hesston an atf inspector visited a pawn shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper ids sold a handgun to a self identified domestic abuser and hadn t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers according to an agency report the atf downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business had the atf gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act it might have prevented a mass shooting said david morantz an attorney who represented one of the hesston shooting victims surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop the lawsuit resulted in a 2 million settlement the shop is now closed teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney if

happens quote icon if licensees knew that atf was going to show up like clockwork they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance she said but right now there s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens the size of the atf s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades in early 2016 after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in san bernardino california the obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly 12 3 million to add 120 atf investigators the republican controlled congress balked with one gop member of the house appropriations committee saying lawmakers would not support the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous second amendment rights of americans b todd jones a former u s attorney who served as the atf s last senate confirmed leader before resigning in 2015 said that despite the 20 plus years of regulatory handcuffs investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight we did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders said jones who is now chief disciplinary officer for the nfl it s like setting up a speed trap you re not going to stop everyone and if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it but what s the alternative no regulation at all during delays guns end up in wrong hands the atf investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests they can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties known as adverse actions but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations who make the final call the trace and usa today found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions for example at the louisville field division which covers kentucky west virginia and southern indiana reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer s violations warranted revocation nine of those recommendations were approved by the division s industry operations director in contrast the industry operations director for the seattle field division which covers washington oregon idaho alaska hawaii and guam approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators jim zammillo a former atf deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010 said the justice department s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found the guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the atf share this story the increased oversight led to greater standardization zammillo said but it also caused consternation among field division heads they viewed it like i m the sheriff this is my department and i m going to run it the way that i want to zammillo said john jarowski a former industry operations director in st paul minnesota offered another explanation saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators inspectors go in and they want the kill they want the scalp on their belt jarowski said proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years u s attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the atf many times when the u s attorney steps in he d say this dog won t hunt and they d drop it jarowski said so you have to think about spending your resources wisely in many areas of civil and criminal law defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior when it comes to gun sellers congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully forcing the atf to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them jack dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016 when the atf returned in 2017 it uncovered four additional violations including making false statements in required records a report shows a notice to customers entering jack and dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas lets the public know they can carry firearms inside evert nelson usa today network the false statements charge stemmed from the case of a fort riley army soldier who d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop according to a police report the soldier 20 was underage for handgun purchases in kansas he had had a friend fill out the paperwork atf records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke jack dick s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase including when the friend paid using the soldier s credit card the investigator was overruled by higher ups who said it wasn t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card the atf decided to give jack dick s another written warning the owner of the shop declined to comment for this article in 2017 and 2020 the shop released surveillance photos and video on its facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime when the atf does decide to revoke a dealer s license the agency s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind

inspection that uncovered 13 violations six of them repeated according to an atf report the shop had failed to report multiple sales falsified forms and sold guns to people who d self identified as being prohibited it failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees which is illegal the report indicates investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases selling weapons to stand ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed it took the atf 16 months to revoke jc s license during that time according to court records the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon officials cite dealer ignorance to justify leniency investigators do not carry badges or guns and have no arrest authority they carry an atf photo credential instead gun store owners offered the atf a litany of excuses to explain away violations the agency spared a nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was very busy and overwhelmed a pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales during the last inspection in 2016 the owner told an atf investigator he meant to file the reports but did not get around to it felex yukhtman said he trusted the wrong people to manage his small gun manufacturing business in bradenton florida yukhtman s company gun point specializes in building custom ars in 2017 an atf supervisor upheld an inspector s recommendation to shut yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations they included the possession of illegal machine guns later seized by agents yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms he said in an interview the supervisor criticized yukhtman for having shown a pattern of repeated violations despite the atf educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008 the industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned yukhtman in for another warning conference yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the atf for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes they re not there to take your license or make your life miserable yukhtman said the less work they have to do at your store the less time they have to be there the better it is for them our subscribers make this reporting possible please consider supporting investigative

a photograph along with a four page form containing basic business and biographical information the form also requires applicants to check a box to indicate whether they have a felony conviction were ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms the price of a firearms license ranges from 30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as 3 000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades the license held by many retail gun dealers costs 200 for the first three years and 90 for every renewal applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test the atf instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business still atf officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency a dealer in pounding mill virginia avoided a warning conference after expressing his apparent shock according to a report at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back to back handgun purchases the national shooting sports foundation the gun industry s trade group works with the atf to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking by and large firearm retailers are law abiding and follow local state and federal authorities said mark oliva a national shooting sports foundation spokesman we re members of our community mom and pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe the foundation recruits consultants and former atf inspectors to put shops through mock inspections for 750 the organization will run a full day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings it also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders which oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year but rich marianos a former atf assistant director said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible in 2020 it spent 4 5 million on lobbying more than twice as much as the national rifle association which spent 2 2 million according to opensecrets org a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics they re like the nra marianos said never once have they said the atf needs more money help support or resources oliva disputes that characterization he provided confidential records of the group s lobbying of congress in recent years to add millions for atf s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the department of justice postscript the legacy of uncle sam s the call that started the unraveling of the gun trafficking operation at uncle sam s in west virginia came in april 2015 the girlfriend of a former employee contacted an atf agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store s records as the purchaser of shotguns rifles and a pistol according to court records she later told an atf agent that steven adkins had paid her 75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person it was a scheme adkins had been running for at least six years and he d kept it hidden from the atf even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe after being indicted in late 2015 adkins told the atf that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store s founder roger d muncy according to court records adkins claimed muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through adkins estimated that 70 of the gun sales at uncle sam s were illegal the case reverberated across the small town of man where adkins and muncy were serving on the city council in 2008 the city had renamed a street in muncy s honor adkins pleaded guilty in 2016 and the atf pulled uncle sam s gun license adkins who has since been released from prison declined requests to be interviewed for this article muncy was never charged but the revocation didn t stop him from profiting from guns after losing the license to sell firearms at uncle sam s he rented the store to a state trooper who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location the arrangement lasted until july 2019 when the two parties had a falling out in his testimony muncy denied wrongdoing in the adkins case he went on to operate uncle sam s as a pawn shop until he died in december at the age of 68 his wife died four days later since then the day to day management of the store has fallen to their son roger d b muncy who hopes to get back in the gun business the day my daddy and mommy died i was calling alcohol tobacco firearms wanting to know if i was able to get a firearms license he said they said i need to file my application for this project usa today partnered with the trace a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to improving public understanding of gun violence increasing accountability and identifying solutions
on june 23 2020 i sent an email to marianne b leese the senior historian of the historical society of rockland county i had what i hoped was an easy question to answer advertisement who the hell was jackie jones two days earlier on the longest day of the year i had ridden a bicycle over the newly opened bike path on governor mario m cuomo bridge from my home in southern westchester county after passing through nyack and up to haverstraw i d climbed up to harriman state park and rode nearly all the way to the top of a local peak on foot i d climbed up to the top of a creaking old fire tower at the summit the view from on top of jackie jones mountain was spectacular advertisement courtesy tony ortega the year before i d noticed that an arkansas man named doug melton whose hobby is ascending county summits had done an analysis of lidar data laser ranging and determined that for years the wrong peak had been designated the highest point in rockland county advertisement with his analysis melton determined that rockhouse mountain was not 1 283 feet high but only 1 271 95 feet making it 5 55 feet lower than nearby jackie jones mountain at 1 277 5 feet a website called peakbagger com a major arbiter for the country s high pointers made the change to its database as far as peakbagger was concerned jackie jones mountain was now supreme advertisement i d recently begun my own pursuit of bagging county high points but with a twist riding there on a bicycle i ve ascended 20 of them in new york new jersey and connecticut including all five new york city boroughs in a single day s ride but none of them provided such a breathtaking vista as jackie jones mountain and as i left to ride down the mountain and go the long way home over bear mountain bridge i couldn t get one thought out of my mind who was the mountain named after initially ms leese said she couldn t find anything in a book of history about the park and when she checked with a former park employee who knew the area well he confirmed for me that no one knows who jackie jones was or how the mountain came to bear the name jackie jones advertisement i turned to a new york state historian who was similarly stumped but he was kind enough to check with his federal counterpart who pointed out that there was another peak a few miles away named tom jones mountain perhaps there was a jones family among local early settlers he suggested on a website about the history of the nearby town of stony point i found that a jones family had been particularly prominent in the area but nothing about a jackie several weeks later marianne leese sent another message she managed to find a 1992 document put out by the palisades interstate park commission that said the mountain had probably been named for a local resident john r jones or his son john jr who had lived on the north side of the mountain in sandyfield a tiny hamlet that had been wiped out when a dam was built to create nearby lake welch in the 1940s advertisement now that i had a possible name i was able to find more information about john r jones of sandyfield he had been born in 1817 in haverstraw or stony point and had married highlyann babcock when john was about 24 and highlyann was about 20 they began having children adelia margaret and william all grew into adulthood their next child hiram named after highlyann s younger brother was born in 1849 but died only a few years later in 1853 then they had mary john jr harriet martha and finally sarah in 1862 nine children over 21 years and with 19th century health care they seemed fortunate to have lost only one of the nine while in childhood according to the 1992 document cultivating the soil in sandyfield was a tough prospect subsistence farming that would have required other work to make life sustainable at some point the jones men had given it up and had taken up stone masonry they became known locally for harvesting fieldstones that were used in construction and examples of their work can still be found throughout the area advertisement highlyann died in 1886 and john 10 years later in 1896 the first instance i could find in local newspapers of the name jackie jones mountain occurred 31 years later in 1927 but there was nothing in the 1992 article that explained how john r jones of sandyfield had come to have the mountain named after him or whether there was any evidence that he was known by that name and i soon found out i wasn t the only person who had been looking for him advertisement in 2010 alexandra wren then 19 went on a hike in harriman state park in search of her family s past following a description in a newly published park guide she hiked on a path called beech trail until she found a trailside cemetery twenty years before an eagle scout named leroy babcock jr had refurbished the forgotten little burial ground repairing headstones and reinforcing them with metal frames a small plaque bore witness to leroy s work the graves were of john r jones his wife highlyann and their 3 year old son hiram nearby were the headstones of two civil war soldiers and members of the new york 6th heavy artillery known as the anthony wayne guard after a local revolutionary war hero john strickland a father of eight who had died of typhoid fever in 1863 at 45 and his brother in law timothy youmans who died at 35 on april 7 1865 just two days before the end of the war timothy i would learn was highlyann s second cousin when she spotted the stones alexandra used her mobile phone to call her father gordon who was busy working as rockland county s director of fire and emergency services advertisement gordon wren standing where he did as a 20 year old taking admission money to the fundraiser at burgess meredith s estate in 1966 courtesy tony ortega i hope this is important he told her it is she said and told him what she was looking at the graves of john and highlyann jones he told her she was looking at her great great great great grandparents advertisement he told that story to the genealogical society of rockland county in 2013 and it was reported in the rockland county times which turned up on a search gordon retired in 2018 but i found an email address for alexandra who is now 30 and runs a photography business i sent her an email explaining my interest in her family history gordon then called me and confirmed that john r jones the sandyfield farmer was his great great great grandfather he believed that jones was the jackie jones the mountain had been named after although he had no documentation of it the answer to where the mountain had gotten its name was not on its north side for the correct answer i had to look south gordon has lived in the area his entire life and could still remember his older relatives in the 1950s speaking with a local mountain dialect back then when the first bridge across the tappan zee was just being built the differences between the two places small rockland county with its mountains and new york city to the south were much more pronounced and things that were unique about the area had not yet been lost advertisement gordon worked in firefighting his entire career and became rockland county s chief fire instructor in 1977 he was named director of the county s emergency services in 1995 and served in that role until his retirement i could hardly have found someone more rooted to rockland county or more familiar with its every nook and cranny gordon was involved in local historical societies and he led hikes through the backwoods he was anxious to share his own search for local history and we bonded quickly over several phone calls discussing the mountain and his family advertisement a couple of weeks after i first made contact with him i emailed gordon with some news i m sure neither one of us expected while continuing to search for some actual documentation providing a link between his great great great grandfather and jackie jones mountain i had stumbled on a newspaper article in the jan 23 1896 issue of the rockland county messenger it was about john r jones and how he had died whoa gordon said when i told him about it advertisement according to the messenger in 1896 john r jones s daughter who lived with him was becoming increasingly concerned about the state of his mind the article didn t name the daughter but his youngest sarah would have been about 31 in 1896 john himself was 79 and his wife highlyann would have been dead for 10 years it was january and that means cold and dark days john was acting strange complaining that poverty was going to ruin them when sarah if it was sarah knew that the family was actually doing fairly well her father owned two large farms and a woodland lot another daughter living in jersey city was said to be worth 150 000 on wednesday jan 15 john said he was losing his mind and tried to give his daughter 15 telling her to go spend the winter somewhere else or she might not live through it she refused advertisement the next morning he asked her to go to stony point to take care of some business for him while she was gone john r jones strung a rope from the rafters of his barn and hanged himself the housekeeper a miss susie topping found him and fetched the neighbors when the daughter came home she was overcome with the news that greeted her the messenger reported advertisement an inquest found that it was suicide i could find no further mention of john r jones in local newspapers and there was no mention that he had ever been known as jackie or that a mountain had been named after him he appeared instead simply to be a distraught and somewhat obscure 79 year old local man who had sent his daughter away one january morning so he could end his life advertisement i was back at square one where did jackie jones mountain get its name but then another chance occurrence stumbling upon another article in an old newspaper made me realize that for some weeks now i d simply been looking in the wrong place the answer to where the mountain had gotten its name was not on its north side where lake welch was and the former village of sandyfield for the correct answer i had to look south to a small new york valley that had been saddled with an unseemly reputation the article i found was in a 1934 issue of the rockland county times and it praised the work being done by local volunteer firefighters advertisement about halfway into the short article listing accomplishments by the local fire crews there was this passage the fire rangers under command of john dempsey of suffern met and conquered a forest fire sunday that would have wiped out the jackie jones farm near camp hill the property owned by the heirs of the late james a smith the house the original part had dutch doors and they told us the front door lock was from the old rockland county jail jane lemkin camp hill was a reference to a protuberance that had obtained its name because revolutionary war hero anthony wayne had camped his troops there after coming up from haverstraw the same anthony wayne that the 6th heavy artillery of timothy youmans and john strickland had been named after advertisement the 1934 newspaper article suggested that near to camp hill there was a jackie jones farm that was well known enough that it still went by that name even after it had been acquired by a james a smith who had passed it down to his heirs i sent the article to marianne leese and she agreed that it was promising she pulled out an 1876 map of rockland county and found that on an otherwise mostly empty parcel just north of camp hill there was a lone house it was labeled j j jones she then pulled up a current map and found that very close to that same location today there is a large stately house that was listed as being built in 1865 and was probably older she said checking real estate listings i found that the houses around it were all built in the 1970s and the 1980s when the original farm had been subdivided advertisement the 1865 house seemed like it could very well have been the j j jones house on the 1876 map as well as the jackie jones farm mentioned in the 1934 article to confirm it i began tracing ownership of the house from the current day back in time grateful that rockland county s land records were relatively easy to access online marianne meanwhile emailed me that she had managed to figure out the full name of the j j jones listed on the 1876 map we seemed to be getting close advertisement the worse place in the country the rev david cole called it writing in 1884 about a crossroads that was about halfway along the 14 miles between suffern a town on the new jersey state line with belching ironworks and haverstraw the port town on the hudson in 1816 an enterprising nail cutter by the name of michael leyden who also spelled his name laden realized that the midway point of that journey for the teamsters hauling goods back and forth between suffern and haverstraw would be a promising place to put a watering hole his store and tavern also attracted mountain people who found that laden was interested in their handmade products as payment for the food and drink he was selling he took their handmade baskets and bowls so he could sell them in new york city and although he left in 1836 to return to manhattan the crossroads had already taken on the name ladentown and his tavern was already a local institution with an unsavory reputation sodom cole says it was called by some advertisement ladentown was a favorite stopping place for teamsters on their journeys to and from the river and as liquor could there be had in abundance the village soon came to possess an unenviable reputation he wrote but the good reverend assured his readers that by the time of his writing the hamlet has long ere this outgrown its bad reputation one way the locals took on ladentown s wide open ways was to counter it by building a church by 1865 laden s original property had been acquired by a man named john j secor who set aside a parcel for the erection of the methodist episcopal church cole in his 1884 history of rockland county not only lists the founders and original trustees of the church crediting them with helping to clean up ladentown but also notes the institution s then current stewards a d d johnson and a man who owned a large farm in the area about two miles to the northeast of the ladentown crossroads his name was jacob j jones advertisement it was marianne who told me the name and said the church steward in cole s history was the same j j jones whose house was shown on the 1876 map we were now quickly putting together an outline of the farm s history up to the present day jones had acquired it at some point before 1865 and he had lived on it until he died the day after christmas in 1908 jacob j jones perhaps one of the longest lived and best known residents of the ladentown section died at his home on saturday last aged 83 years 11 months and 14 days the rockland county times noted on jan 2 1909 advertisement as the 1934 newspaper article suggested the jacob jones farm had eventually come into the possession of james a davis the former manager of the west shore gas company in haverstraw and a real estate investor whose holdings included the jacob jones estate his obituary noted after he died suddenly on aug 2 1933 at 74 his wife eleanor then sold the former jacob jones farm in 1936 to a woman named lillie mayer who with her husband arthur owned the farm for the next 30 years arthur mayer was a legendary film distributor who was so well known for his anecdotes about early hollywood he and lillie spent much of the time in their later years touring colleges with their tales of movie lore a short documentary was made about them arthur and lillie in 1975 and was nominated for an oscar lillie and arthur mayer who owned the jackie jones farm from about 1933 to 1978 via ucla advertisement two years before that in 1973 jane lemkin went to meet arthur and lillie mayer for the first time she had been told about them by a friend who had house sat the mayer farm for several years the mayers were in new york city or lecturing at colleges most of the year and they needed someone to live in the house year round and keep it up her friend encouraged jane to apply for the job and she can still remember her first trip to the house which at that time was surrounded by land not other houses and was quite secluded there was a swimming pool at that time built close to the house and she was taken there for the interview arthur was sitting out there by the pool stitch stark naked and he invited us to go in so i took off my clothes and jumped in jane told me with a laugh when i spoke to her on the telephone recently advertisement she remembers him cracking a joke about how her calves identified her as good peasant stock they got the job and jane says her children grew up in the house after three years house sitting for the mayers the house was sold to developer vincent giffuni who asked them to stay in the house as he subdivided the farm putting in new streets and houses finally 15 years after that memorable interview by the pool jane s family left the house in 1988 we loved it she says when we moved in there was just this huge expanse of land the house the original part had dutch doors and they told us the front door lock was from the old rockland county jail we would find things like bayonets on the property it was paradise we used to hike up to the top of cheesecote mountain jane says and she remembers that arthur was angry that a communication tower had been built on top of it which arthur said was land he owned they didn t ask me he would say advertisement among the visitors to the house that lemkin remembered were the mayers grandchildren including a young shelley mayer who today happens to be my state senator as house sitters jane s family not only kept the house in shape but also the things in it which included antique furniture and also photo books one of which included a snapshot of eleanor roosevelt in a white outfit at a lawn party at the house playwright maxwell anderson was inspired by rockland s geography in particular the high tor a high point on the palisades towering over the hudson river that overlooks haverstraw she says all of that was taken away in 1978 when giffuni took possession of the house but continued to allow jane to live there advertisement she remembers looking up the location of the house and seeing that it had previously been owned by a j j jones but she didn t know that the land had at one time been known as jackie jones farm and she didn t know if there was a connection to the mountain she agreed with marianne leese that the house was older than the 1865 date in real estate listings the mayers thought it went back to 1810 she told me advertisement in 1941 five years after lillie mayer acquired the jacob jones farm her husband arthur signed a deal to distribute an unusual and controversial quasi documentary put together by two of his rockland county neighbors john steinbeck lived for several years in the area and the 1941 quasi documentary the forgotten village was his attempt to portray a remote mexican village that is dealing with a typhoid epidemic in a battle between traditional superstitions and modern medicine the film used actual rural mexicans as its cast and the story is narrated in voiceover steinbeck had originally wanted spencer tracy to do the narration but mgm wouldn t let him out of his contract so steinbeck asked another ladentown local to do the job burgess meredith who lived only about a mile from arthur and lillie mayer on camp hill road meredith had been lured to rockland county by a playwright friend maxwell anderson who at one point in the 1930s was probably the most successful writer on broadway anderson was inspired by rockland s geography in particular the high tor a high point on the palisades towering over the hudson river that overlooks haverstraw in 1936 anderson wrote a comic fantasy with that name about a contrary gadfly named van van doren who owns the peak which is also haunted by 16th century dutch sailors the play s original production opened that year in cleveland with burgess meredith playing van doren advertisement hell you don t need money pap worked that out all you need s a place to sleep and something to eat i ve never seen the time i couldn t find a meal on the mountain here rainbow trout jugged hare something in season right around the zodiac van doren tells his sweetheart about how they can live on the mountain without money she remains understandably skeptical so van doren at least temporarily throws her over for a dutch ghost it s a quirky play three years later meredith starred as george in the 1939 film version of steinbeck s of mice and men so they were already close friends when the forgotten village was made in 1941 the film ran into problems however when the state s board of censors kept it from its scheduled opening in september for indecent and inhuman scenes that featured a mother breastfeeding and later while she is grimacing in childbirth arthur mayer appealed the ban and managed to get it lifted for a nov 18 opening at the belmont theater on 48th street to mixed reviews but steinbeck was always fond of it despite the criticism during my marriage to paulette goddard i saw john steinbeck often and under happy conditions meredith wrote in his 1994 memoir so far so good paulette and i were living in my country house in rockland county twenty minutes north of the george washington bridge the steinbecks came to visit us there and we went to his home in manhattan during the postwar period i witnessed the disintegration of his marriage to gwyn and the growing up of his children later he rented a country house near me a fine hand built home belonging to the artist henry varnum poor advertisement meredith s own marriage to goddard ended in 1949 he married for the third time in 1950 to dancer kaja sundsten and continued to live just down the road from the mayers by 1966 tensions over development in the area led local residents to incorporate as the village of pomona to help pay for the process burgess meredith agreed to hold a fundraiser a horse show on his land at the base of the property a gate still stands where people lined up to go inside for the show and a 20 year old local fireman was stationed there to make sure and get 10 from each of them a large amount in 1966 on a recent chilly march afternoon gordon wren stepped over some dried branches and rocky ground in that same place in order to show me where he stood taking money from people who had come to see the horse show on burgess meredith s property advertisement i think i had only been a firefighter for about a year gordon said remembering the details of that day for marianne leese and me as the three of us after trading emails and phone calls for a few weeks got together for the first time to look at some of the places we d been researching i was only 20 but they had me count the money he said with a laugh meredith invited him up to the house and showed him into an upstairs room so he could have some quiet while he counted the day s proceeds he asked me if i wanted a drink then he brought me a rye and ginger in a giant tumbler i said thank you mr meredith and he said don t call me mister and he said when i was done to come down to the pool for another drink advertisement gordon was still tickled about it 55 years later with marianne and gordon i went by the mayer house the meredith house and other landmarks in the ladentown camp hill area including a mural at the local post office that depicts the area during the revolutionary war the 1934 newspaper article called jacob j s land the jackie jones farm and his obituary had said he was one of the best known figures in the area i could tell that gordon was disappointed that john r jones his ancestor in sandyfield now seemed less likely to be the source of the mountain s name and marianne still mindful that the 1992 document suggested that john r jones was the source asked me if i really had enough evidence to point instead to jacob j jones of camp hill advertisement i laid out the case for her and gordon the 1934 newspaper article called jacob j s land the jackie jones farm and he was identified in rev cole s 1884 book as a steward of the methodist church which cole credited with helping to improve the area s reputation his obituary meanwhile had said he was one of the best known figures in the area that all suggested to me the kind of person who might get a mountain named after him that was only three miles from the location of his farm yes the place where john r jones lived on the north side of the mountain sandyfield was even closer to the peak but his suicide and the fact that very little else was known about him and that there was no evidence tying him to the name jackie made it seem less likely that the landmark had been named after him advertisement but marianne was right there were still gaps in the story despite what seemed like pretty good evidence that jacob j jones who had lived from 1825 to 1908 in the area that eventually became the village of pomona new york with the help of burgess meredith s 1966 fundraiser was indeed the jackie jones whose name was on rockland county s highest peak we hadn t been able to locate jacob s gravesite which his obituary said had been near his homestead jane lemkin didn t remember any headstones near the house and she suggested it might have been bulldozed with the subdivision of the farm there was a jacob jones whose grave was a little farther south and that gordon and i tracked down but that jacob had died in 1851 and wasn t the person referred to in the 1934 newspaper article the current owner of the jacob j jones lillie arthur mayer house was at first excited to talk to me about the place which he had bought in 2018 he said its original history went all the way back to 1760 and he had been restoring some of its original features but then he stopped returning my calls and so i thought it best to preserve his privacy courtesy tony ortega advertisement i wanted to know more of course and perhaps someday more information will turn up that helps explain how jacob j jones of camp hill got a mountain named after him that now thanks to doug melton has taken its true place as a county s highest point and another summer is coming the bridge beckons i figure i ll ride back to rockland county and up to lake welch and hike the beech trail this time not with the goal of standing on a peak but so i can visit john highlyann hiram and their cousins tim and john and then swing down to burgess meredith park in pomona i hope

the other day a friend of mine sent me a brief video clip where an israeli soldier was seen crushing the head of a palestinian child on hearing the shrieks of the little boy who couldn t have been more than six or years old my blood curdled i couldn t stomach watching the footage to the end i later learned that the child had died while reciting the kalima such inhumanity makes a mockery of creation itself yet it seems that it is the fate of the palestinians to live in such misery jewish history also delivered them the holocaust which represents an indelible blot on mankind thus many european countries have criminalised holocaust denial but then israel is mercilessly committing its own atrocities against women and children if violence can escalate at such rapid pace as we saw earlier this month one can only imagine the sheer devastation if a major war broke out two armies in combat is one thing targeting unarmed civilians is something else no matter that the order comes from the top yet from the very beginning of the israel palestine conflict the israelis have been guilty of all kinds of war crimes including genocide the latest round of violence erupted over the expulsion of palestinian families from their own land as well as israeli raids on the al aqsa mosque compound the israeli bombing of the gaza strip left 248 palestinians dead and close to 2 000 injured the seeds of zionism were sown in palestinian lands since the balfour declaration in 1917 a statement issued by britain underscoring support the establishment of a national jewish home in what constitutes modern day palestinian territories this promise was fulfilled in 1948 when a small portion of palestinian land near the golan heights was allotted to the new state of israel this became a magnet for jewish communities around the world fleeing fascism in europe with american economic and military aid the new state had entrenched itself in palestinian land within 20 years thus impelled by the zionist instinct of expansionism israel waged full scale war against the entire might of the middle eastern countries in 1967 this only lasted six days but was sufficient time to seize the remaining palestinian territories of the west bank east jerusalem gaza strip as well as the syrian golan heights and the egyptian sinai peninsula thus israel over ran a huge portion of palestinian land by effectively displacing palestinians who had been living there for centuries from their homes and forcing them to seek refuge in the gaza strip two armies in combat is one thing targeting unarmed civilians is something else no matter that the order comes from the top gaza borders egypt but also israel which separates it from the west bank thus the tragedy is that gaza is surrounded on all three sides by hostile territories egypt s rafah border crossing provides a good supply line to the palestinians but in the past has been blocked at the behest of israelis who fear that hamas will import arms from other countries thereby enabling israel to tighten its blockade of gaza and devastating the local economy in what has been termed the world s largest open air prison if one takes stock of the last 73 years one can safely conclude that following the 6 day war of 1967 the balance of power gravely tilted in favour of israel and against the palestinians furthermore confrontation between the two would only lead to the devastation of palestinians living in gaza if this conflict is prolonged it will be the palestinians who continue to suffer many proposals have been put forward over the years to resolve this issue peacefully none has been successful there have been suggestions of a one state and two state solution the oslo accords were signed in 1993 as confidence building measures to create trust between israelis and palestinians and bring peace to the region yet less than a decade later the reign once again became a theatre of war looking at the prevalent situation one feels that living in a perpetual state of egregious hatred doubt and mistrust is worse than hell the writer is a former member of the provincial civil service and an author of moments in silence
