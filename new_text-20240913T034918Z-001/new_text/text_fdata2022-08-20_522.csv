with virginia taking in roughly 1 9 billion in unanticipated revenues over the past fiscal year gov glenn youngkin s administration is proposing putting 400 million toward a new state taxpayer relief fund the right thing to do is return unplanned revenue to taxpayers the republican youngkin told members of the house and senate committees that oversee virginia s budget process on friday it s not our money it belongs to the hardworking taxpayers of virginia but some democratic lawmakers said the money much of which comes from taxes on investments would be better used to bolster public worker salaries provide state services and fund capital improvements such as an estimated 25 billion in school replacement costs we have to deal with these ongoing problems and to automatically say that all of it goes into tax cuts is just not realistic said del vivian watts d fairfax who previously chaired the house finance committee when democrats controlled the chamber del sally hudson d charlottesville and an economist at the university of virginia said that as corporate profits have risen so have the payouts to their shareholders it seems fair that when corporate profits soar you reinvest that money in the infrastructure that makes it possible to maintain a healthy business climate she said roughly three quarters of the unplanned revenues were from nonwithholding taxes a category that includes taxes on capital gains partnerships and s corporations ira distributions interest and dividends and self employment income tax revenues of this kind tend to follow rises and falls in the stock market finance secretary stephen cummings described the growth in nonwithholding tax revenues which rose 71 between 2019 and 2022 as incredible corporate taxes also saw dramatic growth he noted rising nearly 110 over the same period and 30 over the past year however youngkin spokeswoman macaulay porter said they did not significantly affect virginia s 1 9 billion in unanticipated revenues since the state had actually forecast that collections in that category would be higher other revenue sources like corporate taxes are still much higher in dollar terms than they were in 2019 but were more or less in line with the assumptions embedded in the caboose budget she said referring to the budget that governs the last few months of the fiscal year that ended on june 30 whereas nonwithholding was way above what anyone expected data presented by cummings also showed a spike in nonwithholding payments greater than 100 000 last year while a decade ago just under 1 200 payments for capital gains and non wage income exceeded that threshold over 4 700 such payments were made last year you can see dramatic growth in those that clear that 100 000 bar said cummings disagreement over best use of revenues youngkin repeatedly emphasized his belief that the unanticipated revenues are not the government s money and any surplus belongs to the taxpayers when combined with roughly 1 2 billion that the general assembly appropriated last year but has not been spent state revenues are currently more than 3 billion higher than expected but much of it has already been designated for particular uses by legislators during the last budget cycle state law requires that roughly 900 million be deposited into the state s rainy day fund youngkin noted while other large chunks will go toward uses such as the state s retirement fund capital improvement overruns and road widening the 400 million the governor wants for a taxpayer relief fund would be created after accounting for all earmarked uses of this cash surplus he said any proposal will require approval by the general assembly this 400 million is a down payment he told reporters after his speech this is the beginning of recognizing that when we in fact have big cash surpluses driven by taking in way too much money and overtaxing virginians the government can provide meaningful tax reductions to virginians going forward republicans praised the proposal as needed relief for virginians suffering from record inflation all across virginia families and small businesses continue to struggle with near record inflation house appropriations vice chair terry austin r botetourt said in a statement governor youngkin s revenue announcement today makes it clear that we have not only an opportunity but an obligation to provide even more relief to taxpayers when we return to richmond in 2023 but watts said the tax relief proposal was just not in touch with the real world out there pointing to staffing shortages among teachers state mental health care providers and law enforcement officers across the commonwealth watts said virginia is facing crisis gaps in employment and while the general assembly recently approved pay raises of 10 and higher for all these workers that went into effect july 1 inflation s just eating it up she said i m just frustrated that this on the ground awareness was not expressed she said to just say automatically we return it to the people well the people need kids in classrooms with trained teachers in a classroom that isn t doubled up because there s a teacher vacancy youngkin acknowledged after his speech that we continue to see staffing shortages but said he is hopeful that the pay increases will go a long way towards covering a historic pay gap he also signaled that the administration will seek further tax cuts calling virginia s taxes high relative to surrounding states such as north carolina and tennessee we ve got to be consistently lowering the tax burden in virginia he said
it s an especially sweet victory for oregon s senior senator who is widely seen as the architect of the measure that will allow medicare to negotiate drug prices example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video portland ore oregon s senior senator ron wyden was at a pharmacy on west main street in medford when president biden signed the inflation reduction act into law this week it was an especially sweet victory for wyden who has fought drug companies for decades in an effort to bring down the cost of prescription drugs he s widely seen as the architect of the measure in the package that will allow medicare to negotiate drug prices i was telling the seniors at the medford pharmacy that there was a dose of good news he said a big dose of good news for thousands of senior citizens in oregon and hundreds of thousands across the state because they were going to get a fair shake finally for their medicine wyden was a guest on this week s episode of straight talk to discuss how the inflation reduction act will bring down costs for oregonians among other topics oregon s other senator jeff merkley also discussed the new law when he appeared as a guest on straight talk last week beating big pharma wyden and other democrats have been pushing to give medicare the power to negotiate drug prices for decades ever since president bill clinton proposed his health care overhaul in 1993 under the inflation reduction act medicare will initially be able to negotiate prices for ten drugs the first round will start with the most expensive like cancer and arthritis drugs wyden said with more added to the list later wyden called the new approach a seismic shift in the relationship between oregon seniors and big pharma and a long overdue change to the restriction that prevented medicare from negotiating big pharma guarded that restriction like it was the holy grail he said i called the restriction a curse now it has been lifted the gospel in washington dc is big pharma doesn t lose this time oregon seniors and folks across the country beat big pharma the legislation also includes a provision written by wyden that mandates a financial penalty for drug companies if they raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation so this would mean for the first time since medicare began in 1965 there would actually be consequences for big pharma price gouging he said that sends a pretty powerful message tackling climate change wyden s fingerprints are on another key part of the inflation reduction act the provisions to address climate change he worked on the clean energy for america act which passed the house in 2009 but it never came up for a vote in the senate after that failure wyden said he and his fellow lawmakers regrouped and turned to market based technology neutral tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions the result was a re worked piece of legislation that forms a cornerstone of the inflation reduction act s climate provisions it s market oriented and there is going to be competition so that s why independent experts like the rhodium group say families are going to save 500 bucks the market system gives folks in nuclear hydrogen and carbon capture all a chance to compete he said 80 billion to bolster the irs the inflation reduction act includes 80 billion for the internal revenue service more than half of which is designated for enforcement efforts including hiring more irs agents to increase audits republicans have attacked the provision arguing that the audits won t just hit billionaires but average middle class taxpayers too wyden wanted to set the record straight one of the most senior influential republicans said there would be all these enforcement agents coming in with assault weapons and the criminal division of the irs said no way are we going to do something like that he said the legislation and the additional audits will go after wealthy tax cheats he said not average taxpayers who pay their taxes with every paycheck they re not the issue he said but these wealthy tax cheats go to their accountants and say i don t pay my taxes that way help me exploit all of these strategies for avoidance that s why a number of billionaires have been able to pay little or no taxes for years he also pledged to keep an eye out to make sure the money designated for the irs is used the way lawmakers intended as chairman of the finance committee i am going to be watchdogging this every step of the way he said so if i see evidence of what a couple of these senior republicans falsely said that there would be all these people with assault weapons coming in you better believe i am going to get that changed fighting inflation by bringing down costs critics and non partisan analysts like the penn wharton budget model have said the inflation reduction act will do little or nothing to actually bring down inflation but wyden said the inflation improvements will come from bringing down costs for consumers across multiple sectors this cuts costs and what fundamentally congress can do that really helps in the fight against inflation is cutting costs he said those cost reductions include a cap on the cost of insulin for medicare recipients reductions in americans energy bills and a provision that limits stock buy backs by companies and executives those measures will ultimately reduce the federal deficit he said leading to an opportunity to cut borrowing costs for consumers looking to buy things like homes and cars wyden also discussed the recently passed chips act and how it will benefit oregon s semiconductor industry as well as his legislation to discourage price gouging by big oil companies and his efforts to protect women s reproductive health data following the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade
the rain was coming down in sheets the day tiara young hudson won the democratic primary for circuit court judge in the alabama county she has long served as a public defender voters were undeterred when the ballots were counted in jefferson county the most populous and most diverse in the state they showed that more than 31 000 people had braved the storm to vote in the primary on that day in may fifty four percent of them chose hudson with no republican challenger in the race the outcome was tantamount to victory for hudson in the general election in november the attorney wife mother and dedicated churchgoer rejoiced thanking her family and god in a public facebook post hudson was on track to be the first public defender to serve as a judge on the jefferson county circuit court and the first black woman with a background as a public defender to serve on the bench anywhere in alabama the celebration was short lived just over two weeks later a state commission divided along racial lines dissolved the judgeship hudson had effectively won first circuit judge clyde jones resigned from the seat eight days after the may 24 primary and seven months before the end of his term that gave the judicial resources allocation commission jrac created by alabama s republican dominated legislature in 2017 the opportunity to consider transferring his seat the next week the commission voted to permanently relocate the seat from jefferson county where the crime rate is the highest in alabama to majority white madison county all three black members of the commission voted against transferring the judgeship all eight white members voted in favor the chairman of jrac called the move a simple matter of filling a need in madison county but the transfer of the judgeship the first by the commission since it was created has been met with overwhelming objections at a jrac meeting before the vote members of the public testified that the move strips a county with a substantial black population of a critical resource and gives that resource to a county where white people comprise nearly 70 of the population as opposed to 48 in jefferson county last month the southern poverty law center and the american civil liberties union of alabama filed a lawsuit on behalf of hudson to challenge the constitutionality of the transfer update appeal before the alabama supreme court underlying the case is a question that goes to the heart of the splc s mission by stripping a judgeship from the state s largest metropolitan area where criminal cases are numerous and complex is an injustice being done and is this new commission being weaponized to shuffle judgeships in such a way that diverse communities lack fair representation in the judiciary this goes back to the people s power to have representation it goes to the power of voting said ahmed soussi voting rights staff attorney for the splc judges are elected by the people in alabama and we believe the constitution states that only the legislature decides how many judges can be in a specific area jrac doesn t represent the people it is this niche state agency that is making this first big move we want to challenge this right away because we believe this is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that no other judges are removed unconstitutionally if we don t what will stop jrac from taking all the judges out of jefferson county according to the complaint the decision to eliminate jefferson county s tenth judicial circuit place 14 judgeship and permanently relocate the seat to the twenty third judicial circuit in madison county violates the alabama constitution the state constitution the plaintiffs argue gives only the legislature not a commission created by it unelected and unaccountable to voters the authority to reallocate judgeships the white members of the commission have made multiple attempts to transfer judgeships from jefferson county to madison county but unsuccessfully until now according to the complaint at an aug 8 hearing attorneys for the splc and the aclu of alabama asked a judge to issue a preliminary injunction to immediately block the commission s decision on aug 12 montgomery county circuit court judge jimmy b pool dismissed the lawsuit on the basis that the plaintiff did not use the correct procedure to remove a sitting judge from office under these circumstances as a result the judgeship will remain in madison county unless a higher court overrules pool s decision we are disappointed that the court refused to step in and prevent this unconstitutional removal of a circuit court judgeship from birmingham soussi said the community of jefferson county deserves fair representation on the bench and access to a court system with the full resources to serve them but they are being denied both by alabama s current system metropolitan skyline of downtown birmingham alabama credit sean pavone alamy stock photo power of voting jrac was created to assess and report to the legislature on the need for judgeships the law creating the commission also purports to give it the power to move a judgeship to other districts or circuits when a judicial vacancy arises in alabama circuit courts have jurisdiction over felony prosecutions and civil suits with claims in excess of 10 000 the lawsuit filed by the splc and the aclu asked a state court in montgomery the capital city to invalidate jrac s decision and instead require gov kay ivey to follow the constitutionally mandated process for filling judicial vacancies in jefferson county under that process the governor must appoint one of three nominees submitted by the jefferson county judicial commission hudson has applied to be one of those nominees with his order dismissing tiara hudson s cause of action judge pool has ruled that it is ok for the judicial resources allocation commission to do the legislature s job said tish gotell faulks legal director for the aclu of alabama flawed study hudson said she has been deeply frustrated since the move was announced there is so much in the criminal justice system of the county that needs fixing she said and she was eager to tackle those problems i have the experience and the viewpoint to fix them hudson said not just for the people accused of crimes but for the victims also born in birmingham where she lives with her husband and three children hudson graduated from emory university and the university of alabama school of law a criminal defense lawyer her entire career hudson has been a public defender for jefferson county for the past eight years i ran for this seat because of the things i see in our criminal justice system that need to be addressed differently for the betterment of our communities hudson said i don t have all the solutions but i am willing to go beyond the bench to try to heal communities and restore lives more than 16 000 people went out in the pouring rain and they voted for me and my vision so this lawsuit is really about the voice of the people the people went out they exercised their right to vote and their voice has just been ignored that is the most troubling part for me i would like to think that even if my opponent had won that you shouldn t just make a seat someone has been elected to disappear in his role as jrac chair alabama chief justice tom parker cited a judicial caseload study as evidence of the need to move the judicial seat to madison county the study found that madison county judges handled more cases than those in jefferson county that study however is deeply flawed the lawsuit alleges in madison county each count against a defendant is tallied as a separate case in jefferson county the court system tallies multiple charges against one person as a single case making the total caseload appear smaller according to data compiled by the state there were more than 28 000 crimes reported in jefferson county in 2019 the most recent year for which data is available a rate of 77 464 per 100 000 residents in madison county reported crimes that year were just above 13 000 a rate of 24 532 per 100 000 residents more judges needed no one disputes that madison county could use more judges but so could every other county in the state soussi said indeed the state of alabama is severely short of judges to properly adjudicate the number of cases moving through its courts lawmakers have funding for 20 more judgeships according to the lawsuit but have failed to use that money to increase the total number of judgeships that makes the question of where to place the existing judgeships particularly fraught for us it comes down to the demographic makeup of jefferson versus madison county soussi said jefferson county is much bigger and much more diverse and this was already an existing seat in the county so why take it away why farm this out to some new state commission that has no accountability and no constitutionality what we are saying is let s all work together to get our legislators to make the hard decisions to fund more judgeships let s go let s look let s work together on this until and unless more judgeships become reality jefferson county needs the ones it has hudson said i know i cannot force anybody to put me in this seat but the seat should come back to jefferson county hudson said it is needed here and i want people to know that their voice and their vote does matter photo at top tiara hudson credit andrew wells wells media group

bloomberg famed investor warren buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in occidental petroleum corp in what could end up being his biggest ever acquisition his berkshire hathaway inc on friday won approval to buy as much as 50 of the shares some investors believe it s a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than 50 billion here s why occidental is attractive to berkshire oil inflation looks to be the mega trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there russia s invasion of ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from opec to us shale meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy with investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels people that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts he said at a berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021 familiarity buffett first invested in occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with chevron corp to buy its crosstown houston rival anadarko occidental ceo vicki hollub flew to omaha nebraska on the company s gulfstream v and convinced buffett to add 10 billion to her war chest it was enough to swing the deal and chevron pulled out soon after in exchange buffett got preferred shares yielding 8 annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at 59 62 apiece today with occidental at 71 29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than 900 million if exercised value initially the anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up occidental s balance sheet with more than 30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic occidental s market value went from 50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than 9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed but on the flip side this created a good value play for buffett when crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by russia s invasion of ukraine occidental was best placed to benefit the stock is the best performer in the s p 500 this year up more than 140 compared with the index s 11 decline oxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure said bill smead who manages 4 8 billion at smead capital management inc and is a top 20 shareholder in occidental soaring crude prices mean they re now paying off that debt and gushing cash it s the best of all worlds cash too much cash has been berkshire s biggest investing challenge over the past few years the conglomerate had about 105 billion on hand at the end of june it is expected to generate about 8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to greggory warren of morningstar research services llc inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work occidental would work better as a subsidiary of berkshire than a stock holding given the volatility that exists in the energy commodity markets warren said this could end up though evolving into a slow motion takeover where berkshire buys up to the stakes that ferc allows it to acquire until it can acquire oxy whole shale occidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the permian basin the largest us oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just 40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend west texas intermediate currently trades at about 90 a barrel hollub has reined in the drill baby drill mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production free cash flow hit a record 4 2 billion in the second quarter the anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed occidental to lift its land holdings in the permian to 2 8 million acres 14 times the size of new york city s five boroughs combined it also added steady cash flowing assets in the gulf of mexico and algeria ceo buffett has a good personal relationship with hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in omaha brokered by bank of america corp ceo brian moynihan this year the veteran investor praised hollub after reading a transcript of occidental s feb 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising i read every word and said this is exactly what i would be doing buffett told cnbc s becky quick in squawk box in march she s running the company the right way inflation reduction act the oil industry mostly criticized the inflation reduction act that president joe biden signed into law this month the 437 billion legislation discourages needed investment in oil and gas and offers the wrong policies at the wrong time the american petroleum institute said but hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill very positive that may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which occidental is a leading proponent the company has plans to build the world s biggest direct air capture plant which will

clayton for decades managed health care company centene corp focused on scale now one of the largest in its industry centene is recalibrating for efficiency the shift in strategy brought an abrupt end this week to its plans for an east coast headquarters in north carolina stunning local leaders there but pleasing wall street with 90 of its workforce now fully or partly remote the company has been quietly relinquishing most of its once expansive office footprint in st louis and across the country the company may not have had a choice investors wanted the company to cut costs and improve profit margins with a new ceo at the helm the company has been aggressively slimming its real estate portfolio across the country moves that are likely to improve its bottom line but leave cities like the st louis region grappling with dozens of vacant office buildings making sure that centene delivers on its promises of margin expansion is something that investors take very seriously said julie utterback senior equity analyst at morningstar research services it sounds like this management team is taking that very seriously as well which is appreciated the east coast campus wasn t centene s only casualty the company already said it was no longer going to finish its 770 million headquarters expansion in clayton that would have added nearly 1 million square feet of office space hundreds of apartments or condos retail shops a 1 000 seat civic auditorium and a hotel near south hanley road and forsyth boulevard and centene has vacated nearly its entire real estate footprint here approximately 1 million square feet of office space according to marketing materials shopping those properties for lease or sublease roughly 300 000 square feet in chesterfield 180 000 square feet in des peres 100 000 square feet in richmond heights 100 000 square feet in creve coeur more than 60 000 square feet in st louis city the company confirmed in a statement that it will vacate several leased locations though it did not state which ones the centene spokesperson also said it will maintain its headquarters in clayton operations center in ferguson and its home state health headquarters in st louis despite a marketing brochure advertising the entire building for sublease it s an about face to how the company previously operated gobbling any block of office space in the region that was 75 000 square or feet more and it comes on the heels of the pandemic that cooled the office market as companies rethought their needs commercial real estate experts said the centene effect combined with the covid effect is disastrous for the st louis market said kevin mclaughlin of kma commercial real estate and the centene offices are coming on the market at a time when st louis already has a surplus of office space there s tons of competition you didn t have three to five years ago mclaughlin said centene s expansive real estate portfolio was a product of its former ceo michael neidorff who led the initial plans for the east coast headquarters that was to bring 3 900 jobs to north carolina for years under neidorff centene succeeded through growth neidorff expanded the company from a 40 million health plan to a giant in the managed care industry bringing in 126 billion in revenues last year neidorff took a medical leave of absence in february and sarah london was named as his replacement in march neidorff died in april at the age of 79 after years of acquisitions investors have been looking for change analysts said the company s stock price was underperforming relative to its peers last year the company announced a plan to improve margins and shed non essential assets after an activist investor stepped in last year the company agreed to overhaul its board of directors during an earnings report in july centene said it planned to decrease its domestic leased space by 70 which it expected would save 200 million in rent each year from my perspective having two corporate headquarters is not a way to gain efficiency utterback the morningstar analyst said the company also announced plans to sell a spanish hospital business and a company that runs radiology clinics in slovakia and the czech republic investors seem pleased with the moves after news broke that centene was scrapping its east coast headquarters plans wall street reacted with enthusiasm centene stock rose 1 6 on friday closing at 96 90 in clayton where officials are still dismantling its development agreement with the company mayor michelle harris said the company s presence is a real positive for the region and its decision to not carry out its east coast campus brought some closure for the community that centene isn t going to leave the st louis area

while it s been a good summer for equities in general after a torrid first half of the year tech titan apple nasdaq aapl is having a particularly sunny couple of months since the start of june their shares have rallied more than 30 effectively reversing the 30 drop they d been experiencing since march what had initially looked like a bull trap soon became a full on trend reversal and as markets trade through these dog days of summer apple s shares are suddenly within a couple of dollars of hitting all time highs get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more find a qualified financial advisor finding a qualified financial advisor doesn t have to be hard smartasset s free tool matches you with up to 3 fiduciary financial advisors in your area in 5 minutes each advisor has been vetted by smartasset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests if you re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals get started now those in the bear camp might be licking their chops at the thought of apple soon starting to hit resistance and forming a dangerous technical triple top around the 180 level as this could be the harbinger of a fresh bout of selling but there are plenty of louder voices saying this might just be the first half of what will turn into a multi month rally yesterday morning the team over at bank of america called for significantly more upside to be unlocked in apple s shares on the assumption that they can get above their previous all time high from last december chief market technician stephen suttmeier said that if apple were to hold above or near the 157 150 area on dips that would set up a bullish head and shoulders continuation pattern and if that happens the stock could then turn upwards again towards the highs of around 176 to 183 seen in december 2021 and if that happens suttmeier believes it would confirm the pattern and there could be further upside for the tech giant perhaps as high as 230 sure there are a couple of ifs and buts in this hypothesis but the technical foundation of the argument holds true it was a sentiment echoed by gene munster over at loup ventures yesterday as well who took a similarly bullish stance albeit over a longer term view he thinks shares of apple can push substantially higher over the coming years thanks to the stability of the company s underlying business and the chances it will tap into major new markets with the products it currently has in development in an interview with cnbc he said i think that from an upside potential i think there is still measurable upside i think 40 upside over the next couple years around 250 munster justified this target by pointing to a stable business for its current list of products like the iphone combined with the growth potential it could see with some of its developmental projects on its current lineup the loup ventures founder estimated that 70 of the tech giant s current offerings are necessities not discretionary purchases this could give the company a floor if the economy slows in the near term getting involved this is solid stuff to be hearing for those of us thinking about buying into this rally adding further support to the bull case are the comments from ming chi kuo at tf international securities who last week talked about ways apple could go about minimizing the impact a possible recession might have on consumer demand one tactic could be for them to announce several new products ahead of their scheduled september event and success here would bolster the case for apple being a truly recession proof stock compared to their peers from the faang group of tech stocks they are by far and away the best performer in 2022 with the likes of netflix nasdaq nflx and facebook nasdaq meta being so far off the pace as to not even be worth comparing against apple is well worth its place on investors watchlists for the moment and there s a strong case for them to be in your portfolio too the company has managed to weather what feels like a year of non stop inflation and supply chain headwinds while still getting its shares to trend towards fresh all time highs if that 180 can be cracked in the coming weeks it s not hard to see them pressing on into the 200s article by sam quirke marketbeat

it this week with strong gains across the board as currency markets start to price in the prospect the federal reserve is unlikely to soft pedal when it comes to raising rates heading into the end of the year according to hewson this message doesn t appear to be cutting through when it comes to equity markets but at some point it will probably at jackson hole next week when fed chair jay powell

mixed the federal reserve minutes released this wednesday showed that the us will continue raising the rates and tightening the monetary conditions to bring inflation back toward the 2 level in the us noted ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote bank in the wake of the softer than predicted headline inflation number last week investors had scaled back their expectations for future rate hikes but the fed minutes have since forced investors to rethink those expectations after all inflation still remains at decades high levels and there is no certainty it has peaked in this cycle added ozkardeskaya the latest data showed that the existing home sales declined in the us but the philly fed manufacturing index came in unexpectedly stronger jobless claims also fell more than expected last week defying those calling for recession in the us she concluded meanwhile federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard was on record on thursday as saying he may be in favor of another big rate hike when rate setters meet next month as inflation may not have peaked just yet elsewhere european central bank board member isabel schnabel noted that the eurozone inflation outlook

try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

kemter e via getty images the projected market size opportunity for bioplastics back on september 11 2021 we wrote an article for our google blog which spoke about how we felt that blue biofuels otcqb biof investors missed something very important that we believed to be of great significance our bullish perspective on this company emanates not only from the opportunities that lie ahead for biof in the field of biofuels but also in the exciting area of bioplastics the global bioplastics market is expected to register a significant cagr 26 03 during the forecast period 2022 2028 according to market growth reports latest research bioplastics industry know how optimization stages are solutions which deliver an organization the ability to know the requirement of every individual customer and suggestion the best possible experience for them across all touch points the global bioplastics market was estimated at 3 123 24 kilo tons in 2022 and is expected to register an estimated cagr of 26 03 during the forecast period 2022 2028 one of the major drivers for the increasing demand in this market is the increasing environmental concerns globally and governments of the developed and developing nations encouraging environment friendly products source market watch cagr for global bioplastics market 2022 2028 market watch that blog article focused on two very important developments that were taking place at blue biofuels inc which were subsequently communicated to shareholders by the company through two separate press releases blue biofuels hires expert in plastics and polymers to accelerate the development of biodegradable bioplastics and nanocellulose products blue biofuels files two new patents on the production of lignin and nanocellulose from its cts technology one filed patent pertains to the production of lignin from the cts process the second filed patent pertains to the production of nanocellulose from the cts process these are important developments because our no sulfur lignin can be used for the production of bio originated and biodegradable plastics as well as in ion exchange resins further the company believes both lignin and nano cellulose have the potential of becoming very high value co products of our process the company is working on separating and purifying these products for future sale the global nanocellulose market is expected to exceed 1 billion by 2027 according to reportlinker com source blue biofuels ceo ben slager this about sums up the response from investors investors yawn at important blue biofuels news the guardian while we sounded a wake up call many investors chose to ignore it and instead chose to hit the snooze button plastic waste the environmental impact our initial discussion of the bioplastics opportunity appeared in our seeking alpha article blue biofuels our absolute best and number one micro cap idea for 2021 in that article we laid out the opportunity in bioplastics for the company in the section titled biofuels bioplastics market size and opportunities we highly recommend investors take another look at that article it provides an excellent overview of blue biofuels and why we think that this company could be one of the biggest micro cap sleepers in today s market some of you may have seen the television commercial for the kia sportage named the beachcomber which features a young man driving along a deserted beach gathering plastic bottles and other plastic waste that have washed ashore so that sea turtles can nest and begin laying their eggs there are mixed feelings about this commercial with both sides debating on youtube where the commercial has been viewed over 17 2 million times no matter what side of the issue you fall on there is no doubt that the impact of plastic pollutants to the environment is real there are billions of non biodegradable plastic water bottles that have been used and discarded by people over the years the problem is that many of them wind up in landfills and waterways where they create an unsightly and ugly environmental eye sore many of these plastics are recycled to be used again to make new containers and other plastic items with the advent of new technologies there are now plastics being produced that are biodegradable meaning that over time they will simply breakdown and become an innocuous part of the environment how long it takes to biodegrade depends on the materials used to produce the plastic the graphic below shows the timetable for degradation of various types of plastics time table for biodegradation of various plastics university of florida multiple revenue sources from by products generated by cts 2 0 blue biofuels corporate presentation unlike lignin produced from other industry competitors which use other methods of extraction blue biofuel s sulfur free lignin remains pure and unmodified since there are no caustic chemicals costly enzymes or high temperatures used in the cts 2 0 process this becomes an attractive advantage to potential future customers who purchase this virgin lignin to use in the food and beverage related items that they produce the advantage for blue biofuels inc is that this lignin by product becomes another important source of revenue for the company not one not two but three revenue sources blue biofuel s revenues are not just from selling sugars to produce ethanol our bullish thesis on biof is predicated on the fact that this company is in the unique position of having a patented technology that can produce not one not two but three highly prized sources of revenue those three sources of revenue are the sale of cellulosic sugars to produce jet fuel and other important biofuels the sale of lignin and nanocellulose to produce environmentally friendly bioplastics and the all important fda rin credits that have essentially no cost resulting in 100 profit margins think about that for a minute ethanol producers generate three primary sources of revenue the first comes from the margins on the sale of sugars that are extracted from the processing of the feedstock another comes from the d6 rin credits for corn ethanol recently pegged at roughly 1 13 per gallon this compares to a rin price of approximately 3 23 a gallon for d3 the epa category for corn ethanol rin trades price information epa mountain chart of d6 rin prices 2016 2022 growth energy bar chart of yearly d6 rin prices 2015 2022 growth energy mountain chart of d3 rin prices 2016 2022 growth energy bar chart of yearly d3 rin prices 2015 2022 growth energy the final revenue source for corn based ethanol producers comes from the sale of ddgs distiller dried grains with soluables they are a by product of the process of converting corn into sugars to be used in ethanol production these grains are primarily use as fodder for livestock especially ruminants corn based distillers grains from the ethanol industry are commonly sold as a high protein livestock feed that increases efficiency and lowers the risk of subacute acidosis in beef cattle source wikipedia it s not very common to see a business that derives its revenues from three sources but in the ethanol industry it s standard practice important differences between corn based cellulosic ethanol the biggest differences between producers of corn based ethanol and cellulosic biomass ethanol are three fold 1 the cost of producing a gallon of ethanol which is primarily determined by which feedstocks are used in the sugar extraction process 2 the value of the epa environmental protection agency rin credits in this case a d3 credit for cellulosic ethanol and a d6 credit for corn based ethanol 3 the sale of by products that are result from the manufacturing process imagine for a minute that you had a business selling widgets there is a cost for your company to build those widgets and a price at which you sell them to your customers the difference represents your gross profit margin you have costs associated with making each widget which include things like the cost of procuring the raw materials used now what if the united states government told you that if you were to build your widgets out of a particular material let s call it material a they would pay you a monetary incentive of 1 13 for each widget that your company manufactures this 1 13 would supplement your profits by 1 13 per widget since there are no costs to your company whatsoever the entire 1 13 that you would receive from the u s government is yours to keep let s say that you sell your widgets to customers at a price of 3 00 each you have costs all in to produce those widgets of 1 50 thus providing you with a profit margin of 100 on each widget that you can sell however there is also the additional amount that you receive from the government in this case 1 13 since there are no costs incurred on your part to obtain this additional amount you will add it to the 1 50 profit that you have made from the sale of each widget taking the 3 00 sale price of each widget and adding the 1 13 credit from the government provides a total of 4 13 in revenue versus the prior 3 00 subtracting the cost to produce each widget of 1 50 gives you a net profit of 2 63 per widget in other words your net margins have just gone from 100 to 175 by virtue of the u s government credit while that certainly sounds good the next scenario sounds even better the u s government will provide you with an even greater credit of 3 23 per widget if you use a different material we ll call this one material b to manufacture your widgets in this scenario your net profit margin would amount to 315 instead of 175 it is calculated this way if we take 3 00 the sale price of a widget and add to that the 3 23 received from the government we come to a total of 6 23 in revenues then taking the 6 23 in total revenues and subtracting the 1 50 net cost to produce a widget gives us a net profit of 4 73 for each widget we then divide the 4 73 in net profit by the 1 50 cost of each widget to come up with a profit margin of 315 now we get to the 64 000 question why would you use material a to produce your widgets at a profit margin of 175 instead of using material b thereby increasing your overall profit margins from 175 to 315 the answer is simple you probably wouldn t in the above example material a is field corn while material b is cellulosic biomass the only reason why you would choose to use material a over material b is because you have not found a way to efficiently and effectively use material b as part of your manufacturing process this is where the biofuel industry finds itself today most ethanol producers use field corn versus cellulosic biomass because up until now no one has found an economically viable way to crack the code so to speak as it pertains to the calcitrant properties of cellulose major challenges that blue biofuels has overcome the major challenges in the past associated with using cellulosic biomass to create sugars for fermentation into ethanol are widely known in most previous cellulosic conversion technologies the use of caustic chemicals or expensive enzymes were required this adds substantially not only to the cost of the process but also to the amount of time for conversion to the final product sugars blue biofuel s patented cts 2 0 conversion process requires no costly chemicals or enzymes for pre treatment of the cellulosic biomass before processing to produce sugars for ethanol due to the efficiency of the cts 2 0 process it also takes very little time to complete to process of conversion and results in a 99 conversion rate of the biomass material meaning that there is very little residual waste advantages of cts 2 0 vs other conversion methods blue biofuels using their patented mechanical chemical extraction method called cts cellulose to sugar 2 0 blue biofuels has created a cost effective and efficient method of producing sugars from cellulosic biomass blue biofuels developed a new and improved technology system that converts virtually any plant material â grasses wood paper farm waste yard waste forestry products fruit casings nut shells and the cellulosic portion of municipal solid waste â into sugars and subsequently into biofuels without the use of enzymes or liquid acids we call this the cts process where cts stands for cellulose to sugar the cellulose is converted into sugar and lignin the sugar is further converted into bio ethanol and other biofuels blue biofuels cts process is a mechanical chemical process that unlike other cellulosic conversion processes does not use any expensive and slow converting enzymes in the conversion of cellulose into its components of sugar and lignin we use a very inexpensive catalyst that is recycled cts process is environmentally friendly 100 renewable 100 recycled water no toxic chemicals and an almost zero carbon footprint blue biofuels expects to be able to produce cellulosic ethanol using cts process at a significantly lower cost than any other cellulosic process and even at a lower cost than ethanol from corn due to the fact that our feedstock either tall grasses or waste product is much less expensive than corn source blue biofuels feedstock costs determine margins profitability this last paragraph brings up another very important point which is a major advantage over traditional corn based ethanol blue biofuel s patented cts 2 0 technology uses a very abundant and inexpensive feedstock which can be harvested multiple times throughout the calendar year let s use an example to illustrate what if the cost of material a cellulosic biomass was approximately 1 6th the cost of material b field corn now instead of your raw material feedstock costs being 1 50 they would be approximately 0 25 cents this dramatically changes the profit margin numbers above to reflect the lower cost of cellulosic feedstocks versus traditional corn based feedstock material a field corn produces a net profit margin of 175 material b cellulosic biomass produces a net profit margin of 315 adjusting for the difference in cellulosic feedstock costs to represent 1 6th the cost of using corn as a feedstock results in net profit margins of almost 2 400 the 1 6th differential is not just a random number currently the cost of one ton of corn is approximately 275 00 while the cost of a ton of king grass is between 35 and 55 a ton using the mean price of 45 per ton king grass is roughly 1 6th the cost of field corn a bushel of corn weighs roughly 56 pounds there are 39 4 bushels of corn per ton which produces approximately 2 85 gallons of ethanol per corn bushel or between 90 and 112 29 gallons of ethanol per corn ton compare that to the use of cellulosic biomass as a feedstock for producing ethanol which is estimated to be between 172 5 and 206 gallons per ton as expected increases in the conversion yield improve cost metrics â the sandia gm study states â as a point of reference corn grain ethanol yields average approximately 90 gallons ton the theoretical biochemical yield from cellulose and hemicellulose is 172 5 gallons dry ton while the maximum yield from the thermochemical process is 206 gallons dry ton however the practical maximum yields for conversion processes using cellulose are estimated to be 120 gallons dry ton due to losses from non converted feedstock material and external energy inputs there are no data on production scale cellulosic processes as there are no such processes in existence but the current estimates based on laboratory yields are in the range of 63 72 gallons dry ton hsu 2008 our reference case has an overall average yield 2006 2030 of 95 gallons dry ton and thus assumes significant technical advances over time sensitivity analysis showed that the cost difference between achieving a moderate improvement of yield 75 gallons dry ton and achieving the maximum practical yield corresponds to approximately a 0 20 gallon impact on cost of ethanol source ethanol today the u s government throws its weight behind alternative energy u s house chambers house press gallery source house press gallery just this past week we saw the passage of h r 7356 also known as the inflation reduction act this was milestone legislation for the green energy or alternative energy industry included in the bill is financial assistance for companies that are producing the next generation of alternative energy technologies which will be used to slowly de carbonize the atmosphere and the environment included in the inflation reduction act are several key priorities for the biofuels industry 45q tax credits for carbon oxide sequestration and utilization extended through 2032 with adjusted rates of 85 ton for sequestration and 60 ton for utilization clean fuel production credit starting in 2025 and expiring at the end of 2027 for the production of low carbon fuels five years of sustainable aviation fuel saf credits a stand alone credit for saf then as part of the clean fuel production credit for three years 500 million for biofuels infrastructure through the end of 2031 extension of biomass based diesel blenders credit and the second generation biofuels producer credit for two years 300 million grant program to increase domestic production and deployment of saf and low emission aviation technologies source growth energy this legislation is a game changer for companies which are focused on producing ethanol and saf sustainable aviation fuel we published an article on seeking alpha back on may 12 2022 which indicated that blue biofuels was inching closer to the commercialization of its revolutionary cts 2 0 technology the current inflationary environment and its impact on commodity prices will likely enhance the value of using cellulosic biomass as an alternative feedstock to corn summary conclusion we believe that blue biofuels is in a sweet spot and an enviable position when it comes to producing biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel our investment thesis for biof is predicated on several important factors which are at play including 1 a low cost method of extracting sugars from cellulosic biomass that eliminates the expensive enzymes and chemicals previously used in other methods of sugar extraction 2 a conversion rate of 99 with little or no residual waste 3 an epa d6 rin credit that is substantially higher than the d3 rin credit for corn based ethanol 4 a cellulosic feedstock that is roughly 1 6th the cost of traditional field corn producing much higher margins and potentially greater profits 5 a window of entry into the fast growing bioplastics industry by virtue of having an attractive lignin by product which is purer than other sources of lignin this purity results from eliminating the use of enzymes and chemicals in the cts 2 0 process 6 a potential shift away from traditional corn based ethanol resulting from the inflationary impact on commodity prices including wheat soybeans and corn 7 the company is working in collaboration with the usda to enhance the potential yields from crops that will be used as biomass feedstock 8 the fact that blue biofuels has produced a series of four prototypes each with significantly higher output numbers than predecessor units shows that they have been successful at optimizing each new generation of the cts 2 0 reactor 9 the company has hired an engineering firm to assist with the development and subsequent production of a commercial scale reactor which should be nearing completion by late 2022 or early 2023 10 the recent passage of h r 5376 which should clear the way for grants and other forms of financial assistance to aid in the development of new alternative energy technologies we should also note that on may 2nd of this year the ceo ben slager and cfo anthony santelli each put 75 000 in a private placement which the company was conducting to raise a small amount of working capital to continue with the optimization of the existing prototype we interpret that as a show of confidence in the progress of the prototype development and the results that were achieved remember that blue biofuels is a developmental stage company and will likely need to raise additional capital towards the finalization of the commercial scale unit if you are a micro cap investor you may want to consider adding biof to the speculative portion of your equity portfolio we believe that the company is extremely well positioned in two future mega trends biofuels and bioplastics if blue biofuels can achieve the level of success in their strategic business plan to meaningfully participate in these two industries the stock could see significant appreciation in the coming years however in addition to significant rewards there are also significant risks we ask that you please read the disclosures and disclaimers that appear at the end of each

the entire world has changed since february santos ceo told the australian it was a reference to changing his mind about developing an oil project in alaska but what if he s right about far more the entire world has changed since february santos ceo told the australian it was a reference to changing his mind about developing an oil project in alaska but what if he s right about far more the energiewende is coming full circle all around the world right back to coal oil gas and nuclear the energy sources it was designed to turn away from it s as if the past 10 years of abandoning them was just a fad with 2021 coal production matching levels from back then the oil price surging and nuclear rollouts all around the world the results for investors are impressive dirty fossil fuel investments were one of the very few success stories of 2022 so far in the uk a coal miner that was spun off from mining behemoth anglo american in a green pr stunt and dubbed worthless by finance research firm boatman capital is now worth about 1 9 billion after a sixfold increase in its share price and a 3 000 increase in profits four months after the coal miner was spurned by its parent company in june 2021 i asked nigel farage are coal mining stocks the best way to profit from the green energy boom boy were we right the reason for the divergence from worthless to worth billions was the flawed presumption that governments would actually deliver on their promises to turn their back on coal heh instead they re back to destroying the planet with dirty power with coal usage booming in particular the new energy transition to dirty energy is in order to put financial pressure on russia germany s economy minister even said it s a necessary evil to end life on earth in order to avoid using russian gas more or less unlike anglo american glencore didn t divest its worthless coal business to virtue signal and so its share price is also soaring thanks to record profits especially relative to anglo american my question to you is how long can the shareholder maximising corporate world cling onto green platitudes in the face of economics and energy physics because the politicians gave in at the first sight of trouble the answer is not long because of competition while those companies that embrace energy are powering ahead those that stick to virtue signalling will be left behind and santos doesn t want to be left behind having done a 180 on funding an alaskan oil project it s a reversal that d qualify the santos ceo for the top job at the german ministry for the environment better still santos is doing so in open opposition to the green machine from the australian financial review but for credit suisse s kavonic the risk is that market focus will shift to alaska and its poor optics around esg putting off new investors gallagher disagreed we are doing this because we believe this is a way in which we can deliver the highest value to our shareholders he said how many ceos have gotten gas companies to say that a lot more than a year ago is my point but in germany the shift may have come too late germany s energy utility uniper reported a loss of more than 12 billion which is amongst the biggest in german corporate history and it s summer not winter yet jim rickards is worried about what s coming in winter the headline says germany reaches 75 gas stocks target ahead of schedule this sounds like good news but here s where a detailed read of the article reveals a very different state of affairs the article says that german gas storage capacity is 23 3 billion cubic meters which is about 20 of the actual 100 billion cubic meters of gas that germany used in 2021 in other words the 75 storage target is 75 of 20 of the gas actually used or 15 of the gas needed that leaves an 85 shortfall relative to requirements in other words the germans rely on gas continuing to flow even if they manage to fill their storage capacity it s not until september that the soaring cost of electricity will be passed onto german consumers thanks to the way the german power market works but the crisis has already begun amongst corporations bild reports according to my translation that experts are warning of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs over the gas price explosion so power bills are going bonkers jobs will be lost companies will need bailing out and inflation will soar no surprise that it s not just the corporate sector that s defying the greenspeak more and more politicians are waking up to the fact that they don t just need coal but they also need to stop vilifying and threatening it too it s not just coal of course in germany the government claimed for months that it wasn t possible to restart or extend the life of its nuclear power plants those claims were demonstrably false and the nuclear plants are now expected to open the same goes for the uk s gas storage facilities which were shut around the same time europe became reliant on russia for gas in france wildlife at risk as france issues energy giants with an environmental waiver to avoid shutdown reports the uk s telegraph yikes what could go wrong to get back to the santos ceo s comments the world has fundamentally changed saving the planet is now less important than fighting putin inflation and the lack of energy supply and infrastructure the change is obvious at the political level but also at the corporate level the narrative that only companies that take the energy transition seriously will survive in the zero carbon future has been turned on its head the companies that gambled politicians would persist with such policies in the face of disastrous results have had the rug pulled out from under them and the windfall from those who focused on value for their shareholders has soared there s nothing like a results season to sharpen the mind of corporate boardrooms and nothing like elections to wake up politicians what has the energy war on putin achieved apart from inflation an energy crisis and recessions the financial times sums it up when it comes to oil western sanctions have had limited impact on russian oil output says iea and rerouting of moscow s crude to india china and turkey has helped offset curbs elsewhere in the end russian oil production in july was only 310 000 b d below prewar levels a fall of less than 3 per cent adjust for much higher oil prices because of the sanctions and you get humiliation as for gas gazprom s output so far this year fell by a whopping 13 2 compared to the same period last year look out russia sanctions for the win they worked in cuba iran japan iraq and plenty of other places after all best of all putin is helping with the sanctions by further limiting his exports of gas to europe according to the media wait we celebrate the sanctions for reducing russia s energy exports and then accuse russia of exporting less to squeeze europe politically you can t have both no wonder nobody takes energy policy seriously anymore until next time nickolai hubble editor the daily reckoning australia weekend
the ukrainian president has come under unprecedented criticism from ukrainians since the beginning of the war after his interview with the washington post in which he said he knew about the looming war as early as last fall but did not tell his countrymen some see this as the first real crisis in his team s communications strategy volodymyr zelensky s motives are that this would have created chaos in the country and thus the russians would have taken it over in a matter of days while in martial law crisis management is easier the interview with him was published as part of a major investigation by the publication into the events of the months leading up to the outbreak of war it states that as early as october 2021 the white house was fully convinced that a russian invasion was imminent early in the hour long interview in the barricaded presidency in kyiv he was asked whether hostomel airport outside kyiv should have been reinforced with troops before it was attacked on the morning of february 24 by russian commandos after william burns the director of the cia had in january warned about such an operation from the russians zelensky replies that in kyiv they knew about a similar scenario including the capture of the civilian international airport at least half a year in advance and reminds that last year there were russian belarusian exercises to control or bomb infrastructure according to him there is nothing unique about the planning and that the russians used maps and directions like those of the nazis during world war ii i won t talk about everything burns and i talked about but his main signals were about threats to my life and those weren t the first signals they came from everywhere including from our intelligence he explains he was told to get his family out of the country to which he allegedly replied how do you imagine i would do something like that and expect people to just stay here and adds you can t just tell me look you ve got to start preparing people now and tell them they ve got to save money they ve got to stock up on food if we had announced that then i would have lost 7 billion a month since last october and the moment the russians attacked they would have run us over in three days i m not saying whose idea it was but overall our gut feeling was right if we wreak havoc among the people before the invasion the russians will tear us apart because in times of chaos people flee the country zelensky points out that this is exactly how millions of ukrainians fled west at the beginning of the invasion and we were as strong as we could be but most stayed here fought for their homes he adds and these are the people who stopped the invasion if this had happened in october during the heating season nothing would have been left our government would not have existed that s 100 percent certain forget about us there would have been a political war inside the country because we could not stand losing 5 to 7 billion dollars a month we didn t have serious financial programs there was a shortage of energy resources created by the russians we didn t have enough energy reserves we wouldn t be able to get out of this situation and there would be chaos in the country the president explains that part of his reasons for not informing his countrymen of the inevitable was to better manage the crisis to have controlled chaos during military operations you manage the country differently you can open the border close the border attack retreat defend you can take control of your infrastructure and it s a different situation if you don t have martial law or a state of emergency and you have a country that is run by a huge number of different officials and institutions and minus 7 billion dollars a month and without weapons it is already a really big war for our country in the interview he describes that he is currently in a position to balance his decisions because he is in a paradoxical situation on the one hand i need money so as not to lose my country and on the other hand i cannot spend all the money including the billions in aid from abroad on armaments and salaries of the military adds zelensky there are millions of other ukrainians who also need to receive income to survive zelensky was also asked if he personally believed that a full scale war was imminent how can one believe such a thing that they are going to torture people and that this is their goal no one believed that such a thing was coming and no one knew now everyone says we were warned but these were common phrases when we said give us the details where they re coming from how many people and so on they all had as much information as we did and when i said okay if they re coming from here and there s going to be heavy fighting can we get weapons to stop them we didn t understand it why do i need all these warnings why do i have to drive our society crazy he gives the example that already in january ukrainians began withdrawing deposits from their banks for billions of dollars and transferring them abroad without the central bank imposing any restrictions so with all due respect ukrainians have spent much more money in europe compared to the amount that ukrainians received there as aid added the president and reminds that on the eve a hybrid war was waged by russia against ukraine so that we cease to be a country through creating a political mess to change power in kyiv energy strike to create shortages of gas fuel and heating in order to destabilize the government financial shock and pressure for devaluation of the hryvnia which will cause mass withdrawal of deposits let people debate in the future whether we were right but i definitely knew we discussed it every day in the national security council the defense council etc and i had a gut feeling that the russians wanted to prepare us to hand over our country to them and that s scary two days later the washington post reported a wave of criticism against the president unprecedented since the beginning of the war that if he had warned his people many people would have organized their lives differently and thousands would have been saved criticisms are mainly on social networks but they are from politicians and ordinary ukrainians as well as popular personalities and scientists some even accuse him of being partially responsible for the atrocities that followed some understand his words in the interview as prioritizing the state of the economy over the survival of the people others believe that he questioned the intelligence of ukrainians and that many of them would accept 7 billion a month in losses as the price for saving so many lives of women children and the elderly lost in areas suddenly under russian occupation he didn t want to prepare the country for war because he was afraid that he would lose power writes journalist bogdan butkevych on facebook to be honest my hair stood on end when i read what he said about the evacuation how is it possible for a person on whose conscience lies mariupol bucha and kherson to say that an evacuation would have created chaos in the country there are those who defend the president and point out that ukrainians have had access to media reports for months about american warnings that war is imminent and could begin at any moment anyone who didn t pack a backpack after the reports of what american intelligence said has no right to claim that they weren t warned says valerii pekar we all knew and understood that war was coming we just didn t want to believe it because it was too terrible to be true writes olena gnes founder of the what is ukraine project no statement by zelensky would have changed anything significantly but ukrainians also ask quite reasonable questions such as why blood banks were not prepared or why defensive fences were not erected along the northern border to stop an assault on kyiv others say they have questions but will wait to ask them until after the war is over follow novinite com on twitter and facebook write to us at editors novinite com информирайте се на български novinite bg dnevnik

by katanga johnson washington reuters the world s largest asset manager blackrock inc warned the u s securities and exchange commission sec this week that its proposed rules aimed at fighting greenwashing by fund managers will confuse investors blackrock made the claims in a letter filed this week in response to a sec may proposal to stamp out unfounded claims by funds about their environmental social and corporate governance esg credentials the rules also aim to create more standardization around esg disclosures regulators and activists have become concerned that u s funds looking to cash in on the popularity of esg investing may be misleading shareholders over their esg credentials while blackrock acknowledged the need to boost oversight it questioned the sec s demand for more details on how funds should categorize strategies and describe their esg impact arguing such details could mislead investors about how much esg really matters when managers pick stocks and bonds the proposed requirements would increase the potential for greenwashing and lead to investor confusion blackrock wrote in its letter the granular nature of requirements will inevitably lead to the disclosure of proprietary information about these strategies reducing the competitive advantage of those unique insights also at issue is how the sec s proposal outlines how esg funds should be marketed and how investment advisors should disclose their reasoning when labeling a fund while sec chair gary gensler said in a may statement the measures respond to growing investor demand for such details industry groups warn the agency s aim to standardize esg labels could reduce investor choice the managed funds association said it also supported the sec s goal to promote better disclosure but with concerns requiring an adviser to provide extensive disclosures concerning how it integrates esg factors no matter how incidental the consideration may be will result in undue emphasis on an otherwise immaterial strategy the group said reporting by katanga johnson in washington editing by michelle price and josie kao

text size this story is part of the august 20 edition of good weekend see all 15 stories the stock agent turned to my husband pat as they watched me walk to the ute to feed our baby and chuckled it s good to have a milk truck on board that was me two years ago as a 39 year old breastfeeding mother the personification of a 16 wheel milk tanker fuelling new zealand s nz19 billion dairy export industry the harmless jokes became vitriolic in the months that followed as the conversation shifted from motherhood to farming emissions in our cattle yards and on other farms in the centre of the north island of nz successive clusters of men laughed cynically at climate action initiatives and i chose to remain silent if i d declared that i think most farmers need regulatory pressure to embrace more environmentally friendly practices the knowledge i needed to keep going on the land would have been withheld along with the invitations to farming workshops the farmers i was learning from with their chauvinist jokes didn t want to be told how to manage their land by urban based regulators government consultants or opinionated idealists new to farming i realised that for many the barrier to environmental change was the messenger not the message loading four years ago my instinct would ve been to roll my eyes at these men and seek camaraderie in the corners of social media where farmers are portrayed as dullards then i was the managing editor at digital media company buzzfeed working long hours in sydney s inner city and burning myself out on a diet of outrage and ambition the result of that misguided energy was laid bare on a monday morning in 2018 as i lay on an emergency bed at sydney s royal prince alfred hospital while a young doctor in green scrubs prodded my abdomen and confirmed that i had miscarried my first baby at three and a half months advertisement i squashed the grief alone in the 20 minutes it took a taxi to drive from the hospital to circular quay where my office was located one evening soon after my dad called from nz and said come home you can work on the farm you and pat can rear calves it s a good way to start i didn t know what it meant to be a farmer what it entailed dad had a five year lease on a small block of land where he fattened dairy heifers for other farmers in his offer i saw the possibility of recreating something from my childhood in nz i pictured vegetables in a garden and meat from the freezer slow days centred around home cooked meals food had filled me up in the weeks after my miscarriage red meat especially giving my depleted body the sustenance it needed to avoid anaemia cooking was a distraction from the grief and the idea of getting closer to my food source felt nourishing but i was naive harvey says within months of arriving in nz she and her husband were essentially factory farming credit joel mcdowell we told people we were leaving sydney to become cattle farmers on a 130 hectare lease block in nz it wasn t a lifestyle choice we said we were going into the farming business the question i didn t know to ask then was how do you get closer to your food and make a living and care for the environment when the country s entire food production system is guided by the export commodity trade efficiency and productivity have long been priorities in nz s export focused farming sector we followed this lore for a while and didn t ask if there was another way didn t pause when something felt wrong such as buying seven day old calves from dairy farms to raise in a converted shed on a diet of milk powder and hay advertisement one morning i watched my father cut off a two year old steer s small pointed horns with a pair of horn tippers a contraption that looks a lot like tree pruning shears causing jets of blood to spout over the animal i returned to the yards alone with a bucket of warm soapy water to futilely scrub the wooden railings clean of blood at that moment in early 2019 the confidence i felt while i was in sydney disappeared loading i d believed then that we were skilled enough to be good farmers that my inner city ambition to produce food that was affordable and nutritious would survive our move to the country but i was out of my depth guided by convention i focused primarily on profit and as a result i created a little industrialised system on our farm to fall neatly into the big industrialised system that dominates nz beef and dairy within months of arriving we were essentially factory farming pushing products animals through a production line as quickly and efficiently as possible more than 450 000 tonnes of beef meat are exported from nz each year mostly to north america and asia australia one of the world s largest exporters sends more than double that abroad it s a multibillion dollar industry that s the business we came into willingly at first but we and everyone around us were soon consumed by arguments about food and farming and its role in causing and combating climate change and the degradation of land water and air in our rearing shed calves started to fall ill in the depth of a cold winter a tiny angus friesian bull calf stopped drinking milk it was so dehydrated its hips protruded like handlebars others started to wane from an unseen bug we tested for rotavirus salmonella and e coli but the true cause was the business model too many tiny calves in too small a space in the push to be efficient our animals were dying are the reports right i asked my dad and his friends after reading yet another document indicating our collective demand for red meat was degrading the planet should we stop rearing calves if all we re doing is sending low quality mincemeat into the global market it s just bloody green lefties blaming farmers for things they advised if we re not producing it another country far less efficient will just keep going they said but death takes a toll advertisement the death on our farm and the climate change reports caused me to lose my appetite the jammy slow cooked berbere beef that had soothed my craving body months earlier was replaced by a rich mix of lentils nicola with husband pat on their land the couple have now adopted a low impact farming model credit joel mcdowell do you think about our cattle after they leave on the truck pat asked one day after months of hard blue sky and no rain we d just sent 150 100 kilogram bull calves off the farm to a larger nearby property south of the lake yes i replied well i used to but then i stopped myself i can t dwell on it for long do you not much he said that s the difference between you and me i hear him think you re trying to solve everyone else s problems i m just trying to solve ours when we started farming i thought buying poorly marked bull calves from dairy farms was a change maker strategy because so many farmers considered these baby cattle a waste product their mottled coats suggesting a lineage that won t fill out quickly we continued to farm cattle but now they like us live to aid the environment not the reverse but a sobering thought had started to settle i should be leaving those calves to their fate a fate that means they leave the dairy farm at four days old on a truck destined for the abattoir not our rearing shed calves have a use off the land the tiny animals are killed for their meat veal destined for the niche european market their hide is turned into the soft leather used for expensive handbags and sports car interiors their carcasses become a blood and bone mix that helps vegetables grow and in the blood is calf serum an ingredient used for medical cell research the development of vaccines in particular advertisement not a bit of the animal is wasted and this hypothetically means fewer cattle to emit methane and excrete nitrous oxide via urine and dung isn t it the health of the land the fate of the planet that we should focus on when we first arrived from sydney i tried to win every argument i stumbled into pat didn t bother instead he started creating something new breaking the old system in his own way so that we could survive on the land to start he stopped buying dairy calves that would take years to fatten and then he reimagined what farming could look like here specifically on our piece of land if we stopped trying to control nature through a heady cycle of cropping fertilising and sowing new grass over and again loading we continued to farm cattle but now they like us live to aid the environment not the reverse for a start our low input farming model improves soil quality and protects the grasslands which provide habitat for birds and insects at the point where the cattle become a burden becoming so heavy for example that their collective weight will send dirt sliding into the waterways below the farm they have to go their lives cut short in service to the land our aim is to decarbonise the gulf between those farming for the future and those focused on today and between the people who grow food and those who consume it still exists but the chasm that had opened between us pat and me and between our imagined farm life and the reality started to close when i stopped trying to win every argument and change everyone around us instead i joined pat in the thriving ecosystem he d created to start living the change we d envisaged together years ago nicola harvey is the author of farm the making of a climate activist scribe 33 out august 30 advertisement

for many making aliyah in later life is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream the ability to live in the homeland of the jews is something about which our forefathers could only dream now it s a reality those who come here lock stock and barrel leaving nothing behind are able to forge new lives free of the headaches of exchange rates transfer fees and the like they only have the eyewater welling up high cost of living to contend with same as the rest of us for many others however this is simply not possible the older you are the more difficult the whole aliyah process can be leaving behind a lengthy career a home a car or two and if you re lucky enough a pot of savings brings its own complications first decisions about what stays and what comes with you have to be made should the proceedings from the sale of a house be transferred immediately to your new israeli bank account for example or should you bring just enough for the time being and see how it goes the rate of exchange is the deciding factor for most people british pounds credit rawpixel when we made aliyah six and a half years ago it was almost five and a half shekels to the pound since then the pound has plummeted while the shekel has gone from strength to strength today for example the rate stands at 3 93 shekels to the pound when we arrived what would have cost us 1 now costs us approximately 1 50 those who rely solely on their british pension and pensions from other countries such as the united states for example to a lesser degree for their income have been even more severely affected simon for example who came to live in israel in 2008 when the rate was over eight shekels to the pound was able to live comfortably on his small uk pension the money he received was in his own words enough for a single old guy to manage not wealthily but sufficiently including rent food and a quiet social life today s exchange rate leaves me constantly worried that the landlords would increase the rent beyond my financial capability and have me once again searching for cheaper accommodation he continued high cost of living like so many in his position he is constantly on the lookout for more affordable places to live his dwindling income coupled with increases in rent has seen him move from the center of tel aviv where he started out to ramat gan and latterly to petah tikva where he now lives he is under no illusions however that he ll be able to remain there in the long term and is already on the lookout for cheaper accommodation within reach of his family israeli british certified financial planner rifka lebowitz cfp and founder of the facebook group living financially smarter in israel advises clients on how to make it here born in scotland where she lived until the age of 12 when she moved here with her family lebowitz knows how it feels to be an immigrant i m passionate about helping english speakers understand their finances feel comfortable with their money and succeed financially in israel she says when i asked her how people living on dwindling pensions could improve their situation her advice which applies to all immigrants not just brits was as follows my advice in general has always been to understand that when you are living in two currencies nis for spending and gbp for income you have a currency risk and must budget below your means so that you have a buffer for situations like this the reality is for some people this makes things tight and they need to be very aware of their financial situation and make necessary investment or budget or income changes to adapt rifka lebowitz one of her suggestions for those retirees who are still able and would like to work is to start a side business utilizing their skills in order to make up the shortfall not wishing to be at the mercy of the financial markets many retirees do just this a positive attitude a support system which is readily available here both go a long way to help find the right job side gig or whatever else things to fill in the gap lebowitz says sadly however for many here in israel even those who have never lived anywhere else the cost of living and financial struggles are simply too much to bear what will happen to the british pension not a day goes by when louise doesn t think about her british pension at the moment i am too frightened to look how much it is disappearing she told me she supplements her income with a part time job and is just about managing the thing which grieves her the most however is the dichotomy which exists between her children s standard of living one of her children made the decision to leave israel due to the high cost of living he was struggling to make ends meet he now lives very well in the us with his family his brother on the other hand who remained in israel and is now working as a doctor on a relatively good salary is unable to get his foot on the property ladder it is very likely that he too will leave the country in search of a more financially rewarding and easier life elsewhere something which saddens louise enormously then there are those who think about leaving israel for a better life free from financial worries and constraints but know that for one reason or another this will never happen danielle a brit who has spent all of her adult life in israel told me how difficult things have become in recent times for her and her family like simon above she her husband and their four small children have already moved to a cheaper apartment not only is it extremely stressful for them as they both have full time jobs but it s also very unsettling for the children having to adapt to another city buying a place of their own is simply out of the question especially now as their only savings are in the uk danielle told me that she is very keen to ensure that her children know all about budgeting and saving something which she also feels ought to be taught in schools in the meantime however she and her husband are simply trying to keep their heads above water and maybe save a bit now and then for old age her biggest fear is that they will become a burden to their children as they get older if they don t have enough money put aside to supplement their pensions despite all the difficulties danielle still loves israel i love this country i love the people i feel at home here and i know our struggles are shared by many so at least we re not alone i m certain she speaks for many here the bottom line is this in the words of anton delin a brit with vast experience in the money markets who now lives in israel we are living in a country with the world s strongest currency and while that s hurting big time those who survive on a sterling income it should actually be a source of pride the fact that the world recognizes what s going on over here some names have been changed in the article the writer is a former lawyer from manchester england she now lives in netanya where she spends most of her time writing and enjoying her new life in israel

coming well yes and no sterling has lost more than 10 against a rampant dollar so far this year uk government bond funds are down at least as much and domestically facing uk midcap stocks ftmc are down almost 25 in dollar terms underperforming even euro zone blue chips and yet the picture is not a wholly exceptional one not yet at least no plan flattered by the weaker pound and big weightings in uk listed commodity and cyclical or value stocks like big oil miners and banks the ftse100 index has actually outperformed many of its peers with losses of just 9 in dollar terms so far this year that beats the s p500 japan s nikkei225 and the euro zone s stoxx600 as well as msci s global index sterling has felt the heat but only marginally more than the euro and much less than japan s yen which has been exposed by the bank of japan being one of the few major central banks not to tighten the monetary reins this year speculative positions in the pound are still net negative but much less so than the may trough bank of america s worldwide fund survey showed an overall net 15 of funds underweight uk equities in august and the biggest one month drop in allocations among all the major regions and more negative than positioning in japan emerging markets and the united states where investors are overweight but even then the uk underweight was substantially less than the whopping net 34 of negative positions in wider european stocks a reading that s two standard deviations below long term averages yet again the big offset for many asset managers is the sectoral mix of uk equity indices and ftse100 in particular heavy in neglected so called value stocks such as banks that gain from higher interest rates and also commodity rich oil and mining firms boosted by geopolitical shocks and supply chain squeezes that s how lombard odier s chief investment officer stephane monier explains why his firm has retained its overweight in uk equities since early last year it had nothing to do with anticipation of the secular performance of the uk economy he said but he thinks that may now change at this stage i m becoming more cautious on the uk we are thinking about reducing that overweight to at least a neutral position monier said adding this was a long term rethink about the direction of the economy post brexit and may well be executed in the coming weeks and months beyond the relative ebbs and flows of inflation growth and interest rates in the months ahead monier said what unnerves him most is the lack of a coherent political plan to offset the losses to uk

save america and other republicans are fundraising off the mar a lago raid one of the fundraisers includes house minority leader kevin mccarthy s campaign fund some emails asked for at least 2 others asked for 45 a nod to his role as the 45th president former president donald trump is aggressively raising money off the fbi s seizure of confidential documents at his mar a lago home sending a blitz of emails that urge supporters to donate to an official trump defense fund the money is being solicited through a fundraising vehicle that can dump money into donald trump s leadership pac save america and to another fund make america great again pac which evolved out of his first presidential campaign trump is using the criminal investigation as an opportunity to motivate his supporters to stock war chests that already have more than 100 million he will be able to use the money in a variety of ways including opposing his political enemies and preserving and extending his already firm grip on the republican party some examples of what the former president sent to his followers in the days after the law enforcement actions include what recently took place at my mar a lago home was an unprecedented infringement of the rights of every american citizen the save america joint fundraising committee wrote on aug 12 which included the official trump defense fund logo at the bottom scam after scam year after year this political prosecution is merely a continuation of russia russia russia impeachment hoax 1 impeachment hoax 2 the no collusion mueller report and more he said a fundraising email sent aug 9 had the subject line the democrats broke into the home of president donald j trump the search was approved by a federal judge after the department of justice made a case that there was probable cause to believe a crime was committed answers to your questions what s happening at trump s mar a lago home was the fbi there what is save america trump s save america pac raised millions after the election here s what you need to know about it in the first 10 days since the mar a lago search trump and his allies sent out more than 120 emails explicitly raising money off the event there were at least dozens more referring more generally to things like a witch hunt or the left being out to get trump cocktail napkins raincoats and golf balls the vast majority were sent by the save america joint fundraising committee fifteen of the emails reference an official trump defense fund language that is strikingly similar to the official election defense fund that the house committee probing trump s role in the jan 6 capitol attack said likely never existed the save america joint fundraising committee did not immediately reply to a question about whether there was a segregated fund for money that comes in for the official trump defense fund or where that money goes information on fundraising and spending this month will not be available until they report to the federal election commission in september save america trump pac formed to push debunked voter fraud claims paid 60k to melania trump s fashion designer other fundraising emails came from the campaign arms of house republicans and senate republicans as well as funds affiliated with house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif rep steve scalise r la and sen marco rubio r fla every single dollar raised will go directly to fighting off the corrupt left and their lies an email sent tuesday said on wednesday an email promised a 1 300 match in donation amounts for one day only with text that claimed the fbi went on a wild goose chase looking for cocktail napkins raincoats and golf balls from the white house who is he magistrate judge bruce reinhart facing firestorm for signing mar a lago search warrant gallery fbi search donald trump s mar a lago home in florida not all emails explicitly say what the money will be used for and the amount raised this month will not be disclosed with the fec until september an inquiry to the save america joint fundraising committee was not immediately returned time and maybe fec records will tell there s nothing inherently wrong with profiteering off of galvanizing news and this is obviously very galvanizing for his base as long as it s going to the stated purpose said danya perry a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor in the southern district of new york perry said the official election defense fund was a cut and dried case because the jan 6 committee determined that the money largely did not go to election litigation time and maybe fec records will tell she said trump s vp pence expresses deep concern over mar a lago search asks for full accounting from garland she said trump could also run into trouble if he s raising funds not off of hyperbole but off false statements a fundraising email sent aug 9 had subject line the democrats broke into the home of president donald j trump the search was approved by a federal judge after the department of justice made a case that there was probable cause that a crime was committed bruce udolf a defense attorney and former prosecutor in the southern district of florida said the new official trump defense fund is entirely predictable and raises concerns if trump s doing it it s questionable he said daniel weiner a director at new york university s brennan center said it s common for people across the political spectrum to use the concept that a candidate is being unfairly persecuted when asking for donations and others have used the concept of a fund before recap fbi interviewed top trump white house lawyers in mar a lago document inquiry this is a particular fundraising tactic that the trump campaign has perfected he said fundraising emails promising matches are also common and in trump s case weiner said there s no indication the donations in the past have been being matched it s just a fundraising tactic weiner said ann ravel a democrat who served on the federal election commission said fundraising off of mar a lago is really unseemly he is turning it into a fundraising mechanism and also using it probably for his purposes of politicizing it and therefore advancing his own career ravel said which is why i think it has to be related to deciding to run again in 2024 and to rile up the base trump has not filed to run for election in 2024 but allies have called for him to take another stab at the white house and his fundraising emails regularly ask supporters if they would vote for him a third time money that ends up with save america can be spent for personal use from clothing to defense attorneys but cannot be turned back over to a potential campaign ravel said the make america great again pac is not a leadership fund see the documents read the fbi s search warrant for donald trump s mar a lago property erin chlopak a senior director for campaign finance at the nonprofit watchdog group campaign legal center said the influx of fundraising emails could be misleading at best and fraudulent at worst if the donations do not in fact go to trump s legal defense there s not necessarily a specific campaign finance law that prohibits general misleading fundraising she said but it s certainly a problem that we have seen for many years

august 19 2022 information clearing house responsible statecraft since russia invaded ukraine the united states has sent over 8 billion worth of military aid to support kyiv s war effort this massive arms transfer has included a wide range of weapons from anti armor missiles to helicopters and beyond with the constant flow of news about the war it can be hard to keep track of all these weapons packages so we at responsible statecraft decided to put together a timeline of every arms shipment that has been announced since the war began and whenever a new transfer is announced we ll update this page to reflect it before jumping into the timeline it is important to note a couple of things first this list only contains publicly announced information the pentagon has admitted to sending at least one type of missile that was never mentioned in their press releases so there s reason to believe that this list is not exhaustive second there are two different sources for these lethal aid packages one which has made up the vast majority of transfers to date is known as a presidential drawdown this means that the white house and pentagon agree to send weapons to ukraine from u s stockpiles after which dod can use the funds to replenish their stocks by purchasing new arms from defense contractors biden has used this authority an unprecedented 18 times in order to send weapons to ukraine with most of the funding coming from money that congress has set aside to arm kyiv the other source of weapons is the ukraine security assistance initiative or usai this is a special fund within the pentagon s budget that is used to purchase new weapons from contractors rather than drawing from existing stockpiles transfers from these funds do not require additional approval from congress without further ado here is a timeline of every major weapons shipment or funding package announced since february 24 august 8 the pentagon announced that it will send 1 billion worth of

the s p 500 slid 1 3 per cent to 4228 48 on friday in new york the firm pointed to what happened in 2008 when a then market recovery stalled just below the 200 day moving average the s p 500 went on to fall another 53 per cent before bottoming in march 2009 bringing the peak to trough decline to 57 per cent similarly the bear market of 2000 2002 saw several failed breakout attempts that ultimately resolved in a peak to trough decline of 49 per cent also worth noting is that the down trend was not broken in either of these episodes goldman sachs david kostin said in his weekly kickstart note that downside risks loomed renewed fears about the prospect of a recession would almost surely unwind the recent rally while the us economy has not entered a recession yet in 2022 our economists estimate the probability of a downturn during the next 12 months at about one in three in the event of a recession we forecast the index could fall to 3150 in contrast fundstrat global is holding fast to its bullish call for the second half our team is convinced that any positive catalysts or resolution of key macro issues could lead to a pretty fierce rally advertisement the character of the decline in 1h 2022 was not one of panicked desperation but rather orderly despite the extreme multiple compression that occurred in stocks with a high proportion of their net present value comprised of future earnings the pervasive bearishness on the street means that the amount of dry powder on the sidelines is also very high the latest weekly survey by the american association of individual investors found that despite the rally pessimism persists bearish sentiment expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 0 5 percentage points to 37 2 per cent the aaii said in addition bearish sentiment is above its historical average of 30 5 per cent for the 38th time out of the past 39 weeks the aaii said bullish sentiment continued to recover expectations that stock prices would rise over the next six months increased 1 2 percentage points to 33 3 per cent the highest level of optimism since late december however bullish sentiment remains below its historical average of 38 0 per cent for the 39th consecutive week the survey found

liberty latin america ltd lilak financial lila financial lilab financial is generating core free cash flow around 25 of its market value and buying back stock at all time low prices as investors have sent shares plummeting due to the bear market and the strength of the u s dollar the telecommunications company headquartered in denver has operations in chile puerto rico the caribbean and other

the company through super voting b shares in the last couple of years it has completed numerous acquisitions including the mobile business of at t inc t financial in puerto rico the following chart shows the geographical sources of revenue for the company source mergent malone and tci s spinoff of liberty media malone is a pioneering american businessman and investor in the media and telecommunications sector the early part of his career is highlighted in the 2002 book cable cowboy which documents the growth of tci telecommunications inc from its origination in 1958 when it was controlled by founder bob magness malone joined tci as a 32 year old ceo in 1972 during a period where most of the cable businesses had saddled themselves with huge amounts of debt tci s debt at the time was equivalent to 17 times revenue the growth story of tci where the stock multiplied over 900 fold between 1972 and 1998 prior to its sale to at t in 1999 is told in william thorndike s the outsiders it aslo focuses on three of malone s levers to generate outstanding shareholder returns usually to his own as well as his shareholder s benefit the first of these levers is the strategic use of debt in a thoughtful manner against long term cash flows at low interest rates and with lengthy and staggered maturity second the use of tri partite capital structures with a b and c class shares having respectively one 10 and zero votes per share malone invariably retains control through ownership of the b shares as is the case with liberty latin america the company has three separate classes of common shares which are traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbols lila class a and lilak class c and over the counter under the symbol lilab class b description ticker outstanding

transparent the valuation of individual components of the company this is best seen with liberty media where the entirety of the company s assets are attributed to three tracker stocks formula one fwona financial atlanta braves batra financial and liberty siriusxm lsxma financial as such you cannot buy stock in just liberty media liberty latin america is one of seven structures encompassing

purpose acquisition company liberty broadband lbrdk financial which owns 26 of charter chtr financial the second largest cable company in the u s balance sheet like most malone companies liberty latin america is highly leveraged its current balance sheet is illustrated in the chart below total debt is 9 4 billion with a weighted average cost of debt of 5 7 and a weighted average life of debt of five and a half years debt maturity is spread out and the management team has proven to be seasoned debt jugglers source company presentation cash flow the following chart shows liberty latin america s operating cash flows free cash flow and net income over the last five years as you can see net income is mostly at a loss operating cash flow is strong consistent and mostly on an upward trajectory free cash flow is erratic but now mostly positive the company has been booking large non cash charges due to amortization and depreciation as well as asset write offs the key numbers to focus on at present are the operating cash flow free cash flow and ore fcf core fcf orange line is free cash flow minus changes to working capital and stock based compensation core fcf is around 300 million with a market cap of 1 6 billion this works out to be around an 18 core free cash flow yield valuation given liberty latin america s strategy of focusing on operating and free cash flow it makes sense to try to value the stock through this lens gurufocus has devised a proprietary metric called projected fcf value to deal with situations where free cash flow is erratic essentially the metric takes 80 of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years the company s current projected fcf value is 10 82 i expect this number to improve in the years ahead though the region s recovery from covid 19 has delayed it a bit most of the value buildout is still to come as liberty latin america continues to expand its fixed mobile converged network in latin america demand for higher bandwidth data and mobile communication continues to increase eventually the area will settle into a oligopoly like market and all the major players will be producing lots of free cash flow you can already see that happening in the chart above with core free cash flow ramping up shareholder returns are likely to come from stock buybacks and not dividends the company is buying back shares as illustrated in the following table ticker company 3 month sharebuyback ratio 6 month sharebuyback ratio 1 year share buybackratio lila liberty latin america ltd 2 93 3 49 5 10 stock based compensation one thing to note is that liberty latin america is generous with stock based compensation for its executives as it has been ramping up quickly as of december 2021 the company had about 10 4 million outstanding shares granted as stock based compensation with an average strike price of 17 20 and a life of over three years the share price has to more than double for executives to make a meaningful profit as such i do not think potential dilution is much of an impediment for now and will not be an issue until the stock doubles conclusion arguably liberty latin america is a neglected stock it has been hit by a triple whammy of the covid 19 pandemic a strong u s dollar and the recent bear market the high debt is not really a problem currenty as in the right hands it creates enormous leverage for equity holders interest paid on debt is tax deductible and the cost of debt is usually a lot less than the cost of equity i do not know what malone s end game for liberty latin america is the company is still consolidating and building out like most telecoms the business is capital expenditure heavy but generates a lot of cash eventually it will have to transition from 4g to 5g in its territory which will require a lot of investment i expect in the next three to five years the company will settle into cash cow status generating steady cash flow and continue to buying back stock and paying the occasional special dividend a sale or merger with a larger entity is also a strong possibility

as smoke filled the skies over portland during the riverside and beachie creek fires in 2020 scientists from pacific northwest national laboratory gathered their air quality equipment to get a closer look at the air inside homes what the scientists found could help people keep the air inside their homes cleaner even as wildfire smoke season gets longer in the pacific northwest we found that even with a completely shut home we still had really high penetrations of particulate matter indoors said chrissi antonopoulos a senior analyst with pacific northwest national laboratory for a little more than a week scientists set up air quality monitors inside and outside a home in portland the monitoring stations collected data every two minutes for a few days that summer portland earned the distinction of the city with the most polluted air in the world the people inside the home which was built in 1928 kept all their windows closed and avoided cooking or other activities such as burning candles that increase air pollution indoors however the smoke particles found their way inside the scientists looked at the ratio of pollution outside to pollution inside which peaked at almost 80 antonopoulos said the old housing stock that we have here is not adequate to protect us from either extreme heat or large scale pollution events from wildfires she said our housing is old and leaky when the scientists added a portable air cleaner with a hepa filter to the home the inside air quality dramatically improved antonopoulos said however the air quality still showed unhealthy particulate levels diy ecology breathe better by easily making a clean air fan particulates from smoke can irritate people s respiratory and cardiovascular systems especially people with asthma copd and coronary artery disease wildfire smoke also is dangerous for children older adults and pregnant women moreover wildfire smoke often has a greater impact on people with a lower socioeconomic status according to an article from the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers journal keeping inside air clean often costs money antonopoulos said however some solutions cost less than others she suggested a few ways to keep air as healthy as possible when the skies fill with smoke make a space at home that s kept as smoke free as possible known as a clean room to do that seal off one room especially the windows plastic air sealing covers can make the windows more air tight and towels can work under the doors antonopoulos said keep the door shut as much as possible to do that seal off one room especially the windows plastic air sealing covers can make the windows more air tight and towels can work under the doors antonopoulos said keep the door shut as much as possible use a hepa grade air filtration system make sure the amount of air the filtration system cleans at a time fits the size of the room it s in save money by making a filter with a box fan the key is to have the highest filter possible antonopoulos said the key is to have the highest filter possible antonopoulos said keep the filter clean and change it every three months especially after long days with lots of smoke antonopoulos said manually check air filters to see if they look black and dusty avoid running window air conditioners as much as possible and turn off ventilation like in bathrooms that pull air inside air conditioners are just pulling sucking in the outdoor air indoors use them as little as possible just enough to get some cooling she said avoid creating other indoor air pollution such as cooking with a gas stove or burning incense or candles seal up attics foundations and windows for the long term with the help of professionals closing up tiny cracks can help keep out polluted outside air however antonopoulos said it can also keep polluted indoor air inside homes however more research needs to be done antonopoulos said to develop filtration technologies that are integrated better into central air systems new technologies also need to be accessible and affordable to everyone she said so we need to find technologies that aren t going to increase the energy burdens and that also can be distributed equitably antonopoulos said

the stench of corruption pervaded the triennial convention of unifor canada s largest private sector union which was held in toronto last week with the union s long time president jerry dias forced to step down in disgrace last march after being exposed as a covid profiteer the union top brass were desperate to put distance between themselves and his misdeeds but they made clear that they fully intend to uphold dias rotten corporatist legacy ensuring the global competitiveness i e profitability of canadian big business through concession contracts and staunchly supporting the pro war pro austerity trudeau government and the liberal new democratic party parliamentary alliance that sustains it in office lana payne beat dias hand picked successor scott doherty and unifor local 444 president dave cassidy in the race for unifor president payne who was celebrated by the corporate media as unifor s first female president cast herself as an outsider with a clean pair of hands in reality payne is part of the same bureaucracy as dias she served as national secretary treasurer under his leadership and as unifor s acting president after he was forced out in a scandal that she vainly tried to cover up there were no significant political or programmatic differences between the three candidates in the weeks prior to the convention they engaged in an unseemly factional squabble over who would control unifor s considerable resources this included leaking information that by right all unifor members should be privy to as a matter of course documenting the enormous expense claims of senior union officials in her concluding remarks to the convention payne declared we have truly come together this week to move our union forward you have shown that it is the union all of us together that can take on the challenges we face as workers this is disingenuous bluster the oblique reference to moving forward is aimed at giving the impression that now that that the bad apple dias has been removed for accepting a 50 000 kickback from a seller of covid 19 tests the union can put the corruption scandal to rest and carry on as normal in fact what the millions spent annually on the expense claims of senior unifor officials including for first class travel and five star hotel visits shows is it that it is standard practice for unifor bureaucrats to feather their respective nests at workers expense this corruption arises organically from the corporatist partnership unifor and its must important predecessor the canadian auto workers caw have forged with the detroit three auto bosses corporate canada and the state over the past four decades in the united states a dozen top united auto workers uaw officials including two former presidents have been sentenced to jail time for accepting kickbacks padding expense accounts and otherwise stealing from the workers they claim to represent payne s attempt to posture as just another rank and file worker is a brazen insult to the hundreds of thousands of unifor members in the auto auto parts aviation and other industries who have been forced to labour in deadly conditions during the covid 19 pandemic the convention was not about meeting the challenges we face as workers but rather the challenges confronted by payne and the unifor bureaucracy she now heads as they seek to contain and derail mounting worker demands for militant action to counter soaring prices employer demands for speed up and decades of contract concessions unifor s build back better collective bargaining program which deliberately echoes a slogan employed by the trudeau government and by the biden administration in the united states makes clear that one of the union s key tasks in the coming period will be suppressing workers wage demands unifor it declares will r efuse to accept any employer demands for pay concessions or any new two tier wage structures in collective agreements in instances where two tier wage provisions exist the union commits to consolidating pay structures to eliminate disparities between workers unifor s defiant posture is a fraud in recent months unifor has negotiated a slew of contracts with pay increases well below the current near double digit inflation rate furthermore if the unifor bureaucrats can beat their breasts about not accepting new two tier wage structures it is because the union has been complicit since its creation in 2013 and long before that as the canadian auto workers in imposing multi tier pay structures throughout canadian industry the fact that the bureaucracy intends to continue its support for low wage multi tier pay rates is underscored by the vaguely formulated commitment to consolidate pay structures to eliminate disparities between workers where multi tier pay scales already exist as autoworkers know only too well unifor eliminates pay disparities between workers by prevailing on older workers on higher pay and better benefits to accept early retirement so that an increasing percentage of workers are ensnared in the same substandard poverty wage structure the entrenchment of multi tier wage structures and removal of older legacy workers from the plants have been key elements in the caw unifor strategy to attract investments by slashing automakers labour costs and maintaining a canadian investor advantage based on the lower value of the canadian vis a vis us dollar reducing labour costs for auto manufacturers is a key component of unifor s new national auto policy which payne presented at a press conference august 11 the report calls for the federal government working in concert with ontario and other provinces to establish a national auto industrial policy and provide lavish subsidies to companies building electronic vehicles and ev components like batteries so as to ensure high profits stressing that canada is at an inflection point in the transition to evs payne trumpeted unifor s goal of making canadian capitalism a global leader in battery electric vehicle production unifor s role as a cheap labour contractor for corporate canada flows directly from the social position of the bureaucrats who staff the union apparatus living on their six figure salaries and corporate expense accounts unifor officials have far more in common with corporate executives and government ministers than they do with the workers they claim to represent fervent proponents of canadian nationalism and the interests of the capitalist state they work to secure a competitive advantage for their own businesses and investors in pursuit of this agenda unifor has developed a close partnership with the trudeau government from dias leading role in helping bring the liberals to power through the 2015 anybody but conservative campaign to his acting as a semi official trudeau government adviser during the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement dias and unifor advocate the same north america first economic protectionist strategy based on a strengthening of canadian imperialism s decades long alliance with us imperialism as does the dominant section of canada s ruling elite dias was also a champion of the ruling class s back to work campaign during the pandemic which protected corporate profits while endangering the health and very lives of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families following last september s federal election dias and unifor publicly initiated the call for a formal liberal ndp governmental alliance in march just weeks after the outbreak of the nato russia war over ukraine it materialized to the rapturous applause of unifor and the canadian labour congress in the form of a confidence and supply agreement under which the ndp has pledged to keep the minority trudeau government in power until june 2025 in the name of political stability the ndp is supporting a liberal government committed to waging war against russia rearming canada s military for further imperialist interventions around the world and making working people pay for this through post pandemic austerity and inflation driven real wage cuts payne and her colleagues in the unifor leadership have every intention of continuing the political course charted by dias this was underscored by the presence at the convention of federal labour minister seamus o regan who delivered a speech heaping praise on payne and committing to working with unifor in the future if a more senior government official was not present this was only due to a desire on the part of trudeau and his inner circle to maintain a certain distance from the discredited unifor bureaucracy as it sought to extricate itself from the dias corruption scandal the liberal government and its ndp allies desperately need the unifor bureaucracy to contain the ongoing corruption scandal so that they can focus on the key task the ruling elite has assigned to it suppressing the class struggle over the past year a series of militant strikes and worker protests have swept across canada from miners in sudbury to public sector workers in new brunswick ontario construction workers and cp rail workers over recent months unifor has sabotaged strikes by over 2 000 workers at passenger carrier via rail and grocery packaging workers at metro this resurgence of class struggle is only in its initial stages workers are being driven into struggle by rampant inflation caused by the pandemic s disruption of supply chains the massive sums the state has funnelled into the financial markets since 2020 to prop up the fortunes of the rich and super rich and the imperialist war on russia in which canada is playing a leading role in the weeks immediately ahead contracts will expire for over 250 000 ontario teachers and education support workers who are on a direct collision course with the hard right ford government around 400 000 public sector workers including health care workers and teachers are without contracts in british columbia where the provincial ndp government is determined to offload the full weight of the crisis onto the workers by imposing below inflation settlements unifor s task will be to ensure that industrial workers do not join this working class upsurge which must repudiate the liberal union ndp alliance and become an industrial and political working class counter offensive if it is to challenge capitalist austerity and intensified exploitation payne acknowledged the growing class tensions in canada during her opening report stating friends we are in a moment a moment of renewed labour militancy and we must seize this moment coming from the head of the unifor bureaucracy the pledge to seize this moment must be taken by workers as a threat more than anything else it amounts to a warning to the bureaucracy to be on its guard lest a movement of rank and file workers from below escapes the union s suffocating control and develops into an open rebellion against the entire big business establishment conditions for such a movement developing are increasingly favourable this fact has been underlined by the campaign that will lehman a mack truck worker from pennsylvania is waging for the presidency of the uaw lehman is fighting for the abolition of the bureaucracy the return of the uaw s vast assets to the control of the rank and file and the building of rank and file committees in every factory to unify american canadian and mexican autoworkers on the basis of an international strategy to fight for decent paying secure jobs for all despite the efforts of the uaw bureaucracy to suppress his campaign lehman was nominated by two worker delegates at the recent uaw convention and will appear on the ballot this fall workers in canada must lend their full support to lehman s campaign this means above all initiating a rebellion against the nationalist pro capitalist unifor bureaucracy through the building of a network of rank and file committees entirely independent of the union apparatus and capitalist political establishment

london a smaller dose of the monkeypox vaccine appears to still be effective and can be used to stretch the current supply by five times the european medicines agency said friday echoing a recommendation made earlier this month by the u s food and drug administration the eu drug regulator said in a statement that injecting people with one fifth of the regular dose of the smallpox vaccine made by bavarian nordic appeared to produce similar levels of antibodies against monkeypox as a full dose the approach calls for administering bavarian nordic s vaccine with an injection just under the skin rather than into deeper tissue a practice that may stimulate a better immune response people still need to get two doses about four weeks apart the ema said national authorities could decide as a temporary measure to use smaller doses of the vaccine to protect vulnerable people during the ongoing monkeypox outbreak eu health commissioner stella kyriakides said the decision would allow the vaccination of five times as many people with the continent s current supply this ensures greater access to vaccination for citizens at risk and health care workers she said in a statement earlier this month the u s fda authorized a similar plan to extend the country s monkeypox vaccine stocks the technique has previously been used to stretch supplies of vaccines during other outbreaks including yellow fever and polio us will stretch monkeypox vaccine supply with smaller doses the unusual recommendations from both regulators acknowledge the extremely limited global supplies of the jynneos vaccine originally developed against smallpox bavarian nordic is the only company that makes it and it expects to have about 16 million doses available this year on thursday the u s also announced a new agreement with a michigan manufacturer to help speed production of 5 5 million vaccine vials recently ordered by the government the ema authorized the vaccine in july based on experimental data that suggested it would work the world health organization has estimated the shot is about 85 effective at preventing monkeypox globally there are more than 40 000 cases of monkeypox of which about half are in europe earlier this week who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said there has been a 20 increase in cases reported in the last two weeks and that nearly all infections have been reported in men who are gay bisexual or have sex with other men tedros said who was in talks with vaccine manufacturers and countries to see if any might be willing to share doses africa has reported the highest number of suspected monkeypox deaths and although the disease has been endemic in parts of central and west africa for decades it has only a small supply of vaccines being used as part of a research study about 98 of monkeypox cases beyond africa have been reported in men who are gay bisexual or have sex with other men who said there is no sign of sustained transmission beyond men who have sex with men although a small number of women and children have also been sickened by the disease monkeypox spreads when people have close physical contact with an infected person s lesions their clothing or bed sheets most people recover without needing treatment but the lesions can be extremely painful and more severe cases can result in complications including brain inflammation and death in the u k which at one point had the biggest outbreak outside africa officials said earlier this week they have seen signs the outbreak is slowing down
a u s energy regulator on friday gave berkshire hathaway inc the company controlled by billionaire warren buffett permission to buy up to 50 of oil company occidental petroleum corp s common stock occidental s share price soared 9 9 closing up 6 41 at 71 29 after the federal energy regulatory commission ferc said letting berkshire add to its 20 2 stake was consistent with the public interest berkshire had applied to increase its stake on july 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers ferc regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil the share price of houston based occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following russia s feb 24 invasion of ukraine berkshire began buying occidental shares four days later buffett s omaha nebraska based conglomerate also owns 10 billion of occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of anadarko petroleum corp and has warrants to buy another 83 9 million common shares for 5 billion berkshire also ended june with a 23 7 billion stake in a larger oil company chevron corp buffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business said cole smead president of smead capital management inc in phoenix which owns occidental and berkshire shares buffett thinks it can make him wealthy berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to buffett s assistant occidental spokesman eric moses said the higher ownership limit was necessary because the company owned assets subject to ferc regulation it said the prior limit was 25 ferc s authorization does not require berkshire to buy any occidental shares some investors and analysts have nonetheless said berkshire could eventually buy occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the 26 5 billion purchase of the bnsf railroad in 2010 after berkshire had amassed a 22 6 stake morningstar analyst greggory warren said he liked occidental more as a wholly owned subsidiary under the berkshire umbrella because it would reduce occidental s costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility independent oil analyst paul sankey added that occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon capture projects included in the inflation reduction act signed this month by president joe biden i can see him taking the whole thing private sankey said referring to buffett smead in contrast said buffett is unlikely to buy all of occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover in the long run he may but you don t file something like this with ferc if you re planning it in the next six months smead said berkshire ended june with 105 4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net 45 2 billion of stocks in the year s first half buffett has pledged to keep 30 billion on hand occidental s market value was about 66 billion after friday s run up berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including geico car insurance see s candies dairy queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses at berkshire s annual meeting on april 30 buffett said he began buying occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation he also expressed confidence in chief executive vicki hollub who has been reducing occidental s debt she says she doesn t know the price of oil next year nobody does buffett said but we decided it made sense
by dr mark w hendrickson you know the old joke how can you tell when a politician is lying when his her lips are moving that extreme cynicism about politicians is reinforced by the recent passage of the so called inflation reduction act ira in addition to being the most egregiously misnamed act in memory more on that below the dishonest statements made by its supporters have been breathtaking in their brazenness senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny proclaimed that the ira will help every citizen in this country and make america a much better place his assertion encapsulates progressives ideological belief that america currently is not a good place and can be redeemed only by economic central planning also erroneous is his assertion that ira will help every citizen the truth is that the ira will benefit some americans at the expense of others the ira warps the rule of law by carving out privileges for special interests it replaces the general welfare role of the federal government as specified in the preamble to our constitution with corrupt cronyism the ira will raise taxes on corporations in several ways while funneling several hundred billion dollars of subsidies pork to energy companies in the gleeful words of the new york times the bill s climate provisions are mostly a collection of subsidies solar wind and nuclear power as for funding those subsidies by raising taxes on corporations it seems that in their zeal to undo president trump s corporate tax reductions proponents of the ira are overlooking the fact that the benefits of those reductions were skewed in favor of workers resulting in record levels of employment and income for blacks and hispanics raising corporate taxes are likely to undo those gains another example of the ira s preference for privileges over the rule of law is the act s grant of billions for a partial bailout of the likewise inaptly named affordable care act to help fund that bailout the ira authorizes prescription drug pricing reform a euphemism for hoped for price controls on certain pharmaceutical products such price controls utterly fail to address the root cause of today s high drug prices namely government involvement in the healthcare marketplace more double talk about ira came from senator joe manchin d wv whose crucial support for the bill provided the necessary vote for its passage several months ago i lauded sen manchin for refusing to support president biden s enormously costly build back better proposal i thanked him for placing the welfare of the country ahead of a partisan agenda i cannot say the same about him today manchin tweeted the inflation reduction act is the product of years of bipartisan conversations about the most impactful ways to produce more energy domestically bring down energy and healthcare costs and pay down our debt the ira achieves this without raising taxes wow where to begin at peeling off the orwellian inversions of that statement for starters manchin is trying to cloak the ira in a veneer of bipartisanship but not a single republican voted for it blame who you want but it was not bipartisan without raising taxes ira imposes a mandatory minimum 15 tax on corporations making more than 1 billion in a year ensnares any small business that makes use of private equity adds a new tax on corporate stock buybacks and finally adds tens of thousands of irs agents whose purpose can be nothing other than redirecting more wealth from the private to the public sector pay down our debt where have we heard that before such rhetorical sugar helps the bitter medicine of government expansion go down more smoothly when a bill is first enacted but somehow the rosy expectations never come to pass and government debt continues to swell bring down energy and healthcare costs here we see the common conflation of costs with prices under the authority of ira medicare and medicaid may indeed succeed in suppressing the prices of certain pharmaceutical drugs but that won t do anything to reduce the costs of producing such drugs it is premature to say with any degree of certainty what the impact of lower prices for drugs will be on the development of future drugs but the potential for harm is there as for reducing energy costs that s nonsense for several decades now progressives in the federal government have chosen to persecute the companies producing the cheapest and most reliable forms of energy i e fossil fuels while subsidizing more expensive less reliable forms of energy primarily wind and solar this has raised the cost of energy above what it otherwise would have been and ira continues on the same economically perverse path that brings us back to sen schumer s assessment how does making the cost of energy more expensive and supporting energy sources that place the electric grid at risk and result in brownouts and blackouts help every citizen and make america a better place my gosh 70 years ago we never worried about brownouts and blackouts now in states like liberal california and conservative texas residents have to worry about the lights going out those are just some of the distortions being woven around the ira let s now address the biggest whopper of them all namely the absurd claim that the act will reduce inflation the purpose of the ira is to expand government control over important parts of the economy and to siphon more wealth from the private sector to the public sector it has nothing to do with reducing inflation according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office an assessment shared by sen bernie sanders i vt who voted for the bill the reason for calling this piece of legislation the inflation reduction act of 2022 is that the party currently calling the shots in washington knows that the american people are ticked off and worried about inflation being over eight percent inflation caused by previous reckless government over spending they hope that economically ignorant americans will accept the name of the act at face value it s all marketing and p r the party in power is hoping to minimize electoral losses this november by getting some voters to believe that a new government tax and spend bill which the ira is will help to bring down inflation which the ira will not dr mark w hendrickson is a retired adjunct faculty member economist and fellow for economic and social policy with the institute for faith and freedom at grove city college

headquartered in the people s republic of china prc miniso purports to be a fast growing global value retailer which serves consumers primarily through its large network of miniso stores on october 15 2020 defendants held the ipo issuing approximately 30 4 million american depositary shares adss to the investing public at 20 00 per ads pursuant to the registration statement the miniso class action lawsuit alleges that the ipo s registration statement was false and or misleading and or failed to disclose that i defendants and other undisclosed related parties owned and controlled a much larger amount of miniso stores than previously stated ii as a result miniso concealed its true costs iii miniso did not represent its true business model iv defendants including miniso and its chairman

drastically drop its franchise fees on july 26 2022 market researcher blue orca capital published a report on miniso which alleged several issues with miniso including that contrary to s claims many miniso stores are secretly owned by executives or insiders closely connected to the chairman and ltimately we believe that there is overwhelming evidence that miniso misleads the market about its core business as blue orca explained ur suspicion is that miniso realized early in the pre ipo process that a brick and mortar retailer would be far less attractive to investors than an asset light franchise business so we think that simply lied about these stores blue orca added that chinese corporate filings also indicate in our view that the chairman siphoned hundreds of millions from the public company through opaque caribbean jurisdictions as the middleman in a crooked headquarters deal blue orca further concluded that ndependent evidence including archived disclosures on miniso s chinese website reports in chinese media and interviews with former employees indicate that miniso is a brand in serious peril noting that miniso lowered its franchising fee by 63 over the past two years in a desperate effort to attract franchisees on this news miniso s ads price fell nearly 15 as of july 27 2022 miniso adss closed at 5 66 per ads representing more than a 70 decline from the 20

former president donald trump gestures as he departs trump tower wednesday aug 10 2022 in new york on his way to the new york attorney general s office for a deposition in a civil investigation ap photo julia nikhinson supporters of brazilian president jair bolsonaro show a trump campaign flag during a re election campaign rally for bolsonaro in juiz de fora minas gerais state brazil tuesday aug 16 2022 bolsonaro formally began his campaign for re election in this town where he was stabbed during his 2018 campaign general elections are set for oct 2 ap photo silvia izquierdo if it wasn t certain before it s crystal clear now former president donald trump has a viselike grip over the republican party no allegation of impropriety or illegality no concern over stoking extremism and violence no documented trammeling of the rule of law can cut away at his seeming dominance over the american right this month it emerged that the fbi was investigating trump for his wrongful possession of classified u s documents including items allegedly related to the u s s nuclear arsenal the wholly partisan reaction to the revelations only boosted trump s stock driving millions of dollars in donations to his political action committee and fueling right wing outrage over the supposed overreach of the state meanwhile the results of a series of primary elections across the country most notably tuesday s landslide defeat of rep liz cheney r wyo by a trump aligned challenger reinforced how internal party opposition to trump has generally proven to be a political death sentence of the 10 republican lawmakers in the house who voted to impeach trump for his role in inciting the jan 6 2021 assault on the capitol only two even stand a chance to return to the chamber next year trump s hold over the republican party has led to the rise of a new crop of potential republican lawmakers who parrot the former president s 2020 election lies that has profound implications for the country s electoral processes according to an analysis published by the washington post this week nearly two thirds of gop nominations for state and federal offices with authority over future elections involve candidates who embraced falsehoods and conspiracy theories about the previous one and deny its legitimacy in the time since trump left office his sway over republicans has arguably grown a straw poll of attendees at the right wing conservative political action conference earlier this month saw enthusiasm for trump as high as ever if he chooses to launch a 2024 presidential campaign the bulk of the republican establishment is set to meekly line up behind him if you look at a political analysis there s no way this party is going to stay together without president trump and his supporters sen lindsey graham r s c said last year there is no construct where the party can be successful without him it s a state of affairs more familiar in other parts of the world than in the united states the wholesale capture of a wing of american politics by what is as cheney put it a cult of personality surrounding one demagogic leader has limited precedent in u s history but we can see current variations of the theme in among other places hungary under its illiberal nationalist prime minister viktor orban turkey under long ruling president recep tayyip erdogan and india under hindu nationalist prime minister narendra modi in all three countries the ruling faction in a parliamentary democracy has become a vehicle for consolidating the power of the figure at the top they are in different stages of their evolution erdogan s grip may be loosening with former allies defecting and forming new parties while modi and orban are more comfortably in control the leaders majoritarian demagoguery has led to the erosion of their democracies which critics argue have become to varying degrees quasi autocracies where media is cowed ethnic or religious minorities are bullied and the opposition marginalized this phenomenon is on show in other democracies dominated by illiberal factions as political polarization only deepens the incentives to retain power and punish one s opponents the republican party s zealous devotion to getting rid of anyone who challenges trumpian dogma feels entirely too familiar wrote academic brian klaas in a washington post column last year that noted how republican fealty to trump was mirrored by politicians in poland s ruling party who have weaponized conspiracy theories about the media and liberal establishment it s a litmus test are you a true believer willing to repeat the theory even if you don t believe it yourself klaas wrote if you are the party accepts you this sort of corrosive loyalty test has caused tremendous damage to poland s democratic institutions for the united states there s a long runway for further democratic backsliding some analysts believe it s necessary for the full weight of the judicial system to be brought to bear against trump even while others warn of the dangerous precedent it may set a considerable minority of americans buy into trump s narrative of victimhood and persecution by the democratic establishment trump s whole presidency was unprecedented countered ruth ben ghiat a historian at new york university and scholar of 20th century authoritarian politics he differed from past heads of state of either party in having zero interest in public welfare or consensus politics his goals were autocratic amassing power domesticating the gop and having his financial and other personal interests prevail over national ones in shaping domestic and foreign policy trump s republican critics have been demoralized by the extent to which the party s base has abandoned them and flocked to the trumpist banner maybe there wasn t going to be a tidal wave of people to come over but i certainly didn t think i d be alone rep adam kinzinger r ill said to reporters last week along with cheney kinzinger served on the house select committee investigating the jan 6 riot he is not seeking reelection in november now trump may see a path to override the institutional checks and the instruments of accountability set against him sean illing co author of the new book the paradox of democracy that traces the long history of democracies growing susceptible to would be authoritarians warned that the united states existing democratic guardrails may not hold if large numbers of republicans vote for people who explicitly promise to subvert the rule of law the only response is to persuade more people to resist it illing said the history of democratic decline is a history of demagogues and autocrats exploiting the openness of democratic cultures to mobilize people against the very institutions that sustain democracy itself
russia s invasion of ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from opec to us shale meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy with investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels people that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts he said at a berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021 familiarity buffett first invested in occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with chevron to buy its crosstown houston rival anadarko advertisement occidental chief executive vicki hollub flew to omaha nebraska on the company s gulfstream v and convinced buffett to add us10 billion to her war chest it was enough to swing the deal and chevron pulled out soon after in exchange buffett got preferred shares yielding 8 per cent annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at us59 62 apiece today with occidental at us71 29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than us900 million if exercised best of both worlds value play initially the anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up occidental s balance sheet with more than us30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic occidental s market value went from us50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than us9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed but on the flip side this created a good value play for buffett when crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by russia s invasion of ukraine occidental was best placed to benefit advertisement the stock is the best performer in the s p 500 this year up more than 140 per cent compared with the index s 11 per cent decline oxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure said bill smead who manages us4 8 billion at smead capital management and is a top 20 shareholder in occidental soaring crude prices mean they re now paying off that debt and gushing cash it s the best of all worlds cash too much cash has been berkshire s biggest investing challenge over the past few years the conglomerate had about us105 billion on hand at the end of june it is expected to generate about us8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to greggory warren of morningstar research services llc inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work occidental would work better as a subsidiary of berkshire than a stock holding given the volatility that exists in the energy commodity markets warren said advertisement this could end up though evolving into a slow motion takeover where berkshire buys up to the stakes that ferc allows it to acquire until it can acquire oxy whole profits over production occidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the permian basin the largest us oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just us40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend west texas intermediate currently trades at about us90 a barrel hollub has reined in the drill baby drill mentality that characterised shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritising profits over production free cash flow hit a record us4 2 billion in the second quarter the anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed occidental to lift its land holdings in the permian to 2 8 million acres 14 times the size of new york city s five boroughs combined it also added steady cash flowing assets in the gulf of mexico and algeria ceo is running the company the right way advertisement buffett has a good personal relationship with hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in omaha brokered by bank of america chief executive brian moynihan this year the veteran investor praised hollub after reading a transcript of occidental s february 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising i read every word and said this is exactly what i would be doing buffett told cnbc s becky quick on squawk box in march she s running the company the right way inflation reduction act advertisement the oil industry mostly criticised the inflation reduction act that president joe biden signed into law this month the us437 billion legislation discourages needed investment in oil and gas and offers the wrong policies at the wrong time the american petroleum institute said but hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill very positive that may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which occidental is a leading proponent the company has plans to build the world s biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as us180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air bloomberg

next week jerome powell will find himself facing down financial markets at the feet of the teton mountains in jackson hole wyoming each standing in the summer heat daring the other to blink first the market has been fighting the fed for around two months stocks tumbled friday to end what had been a four week winning streak but don t let that fool you the s p 500 is up 15 3 percent since june 15 spreads between junk bonds and ultra safe u s treasuries have narrowed dramatically mortgage rates have tumbled the yield on the 10 year treasury has fallen by 14 6 percent we expect that federal reserve chairman jerome powell will come to jackson hole next week determined to show the market the error of its ways first and foremost this will mean correcting the way investors react to incoming data from the fed s point of view a barn busting jobs number or a bigger than expected rise in retail sales is bad news not good news for example it signals the need for further tightening and indicates prior tightening has been less effective than expected powell will want to show the market that it needs to start interpreting signs of resilience in the economy as signs of persistent inflation that will be overcome with more tightening the delicate part here is that powell and his fellow fed officials are aware there is a risk of overshooting they do not want to lock themselves into hiking three quarters of percentage point at every meeting until inflation falls down to two percent because they believe monetary policy influences economic condition with long and variable lags they would like to take their time with future hikes which means smaller hikes and occasional pauses to give the economy time to react to that end powell is likely to reiterate what we read in the minutes of the july meeting namely that it is likely that the fed will slow the pace of hikes at some point in the future and that the pace of hikes will depend on incoming data what makes this tricky is that powell must be careful not to sound too dovish here leaving room for the market to interpret that the main risk to the base case of a raise and hold fed strategy is a fed cut as we ve seen in recent weeks this dovish interpretation can quickly become the base case if the market does not receive a stern pushback from the central bank actually in recent weeks the fed s pivot from hikes to cuts became the base case for many economists even in the face of stern pushback so powell will likely need to explicitly reject the idea of a pivot san francisco fed president mary daly previewed this in her remarks this week saying the fed was unlikely to quickly flip from raising rates to cutting rates powell will likely point out that the fed s projections released in june showed restrictive monetary policy extending into 2024 where once the fed s mantra was lower for longer now powell will have to convince markets that its compass points to higher for longer one big question mark will be how openly powell discusses raising into a recession or rising unemployment months ago powell seemed to indicate that he believed that much of the job of cooling the labor market could be done by cutting unfilled job openings rather than triggering layoffs does powell still think this if he says he does the risk is the market will believe the fed will flinch if it turns out monetary tightening is throwing americans out of their jobs by the estimates of some very well known economists unemployment may have to rise above five percent to bring inflation near the the fed s two percent target will powell signal agreement with that it seems increasingly likely that the u s economy will fall into an indisputable recession in the near term powell s speech will be the signal of how the fed will react to that too much optimism about avoiding a recession will likely convince markets that the fed will flinch if the downturn exceeds expectations the market will believe that powell will blink first
