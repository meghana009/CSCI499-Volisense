rendered as a video brighteon com 2a7fbd72 9868 4e7a 991f 353809de608a what will unfold as the vaccine genocide accelerates trending post vaccination death rates show that at least one third of those who are vaccinated will die over the next decade with multiple booster shots administered as much as half the global population could be eliminated via vaccines due to so called non covid deaths that the media will blame on a lack of medical staffing that s because these vaccines are deliberate depopulation bioweapons and they are being forced onto the population by globalists who believe they are saving the planet by urgently reducing the human footprint on earth s resources they are convinced this will bring the planet back from the brink of ecological collapse each day 30 million more human beings are vaccinated with gene altering cancer causing covid vaccines source ourworldindata org that means 10 million more people are condemned to death by lethal injection each day if this rate of mass vaccination continues through early 2023 it will mean that over half the world s population could be dead by the end of 2032 given the increased mortality rates we are seeing in early 2022 this mass die off will have catastrophic consequences on human civilization blue cities with high vaccination rates will collapse into mad max conditions stock markets will collapse nations will fall war

market participants are trading on the possibility that the fed might not go as hard as people think but only two things will stop the fed from bringing out the big wrench to tighten up loose monetary settings the us unemployment rate is 3 9 per cent already below the long term natural full employment rate of 4 per cent at which wages usually rise and stoke inflation bloomberg deutsche bank s chief us economist matthew luzzetti told the australian financial review that the fed would be looking at unemployment and financial market dysfunction between now and march the test for inflation at a generational high of 7 per cent is already too far gone first it would be back to back what i would call disastrous jobs reports between now and march with the unemployment rate rising he said advertisement the us unemployment rate is 3 9 per cent already below the long term natural full employment rate of 4 per cent at which wages usually rise and stoke inflation there is some nervousness the omicron variant with its related mandates for workers and school closures has stalled the stunning jobs recovery and may even have undone some of the gains but as luzzetti points out labour department reports would have to be disastrous for the fed to react to this factor fed chairman jerome powell has already indicated that with such high inflation the central bank does not even need a full employment scenario to lift interest rates off their historic low level the second factor is getting really sharp volatile and disruptive tightening of financial conditions in close proximity to that march meeting luzzetti says advertisement some suggest that tensions over ukraine and related sanctions on russia could trigger a financial crisis to which central banks already low on dry powder would have to respond with a more dovish approach to interest rates euan rellie managing director for investment bank bda partners says central banks have been known to get the jitters on geopolitical risks i think people recognise interest rates have to go up people recognise inflation is more persistent it s not transitory he says but conversely or perversely the fed typically turns a bit dovish when there s real geopolitical risk in the market rellie says conversely and perversely because geopolitical risk in the case of ukraine and russia is likely to further stoke inflation just the thing motivating the fed to raise interest rates in the first place ukraine is the third largest grain exporter in the world and russia is responsible for 35 per cent of europe s natural gas a war would further disrupt supply chains and feed through to energy and food inflation financial market functionality is also important for the fed advertisement so it may be interesting to watch whether the fed comes up a little softer on wednesday than we expected rellie says might even delay some of those interest rate or signal that they are potentially going to delay some of those interest rate rises bank of america analysts however say the fed should not be relied upon to support financial markets investors should not assume the fed will step in to placate volatile markets inflation is at multi decade highs and the unemployment rate is sub 4 per cent given the central bank s dual mandate tightening is wholly appropriate bank of america s equity and quant strategist savita subramanian said in a note to clients on tuesday wednesday aedt the much watched 10 year treasury yields rose 3 basis points in the last three hours of trading reflecting market expectations that the fed is not planning to go off script financial markets continue to price in four interest rate rises this year for luzzetti other than jobs and the financial market turmoil it seems close to a done deal that the fed is going to begin to raise rates in march

the standard poor s 500 index has dropped nearly 10 from its record set on the first trading day of the year the stock market is losing crucial support from the federal reserve omicron is causing havoc at businesses around the world and russia just might be preparing to invade ukraine creating more uncertainty and raising the prospect of even higher oil prices no wonder investors are freaking out and selling stocks the standard poor s 500 index has dropped nearly 10 from its record set on the first trading day of the year the biggest setback for wall street since its collapse when the pandemic first struck and the market s moves have been fierce amid the mounting uncertainty advertisement the s p 500 had four straight drops of 1 through friday the longest such streak since late 2018 the streak broke only after the s p 500 eked out a slight gain monday when a furious 11th hour rally erased what had been a 4 loss tuesday was another volatile down day for stocks for nearly two years investors had poured money into stocks confident that the federal reserve would help keep share prices upright the fed s super low interest rates and the rapid u s economic recovery from the pandemic induced recession made stocks a more lucrative bet than safer investments such as low yielding bonds the s p 500 more than doubled between its pandemic low in march 2020 and the end of last year advertisement but the fed is now threatening to end the party determined to cool down the hottest inflation in nearly four decades the u s central bank is moving away from its easy money policies and preparing to raise interest rates and that spells trouble for the stock market as rates rise bonds will look more attractive probably encouraging investors to shift money out of riskier areas of the market worse higher rates are likely to slow the u s economy reducing consumer spending and hurting the corporate profits that drive stock prices the prospect of higher rates is one reason the international monetary fund on tuesday slashed its forecast for u s economic growth this year to 4 from the 5 2 it predicted in october the unknowns are daunting the fed hasn t had to raise interest rates sharply to combat inflation since the early 1980s and policymakers have no experience in dealing with the aftershocks of a global pandemic omicron and other coronavirus variants threaten to disrupt business activity in unpredictable ways advertisement as if all that weren t enough tension over russia s threat to invade ukraine and the likelihood that the united states would retaliate with sanctions could send oil prices higher and put more pressure on the global economy investors don t see the volatility going away soon the vix index which measures how much investors are paying to protect against drops for stocks in the upcoming 30 days recently touched its highest level since october 2020 the heaviest losses in the market s swift readjustment have hit the big fast growing companies that had been the biggest stars of the pandemic amazon has lost nearly 18 since jan 3 and tesla has lost more than 23 netflix another pandemic darling is down nearly 39 advertisement the damage has been widespread with the most speculative corners of the market hit particularly hard bitcoin has fallen by more than 40 since hitting an all time high in november the smaller companies in the russell 2000 index many of which are losing money have lost 18 since peaking in early november and the meme stocks that rocketed higher almost exactly a year ago have also come down gamestop has lost nearly a third of its value so far in 2022 and amc entertainment is down 41 for those who ve been warning that prices were too high this looks like the overdue beginning of the end for a spectacular run advertisement today in the u s we are in the fourth superbubble of the last hundred years famed value investor jeremy grantham said in a recent report he says not only are u s stocks in a bubble but so are real estate and bonds grantham lays the blame squarely on the fed for keeping conditions too easy and encouraging prices to run too high just as he said it did before the 2000 dot com bubble burst and before the 2008 financial crisis how did this happen will the fed never learn grantham wrote now with the consumer price index showing inflation at 7 wall street sees the fed moving aggressively in the opposite direction investors are pricing in a 66 chance the fed will raise the short term rates it controls by a full percentage point this year a month ago those same investors saw less than a 35 probability of that advertisement at the same time they expect the fed to offload some of the trillions of dollars of bonds that it amassed through the pandemic to keep longer term rates low doing so would also have the effect of pushing up bond yields and tightening credit just as another rate hike would even before the fed starts tightening the u s economy appears to be losing momentum omicron and other variants can make americans warier about going out shopping reducing the consumer spending that drives 70 of u s economic activity continued virus outbreaks also risk disrupting factories and ports worsening existing supply chain bottlenecks and pushing inflation higher and the economy won t get a repeat of the massive government spending that fueled strong growth last year higher u s rates could also have global repercussions luring investment out of other countries especially in the developing world and destabilizing the world s financial markets advertisement while the european central bank is not expected to raise rates until well into 2023 bond market rates have started rising from very low levels indicating that investors think eventually the ecb will step up the pace of stimulus withdrawal as well compared with the u s europe s near term growth prospects have weakened amid high coronavirus cases from the omicron variant high oil and gas prices and continuing shortages of semiconductors and other parts that have hampered manufacturers particularly the auto industry higher rates just add to the risks and uncertainties fed tightening always breaks something michael hartnett bank of america s chief investment strategist wrote in a recent bofa global research report he s expecting stocks to fall in 2022 due to the rates shock in the early part of the year and then recession panic in the back half of the year advertisement others on wall street see the market s decline as temporary stocks have historically lost an average of 6 in the three months after the fed s first increase in a rate hike campaign but the s p 500 usually goes on to recover and return an average of 5 during the six months after the first hike according to goldman sachs associated press writer david mchugh contributed to this report

including future development costs fdc of 9 51 boe on a pdp basis and 18 44 boe on a 1p basis three year average f d including fdc of 17 08 boe on a 1p basis strong f d recycle ratios including fdc of

waterflood represent 84 of the company s 1p reserves and 78 of its 2p reserves the company is benefiting from ongoing material cost reductions for development drilling completions and workovers in the acordionero oil field gran tierra s largest oil asset the company drilled 20 development wells in acordionero during 2021 these new wells were drilled for an average cost of approximately 1 1 million per well a 27 reduction from the 2020 average and a 42 reduction from the 2019 average these new wells completion costs averaged approximately 0 7 million per well down 14 from the 2020 average and down 41 from the 2019 average the average 2021 workover cost of an existing well was 0 4 million per well down 53 from the 2019 average pdp reserves account for 59 of 1p reserves and 1p reserves account for 65 of 2p reserves demonstrating the strength of the company s reserves base and the potential future conversion of probable reserves into 1p reserves and proved undeveloped reserves into pdp reserves gran tierra s mature waterflood assets costayaco and moqueta continued to grow and deliver value with total reserves additions of 4 6 mmboe pdp and 4 8 mmboe 1p respectively fdc are forecast to be 382 million for 1p reserves and 578 million for 2p reserves increases in fdc relative to 2020 reflect that mcdaniel has now recognized 61 proved undeveloped future drilling locations up from 48 in 2020 and 94 proved plus probable undeveloped future drilling locations up from 81 in 2020 gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented during 2021 gran tierra achieved strong 148 pdp and 123 1p reserves replacement through our successful results from our development drilling waterflooding programs and field performance we completed our 2021 development plan on budget including waterflooding efforts and development drilling in the acordionero and costayaco oil fields as well as workover activities in the moqueta oil field the success the company achieved in 2021 also reflects our ongoing conversion of reserves from the probable to the proved category with 94 proved plus probable undeveloped future drilling locations gran tierra is well positioned to continue to grow the company s production in 2022 and beyond during 2021 a combination of our ongoing reductions in per well drilling completion and workover costs our focus on maintaining low operating costs and the strong rebound in oil prices drove significant increases in our nav per share after tax values to 1 59 per share 1p up 124 from 2020 and 2 92 per share 2p up 31 from 2020 with this significant growth in our nav per share values in 2021 we believe gran tierra is well positioned to potentially offer exceptional long term stakeholder value future net revenue future net revenue

thereof the company s operations including planned operations and developments the impact of the covid 19 pandemic and the company s response thereto disruptions to operations and the decline in industry conditions and expectations regarding environmental commitments the forward looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates rig availability the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or where applicable assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion and the ability of gran tierra to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned gran tierra believes the material factors expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity or local blockades or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products other disruptions to local operations global health including the ongoing covid 19 pandemic global and regional changes in the demand supply prices differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas including changes resulting from a global health crisis or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by opec and other producing countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions equipment performance and costs actions by third parties the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel volatility or declines in the trading price of our common stock or bonds the risk that gran tierra does not receive the anticipated benefits of government programs including government tax refunds gran tierra s ability to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under its credit agreement and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020 and its other filings with the securities and exchange commission these filings are available on the securities and exchange commission website at and on sedar at www sedar com statements relating to reserves are also deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions including that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future guidance is uncertain particularly when given over extended periods of time and results may be materially different although the current capital spending program and long term strategy of gran tierra is based upon the current expectations of the management of gran tierra should any one of a number of issues arise gran tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact gran tierra s results of operations and financing position in particular the unprecedented nature of the current pandemic and the resulting economic conditions may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release

with ni 51 101 and cogeh estimates of net present value and future net revenue contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effect of aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s reserves will be attained and variances could be material all reserves assigned in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are located in colombia and ecuador and presented on a consolidated basis all evaluations of future net revenue contained in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are after the deduction of royalties operating costs development costs production costs and abandonment and reclamation costs but before consideration of indirect costs such as administrative overhead and other miscellaneous expenses it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in this press release represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are estimates only references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is no precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil drilling locations disclosed herein are derived from the gte mcdaniel reserves report and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and or probable reserves as applicable well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume definitions proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned certain terms used in this press release but not

otherwise requires shall have the same meanings herein as in ni 51 101 csa staff notice 51 324 and the cogeh as the case may be oil and gas metrics this press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics including nav per share f d costs f d recycle ratio operating netback reserve life index and reserves replacement which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods nav per share is calculated as npv10 before or after tax as applicable minus estimated debt divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding management uses nav per share as a measure of the relative change of gran tierra s net asset value over its outstanding common stock over a period of time f d costs are calculated as estimated exploration and development capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and dispositions divided by the applicable reserves additions both before and after changes in fdc costs the calculation of f d costs incorporates the change in fdc required to bring proved undeveloped and developed reserves into production the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the financial year and the changes during that year in estimated fdc may not reflect the total f d costs related to reserves additions for that year management uses f d costs per boe as a measure of its ability to execute its capital program and of its asset quality f d recycle ratio is calculated as fourth quarter operating netback per wi sales volume divided by the appropriate f d costs per boe management uses f d recycle ratio as an indicator of profitability of its oil and gas activities operating netback is calculated as described in this press release management believes that operating netback is a useful supplemental measure for investors to analyze financial performance and provide an indication of the results generated by gran tierra s principal business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses reserve life index is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by the referenced estimated colombia production management uses this measure

commission sec rules and disclosure requirements of the u s financial accounting standards board fasb and those differences may be material ni 51 101 for example requires disclosure of reserves and related future net revenue estimates based on forecast prices and costs whereas sec and fasb standards require that reserves and related future net revenue be estimated using average prices for the previous 12 months in addition ni 51 101 permits the presentation of reserves estimates on a company gross basis representing gran tierra s working interest share before deduction of royalties whereas sec and fasb standards require the presentation of net reserve estimates after the deduction of royalties and similar payments there are also differences in the technical reserves estimation standards applicable under ni 51 101 and pursuant thereto the cogeh and those applicable under sec and fasb requirements in addition to being a reporting issuer in certain canadian jurisdictions gran tierra is

january 25 2022 the most successful chinese diplomatic and foreign trade efforts are the ones they want to keep out of the media spotlight to do that china is using a lot of cash and ingenuity to make it happen for example in the last two decades the number of jobs in the west for journalists in the traditional print media newspapers and magazines declined by about half the news business including most of its advertising revenue moved to the internet where there were fewer traditional journalism jobs and the pay was much lower chinese propagandists media experts and intelligence officials are skilled and well paid and quick to take advantage of this major change in western news media success was evident early on when china offered jobs to western journalists in chinese foreign news bureaus there were always many more qualified applicants than there were jobs and chinese propaganda officials used the applicant screening process to determine who would be most loyal and effective with working for china as the russians discovered during the cold war cash for compliance can be very effective for example the most important skill for western journalists reporting chinese activities inside china and overseas is to do it convincingly keep it legal but as convincing as possible the propaganda and censorship organizations in china have acquired and honed their skills working on controlling and censoring news within china including the internet adapting these skills to deal with foreigners especially westerners is sometimes difficult but over time very effective the impact of all this is considerable and most foreign media users don t notice the disconnect between what china wants to be reported and what is actually happening the propaganda is obvious to those who experienced something that chinese propagandists decided should not be reported on accurately or at all this often turns into some bad news in the west because a lot of people believe usually for economic reasons the chinese version make public comments that contradict what most of the audience believes to be true china persecution of their ethnic and religious minorities as well as illegal trade practices are two items the chinese media manipulation efforts seek to conceal when the contradictory public statements are criticized and ridiculed by local media the chinese know they can t make the problem unhappen but they advise or order the offender to just shut up and let memories of their mistake fade all this is nothing new ninety years ago nazi germany was in a similar position to china as an economically powerful country that was able to use similar coercions against foreign media the best is an example of how the nazis and chinese have both been successful in getting american movies and tv shows censored to eliminate anything that makes china look bad both chinese and nazis wanted such adjustments carried out convincingly and discreetly this approach didn t work for the russians because they had little economic influence due to their inefficient state controlled economy until the 1990s china had the same problem but in the 1980s chinese communists decided they needed a free market economy to compete with the west and made it happen while maintaining the old communist police state they had the example of the soviet union and other communist states that collapsed between 1989 and 1991 because a command state managed economy did not work chinese efforts to buy journalists and other influencers in the west also became visible as western counterintelligence efforts began to uncover the details of how china was stealing huge quantities of ip intellectual property as in new methods protected by patents or as trade secrets the most obvious corruption was in academia where much basic research was done academics violated a lot of laws against such ip theft and often expressed surprise when prosecuted for this because they treated the fees from chinese sources as legitimate while some western countries can resist these efforts in many less developed countries people bought will bought as long as you keep the payments high enough to cause substantial economic and psychological pain if halted the chinese media campaign in the west is one of their rare victories but they cannot boast about it because that would be admitting to violating numerous laws in western nations naughty younger brother some things have not changed in 2019 north korea admitted the obvious it never had any intention of surrendering its nuclear weapons the reality was that north korea was using its traditional negotiating tactic of offering to behave but only if they received some economic aid first as a show of good faith that tactic no longer works and now north korea is back to making threats the north korean nukes and military threats remain north korea continues falling apart economically and politically and that has led north koreans to do the unthinkable which includes openly criticizing the government putting anti government graffiti in public places and even attacking corrupt government officials including police north korea is bankrupt and not getting better covid19 made matters much worse because north korea was totally unprepared to handle it and responded by shutting its borders and restricting movement within north korea this crippled an already weak economy and efforts to deal with the threat of another fatal famine even the security forces were getting less food and the emergency military food reserve was used up big brother china is openly losing patience with its unruly neighbor china is literally north korea s economic lifeline china is the primary or only source for essentials like petroleum food and all sorts of smuggled goods past a long list of international sanctions china will tolerate a lot of bad behavior in return for obedience and maintaining order along the chinese border north korea is failing in both categories everyone looks to china because korea has traditionally been a chinese responsibility and most of the time a difficult one north korean leader kim jong un has obediently gone to china several times since 2018 to receive advice kim also met with the leaders of south korea and the united states so far lots of the right words but little action china and everyone else fears that north korea is going to try and scam its way out of another tight situation and risk the very real wrath of china while doing it inside north korea the official word is that nuclear weapons are essential and not negotiable unofficially more north koreans want a change of government or a way to get out meanwhile south korea continues to visibly prosper with gdp per capita that is more than 20 times larger than north korea being caught viewing videos of life in south korea or south korean video entertainment is now a capital death penalty offense in north korea naughty trade partners chinese efforts to punish uncooperative trade partners are getting more expensive the offenders range from tiny lithuania to australia south korea japan and the united states all of these nations have criticized chinese manipulation and refused to back down when china threatened retaliation for australia it s about some essential chinese imports natural gas and iron ore where alternative suppliers are hard to find for south korea and japan it s mainly trade in general but for japan there were a lot of economic investments inside china which have been quietly moving to other countries often at a loss china seeks to retaliate against any trading partner who resists chinese demands two recent examples are tiny lithuania and much more formidable australia which is a major trading partner that china cannot afford to lose completely china has been putting more pressure on australia for years and that has forced china to accept that they will have to pay more for iron ore and natural gas two major imports from australia china is not only losing current trading partners but is having problems finding new ones for example china is called out by the african government for corrupt acts and being forced to find other sources for raw materials they thought they had a lock on there are different problems with lithuania which incurred chinese wrath by refusing to comply with demands that lithuania stop trading with taiwan lithuania further angered china by quickly withdrawing its diplomats before china could change their status and remove diplomatic immunity china cut trade activity with lithuania but that was so small it was not a problem for the target china is really angry now and is trying to impose a secondary boycott against lithuania by threatening eu european union nations to suspend trade with lithuania that is not having the desired effect as many eu trading partners are pushing noting how successful this has been for the united states which began doing it five years ago opposition politicians in america criticized this but were wrong and now the west largely accepts that fact that china needs them more than the other way around the only trading partners china can still successfully bully are russia pakistan north korea and several even smaller volume trading partners naughty economic realities propaganda and a police state cannot make china s fundamental economic problems go away this is mainly about the size of their 117 trillion government debt which is nearly four times the size of the u s debt china has the second largest economy in the world at 18 trillion that means their debt is six times gdp while the american debt of 29 trillion is 1 26 times gdp it s worse when you take population size into account china has about four times the population of the u s meaning the average chinese has about 16 percent of the income of an american while carrying far more government debt per capita much of that debt comes from millions of housing units built by local governments that not enough chinese can afford or will not consider because many of these ghost cities are far from where the jobs are another source of bad debt is foreign nations china loaned billions to for its belt and road projects more of them than expected are defaulting on these debts all of these defaulted properties still have to be maintained or they will become unusable ruins china may have to cut maintenance on a lot of these high rise apartments and townhouses because the government is trying to avoid the bankruptcy of many large property companies and associated firms by making chinese as individuals pay it china is raising taxes which are fees and other contributions it can compel citizens with money to pay most of the debt is internal because foreign lenders were aware of the problem and least acted on the chinese debt bubble before the chinese government did china wants to maintain its international credit rating otherwise exports will be less profitable and imports will cost more internally institutional bond holders will have to eat absorb a portion of bad debt in order to spare the millions of individual chinese from suffering major losses this is preferable because the chinese economy depends on consumer spending while this approach maintains popular faith in the financial system chinese institutional investors banks insurance companies investment funds and endowment funds will struggle to survive and if any of these institutions fail many individual chinese will see the value of their insurance and stock market holdings shrink the government insists it has this debt disaster under control but they don t china is attempting to use a high risk solution to the problem despite being a dictatorship they are learning that there are many financial realities they cannot just impose a solution on china had studied what happened in russia in the late 1980s as the soviet economy fell apart because senior leaders did not really understand what they were dealing with china learned from that but failed to take into account that organized corruption at the provincial level was worse in china than in russia over the last decade the central government has become aware of this and the extent of it many provincial and central government officials responsible have lost their jobs and a growing number are being executed or sent to prison chinese leaders believe that they can deal with the current mess mainly because there is no alternative they note that western democracies also pile up huge government debt for political reasons the american government debt has more than doubled in the last decade because of that democracies are better able to deal with these crises while a market government ruled by a dictatorship is not the chinese bond market is the second largest in the world after the united states with debt quality the ability of debtors to repay is a major factor the quality of chinese debt is much lower than the u s or the west in general and the extent of this problem was deliberately hidden by debtors especially local governments for decades this makes a chinese real estate bubble far more dangerous than previous ones encountered in major economies the government has other problems because covid19 caused more unemployment and bankruptcy of chinese firms dependent on export sales transportation firms have taken major losses because s ince covid19 first appeared in late 2019 china has taken extraordinary measures to reduce overseas travel by chinese and visits by foreigners by mid 2021 air passenger traffic in and out of china had declined 98 percent compared to the same period in 2019 some airlines have been able to get more air freight work but not enough to make up for the lost passenger traffic this foreign travel ban continues because the various mutations of covid19 get back into china via foreign travel some must be allowed but 98 percent of it has been declared expendable the keeps a lot of chinese consumer spending that normally goes to tourism at home where is more desperately needed another embargo has been placed on information in late 2021 new laws were introduced that punished those who report information the government disagrees with that means it takes longer for the details of high level corruption of government approved financial misbehavior to reach foreigners and most chinese a financial system collapse would be impossible to hide which is the main reason a major government debt management official was executed a year ago as the government declared the debt crisis a matter of national security that explains the emphasis on maintaining chinese morale and faith in their government while trying to make foreigners absorb a larger portion of the debt in this case the national security threats are both internal and external the foreign bond holders can fight back and that is why a lot of foreign firms are pulling manufacturing operations out of china for the international community china is not considered a reliable trading partner january 21 2022 china is currently negotiating with the west african nation of equatorial guinea to build maintain and use a naval base for chinese warships operating in west africa and the atlantic the chinese offer includes large loans and large bribes for local officials similar deals are being made with myanmar burma china already has bases in northeastern africa djibouti and pakistan january 24 2022 down south in cambodia commercial satellite photos show chinese dredging ships at work in a cambodian port that is apparently going to be a naval base for china in november 2021 chinese leader xi jinping clashed with several other national leaders at a special virtual teleconference china asean association of southeast asian nations meeting this event was to commemorate three decades of chinese relationships with the association members the philippines accused china of using intimidation to conquer and take control of the south china sea specifically the filipino leader accused chinese coast guard vessels of using water cannons to prevent filipino ships from resupplying the small military garrison on a grounded lst at second thomas reef xi responded that the coast guard vessels were protecting chinese territory xi ignored international treaties and a 2016 ruling by an international tribunal that the chinese claims were false most asean members agree with the philippines and the 2016 court ruling but china responded by demanding that outsiders like the united states do not interfere with a local issue china has put a lot of economic and diplomatic pressure on asean members to either back china or not openly oppose chinese efforts to take possession of the south china sea founded in 1967 by indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand asean has since then expanded to include brunei burma cambodia laos and vietnam most of these nations oppose china s claims in the south china sea china long had a staunch and paid for cambodian ally in asean cambodia blocks attempts to unify and oppose china xi also clashed with other asean leaders over the absence of myanmar at this meeting that was because china and asean disagree over the legitimacy of the new myanmar military government which forced out elected leaders in early 2021 because those officials wanted to reduce the power of the military and chinese interests inside myanmar cambodia is not as staunch ally as china would like and the failure to get asean to support the new myanmar government was a very public rebuke of china for its use of outlaw tactics january 23 2022 off taiwan 29 chinese military aircraft flew into the taiwan adiz air defense identification zone without identifying themselves worldwide foreign aircraft identify themselves when reminded that they have entered an adiz chinese military aircraft approach or enter the taiwan adiz without warning and that often means taiwan sends up fighters to double check adiz intrusions have increased sharply in 2021 with about a thousand chinese military aircraft taking part in dozens of adiz violations the 2021 activity involved a lot of specialist models like asw anti submarine warfare aircraft like the american p 3 as well as a lot of ew electronic warfare and elint electronic intelligence aircraft there was also an appearance by the new chinese sead suppression of enemy air defenses aircraft the j16d specialized sead aircraft were first developed over half a century ago by the united states and nicknamed wild weasels the latest american sead aircraft is the f 18g most of the intrusions are carried out by fighters and a growing number of bombers january 22 2022 india has seen less chinese activity along their common border but is still dealing with china because china backs the military government in myanmar burma and india is trying to avoid becoming involved that has proved difficult to do india has a 1 4oo kilometers border with burma and long had problems with tribal separatist rebels in the northeast india finally worked out peace deals with all the rebels before the pro india elected government in burma was ousted in february 2021 the burmese army war with northern tribes resumed because the army is seen as the main reason for all the corruption and illegal chinese economic activity in the north over a year later there is a lot more fighting in northern burma and a lot of refugees fleeing to india many of the refugees belong to the same tribe that straddles the border a lot of non tribal burmese entered as well and india sought to stop those refugees to avoid more trouble with china this led some of the separatist tribal gunmen in india to use force to block indian efforts to curb the flow of refugees january 16 2022 the philippines received another gift of military equipment from china the recent donation is for construction and transportation equipment in the past there have some donations of weapons and ammo for defeating leftist rebels and islamic terrorists most of the 21 million in donations over the last decade have been non combat gear china sees this as a sales tactic to generate sales of vehicles and construction equipment and that has produced more sales of chinese equipment to the philippines january 6 2022 lithuania was one of the first nato countries to realize that china was a major threat to nato and european nations in general china is accustomed to compliance from eu european union nations china makes requests suggestions or demands backed up by economic and diplomatic retaliation that usually works with even the largest eu states the baltic states are different as china discovered when they demanded that lithuania bar taiwan from opening an unofficial embassy as a representative office in lithuania this came after lithuania opened a similar office in taiwan this should have not been a surprise because lithuania had long been critical of chinese imperialism and tendency to use threats to silence foreign criticism or support for taiwan lithuania had long been critical of chinese mistreatment of their non han ethnic chinese citizens especially turkish moslem uyghurs and tibetan buddhists lithuania also took the lead among eu nations by investigating the security implications of new chinese communications technology particularly what telecoms giants xiaomi and huawei these two firms sold smartphones that contained hidden features that can be turned on or off from china and export user data to china or governments that request access to these features there are also accusations of huawei network hardware and software having similar capabilities china thought economic threats would work because in the last decade chinese trade with lithuania has grown to nearly 2 billion which is five percent of lithuania foreign trade china stands ready to advise and assist opposition political parties in lithuania seeking to replace the current government that may also backfire because the latest chinese move was to downgrade the lithuanian embassy in china to a lesser status that would include lithuanian diplomatic personnel losing their diplomatic immunity before that could happen lithuania flew all its diplomatic personnel out of china and declared their embassy temporarily closed china was not amused and fellow eu nations were impressed more attention was also focused on growing chinese misbehavior in europe something few of the larger eu members were willing to raise much less call out china on these matters january 5 2022 illegal iranian oil exports to china during 2021 were way up this enabled iranian oil smugglers to ship and sell 40 percent more oil than in 2020 that s 123 million more barrels of oil sold at a discount from the world price for legal oil to countries like china syria russia and venezuela in 2021 the u s halted enforcement of the oil export sanctions in the persian gulf which made it possible for smugglers to sell discounted iranian oil to arab persian gulf countries mainly the uae where that oil could then be exported as arab oil to distant customers iran has a fleet of tankers most not owned by iran that handle the smuggling and american efforts to track and sanction these tankers declined as did the number of times smuggling tankers were detected but not intercepted because of this iran had several hundred million dollars of oil income that was apparently used mainly to sustain iran sponsored violence overseas january 3 2022 china has complained to the un that american firm spacex has put too many of its starlink satellites into leo low earth orbit and one of them recently came too close to a new chinese space station china wants spacex to do something about that and demands that the un declare starlink a danger to orbital traffic and regulate the number of satellites spacex can put into leo for its starlink internet service starlink is but the latest irritation from spacex china is trying to recreate the reusable boosters that make spacex launches so much cheaper without making their launch services even more unreliable that spacex from a military point of view starlink is a major problem because china has been creating anti satellite weapons that could cripple a conventional satellite communications and surveillance system it would be much more expensive time consuming and uncertain to cripple an leo network that is built around the concept of surviving major damage and continuing to operate the chinese solution is to go after spacex from many directions using bribes intimidation propaganda and litigation to take down a major unexpected threat january 1 2022 western neighbor kazakhstan experienced major protests over economic issues especially the doubling of the price for diesel and gasoline kazakhstan is a major producer of oil and natural gas but most of what the government makes from that is stolen by the corrupt politicians who have run the country since 1991 the first such kazakhstan dictator was nursultan nazarbayev he was a former soviet era official who maintained the soviet era political controls that included keeping kazaks from enjoying much benefit from the booming post 1991 economy after more than a decade of poor economic performance and growing privation for most kazaks public protests became a common occurrence increasing in size and frequency each year between 2018 and 2021 the number of protest demonstrations went from less than fifty a year to over a thousand in 2021 in 2019 nazarbayev resigned and was replaced by a trusted associate kassym jomart tokayev who was actually a reformer and sought to change the laws and operation of the government to increase living standards for most kazaks this plan was disrupted by the arrival of covid19 at the end of 2019 without covid19 and the global economic recession it produced the tokayev reforms might have worked instead the number of protests kept increasing and by 2021 threatened to bring down the government nazarbayev saw this possibility early on and sought to avoid a successful popular uprising by having kazakhstan join several economic and security agreements with russia and a few with china tokayev invoked the csto collective security treaty organization agreement csto was formed in 2002 with russia kazakhstan belarus tajikistan kyrgyzstan and armenia agreeing to support each other in security emergencies within a week a csto peacekeeping force of 2 500 troops began arriving in kazakhstan most of the ctto forces were russian and all of them were used to replace kazak troops who were protecting economic and military installations the kazak forces were sent to help suppress the increasingly violent protests that appeared to work and a week after arriving the cato forces began to leave with all of them to be gone by the 19th meanwhile more kazak security forces confronting the demonstrators were ordered to open fire if necessary to suppress the most violent demonstrators that apparently worked as did tokayev removing some nazarbayev loyalists from senior government positions and taking control of organizations that nazarbayev controlled via men he controlled nazarbayev was now completely replaced and vulnerable to being prosecuted for all the economic and political crimes committed between 1991 and 2019 one of the protestor demands was that nazarbayev be punished tokayev still has to deal with the fact that over 200 protestors were killed nearly 3 000 are in jail and most of the protests have ceased as kazaks wait to see what tokayev does next the five new nations of central asia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan are generally run by soviet era officials since 1991 these men are happy to see russia returning to its traditional police state ways nazarbayev played both russia and the united states off each other for various types of support all three countries have one thing in common and that is opposition to islamic terrorism thus in 2011 kazakhstan sent some counter terrorism troops to afghanistan so far kazakhstan has kept islamic radical groups under control as in chased them out of kazakhstan and wants to keep it that way nazarbayev like the other central asian dictators expected to eventually face rebellion fueled not by islamic conservatism but anger at corruption and a lack of jobs russia stands by to help out in return for loyalty tokayev now owns that debt the five stans of central asia have another option china the stans have been very receptive to chinese diplomatic and economic cooperation this bothers russia but not to the extent that threats are being made as was the case with the former imperial provinces to the west the stans also have a problem with never having been democracies when the russians conquered them in the 19th century the local governments were monarchies or tribes when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 locals who were former soviet officials held elections and manipulated the vote to get themselves elected president for life but many people in the stans want clean government and democracy as well as continued independence from russia china is no help with that because the chinese prefer dictators december 29 2021 in congo china is losing some very valuable assets as congo investigators continue to probe the so called china deal which was meant to trade congo minerals for infrastructure projects built by china the overall deal is worth billions published estimates run from 6 8 to 10 billion former president kabila was supposed to leave office after the 2016 elections selected a new president he could not run again and was unable to get the constitution changed he was forced to allow elections at the end of 2018 but was able to rig the vote to get someone willing to cooperate with the corrupt system kabila wanted to keep going that did not work during 2021 the mining contracts kabila agreed to with china were being audited and evidence of extensive wrongdoing by kabila and china were documented china is losing those contracts so kabila is very much on the defensive as are his cronies in parliament and the courts the misdeeds of kabila were the reason congo was facing widespread chaos and civil war that is made worse by the ongoing ethnic divisions december 28 2021 one of china s many enemies the philippines is now engaged in a regional arms race their navy recently ordered two 3 200 ton corvettes from south korea each will cost 227 million and both will be delivered by 2026 because of the threat from china the philippines has been seeking to obtain six new frigates corvettes and so far has ordered four of them from south korea the first two were ordered in 2016 these were 2 600 ton jose rizal class ships and both now in service with the philippine navy for the philippines military spending is modest but as a percentage of gdp it is about one percent in contrast the united states was spending 3 7 percent britain

on monday the u s supreme court issued a highly anticipated ruling in an employee retirement income security act erisa lawsuit known as hughes v northwestern university in the ruling the supreme court explains that the act of determining whether petitioners state plausible claims against retirement plan fiduciaries for violations of erisa s duty of prudence requires a context specific inquiry of the fiduciaries continuing duty to monitor investments and to remove imprudent ones as articulated in tibble v edison international the tibble case which the supreme court ruled on in 2015 similarly involved allegations that plan fiduciaries had offered higher priced retail class mutual funds as plan investments when materially identical but lower priced institutional class mutual funds were available as summarized in the new ruling the tibble order concluded that the plaintiffs in that instance had identified a potential violation with respect to certain funds because a fiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its investments the new ruling states that tibble s discussion of the continuing duty to monitor plan investments applies in the northwestern case such that the 7th u s circuit court of appeals erred in concluding that the defendants provision of a broad choice of investment options was enough in itself to insulate them from fiduciary liability claims related to individual investment options now the case has been remanded to the 7th circuit which could in turn either remand the case again to the district court or choose to rule another time without further input from the trial court settlement is also a possible outcome commenting on the implications of the new supreme court ruling nancy ross a chicago based partner in and co chair of mayer brown s erisa litigation practice says it is not what she would call a groundbreaking or major ruling despite some of the early headlines that have already been written suggesting this case is a really big deal in fact i view this as a limited ruling ross says what i mean is that the supreme court did not reach any specific or detailed conclusions that any of the investments offered by the defendants in this case are actually inappropriate nor did the justices come down and say a fiduciary can never offer retail shares of funds within their institutional retirement plans instead what they said in a nutshell is that the 7th circuit simply did not give enough consideration of the duty to monitor precedents set by tibble one arguably new but again not groundbreaking affirmation given by the supreme court ross says is that a retirement plan fiduciary cannot simply put a large number of investments on its menu some of which may or may not be prudent and assume that the large set of choices somehow insulates the plan sponsor from the duty to monitor and remove bad investments in other words having a large investment menu does not itself protect a plan sponsor who permits an imprudent investment to persist and sponsors similarly cannot hide behind the fact that participants ultimately choose in which funds to invest their money this is not really even a new position for the supreme court to take ross says thanks to tibble and other cases we already knew that fiduciaries cannot be asleep at the switch and say they are just going to offer every investment option under the sun and assume everything will be fine from a fiduciary perspective ross says the ball is now firmly in the 7th circuit s court and she does not expect the judges on the circuit to suddenly change their point of view about the merits of this case they could for example revisit the factual record and conclude after a more thorough review that expressly incorporates tibble precedents that the defendants in fact behaved prudently i think we all have to keep in mind that the 7th circuit has consistently taken the position that a retirement plan fiduciary does not have a duty to be overly paternalistic ross says in its view if you offer a range of good choices and then let your participants set their own allocations or rely on your choice of a prudent default then you have done your job as a fiduciary of course you can t put in clearly horrible investment option but good fiduciaries already know this ross says the new ruling can be interpreted as modestly expanding tibble she says the hughes v northwestern university case has reaffirmed that fiduciaries have an obligation to continuously monitor all the investments on their menu regardless of the menu s size and to remove any that become imprudent again based upon tibble you cannot simply line up your plan with a lot of choices and think that you have done your job ross reiterates that s the key takeaway here participant choice is not going to eliminate alleviate or insulate fiduciaries from their duty of prudence while she expects the plaintiffs bar to interpret this ruling as a victory for their cause ross does not see it that way nor does emily costin a partner in the erisa litigation practice team at alston bird in washington d c my viewpoint is that this new opinion does not move the needle so much in terms of the actual law costin says the supreme court sent the case back down to the 7th circuit to reconsider it did not say the plaintiffs are right and that this matter is settled it ordered the lower court to reconsider whether the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged their allegations and that remains to be seen costin says she has homed in on a few key passages in the supreme court s short ruling including a section on page five which speaks to the concept of fiduciaries duty to remove imprudent investments within a reasonable time frame from a practical standpoint i already get a lot of questions along this line regarding for example how long an investment should be kept on a watch list before removing it costin observes is a reasonable time frame one quarter of poor performance is it two or three or more of course as practitioners we know the answer is always going to be fact specific but i think this may be a point of difficultly in interpreting this opinion fiduciaries want to move in a timely manner to address any problems that arise but on the other hand they don t want to just be constantly churning their investment menu because that is not healthy either costin says she can imagine this opinion inspiring some plan fiduciaries to shrink their investment menus with the idea of making their duty to monitor each investment option that much easier to meet but she does not expect that will be a widespread course of action plan fiduciaries should remember that there are already well established fiduciary best practices upon which they can confidently rely costin says one of these best practices is that committees meet quarterly for their investment and plan reviews for example this time frame isn t defined by the law but rather by the context in which fiduciaries operate when there is not a clear definition or requirement under the law or legal precedents fiduciaries should look at the reasonable best practices that have been established in the marketplace like ross costin says the supreme court s ruling can also be seen as comforting to plan fiduciaries as it recognizes the challenging position they are put in that line goes as follows because the content of the duty of prudence turns on the circumstances prevailing at the time the fiduciary acts appropriate inquiry will necessarily be context specific at times the circumstances facing an erisa fiduciary will implicate difficult trade offs and courts must give due regard to the range of reasonable judgments a fiduciary may make based on her experience and expertise andrew oringer a partner in dechert s erisa and executive compensation group in new york city agrees wholeheartedly about the importance of this final line it is important to acknowledge and understand that this is a narrow decision oringer says the supreme court justices took a look at the 7th circuit s decision and basically said the only thing they can tell us in this matter is that a broad investment menu is not automatically a prudent menu under the precedents set by tibble so it is not groundbreaking he says that the supreme court in this unanimous decision did not take the opportunity to act as traffic cop in giving the rules of the road for the establishment of investment menus under 401 k plans a future supreme court ruling very well could do so he expects but this ruling has not oringer says that taking a step back the new ruling calls to mind another precedent setting case fifth third v dudenhoeffer this is because the early interpretation of that ruling seemed to suggest it would cause more stock drop cases to be filed and to succeed in court basically because it did away with a longstanding presumption of prudence that had previously been applied to the provision of employer stock within dc retirement plans but in reality because of other passages in dudenhoeffer the opposite has happened and successful stock drop cases have become exceedingly rare going back to dudenhoeffer so many people thought that case would cause an explosion of stock drop lawsuits oringer recalls in reality the situation was so much more nuanced and the pleading standards that ultimately emerged in the wake of that case are very difficult for plaintiffs to get over i actually think a similar thing could ultimately happen here

still hounded by short sellers precisely because of the possible sheer magnitude of the discovery our pick for the world s most exciting onshore play in recent history and possibly the last we will see has just updated shareholders on the prospects for its next 3 6 well drill campaign in namibia reconnaissance energy africa reconafrica tsxv reco otc recaf is nearly finished with the initial interpretation of its massive 450 kilometers of 2d seismic data for namibia s kavango basin and the company says it s already delineated a diverse group of high quality prospects for the drill campaign in a january 20 press release reco also said it had appointed two new directors to its board craig steinke as executive chairman and dr joseph davis in the meantime reco has designed another huge 500 kilometer 2d seismic acquisition program which has been submitted to the local authorities for approval and is slated to start by the end of february as soon as all permitting is approved by the namibian government we ll see the detailed drilling schedule for the first half of this year we believe the first well will be spudded in q1 and reco s ambitious esg project elements are moving full speed ahead with the company s 1 million covid vaccine support program for the namibian government so far ensuring over 8 000 first dose vaccinations over 1 200 second dose vaccinations and 100 boosters for hard to reach remote villages and settlements in kavango east and kavango west so far a total of 52 of a planned 81 villages have seen covid vaccination outreach from here on out we expect the q1 news flow to gain significant momentum as the anticipated seismic interpretation delineates the drilling locations for an onshore oil play that has potential to put namibia on the global conventional hydrocarbons map active petroleum system already identified excitement has continued to build attracting short sellers and questionable tactics since reco tsxv reco otc recaf announced in august that together with its partner namibian state run namcor that lab tests confirmed evidence of an active petroleum system while results from a second stratigraphic test well encountered 350 meters of hydrocarbon showings those results had executives noting that they drilled into a very thick zone of potential production or reservoir all on the maiden stratigraphic test drills the first well 6 2 encountered over 250 meters of hydrocarbon shows after drilling to a depth of 2 294 meters the second test well returned 350 meters of hydrocarbon shows after drilling to a depth of 2 780 meters doug milham ceo of horizon well logging inc the company that did the sample logging data and analysis described the results as indicative of an exploration play with world class potential likewise industry recognized polaris conducted the 450 kilometer 2d seismic program for reco the results of which will help determine where the upcoming drill campaign that we ve been waiting for the 8 5 million acre play of a lifetime the size of this play is almost unimaginable reco tsxv reco otc recaf has the rights to 6 3 million acres in namibia s portion of the giant kavango basin and another 2 2 million acres in neighboring botswana it s a play that has had the likes of wood mackenzie a well known analyst for natural resources compare the potential to the permian basin in texas and it s a play that world class geologist dan jarvie has estimated could have potential for billions of barrels of oil we think the sheer size and potential here demands patience and early in investors are probably in this for the long haul when billions of barrels is at stake in what could be a once in a lifetime exploration effort it s important to do things right and by the book including a lineup of esg efforts that ensure this is beneficial for namibia steinke has called it transformational for namibia a country that suffers from severe energy poverty their main goal in vision 2030 is to industrialize their country and pull their people out of poverty you have to remember they don t have a significant amount of indigenous energy for example namibia imports 60 of their electricity from south africa so how can they industrialize their country if you have to import energy to establish industries but at higher costs then how do you compete you can t so far despite misinformation to the contrary that has been debunked by the namibian government itself we think reconafrica tsxv reco otc recaf has made all the right moves to ensure the biggest conventional onshore oil exploration in decades is de risked for everyone exxon mobil nyse xom is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world it was founded by john d rockefeller sr in 1870 with a goal

assets in the barnett shale in texas reuters has reported citing a confirmation of the news by the company the assets include 2 700 wells spread across 182 000 acres according to the report so far no buyer has been identified and no agreements have been reached on the sale a spokeswoman for the company said aside from the considerable drilling success and exploration upside to be unlocked in the stabroek block operations are proving to be highly profitable and it hasn t stopped there exxon is also developing the payara oilfield in the stabroek block located to the north of liza one at a water depth of around 2 000 meters the payara field is expected to break even at 32 per barrel highlighting the operations considerable profitability in an environment where brent is selling for over 85 per barrel more importantly a combination of low breakeven prices for the oilfields in the stabroek block and a very favorable production sharing agreement with guyana s government with a low royalty rate

metric tons year the company says the renewable diesel will be produced from blue hydrogen involving natural gas reforming accompanied by carbon capture and storage canadian natural resources tsx cnq has been able to do what many of its canadian counterparts haven t been able to keep its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the covid pandemic while canada s producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand though canadian natural resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however it also said it would curtail some production at high cost conventional projects in north america and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020 though there is a lot of negative press surrounding canada s oil sands the industry is starting to clean up its act a bit and canadian natural resources is leading the charge and if analysts are right about canada s comeback canadian natural resources could be in for a big year though the canadian energy giant has seen its stock price slump this year it could provide a potential opportunity for investors as oil prices rebound it is already up over 170 from its march 2020 lows but it is just getting started if oil prices continue to climb it could be huge news for investors that held on tc energy corporation tsx trp is a calgary based energy giant the company owns and operates energy infrastructure throughout north america tc energy is one of the continent s largest providers of gas storage and owns and has interests in approximately 11 800 megawatts of power generation it s also one of the continent s most important pipeline operators with tc energy s massive influence throughout north america it is no wonder that the company is among one of canada s strongest and well known companies like a number of its peers one of tc energy s biggest challenges in recent years was grappling with the particularly difficult approval process for its keystone pipeline but that s all history now and with the bounce back in oil and gas demand tc energy could stand to benefit while tc energy s stock price has yet to recover from pre pandemic levels it is one of the few industry giants which has managed to keep high dividends rolling in with quarterly payouts exceeding 6 tc has remained appealing for investors in the industry suncor energy tsx su is another giant in canada s industry it has set itself apart from some of its peers through a number of high tech solutions for finding pumping storing and delivering its resources not only is it big in the oil sector but it is also a leader in renewable energy recently the company invested 300 million in a wind farm located in alberta showing that it is committed to reducing its carbon footprint now that oil prices are finally recovering giants like suncor looking to capitalize while many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production those who focus on technological advancements in the area have a great long term outlook and that upside is further amplified by the fact that it is currently looking

over the past year it s been hard to avoid discourse surrounding a new phenomenon nfts short for non fungible tokens seemingly coming out of nowhere and exploding into the mainstream many celebrities have endorsed nfts including the likes of eminem paris hilton and even melania trump there s also a strange nft centered television show streaming on apple tv called the red ape family it s clear that there is a massive industry backing the sale of these digital tokens worryingly there are a growing number of reports illustrating the devastating environmental impact that nfts and cryptocurrencies have on the environment most people have a hard time understanding what an nft is or why it would have any value this is hotly contested nfts are essentially one of a kind digital proofs of purchase that can be associated with any number of online media they are backed through cryptocurrencies like bitcoins and more commonly the etherium variant this process is inherently energy intensive because every time an nft is created or transferred a signal is sent to thousands of computers on an online network known as the blockchain to verify that said nft is one of a kind according to an analysis of the nft market simply creating an nft creates an equivalent carbon footprint to driving 500 miles in an average gas powered american automobile additionally once transactions are factored in the average nft equates to around 620 miles this is equivalent to the average eu resident s energy consumption over the course of a month or using a laptop continuously for 3 years according to a paper published in the scientific journal nature researchers concluded that bitcoin mining in china could begin to offset efforts aimed at combating climate change according to the study without any policy interventions bitcoin mining in the country would exceed the total annualized greenhouse gas emission output of the czech republic and qatar since the time of paper publication china has taken a harsher stance on cryptocurrencies it s clear that nfts and the cryptocurrencies associated with them pose a very real threat to our climate they serve no necessary utility and as such the u s government needs to take some sort of action cryptocurrencies are already banned in several countries russia is also on track to ban the use and mining of cryptocurrencies if the united states does not take similar measures it would seriously undermine any other measures to reduce emissions

pay dirt is slate s money advice column have a question send it to athena and elizabeth here it s anonymous dear pay dirt my husband and i recently started the housebuying process with a gorgeous home in a perfect area despite the hot housing market the house had been on the market for about a month we were absolutely over the moon we qualified for down payment assistance and the sellers would help with closing costs per our contract we put down 2 000 in earnest money which was everything we had saved up this was the only way we could afford a house and we felt so lucky but quickly after the sellers accepted our offer they started acting squirrelly evidence suggested they were still showing the house after accepting our offer our contract didn t have a kick out they asked to amend later so they could accept backup offers we didn t accept they demanded that they not be required to turn over the keys during closing until they received everything from our loan distributor and there were other actions insinuating we would somehow breach things got really bad after the inspection the house needs a new roof there s a gas leak the dryer vent and old wiring is a fire hazard the foundation is starting to crack the inspection cost about 2 000 but with the sellers covering closing costs we thought we would be ok the sellers asked for an extra two weeks so they could talk to contractors and we were happy to oblige but after the full two week period they decided to just terminate the contract rather than make any offer of repairs or a discount at all advertisement i don t think they ever wanted to sell to us honestly and our realtor thinks they did this so that they could put the house back on the market without having to tell other potential buyers of these serious problems she doesn t trust the sellers agent to be honest in the disclosures but there s no proof they weren t honest with us now we have to pay for the inspection because there is no closing and our savings that let us potentially buy a house in the first place are wiped out advertisement advertisement advertisement i feel like i ve been scammed and had my dream of homeownership stolen from me i m heartbroken and furious that these sellers would waste our time and our money and treat us so disrespectfully in the process is there anything at all that i can do either to recover what we ve lost or to make this inspection public so that other buyers aren t scammed the same way we were how can people be so cruel dear cruel advertisement the housing market is very competitive right now as i know you know and i could definitely see how you would feel misled a dream you thought was in reach is now gone but you might just have to chalk this up as a lesson learned in a shady and expensive matter contrary to what hgtv portrays deals fall through all the time taking the money spent for inspections with them while inspections are pricey i have only been asked for a refund once which i declined shares tom the real estate guru behind the frugal gay tom who owns over 18 homes across the states of texas and ohio says a 2 000 inspection sounds a bit ridiculous the most i have spent was 1 600 for a four unit building but think this expensive inspection could have saved you tens of thousands of dollars in fixing up a money pit of a house advertisement advertisement tom has a very good point houses are expensive especially houses with problematic foundations if spending 2 000 wiped you out then you are probably not ready to own a home and especially not this one assistance programs only cover so much and rarely do they cover anything maintenance wise anything can go wrong at any time so besides having a down payment saved up you ll still need an emergency fund to help weather the storms called homeownership advertisement i m so sorry this happened to you and i hope that in a few years with luck and work from the comfort of the much better home you ll own in the future you ll be able to see the silver lining to the situation advertisement dear pay dirt i am a 23 year old woman who just hit 1 5 years at her first job out of college woo i grew up lower middle class in a rural part of the country my family was on free or reduced usually free lunch for all but two years of my childhood now i earn about 75k per year which just feels like so much money to me and honestly i don t know what to do with it advertisement advertisement since starting my job i ve saved about 12k for my pile of student loans and another 11k or so in my personal savings my loans are still in deferment so i have the money in a regular savings account with my personal savings i have a retirement account through work but besides that i haven t invested any money advertisement my mom took on quite a bit of debt way back when my parents got divorced and it was a struggle for her to pay it back so i tend to be pretty risk averse when it comes to money i didn t even get my first credit card until this year because i was so nervous about taking on avoidable debt i don t have a car payment or anything either just my student loans and rent it feels almost like a waste to have over 10 grand squirreled away in a normal low interest savings account but i m also so so skeptical of day trading and crypto trading apps which seem like the go to option for people my age who want to invest i just don t have the mental energy to keep up with stock prices and make smart investments it d end up being like glorified astrology i do want to buy a house someday and i ll be applying to fully funded ph d programs starting next year advertisement advertisement advertisement all this to say do i just leave my savings in a normal account should i even keep saving now that i have 11k tucked away or should i use the extra grand a month to enjoy life outside of school i m proud of myself for saving as much as i have but i want to use my money wisely too it s just gathering dust dear gathering dust before i share anything else i want to say one thing your mom s money story is not yours it s hard to decipher the difference when we unconsciously take on a money script but just because your mom had issues with debt does not mean you have to salaries for grad students in fully funded doctorate programs average 30 000 per year so while you wouldn t be destitute if you get into one and decide to attend any extra cash you have saved would come in handy when you need more flexibility with your budget consider what brenda olmos shares in regard to your unique money situation advertisement olmos who is currently a practicing nurse practitioner pursuing a ph d in nursing as well as co host of the minority millennial money podcast wants you to remember that crypto and day trading are not the only options you have when investing before pursuing a doctorate program at 23 it would be a major advantage to put your 12 000 into market index funds like voo vtsax or vti you have time on your side so investing in index funds now can be extremely lucrative later advertisement advertisement she also suggests that you be very sure of the exact reason you re pursuing your ph d look into what kind of jobs people with that ph d have and how much they make it s definitely easier when it s fully funded because you don t have to work but it s a long haul and most professor jobs are only going to pay slightly more than 75k she already makes and these jobs are highly competitive to land so make sure you re pursuing one that will allow for adequate job growth internal to the institution advertisement advertisement dear pay dirt when i was a child my grandmother opened a savings account in my name and hers so i could be a member of her bank which is not open to the public it s only for military members or their beneficiaries she has been depositing small sums of money into this account for years about five years ago i got married no prenup we are both members of the same bank and have joint finances but this savings account is still held in mine and my grandmother s name and he has no access to it fast forward to about a year ago and i got a raise at work which i told my husband about i also requested a change to my payroll disbursement so 200 a month is now direct deposited into my private savings i did not tell my husband about this he has some lingering childhood young adult trauma that has left him with the belief that women are cheaters and they use men and then leave he knows this account exists but would view me putting money into it as an escape fund and it would destabilize the marriage advertisement advertisement i am aware that therapy would be beneficial and it is something i m trying to convince him to do my primary goal of putting this money aside was to have a small nest egg in case i wanted to buy him a gift without it appearing in the normal account or if i wanted to do something with the money he wouldn t agree with i e help out a family member but i am also a realist and recognize that having a small emergency fund may come in handy in the event things were to ever go south in my marriage advertisement my question is this savings account is in my name and my grandmother s although i believe within the next five years it will be my name only since she is very old and is doing poorly and it is a portion of my paycheck only that is being funneled in if we were to get divorced would this be considered joint funds is there a way for me to have an emergency fund in the event of a divorce that is mine and mine alone i just feel better with it there dear better with it there advertisement advertisement advertisement when married your assets are commonly referred to as marital or nonmarital the tricky thing is whether you live in a community property state marital assets are anything you ve acquired while married this can include bonuses salary and inheritance if it s received after marriage the checking account you opened prior to marriage with your grandmother is considered a nonmarital asset for now but can change depending on how you are funding the account in your case salary earned while married and if you are paying for any joint expenses with the money you can open a checking account in your name and your name only which can give you quick access to any funds you may need in case of an emergency but just because the funds are in your name now doesn t mean he can t come after you later your best recourse is to consult with a licensed financial planner in your state to find out what you can do now to protect yourself later on advertisement you ve mentioned going to therapy with your husband which is totally needed but i m going to suggest you go to therapy by yourself as well this situation with your husband sounds like it s on its way to becoming financial abuse you are scared to have your own account and are hiding it from him this is a huge red flag i wish you the best of luck finding these answers while keeping yourself safe if you need more information the national domestic violence hotline can help direct you to the closest services advertisement dear pay dirt i m in my late 30s and have a retirement question i spent 10 years in local government but in two different counties so have two small pensions i recently started working for the federal government yet another pension i m putting the match amount into this account each paycheck finally i have a small roth ira that i occasionally put money into advertisement i feel like i have lots of accounts with small amounts of money should i just leave all these accounts alone or should i try to roll them over into one account lots of little nest eggs dear lots of little nest eggs different retirement accounts offer different benefits and options while you can usually withdraw from your ira without a major hit you can t with a 401 k you can contribute pretax to one but not the other in this case i d see if you can roll over your state 401 k s into an investment account and then keep your federal pension and ira separate this way you can actively invest your way to one bigger nest egg while still keeping two aside at your age this seems like the best plan athena more advice from slate my husband and i are expecting our first child we re both in graduate school and have a pretty tight income right now we qualify for a child care subsidy that would put day care within the realm of possibility my husband is open to this but has offered up an alternative we each take three days a week on and three off when we re on we re responsible for being the primary caregiver for the bulk of the day and when we re off we can go onto campus get work done but would split responsibilities in the morning and evening we d share the seventh day i feel heartless but i m pretty insistent about day care i need to write my doctoral dissertation and i m worried that won t happen if i m caring for an infant

the united states warned moscow yesterday of damaging sanctions including measures personally targeting vladimir putin as russian combat troops massing around ukraine launched new exercises tension appeared to be only increasing with the white house saying the risk of a russian invasion of ukraine remains imminent warning that would prompt enormous consequences and even change the world president joe biden said he would consider adding direct sanctions on putin to a raft of measures being drawn up yes i would see that biden said when asked by reporters in washington about targeting putin whom opponents have long accused of holding gigantic secret wealth a senior us official laid out economic sanctions with massive consequences that go far beyond previous measures implemented in 2014 after russia invaded ukraine s crimea region warning that the gradualism of the past is out new measures would include restrictions on exports of high tech us equipment in the artificial intelligence quantum computing and aerospace sectors the official told reporters on condition of anonymity what we re talking about are sophisticated technologies that we design and produce and cutting them off would hit putin s strategic ambitions to industrialise his economy quite hard the official said british prime minister boris johnson echoed the threat saying sanctions would be heavier than anything we ve ever done in a bid to break the growing tension french president emmanuel macron said he would talk by telephone with putin on friday seeking clarification on moscow s intentions western leaders stepped up preparations for any russian military action in ukraine yesterday with the united states focusing on how to protect energy supplies and britain urging other european nations to get economic sanctions ready tensions remained high after nato said on monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to a russian troop build up near its border with ukraine russia which denies planning an attack said it was watching with great concern kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov repeated moscow s line that the crisis is being driven by us and nato actions not the russian troop build up ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskiy in a televised video address yesterday evening urged his compatriots to stay calm and said work was underway to bring about a meeting between him and the leaders of russia germany and france there are no rose coloured glasses no childish illusions everything is not simple but there is hope he said the united states and the european union have threatened economic sanctions if russia launches an invasion and western leaders say unity is paramount though differences have emerged among european nations over how best to respond it is absolutely vital that the west is united now because it is our unity now that will be much more effective in deterring any russian aggression british prime minister boris johnson told parliament urging our european friends to be ready to deploy sanctions as soon as there was any incursion he said britain was discussing the possibility of banning russia from the swift global payments system with the united states one of many potential measures to punish moscow if it launches an offensive in washington senior biden administration officials said the united states was in talks with major energy producing countries and companies around the world over a potential diversion of supplies to europe if russia invades ukraine speaking to reporters on a call the officials did not name the countries or companies involved in discussions to protect supplies to europe but said they included a broad range of suppliers including sellers of liquefied natural gas lng we ve been working to identify additional volumes of non russian natural gas from various areas of the world from north africa and the middle east to asia and the united states a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity the eu depends on russia for around a third of its gas supplies any interruptions to its russian imports would exacerbate an existing energy crisis caused by shortages russia has tens of thousands of troops near ukraine and is demanding security guarantees from the west including a promise by nato never to admit ukraine moscow sees the former soviet republic as a buffer between russia and nato countries political advisers from russia ukraine germany and france are due to meet in paris today under the so called normandy format to seek ways of ending the conflict in eastern ukraine between kyiv s forces and pro russian separatists scholz defended germany s refusal to follow other western countries in sending kyiv lethal weapons to defend itself against a possible russian invasion citing historical reasons for berlin s caution the tensions over ukraine have been felt on financial markets and the price of oil in recent days an escalated conflict between russia and ukraine would be likely to further increase energy costs for many countries keeping headline inflation rates elevated for longer said gita gopinath first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund the united states has committed more than 650mn of security assistance to ukraine in the past year and more than 2 7bn in total since 2014 when russia annexed ukraine s crimea peninsula a us plane carrying military equipment and munitions landed in kyiv yesterday the third shipment of a 200mn security package to shore up ukraine the us department of defense said on monday about 8 500 us troops had been put on heightened alert and were awaiting orders to deploy to the region should russia invade ukraine

total assets grew 82 2 million or 11 4 from 721 1 million the growth from the prior year period was driven by an increase in total loans of 60 5 million or 12 4 and cash and cash equivalents of 101 7 million or 738 2 partially offset by a decrease in loans held for sale of 74 3 million or 62 4 william m parent president and chief executive officer stated the fourth quarter was a transitional quarter as our mortgage banking business continued to be negatively impacted by declining origination volumes during the quarter we were able to grow our commercial lending business and increase and extend our low cost funding while also repositioning our fixed rate residential mortgage loan portfolio this significantly increased our liquidity and prospects for improving net interest margin in anticipation of loan growth into a higher interest rate environment in 2022 we are continuing to transition our mortgage banking operations and in the first quarter of 2022 initiated a reduction in force reflecting lower mortgage loan production levels our decision to declare a special dividend that returns approximately 10 million in capital to our shareholders reflects the impact of low stock trading volume on the pace of our stock buybacks and our commitment to actively manage our strong capital position we look forward to 2022 with strong prospects for growth in our community bank that should generate continued operating leverage and stronger recurring earnings fourth quarter operating results net interest income decreased by 282 000 or 4 7 to 5 7 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 from 6 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 this decrease was primarily due to a 7 4 decrease in average balances of 1 4 family residential loans as a result of the

million in the same period in the prior year relative to the prior year quarter the net interest margin increased by 14 basis points to 3 14 from 3 00 the improvement reflects average loan growth of 44 8 million from the prior year quarter while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 27 basis points the company recognized a credit for loan losses of 108 000 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 driven by changes in the qualitative factors related to improving commercial lending trends in addition to a decline in total loan balances of 20 2 million from the prior quarter the

loans held for sale were 44 8 million as of december 31 2021 compared to 75 4 million as of september 30 2021 the decrease in the mortgage banking pipeline and loans held for sale reflecting rising

000 for the fourth quarter of 2021 from 274 000 in the third quarter of 2021 as a result of a full quarter of expenses paid to the bank s new mortgage sub servicer of 310 000 for the quarter partially offset by a positive fair value adjustment of 43 000 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a positive fair value adjustment of 39 000 for the third quarter of 2021 based on an increase in mortgage interest rates non interest income decreased 11 1 million or 70 9 to 4 5 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 15 6 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 principally due to a

million during the fourth quarter of 2020 the fourth quarter of 2021 ended with a mortgage pipeline of 85 9 million compared to a pipeline of 396 6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 mortgage servicing fees decreased 18 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2021 principally due to 310 000 in sub servicer expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 partially offset by a positive valuation adjustment to mortgage servicing rights of 43 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to an impairment charge of 87 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2020 and increases in residential mortgage loan servicing fees net of amortization of 162 000 from the prior year quarter non interest expenses decreased 638 000 or 6 5 to 9 2 million in the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 9 9 million in the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease was due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense of 297 000 or 4 7 primarily attributed to lower commissions and incentives associated with a normalization of residential loan production and by reductions in headcount related to the bank s outsourcing of mortgage loan servicing in addition to decreases in data processing professional fees and other non interest expenses from the prior quarter totaling 452 000 non interest expenses decreased 3 7 million to 9 2 million in the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 12 9 million in the quarter ended december 31 2020 the decrease is principally due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 2 6 million primarily attributed to lower commissions and incentives associated with a normalization of residential loan production and reduced headcount and decreases of 437 000 in occupancy and equipment expenses as the company has significantly decreased its operating footprint over the past twelve months the income tax expense was 330 000 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to 1 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2020 year to date operating results net interest income increased by 3 1 million or 16 4 to 22 0 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 18 9 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the change reflects the downward pricing and improved composition of deposit liabilities as well as loan growth the composition of our funding base improved with an increase of 48 9 million or 50 6 of non interest bearing deposits and a decrease of 23 3 million or 31 8 of borrowings the composition change resulted in a 50 basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities average loan growth of 51 5 million or 9 2 from the prior year more than offset a 17 basis point decline in loan yields the

factors related to the impact of the covid 19 pandemic the economic outlook commercial lending and credit quality trends all helped to generate the credit for loan losses partially offset by provisions for loan growth non interest income decreased 23 5 million or 42 4 to 31 9 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 55 4 million in the prior year principally due to a decrease of 26 6 million in the net gain on loan origination and sale activities partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing fees net of 2 8 million mortgage loans sold were 1 4 billion in 2021 compared to 1 5 billion in the prior year net gain on loan origination and sale activities decreased as a result of both lower loan sales and the impact of a shrinking mortgage banking pipeline during 2021

a new entrant has emerged in the landscape of factor investing according to j p morgan the human capital factor hcf a strategy that analyzes certain employee perceptions such as pride purpose and psychological safety has demonstrated that it may be more relevant to a company s stock performance than other investment factors developed by a pennsylvania based investment research firm called irrational capital hcf quantifies corporate culture by studying employee behaviors and motivations rather than by simply looking at more easily quantifiable stats such as compensation packages or the number of diverse members on the board irrational capital argues that these run of the mill disclosures don t provide an accurate appraisal of human capital and that a better measurement should include employee perceptions of corporate culture a factor that touches on the field of behavior science often focus more on what is easy to count instead of what is important to count said dan ariely a behavioral economist at duke university and a co founder of irrational capital hcf on the other hand evaluates employee perceptions a factor that ariely believes is crucial from a variety of angles such as their opinion of the management team and their level of emotional connection with colleagues through proprietary data sets gathered from corporate employee surveys and public sources such as glassdoor irrational capital has collected two million responses and more than 13 million unique data points from over 2 000 companies in the u s the public and private data sets are eventually combined into an aggregate hcf score that reflects how motivated the employees are to create value for the company covid really emphasized the importance of intrinsic motivation ariely told institutional investor companies have grown to be more dependent on self driven employees than ever and those with high hcf scores could have an edge on their competitors he added j p morgan analyzed hcf s performance across a wide range of indices including the nasdaq russell 1000 and msci usa by back testing stock performance data from 2015 jpm found that the nasdaq hcf long portfolio delivered an excess return of 3 1 percent while the nasdaq hcf long short portfolio generated a significantly higher annual return of 13 3 percent the report concluded that within the tech heavy nasdaq the hcf is highly proficient at identifying underperformers for the russell 1000 and msci usa indices the hcf long portfolios delivered excess returns of 3 7 percent and 6 2 percent respectively david van adelsberg a co founder of irrational capital said that the hcf score can be used for a variety of portfolio construction objectives for example jpm s environmental social and governance investing team adjusted the hcf for the innovation element to create a metric called innovation culture score it found that on average companies where employees feel the most encouraged to pursue innovative ideas deliver an excess return of 3 6 percent in an earlier research report jpm also used hcf to study how gender equality affects stock performance instead of looking at how many women are at the company or in senior leadership roles the hcf comes up with a gender alignment score that measures the absolute differences between the responses between female and male employees the report said the key here is that this data allows for a far more meaningful analysis of gender inequality than simply counting metrics jpm found that the gender alignment strategy developed from hcf outperformed the s p 500 and many mainstream gender diversity etfs

there s been much hubbub in recent months about what s been dubbed the great resignation the popular phrase refers to the roughly 33 million americans who have quit their jobs since the spring of 2021 some pointing to the difficulty of businesses in recruiting workers and spectacles like the immense popularity of the anti work thread on reddit have gone as far as to suggest this record breaking trend is a movement of young able bodied americans rejecting work altogether but it s pretty clear that at least for the vast majority of americans quitting their jobs that s not the case americans are not en masse rejecting consumerism moving off the grid and living off the land most still need money some of those quitting are older workers deciding to retire early in large part because their finances have been buoyed by surging stock and housing markets others are secondary earners who have stayed home because they have had to take care of kids while schools have closed due to covid 19 or because more simply working face to face during a pandemic sucks quitting to get better pay or treatment isn t unusual however most americans quitting their jobs merely seem to be aiming to get better jobs while we are living in a bizarre pandemic economy with countless strange trends this isn t necessarily one of them it s pretty standard to see a swell of workers quitting their jobs for greener pastures when the job market is strong and there are lots of shiny opportunities available when the stars align as they re aligning now workers gun for better pay perks flexibility and treatment bargaining power has shifted in their favor that s why we at planet money think it might be better to call what s going on the great renegotiation we coined this term in a recent episode called no shortage of labor stories in that episode we spoke with karin kimbrough the chief economist of linkedin kimbrough approved of our rebranding and she pointed us to her company s treasure trove of data to back it up there are twice as many jobs on our platform as there were a year ago kimbrough said with lots of open jobs workers have greater power to negotiate a better position as for why the labor force participation rate remains significantly smaller than before the pandemic and it s still hard for employers to fill open jobs kimbrough said i think that the workers are there but the terms haven t yet drawn them off the sidelines they are hesitating or being more choosy for a variety of really good reasons they may say i don t want to take the risk and in order to make it worth my while to go out there and work again you need to actually pay me a little bit more low wage service workers look for something better the workers who use linkedin tend to be higher income professionals indeed many of these types of workers are negotiating for better pay and amenities such as continuing to be able to work from home but the great renegotiation seems to be primarily a story about low wage workers according to a recent report by ben casselman at the new york times low wage workers in the leisure and hospitality sectors have the highest rate of quitting in november alone a record breaking 1 million leisure and hospitality workers quit their jobs and that was before omicron started surging with places like hotels bars and restaurants seeking to hire or rehire scores of workers as americans began spending on services again there have been many employers simultaneously competing for their labor that creates an environment where quitting for something better makes a lot of sense now with omicron surging these low wage service workers have an additional reason to quit or demand better pay the great renegotiation is also a byproduct of inflation workers are seeking better pay to keep up with the rising cost of living interestingly workers in the leisure and hospitality sectors saw their hourly earnings increase by 12 3 in november well outpacing inflation yet despite all the quitting and renegotiating the real wage for the average american worker meaning the true value of their paycheck after taking into account inflation fell by 2 4 in 2021 in a recent poll by the new york times and momentum only about 17 of americans said their pay was keeping up with surging prices for much of 2021 american leaders told us that inflation would be temporary but there are growing fears of a wage price spiral in which workers seeing rising prices demand higher pay and companies having to pay their workers more start charging higher prices these higher prices lead workers to demand even higher pay leading companies to charge higher prices and so on it s the inflationary cycle of nightmares in the short term the great renegotiation seems like a great development for many american workers especially low wage workers many are seeing gains in their material standard of living after years of stagnant pay let s hope however this trend doesn t become fuel for a wage price spiral that leaves most americans worse off if you liked this newsletter you can listen to the full planet money episode and subscribe to learn about how the economy actually works
a sharp rise in inflation has economists predicting the reserve bank of australia will be forced to lift interest rates as early as may there has been turmoil on the australian stock exchange over the past week with shares collapsing to an eight month low in yesterday s trading investors wiped 59bn off the value of australian shares with the asx 200 falling 2 5 per cent to 6961 6 points this is understood to be partly driven by fears over global instability and a possible invasion of ukraine however more ominous signs locally have spooked investors with soaring petrol and surging housing construction costs pushing the consumer price index to a larger than expected 1 3 per cent rise in the december quarter that s up from an 0 8 per cent increase over the previous three month period the latest increase means the prices of everyday goods in australia rose by a total of 3 5 per cent in 2021 stream more finance news live on demand with flash australia s biggest news streaming service new to flash try 14 days free now it s been a rough week on the stock market picture nca newswire christian gilles a 4 2 per cent jump in the cost of new homes and 6 6 per cent surge in fuel prices were the main factors to the bigger than expected increase the reserve bank which is meeting next tuesday is expected to concede an interest rates rise is likely later this year the rba had previously ruled out a rise until late 2023 rba governor philip lowe had previously talked down rate increases in 2022 saying it would be an over reaction to inflation data he had suggested early 2024 was the most likely time for rates to begin rising however nab economist taylor nugent told the afr the latest economic figures are probably consistent with a rate hike in late 2022 josh frydenberg said inflation in australia remained half of what it was in the united states and lower than in germany canada and britain despite the global supply chain disruptions australia faces and indeed so many other countries do around the world the australian economy is remarkably resilient the treasurer told the australian it is anticipated that interest rates will rise later this year omicron sparks global economic uncertainty australia isn t the only nation facing a rocky year the omicron variant of covid 19 is creating an obstacle course for the entire global economy which will slow growth this year notably in the world s two largest economies the imf said overnight the washington based crisis lender cut its world gdp forecast for 2022 to 4 4 per cent half a point lower than the october estimate due to the impediments caused by the latest outbreak although those are expected to begin to fade in the second quarter of the year the global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected the international monetary fund said in the quarterly update to its world economic outlook weo adding that the emergence of the omicron variant in late november threatens to set back this tentative path to recovery the outlook remains beset by risks including geopolitical tensions and a wave of price increases hitting consumers and businesses that is expected to last longer than previously expected australia isn t the only nation facing increasing inflation after the solid recovery last year when the global economy grew an estimated 5 9 per cent the imf cut projections for nearly every country with india a notable exception but it was the downgrades to the united states and china that had the biggest impact these impediments are expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2022 the report said the negative impact is expected to fade starting in the second quarter assuming that the global surge in omicron infections abates and the virus does not mutate into new variants that require further mobility restrictions the fund once again stressed that controlling the pandemic is critical to the economic outlook and urged widespread vaccinations in developing nations which have fallen short even as advanced economies have moved to deploying booster shots among their already highly vaccinated populations with afp

of 64 7 million in the quarter a 1 4 family residential portfolio loan sale of 35 6 million during the quarter and the decrease in loans held for sale of 30 6 million compared to december 31 2020 total assets grew 82 2 million or 11 4 from 721 1 million the growth from the prior year period was driven by an increase in total loans of 60 5 million or 12 4 and cash and cash equivalents of 101 7 million or 738 2 partially offset by a decrease in loans held for sale of 74 3 million or 62 4 story continues william m parent president and chief executive officer stated the fourth quarter was a transitional quarter as our mortgage banking business continued to be negatively impacted by declining origination volumes during the quarter we were able to grow our commercial lending business and increase and extend our low cost funding while also repositioning our fixed rate residential mortgage loan portfolio this significantly increased our liquidity and prospects for improving net interest margin in anticipation of loan growth into a higher interest rate environment in 2022 we are continuing to transition our mortgage banking operations and in the first quarter of 2022 initiated a reduction in force reflecting lower mortgage loan production levels our decision to declare a special dividend that returns approximately 10 million in capital to our shareholders reflects the impact of low stock trading volume on the pace of our stock buybacks and our commitment to actively manage our strong capital position we look forward to 2022 with strong prospects for growth in our community bank that should generate continued operating leverage and stronger recurring earnings fourth quarter operating results net interest income decreased by 282 000 or 4 7 to 5 7 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 from 6 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 this decrease was primarily due to a 7 4 decrease in average balances of 1 4 family residential loans as a result of the 35 6 million sale from portfolio a 160 000 decline in fee accretion earned from the small business administration s paycheck protection program sba ppp to 158 000 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a 99 000 decrease in interest income from the downgrade of three loans that were previously granted covid 19 related forbearances to nonaccrual status the yield earned on interest earning assets decreased by 23 basis points from the prior quarter and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by 3 basis points from the prior quarter accordingly the net interest margin decreased by 22 basis points to 3 14 in the fourth quarter from 3 36 in the third quarter net interest income increased by 654 000 or 13 0 to 5 7 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 from 5 0 million in the same period in the prior year relative to the prior year quarter the net interest margin increased by 14 basis points to 3 14 from 3 00 the improvement reflects average loan growth of 44 8 million from the prior year quarter while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 27 basis points the company recognized a credit for loan losses of 108 000 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 driven by changes in the qualitative factors related to improving commercial lending trends in addition to a decline in total loan balances of 20 2 million from the prior quarter the allowance for loan losses was 1 14 1 13 and 1 39 of total loans at december 31 2021 september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively and was 239 7 427 7 and 94 6 of non performing assets at december 31 2021 september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively non interest income decreased 3 6 million or 44 3 to 4 5 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 8 1 million in the quarter ended september 30 2021 due to a decrease of 3 5 million in the net gain on loan origination and sale activities sold mortgages totaled 297 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 260 5 million in the third quarter of 2021 the fourth quarter of 2021 ended with a mortgage pipeline of 85 9 million compared to a pipeline of 158 1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and loans held for sale were 44 8 million as of december 31 2021 compared to 75 4 million as of september 30 2021 the decrease in the mortgage banking pipeline and loans held for sale reflecting rising interest rates and seasonality were key contributors to the erosion in the gain on loan origination and sale activities from the prior quarter mortgage servicing fees decreased 17 000 or 6 2 to 257 000 for the fourth quarter of 2021 from 274 000 in the third quarter of 2021 as a result of a full quarter of expenses paid to the bank s new mortgage sub servicer of 310 000 for the quarter partially offset by a positive fair value adjustment of 43 000 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a positive fair value adjustment of 39 000 for the third quarter of 2021 based on an increase in mortgage interest rates non interest income decreased 11 1 million or 70 9 to 4 5 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 15 6 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 principally due to a decrease of 10 9 million in the net gain on loan origination and sale activities sold mortgage loans totaled 297 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to sold mortgage loans of 426 5 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 the fourth quarter of 2021 ended with a mortgage pipeline of 85 9 million compared to a pipeline of 396 6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 mortgage servicing fees decreased 18 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2021 principally due to 310 000 in sub servicer expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 partially offset by a positive valuation adjustment to mortgage servicing rights of 43 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to an impairment charge of 87 000 in the quarter ended december 31 2020 and increases in residential mortgage loan servicing fees net of amortization of 162 000 from the prior year quarter non interest expenses decreased 638 000 or 6 5 to 9 2 million in the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 9 9 million in the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease was due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense of 297 000 or 4 7 primarily attributed to lower commissions and incentives associated with a normalization of residential loan production and by reductions in headcount related to the bank s outsourcing of mortgage loan servicing in addition to decreases in data processing professional fees and other non interest expenses from the prior quarter totaling 452 000 non interest expenses decreased 3 7 million to 9 2 million in the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 12 9 million in the quarter ended december 31 2020 the decrease is principally due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 2 6 million primarily attributed to lower commissions and incentives associated with a normalization of residential loan production and reduced headcount and decreases of 437 000 in occupancy and equipment expenses as the company has significantly decreased its operating footprint over the past twelve months the income tax expense was 330 000 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to 1 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2020 year to date operating results net interest income increased by 3 1 million or 16 4 to 22 0 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 18 9 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the change reflects the downward pricing and improved composition of deposit liabilities as well as loan growth the composition of our funding base improved with an increase of 48 9 million or 50 6 of non interest bearing deposits and a decrease of 23 3 million or 31 8 of borrowings the composition change resulted in a 50 basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities average loan growth of 51 5 million or 9 2 from the prior year more than offset a 17 basis point decline in loan yields the company recognized a credit for loan losses of 438 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to a provision of 2 6 million in the prior year at december 31 2021 improvements to qualitative factors related to the impact of the covid 19 pandemic the economic outlook commercial lending and credit quality trends all helped to generate the credit for loan losses partially offset by provisions for loan growth non interest income decreased 23 5 million or 42 4 to 31 9 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 55 4 million in the prior year principally due to a decrease of 26 6 million in the net gain on loan origination and sale activities partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing fees net of 2 8 million mortgage loans sold were 1 4 billion in 2021 compared to 1 5 billion in the prior year net gain on loan origination and sale activities decreased as a result of both lower loan sales and the impact of a shrinking mortgage banking pipeline during 2021 compared to an increasing mortgage banking pipeline during 2020 mortgage servicing fees increased 2 8 million for the year ended december 31 2021 to 1 7 million from a loss of 1 2 million in the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to positive fair value adjustments of 438 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to impairment charges of 2 1 million in the year ended december 31 2020 non interest expenses decreased 4 7 million or 10 1 to 41 7 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 46 3 million for the year ended december 31 2020 non interest expenses in the year ended december 31 2020 included one time charges of 1 375 000 related to the retirement of senior executives as well as 229 000 of covid 19 pandemic related expenses occupancy and equipment expenses decreased 753 000 as compared to the prior year period as the company migrated to a hybrid work environment and reduced its overall real estate footprint by closing six loan production offices and reducing the office space for the bank s headquarters and loan operations office since the prior year and reduced covid 19 pandemic related spending these decreases were partially offset by increases in other non interest expenses of 307 000 related to one time conversion expenses for the bank s new mortgage sub servicer and increases to board fees and stock based compensation paid to new members of the bank s board of directors income tax expenses decreased to 3 1 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 5 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the current period included a

amounted to 803 3 million compared to 755 1 million at september 30 2021 an increase of 52 2 million or 6 9 a 102 6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from the prior quarter was partially offset by a 30 6 million decrease in loans held for sale and a 20 2 million decrease in total loans the decrease in total loans was primarily the result of a 35 6 million sale of 1 4 family residential loans from portfolio during the quarter partially offset by an increase of 12 3 million or 6 7 in commercial real estate loans deposits increased by 64 7 million or 11 3 in the quarter including an increase of 11 6 million in non interest bearing deposits and 32 6 million in term certificates as the company looked to lengthen the duration of its funding base in anticipation of rising interest rates total assets at december 31 2021 increased 82 2 million or 11 4 from 721 1 million at december 31 2020 contributing to asset growth was a 61 0 million increase in net loans to

judge william h orrick of the northern district of california recently denied a motion to dismiss the securities and exchange commission s sec s first insider trading case charging a defendant with shadow trading the sec alleged that matthew panuwat a biopharmaceutical executive learned that his employer medivation was due to announce an acquisition by pfizer and based on that information immediately bought call options in a third pharmaceutical company in the same market as medivation the court rejected panuwat s arguments that the sec failed to state a claim against him for insider trading and that allowing the case to proceed under this novel theory would violate his due process rights the facts of the case made it a particularly good vehicle for the sec to test its theory but may also provide a basis for future litigants to draw meaningful distinctions based on their own fact patterns panuwat a former investment banker was a senior director of business development at medivation a midsize publicly traded biopharmaceutical company that developed cancer drugs his role was to explore strategic transaction opportunities for medivation including researching potential acquisition targets one company that he allegedly tracked closely was incyte which like medivation was a developer of oncology drugs had an fda approved drug on the market and was seen as a potential acquisition target for larger pharmaceutical companies because of his position at medivation panuwat was entrusted with sensitive nonpublic information this included a summary of bids to purchase medivation five of which were at significant premiums to the then current stock price copies of letters marked confidential soliciting final bids and an email indicating that pfizer had an overwhelming interest in acquiring the company and that the companies ceos were set to have a call to resolve final details of the acquisition minutes after receiving that email panuwat bought short dated out of the money call options for incyte stock despite his long standing interest in the company he had never bought incyte stock or options before receiving the email about the impending acquisition according to the complaint panuwat had good reason to know that the announcement of an acquisition of medivation would lead to a material increase in incyte s stock price panuwat knew that analysts listed incyte as a peer company to medivation he knew that medivation and inctye were among the few comparable companies not yet acquired by larger pharmaceutical companies and he knew that the stock prices of both medivation and incyte had begun trading higher when another company with a similar profile had been acquired a year earlier incyte stock rose by 8 on the medivation announcement and panuwat made just over 100 000 on his trades the court held that these alleged facts properly stated a claim that panuwat knowingly misappropriated confidential material and nonpublic information for securities trading purposes in breach of a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence owed to the source of the information on each of the disputed elements materiality breach of a duty and scienter the alleged facts were unusually detailed first according to the court there was concrete information available to panuwat to indicate that the medivation announcement would affect incyte s stock price second panuwat was because of the nature of his role entrusted with sensitive material including documents marked confidential he had also signed the company s broad insider trading policy which acknowledged the likelihood that he would receive such information and in addition to prohibiting the use of that information to trade in the company s own stock prohibited using that information to trade in the securities of another publicly traded company including all significant collaborators customers partners suppliers or competitors of medivation third there was allegedly strong circumstantial evidence that panuwat knew what he was doing he had a background in investment banking understood the market dynamics and made the trade immediately after learning that an announcement was imminent the court rejected the defendant s due process arguments because the language of the statute and related regulations is broad and the allegations of materiality and scienter were compelling the court acknowledged that there appear to be no other cases where the material nonpublic information at issue involved a third party a fact the sec conceded but found this lack of precedent was not a basis to dismiss the complaint instead the court concluded that the sec s shadow trading theory falls within the general framework of insider trading as well as the expansive language of section 10 b and corresponding regulations for example the court rejected the argument that only information about incyte can be material to incyte under rule 10b 5 because the language of the regulation broadly prohibits insider trading in any security the court reasoned that this breadth does not present a notice issue because cienter and materiality provide sufficient guardrails to insider trading liability indeed the breadth is intentional and is in place to protect markets from new or unusual schemes the court pointed to a statement from the supreme court that ovel or atypical methods should not provide immunity from the securities laws the application of the sec s theory and the court s decision to other instances of shadow trading is not clear one could conceive of situations where the connection between the defendant s confidential information and the company in which he traded were more remote not all issuers insider trading policies prohibit trading in third companies like competitors can such a duty not to trade otherwise be implied the defendant may not be as sophisticated a professional as panuwat was alleged to be the reach of the insider trading laws in such situations remains to be determined sec v panuwat no 21 6322 n d cal jan 14 2022 order denying motion to dismiss complaint at 14 sec v panuwat no 21 6322 n d cal

followed with 208 and 202 cases respectively compared with 190 cases per 100 000 for the bay area as a whole these case rates differ somewhat from those posted by sonoma county due to time lags and

petaluma health center alvin a h jornada special to the chronicle sonoma county s residents now are living with tougher restrictions aimed at stemming transmission than other parts of the bay area

advertisement article continues below this ad sonoma county has consistently lagged the bay area overall in seeing its cases rise and fall it had a slower increase in cases early on but took longer to stem the rise of infections a pattern that has continued during ups and downs of the pandemic the county often retained pandemic restrictions during reopening phases in 2020 and 2021 while other parts of the bay area that were making better progress were able to relax their rules sooner today the county has some of the region s strongest restrictions including a ban on large gatherings anything over 50 people indoors or 100 people outdoors when social distancing is not possible in issuing that order for jan 10 through feb 11 health officer dr sundari mase also asked residents to voluntarily shelter at home to help stem the increase in infections similar restrictions were used statewide before vaccinations became widely available to curtail covid s spread in particular during the first wave in march 2020 and during last winter s surge mase has said the order is meant to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed between december and january case rates jumped from an average of 90 new cases each day to about 1 250 as of last week county health officials have cited gatherings of more than 12 people as a major source of the recent infections at least three dozen cases were traced to

were 36 higher among latino residents than among sonoma county s population overall county data shows latinos account for about 27 of the county s residents additionally this month s surge driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant came after the expiration of emergency paid sick leave programs from the government that helped coronavirus infected workers stay home earlier in the pandemic that means it has become more difficult for many of the county s low paid residents and essential workers to take off work when infected hooks for health care workers gear adorn a wall at the petaluma health center which has been taxed by the surge alvin a h jornada special to the chronicle calls to an emergency hotline from people seeking financial help jumped from about 35 calls each day over the fall to an average of more than 1 000 calls a day last week said javier cabrera rosales program director of the cura project the project provided more than 6 million in emergency financial relief from

ended up hospitalized in a medical coma on a ventilator with local emergency rooms full one 8 year old patient with a severe fracture had to be sent to a sacramento hospital toledo added the timeline of seven day averages for new cases indicates that sonoma county s surge may have peaked that average has trended down since 253 cases per 100 000 residents were recorded on jan 16 according to the chronicle s analysis of state data but transmission rates remain high with the number of cases putting pressure on what medications and treatments are available officials say physicians seek to ensure equitable patient access to limited supplies of treatments like pfizer s antiviral pill paxlovid and monoclonal antibody infusions said dr nurit licht at petaluma health center prioritizing medications for those most in need staffers call pharmacies daily to determine where medications are in stock for those patients we really are trying to remove all barriers to treatment for those who need it most licht said in an exam room on monday licht asked simona toledo in spanish how she has been feeling and they discussed what medications might make most sense given her other health conditions toledo knew medicine would be scarce when his mother tested positive at home on a saturday he called more than a half dozen pharmacies in the area before finding one with paxlovid driven by a sense that he must act fast he acknowledged that patients like his mother don t always have family or others advocating on their behalf it takes so much work and advocacy and navigation toledo said the primary care providers are trying to do their best everyone is working to meet the needs of the community but there are such large numbers of people getting infected and so much demand for care

the securities and exchange commission sec is kicking the tires on new cybersecurity and data privacy disclosure requirements for investment companies investment advisers broker dealers and public companies in a speech delivered monday at the northwestern pritzker school of law s annual securities regulation institute conference sec chair gary gensler laid out potential rule changes he said would strengthen existing cybersecurity hygiene and incident reporting disclosures for financial sector participants enhance disclosures made to clients and customers regarding data breaches and enhance existing cyber risk disclosure requirements for public companies with a goal of increasing the transparency of their cybersecurity practices cybersecurity disclosure framework coming public companies are already required to disclose if they are the victim of a ransomware attack or if customer data is stolen if that information is material to investors gensler said the sec might issue new rules regarding how to update those disclosures when such cyber events occur haima marlier partner at morrison foerster and co chair of the firm s securities litigation enforcement and white collar defense group said gensler has previously indicated a rulemaking emphasis on internal controls for public companies indeed in his speech gensler said he would ask sec staff to make recommendations around companies cybersecurity practices and cyber risk disclosures he added this may include their practices with respect to cybersecurity governance strategy and risk management marlier said this could mean gensler and the sec intend to provide more structure around the internal processes and systems in place within public companies for assessing a cyberattack and determining whether to elevate the incident out of it and up the corporate chain of command many public companies already issue disclosures dealing with cyber risk but like with other nonmandatory initiatives say for climate related risk such reports differ by firm i think companies and investors alike would benefit if this information was presented in a consistent comparable and decision useful manner gensler said getting companies to make such disclosures could require safeguards experts agreed the sec is increasingly an outlier among the regulatory community in its determination to pursue enforcement actions against the very businesses that are themselves the victims of cyberattacks said scott kimpel a partner at law firm hunton andrews kurth who previously served as counsel to a sec commissioner for example in response to the highly publicized solarwinds data breach over the summer the sec s division of enforcement sent investigative demands to large numbers of american businesses who were the victims of this attack kimpel continued i hope the sec will use this initiative to recalibrate its approach to cybersecurity to more closely align its philosophy with that of its sister agencies and i believe the sec will not be successful in its efforts if it maintains an adversarial pro enforcement approach marlier said the concept of creating safe harbors particularly for firms affected by cyberattacks would create a situation where companies are more comfortable sharing information with the government new rules for investment firms advisers broker dealers building upon obligations already in place regarding recordkeeping compliance and business continuity regulations gensler said he has asked sec staff to make recommendations for the commission s consideration around how to strengthen financial sector registrants cybersecurity hygiene and incident reporting taking into consideration guidance issued by cisa the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency and others i think such reforms could reduce the risk that these registrants couldn t maintain critical operational capability during a significant cybersecurity incident he said i believe they could give clients and investors better information with which to make decisions create incentives to improve cyber hygiene and provide the commission with more insight into intermediaries cyber risks on data privacy gensler said the sec is mulling changes to regulation s p the 22 year old rule which requires registered broker dealers investment companies and investment advisers to protect customer records and information gensler said the rule should be modernized and expanded particularly considering the increasingly sophisticated types of cyberattacks that regulated entities are facing i ve asked staff for recommendations about how customers and clients receive notifications about cyber events when their data has been accessed such as their personally identifiable information he said this also could include proposing to alter the timing and substance of notifications currently required under reg s p cybersecurity disclosures for vendors gensler said the sec might begin requiring certain registrants to identify cybersecurity risks with their service providers potentially holding registrants accountable for the strength of the cybersecurity measures put in place by their providers this could help ensure important investor protections are not lost and key services are not disrupted as financial sector registrants increasingly rely on outsourced services he said another potential rule change would increase the breadth of entities covered by regulation systems compliance and integrity known as reg sci the rule which the sec adopted in 2014 is geared to strengthen the technology marketplace of the u s securities markets the rule applies to stock exchanges clearinghouses alternative trading systems self regulatory organizations and more the sec proposed to expand reg sci to include treasury trading platforms in september 2020 the proposal was pushed forward again with additional requirements on wednesday two days after gensler s speech editor s note this story was updated jan 26 to reflect the sec s revisited proposal to expand reg sci to include treasury trading platforms

by matt egan cnn business bank of america is handing out 1 billion worth of restricted stock to virtually its entire workforce as the bank seeks to gain an upper hand in the war for talent in a memo shared exclusively with cnn bank of america ceo brian moynihan said tuesday the company is for the first time opening up its stock awards program to lower level employees who make up to 100 000 a year in the past those employees received a one time cash bonus bank of america said each eligible employee will receive between 65 and 600 restricted stock units corresponding with their compensation those units will vest over four years beginning in 2023 at a minimum that means frontline workers like bank tellers will receive restricted shares that are valued on paper at about 2 900 based on bank of america s current share price of 45 at the upper end higher salary employees would get restricted shares valued at around 27 000 bank of america said the estimated value of the stock awards is multiple times higher than the cash bonuses the bank handed out in the past last year bank of america gave 750 cash bonuses to lower paid employees bank of america said the stock awards which are on top of compensation received as part of the bank s annual review process are going out to roughly 97 of its global employee base but not to those who make above 500 000 a year that level of distribution is incredibly high said brian kropp chief of hr research at gartner the fact they are pushing out that kind of award across the workforce is rare bank of america said that only a small portion of its workforce mostly part time employees and workers in certain overseas locations will receive a cash award totaling 750 apiece in the past bank of america relied more on cash bonuses for lower compensated employees the decision to expand the pool of workers getting restricted stock that vests over time is no coincidence bank of america is betting some employees won t want to quit if that means leaving thousands of dollars of stock on the table companies including banks are grappling with high levels of worker turnover a record 4 5 million americans quit their jobs in november according to government statistics we are in the middle of this great resignation said kropp restricted stock creates a long term retention hook rather than just a cash bonus bank of america acknowledged the stock awards along with raising pay for minimum wage workers are designed to attract and retain talent the bank also cited its financial performance highlighted by a record annual profit of 32 billion the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

owned national securities law firm with offices in new york pennsylvania california and georgia according to the complaint the company made false and misleading statements to the market robinhood suffered from major issues with revenue growth at the time of the ipo with its touted transaction based revenues from cryptocurrency trading only providing a temporary boost to otherwise flat growth the company s supposed significant investments in reliability and infrastructure growth were subpar creating the opportunity for service disruptions and cybersecurity failures based on these facts the company s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the ipo period when the market learned the truth about robinhood investors suffered damages on october 26 2021 after the markets closed robinhood reported its third quarter 2021 financial results revealing that its total net revenue for the period between july 1 2021 through september 30 2021 the same period during which the company conducted its ipo came in at 365 million badly missing analyst estimates by nearly 73 million and declines in its monthly active users maus funded accounts assets under custody auc and average revenue per user arpu robinhood also disclosed that third quarter transaction based revenue from cryptocurrency trading which in the lead up to the ipo had been the bulk of the company s revenues was a measly 51 million staggeringly below the 233 million robinhood earned from crypto trading in the second quarter the proportion of robinhood s cryptocurrency transaction based revenue generated by dogecoin alone fell 40 in q3 with robinhood only generating 20 4 million in q3 compared to 144 5 million in q2 at the same time robinhood s net losses skyrocketed from 11 million to 1 32 billion due to a remarkable 1 24 billion stock based compensation expense that was tied to the stock s post ipo performance and its initial rally which boosted its shares to an all time high of 85 a share on august 4 2021 and triggered a massive payout to defendants tenev and bhatt to make matters worse robinhood also guided for less than 1 8 billion in revenue for the full year implying a maximum 85 growth which fell well short of analyst expectations of 111 analysts immediately took note with those at j p morgan for example downgrading their price target and characterizing the company s trading revenue as a disappoint noting in particular how equity trading was particularly weak down both sequentially and yoy despite a near doubling of accounts and mtus and how rypto trading revenue fell 78 down more than the crypto industry average of 40 and the decline of dogecoin trading of 75 before concluding we believe robinhood has been overearning and guidance will weaken for 22 j p morgan also questioned why management did not disclose trading volumes finding it peculiar for a company generating 75 of revenue on volumes but nonetheless suspecting revenue per trade had been elevated a weaker business outlook on this news robinhood s stock declined nearly 10 5 falling from 39 57 per share on october 26 2021 to close at 35 44 per share on october 27 2021 then on november 8 2021 after the markets closed robinhood disclosed that it had suffered a data security incident on november 3 2021 admitting that an unauthorized third party had obtained email addresses for approximately five million users and the full names of a different group of about two million users indicating that the attack potentially affected nearly 40 of robinhood s maus what is more robinhood said the additional personal information of 310 other users including their names dates of birth and zip codes were exposed and within that group that 10 users suffered even more extensive breaches on
