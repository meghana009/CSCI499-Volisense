forecast assumptions and expectations about future outcomes which are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined here and discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings we ll also be referring to the non gaap measures which are summarized below and with that i ll turn it over to al monaco al monaco president and chief executive officer ok thanks jonathan hello everyone well to start off here what you see in the photo is our new ingleside energy center near corpus christi with the vlcc just being maneuvered in the place for loading it s an important investment for us on many fronts so we ll come back to ingleside in a few minutes it s been a strong quarter operationally and financially so vern will take you through the results and by the way vern was recently appointed cfo he s held a number of senior financial roles at enbridge and most recently headed up our liquids business which colin gruending has taken over i ll cover the high points of what s been a catalyst quarter and year for us followed by a business update before i do that though let me speak to the current state of the energy markets and as a reminder our perspective on this is from a company that s been focused on the energy transition for years it s obvious we need to reduce global emissions and that we re moving to a carbon economy and we think that existing infrastructure is essential to that transition as you ve heard us say before we see ourselves as a bridge to a cleaner energy future by leveraging our businesses and by achieving our own emissions goals we re transitioning our asset mix in line with changing fundamentals and building on our early mover advantage in wind solar hydrogen and rng but it s also very clear that energy demand will continue to grow and that economic growth will always depend on conventional energy so squaring these two realities comes down to the pace of transition and ensuring we secure low cost reliable energy supply while that happens the realities of this careful balance are playing out in energy markets today stimulus spending and recovery are driving gdp growth oil gas and product demand are up and should outpace last year on the way to pre pandemic levels petchem demand was resilient through covid but now even jet fuel has come back as you ve seen natural gas demand is extreme particularly in asia and europe so consumption is up and supply disruptions and tight inventories are creating an imbalance and normally all of that is self correcting and supply response but this energy crisis that we re in right now is entirely about under investment in all forms of energy which is creating havoc with consumers industrial competitiveness and inflation higher energy prices are impacting consumers in developing countries spikes in electricity prices heating cooking and filling up the tank higher industrial feedstock costs also impact competitiveness and again that rolls out to the consumer so agriculture manufacturing pharmaceuticals transportation components technology and housing and supply issues are impacting reliability with the rolling blackouts and rationing in china and india increasing coal power generation of all things in germany fuel shortages in the u k in the u s northeast gas generation is running at five year highs and we re seeing switching to fuel oil for electric generation all of that to say the energy transition is a reality but we need to be thoughtful about the pace and execution with the consumer in mind and it s clear if it wasn t before that conventional energy will be critical part of the supply mix for a long time so the point being here that the transition needs to be driven by a mix of balanced policy solutions most important in our view we have to embrace natural gas because it s simply the enabler of building more wind and solar supply among other things and it s a great source of reducing emissions just like it has been to this point incentivizing consumption based economywide emissions reductions and efficiency measures and an immediate focus on regulatory certainty and support for ccus investment so onto the q3 highlights operationally all of our systems ran near capacity and that drove solid numbers and we re on track as you saw in our release to deliver ebitda and dcf per share within guidance the balance sheet and financial flexibility are strong and will move to the lower end of the target leverage range next year it was a big quarter execution wise with 8 billion going into service which will drive 2022 cash flow and that s a great outcome in the face of a difficult permitting environment to say the least we also accelerated our u s export strategy and lower carbon opportunities so all in good headway on priorities moving the ball down the field delivering good results getting projects in the ground and building our business for the future moving to the business update beginning with liquids and line 3 a month ago now we completed the u s segment so we re in full operation for western canada to the midwest and with that we also brought on the southern access expansion to 1 2 million barrels per day into chicago line 3 has always been about modernizing our system and to my earlier point it assures canadian and u s refiners have a reliable low cost feedstock providing affordable energy for consumers and industry line 3 though also set a new bar for execution in the field through world class environmental measures actively engaging with communities in a different way and developing deeper indigenous partnerships cultural environmental and economic we still got work to complete restoration but i m proud of how our team brought this one to the finish line with line 3 in service we ll earn the full 0 935 surcharge on all mainline barrels and returning the line to full capacity sets us up for downstream expansion to the gulf coast on line 5 the existing line and the great lakes tunnel is also about safe and affordable energy the fact is line 5 and the tunnel are essential to michigan but also the entire region and two canadian provinces we re doing everything we can to make sure people s critical energy needs are not cut off like propane in the upper peninsula and jet fuel for the detroit airport as just two examples of many independent experts concluded there s no practical alternative to line 5 other than thousands of more railcars and trucks higher emissions and increased energy costs i m pretty sure people don t want that in fact that s what the majority of michiganders are saying 80 or so believed the cost of energy is important to them and there s four to one support for the tunnel but we ve always understood the need to protect the great lakes which is why we ve gone to extra length at the streets including continuously and independently verifying the entirety of the line shutting down the line as a precaution in high wave and wind conditions and applying the latest in technology to monitor ship traffic to ensure there is no anchor drags we ve committed to build the great lakes tunnel to reduce the risk to as near zero as humanly possible we received the first tunnel permit last year and we re working on the remaining two so let s shift gears now to our export strategy a few years ago we had a point of view on the evolving global supply demand fundamentals and the need to point infrastructure to the gulf and to capitalize on growing exports as you can see the maps developed out we ve built a big presence in the gulf our export strategy is entirely consistent with the energy transition because north america is a low cost sustainable producer of conventional energy and lng exports can displace coal which is going to be a big driver of lowering emissions in asia our u s gulf coast strategy began with providing full path access for canadian heavy to the gulf and establishing a storage and blending hub we re bolstering our seaway dock capacity with our houston oil terminal to provide expanded low cost waterborne access we ve now built out our light oil export position gray oak initially gave us contracted pipeline ownership into corpus and houston and the ingleside energy center now gives us last mile connectivity to the light oil export path ingleside is north america s premium export terminal transiting 25 of u s exports last year with 15 plus million barrels of storage and 1 6 million barrels per day of ship loading capacity ingleside checked all the strategic commercial and financial boxes for us it sources crude from the permian and eagle ford connected by 3 million barrels per day of pipe capacity it s vlcc capable and it s prime location on the outer harbor commercially take or pay commitments fit the business model well and it came at an attractive valuation and we re very glad to have retained the operating team finally we evaluate every new investment at enbridge through an esg lens and specifically we need to see a path to net zero ingleside s new state of the art facilities were designed to reduce emissions in the first place but we re also moving forward with the large inside the fence solar power that ll allow us to achieve net zero on scope 1 and 2 and contribute to scope 3 reductions now it s worth just delving a bit deeper into why this is a business for the future it s clear that the permian is among the most competitive basins globally and its scale low breakevens and proximity to markets means it s essential in any transition scenario and a competitive supply source in meeting global demand for many years to come ingleside has the lowest basin to water cost structure of any export point in corpus or houston and that s because our two vlcc berths can load a twice the rate of a suezmax and we avoid lightering trips which when combined with our outer harbor location saves roughly five days transit we also have capacity to capture incremental barrels and this is a big upside for us we ll go after the low hanging fruit first which is to contract up existing dock capacity which could add another 600 000 barrels per day of loadings and then we ll build into the permitted storage that we already have and dock capacity so another 5 5 million barrels of storage there and 300k of loadings lastly as part of our transition lens again the terminal s location and open land make it an ideal spot for green fuel and carbon capture development while we re on the topic of exports texas eastern and valley crossing are nicely situated along the gulf which puts us at the center of the u s lng build out and that pace should quicken now given the global supply crunch not much doubt about gases role in sustaining european and asian economies displacing coal and building renewables and these fundamentals drive more demand pull on our systems in just two years our lng volumes have doubled to 1 bcf per day and we ll add another half of b with our cameron extension that ll feed calcasieu this year we ve also built a nice portfolio of late stage development projects totaling about 2 billion bill and his team are also executing a 5 billion secured capital program 3 billion of that is targeted for in service this year we ve just completed our two bc expansions for about 600 million cubic feet a day to the lower mainland and u s northwest in the u s northeast we ve put middlesex and appalachian to market into service but again as you all know this region needs a lot more capacity to address reliability and rising energy costs we re advancing our multiyear modernization programs so that will lower emissions and ensure the integrity of our system for years to come but there s more opportunity beyond that our new partnership with vanguard renewables will develop rng projects along our system we re starting with eight projects where we ll provide the injection and transportation assets and that should total around 100 million of capital onto our gas utility in ontario first this system is not only critical to the heating market but meeting peak generation demand in fact the iso s recent study and i encourage everybody to have a look at this makes it clear that natural gas is essential to ontario s energy needs today and in the future our franchise also benefits from continued population growth mostly from immigration we re on track for another 45 000 customers there this year importantly ontario has also approved 27 new community expansions we re planned to sanction new capital for those shortly overall we re executing on 3 billion of utility capital to 2023 so great visibility there to rate base growth there s also lower carbon potential we re developing a sound portfolio of rng and hydrogen opportunities on rng we ve got three in operation and four in construction and through the walker comcor jv we re developing another 15 projects across canada with more potentially in the hopper on hydrogen our green power facility was completed a couple of years ago and that proved out the technology and gave us great experience this quarter we expanded that facility and put into service the blend hydrogen project and that will move into our distribution network the prize here of course is to make that happen across the franchise finally to our renewables business and an update on european offshore wind as you recall we ve got three projects in operation and now three in construction and several opportunities in development matthew went through that at enbridge day offshore france we ve installed 35 foundations at saint nazaire and another 45 plants through mid 2022 so we re on track for in service there late next year later fecamp we re building the foundations there right now and at calvados we re manufacturing substation components and subsea cables these projects will add 1 4 gigawatts of capacity with in service dates through 2024 as far as development we ve got another 3 gigawatts at various stages so we have good runway here as well in north america we re accelerating our inside the fence solar self power we ve put three facilities into service on our liquids and gas pipelines and as you can see here you get a feel for the proximity to our pipelines we ve now started construction on four new projects on the lakehead and flanagan systems this phase will be in service next year and will lower our emissions and generate good returns these projects compete for capital straight up with the rest of our business our existing behind the fence land large power load and renewable capability really give us an advantage in this space and there s a lot of runway to grow at the compressors and pump stations that you see noted on the map here so stay tuned for more all of this is a great example of how we re using our skills that we developed in renewables over the last couple of decades to the rest of our business today last point as part of our new energy business we ve established a dedicated team to coordinate the strategy and allocate capital to the best opportunities an important element of low carbon strategy in our view is partnerships that give us access to technology complementary assets and skills we now have amassed four partnerships which includes a recent one with shell where we will collaborate on a range of north american opportunities and with that let me pass it to vern to go through the financial results and the priorities there vern yu executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks al and good morning everyone as al mentioned earlier my 28 years at enbridge has given me a great view of the business as a whole and i look forward to leveraging this experience to my new role as cfo my focus will be sustaining our track record of disciplined investment and value creation so don t expect to see any big changes from me today i ll start off my remarks with an update on our key financial strategies our balance sheet and financial flexibility were in really good shape we re bbb high across the board we ve bolstered our balance sheet capacity by continuing to recycle capital at attractive valuations another 1 2 billion this year and increased our ebitda through organic growth and continued cost reductions this ebitda growth provides even more financial flexibility the resiliency of our cash flows is very strong providing highly predictable cash flows year after year this solid base along with execution on our capital program has us on track to deliver 2021 results within our ebitda and dcf guidance ranges and the capital we placed into service this year will drive a lot of free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond we expect to have 5 billion to 6 billion of annual investment capacity beginning in 2022 which we ll be deploying in a disciplined manner i ll come back to this later so our foundation is very strong and q3 was another solid enbridge like quarter all of our four key financial metrics are up year over year on strong performance across our businesses and continued cost containment adjusted ebitda and dcf are up about 10 to 3 3 billion and 2 3 billion respectively eps is up over 20 mainline volumes were about 2 7 million barrels per day in q3 reflecting strong demand for heavy crude in path 2 and path 3 which was in line with our expectations gas utilization has been great and for the full year we re seeing the benefits of our rate cases kicking in the utility continues to be strong its cash flows provides stability and it s throwing off a lot of growth finally our renewables business is performing in line with what we ve been expecting this strong operating performance across all of our core businesses has however been partially offset by continued weakness in energy services and the effect of a weaker u s dollar on unhedged revenues in energy services steep backwardation and historically narrow geographical basis has limited our ability to take advantage of pipeline and storage contracts fx has been a modest headwind to our operating results although we are substantially hedged this shows up as an add back in our eliminations and other segment in terms of dcf maintenance capital was a little lighter than planned with three quarters of good results in the books we re well on track to achieve our full year guidance let s turn to ebitda we anticipate strong asset utilization again in q4 with line 3 fully in service on october 1 we re expecting fourth quarter ebitda contributions in line with our guidance of roughly 200 million and the mainline we expected to average just around 2 95 million barrels per day the moda acquisition closed this month and it will be a modest tailwind in q4 with the terminals contracted volumes ramping up over the next 12 months on balance we are anticipating tailwinds and headwinds to be roughly balanced for the rest of the year energy services is expected to remain weak through 2021 we saw some warmer weather in october in ontario which will negatively impact our utility outlook and a weaker u s dollar will weigh on our operating results net of our hedges onto dcf we expect lower interest expense on a weaker u s dollar timing related delays to utility maintenance capital and cash savings from higher u s tax pool utilization roughly in line with the 100 million we outlined in q2 as we move toward year end our focus will shift to 2022 and here s a few factors that will contribute to our forecast which we ll provide a much more fulsome review at on our enbridge day call first the 10 billion of capital that we put into service in 2021 will drive higher ebitda and cash flows ingleside s volumes will ramp up in 2022 growing its ebitda contribution and we re expecting strong utilization across all of our systems including the mainline where we expect 2022 volumes to trend to our q4 outlook the gas pipeline and utility businesses are expected to remain nicely utilized and capture rate increases our renewable projects will remain largely in construction through most of 2022 with saint nazaire coming into service in the last quarter and in energy services we expect losses to moderate in 2022 but we still anticipate a slightly negative contribution next year out of the money contracts will begin to roll off late in 2022 and early in 2023 so that will bring us back to our more normal positive run rate and finally relative to our 2021 plan we expect fx to remain a headwind in 2022 as usual we ll roll out our formal guidance for 2022 in december the outlook for our balance sheet is similarly strong we ve just now completed our 2021 financing plan including 2 4 billion of sustainably linked bonds at historically attractive interest rates despite the full spending associated with line 3 and the moda acquisition with only partial year ebitda contribution our year end credit metric is expected to remain within our 4 5 to 5 0 policy range so that s a good outcome so with a full year of contribution in 2022 from this capital and the noverco sale proceeds we ll drive debt to ebitda down to the low end of our credit metric range in 2022 that s going to provide a lot of financial flexibility and continues to support our bbb high credit rating i m sure you re wondering about inflation so let me spend a minute on how we re thinking about it recall roughly 80 of our ebitda has toll escalators or regulatory mechanisms that protect us and if we continue our cost management track record this could actually provide a small tailwind for us our strategy to procure materials and equipment early has so far shielded us from any significant inflationary impacts today let s shift to how we ll deploy our investment capacity in 2022 we anticipate 5 billion to 6 billion of annual investment capacity and we ll be disciplined in terms of how we invest this to maximize shareholder value we ll provide more detail at enbridge day but our big picture priorities have not changed protecting our balance sheet remains our first priority and we ll assure we ll have plenty of financial flexibility and buffer that includes continuing to evaluate opportunities for further capital recycling where it makes sense we expect to grow the dividend rate hopefully up to the level of medium term dcf growth with an eye to migrating our payout to about the midpoint of our 60 to 70 payout range our base businesses will continue to kick out 3 billion to 4 billion of organic growth opportunities per year with attractive returns that s growth in the utility gas pipeline modernization and low capital liquids pipeline expansions the next 2 billion will go to the next best alternative and we will assess share buybacks adding more organic growth asset m a and further deleveraging as we have said before share buybacks have risen in the order of priority and we continue to believe with the predictability of our cash flows a ratable growth our asset and our asset longevity we are currently undervalued at our current share price i m excited that we have this financial strength and flexibility to optimize our capital allocation and shareholder returns so finally to wrap up our annual enbridge day will be on december 7th this year as usual we ll use this event to update you on our financial outlook and our strategic priorities we re planning for the event to be in person in toronto so we look forward to seeing you there of course we ll have a webcast to for those wanting to attend virtually so with that i will turn it back to al al monaco president and chief executive officer ok thanks vern just a couple of takeaways here 2021 as you heard is a pivotal year for us the business is performing well and is generating highly predictable results we re executing the priorities that we laid out at the last enbridge day and we re on track to put in 10 billion of capital into service this year that will generate a lot of cash flow as you just heard so with that let me hand it back to the operator for q a we re not yet all in the same room here so i ll direct questions as needed so back to the operator questions answers operator thank you and your first question comes from the line of robert kwan with rbc capital markets robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst great good morning i just want to dig into the comments you made to start around at capital allocation and specifically that 2 billion back up you had some comments just around share buybacks and you see your shares as being undervalued i m just wondering whether you similar to what you did about a year ago be willing to rank order those options and as it relates to dividend growth i think vern you mentioned up to the growth the underlying growth i don t know if you can just kind of frame that comment in light of what your friends across the street did this morning vern yu executive vice president and chief financial officer ok robert i think on the capital allocation it s really great that we have the capacity to look at all of these different options obviously when we make these decisions there s a number of pros and cons to each of them on the share buyback front it s great that we can invest in enbridge as the company continues to grow its dcf and its cash flows a share buyback lowers our payout it provides dividend savings and obviously it s executable but some of the cons are that it doesn t provide any further organic growth doesn t add incremental ebitda and doesn t help us with our long and medium term cash horizons so i think what we d like to do is look at that in concert with all of the other opportunities that we have and as we work through 2022 and beyond we ll make sure that we make the best decision for our shareholders if we turn to the dividend obviously dividend growth is a key component of our value proposition we plan to continue to grow it but we have some other competing priorities as well in the near to medium term we d like to get back to the middle part of our policy range and at this present time we don t believe the market s fully valuing the level of the dividend that we provide today so hopefully that provides some clarity for your question there robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst yeah it s great vern and if i can just finish with the question on the oil pipeline side with l3r done you ve talked in the past about other oil pipeline expansions just wondering if there s any update on those now that l3r is in service and are any of these projects somewhat imminent but waiting and being held back pending clarity on the mainline contracting situation al monaco president and chief executive officer so i think we ll get colin to respond to that robert colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline hey robert yeah we re excited that obviously line 3 is in service and immediately being useful and well utilized and we do have a batting order of expansions cost effective ones by the way lined up as we ve talked about for some time our system is vast it s complex and it continually provides you know creative solutions that we can harness as we have to the last number of years you know these range from drug reducing agents horsepower on existing pipes potentially some reversals or even repurposing so the same roster i would say that you re familiar with is being teed up here it will be dependent on customer interest and i think in part industry s you know emerging need to sustain some excess egress and multiple options to market i think that s a concept that s been absent for a couple of decades and we ll do our best to fill that need so we ll talk more about this at enbridge day that s what that day is designed for but we are excited about the prospects here robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you very much colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline thank you operator and we also have jeremy tonet with j p morgan online with a question jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst hi good morning al monaco president and chief executive officer hello jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst well i just want to start off with the ingleside acquisition there i know it s very recent since you guys closed but just didn t know if you could provide any updated thoughts as far as you know now that you have it how is it executing versus to your expectations and i guess more specifically when we think about the crude oil export side you know we ve seen trends shifting there a bit given where the differentials are so wondering if you could provide any more thoughts i guess on how you see those trending in the near term al monaco president and chief executive officer colin colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline yeah sure hey jeremy yeah so we re pretty excited about this you know the market for the permian barrel is increasingly global as you know it s large and growing and it s going to play a long term role in energy export and energy transition we closed the transaction a few weeks ago i know but i would say our q4 outlook and our 22 outlook is quite encouraging we re seeing export loadings ratably ramping up quite nicely in line with upstream drilling rig account trajectories so that s good and i d say it s also very consistent with our purchase economics we have multiple commercial expansion offerings inflight to leverage the operating leverage that al talked about and the fixed cost pre built facility that s there some of these offerings are a continuation of commercial offerings that the prior management team and owner had inflight and some additional ones on our own we re looking at multiple types of products to export and we ve had some good inbound interest i would say here right off the bat so i think it s looking generally pretty positive here jeremy al monaco president and chief executive officer maybe just to add jeremy one point to that you know really in terms of your part of your question around differentials and where they ebb and flow the way we look at this one is this is highly contracted facility so the way the economics work in our model is we ve got that base and then we sort of look at it as upside if the differentials point our way and in the producers way and so really i think good upside here to global dynamics which you know are likely going to look for more low cost reliable light crude from north america so that s just how we look at it in a bigger picture jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst got it that s very helpful there and then maybe just want to pivot to i guess energy transition side a little bit rng seems like is quite active in canadian side just wondering on the u s side if you see opportunities there or how much capital could be deployed in general al monaco president and chief executive officer well bill is probably closest to the u s side given the new opportunity there with vanguard so maybe bill why don t you take that bill yardley executive vice president gas transmission and midstream yeah you know jeremy i think the vanguard renewables partnership that we announced is a really good step you know we have line of sight to a 100 million worth of projects you know in the near term so it s kind of a good place to dip our toe in the water and you know the model that we re setting up it really gives us a line of sight to even more so like i said toe on the water really really good stuff there i think in addition to that partnership though we really got to think about our long standing relationship with all of the ldc customers so all of our utilities that you know are somewhat active in this space and you know the relationship there could extend from partnerships to do some rng projects together to just simply we do a project and have a resale to them as they as we both strive to meet our emissions target so i think it s got a lot of potential i mean how much is yet to be seen it s pretty amazing when some a place like the aga comes out with a statement saying well you know rng could meet half the heating load over the next i forget the timeline 10 or 20 years that s pretty impressive jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst got it thanks for that i ll leave it there al monaco president and chief executive officer ok thanks jeremy operator your next question comes from the line of ben pham with bmo please go ahead ben pham bmo capital markets analyst good morning i want to understand energy transition and i m wondering when you look at energy transition opportunities and you put them through your filter you look at the risk reward is there would there be any significant difference in how you look at those investments versus year existing portfolio is it different returns different risks profiles different counter price would love comments on that al monaco president and chief executive officer ok it s al ben so i would say it s exactly the same as we look at the rest of our business and as vern referred to we ll continue to be very disciplined as we re putting capital to work in the future so maybe the way to think about this at a high level is if you look at what we have inflight right now if you look at wind solar some initial rng and hydrogen investments they re pretty much right in line with the business model that you re used to seeing from us and in the case of hydrogen for example with the two projects that we re working on in ontario and then a third one in quebec they ll be incubated if you want to look at it that way within the existing commercial model where we re assured a return on and return of capital so i think that s the way we re looking at it we ve probably got 2 billion inflight now in terms of energy transition category and i would say that over the next five years you re probably looking at that same level of call it a billion dollars a year i think what s to be determined though longer term is how fast hydrogen and other areas like ccus develop so i think for the next five years we don t see massive amounts of capital being deployed there other than these core areas that we re working on right now so hopefully that provides some context vern yu executive vice president and chief financial officer can i make just a quick add on al monaco president and chief executive officer yeah vern yu executive vice president and chief financial officer the other thing that we re doing is when we look at our traditional investments now we do add the price of carbon to each of those investments and we also increased the hurdle rates slightly because of the energy transition risks on some of those opportunities so with these energy transition assets obviously those adders aren t applied al monaco president and chief executive officer yeah and again i think you ve seen the chart we use for this ben the whole game here for us is to really utilize the existing assets to leverage those assets into low carbon opportunities so you see it in the utility you see it in bill s business and you see it with the solar self power which links right up to our conventional business ben pham bmo capital markets analyst ok great and then my second question on mainline cer decision are around the corner do you expect the cer decision that effectively be a yes and no as you ve applied application boundaries is there a situation where they can give you a blanket approval subject to conditions on contract levels and tolls al monaco president and chief executive officer colin colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline hey ben you know we re waiting for this eminently right and it s unclear precisely the form of the decision that will come i think they have an array of choices here but obviously we strongly believe in the one we filed for with the variety of benefits we included in it that were as you recall requested by industry so we look forward to that and i would say if the decision is acceptable and i would emphasize this next word in its totality right we would proceed to the next stage which would be commercial contracting and then you know finality by mid 22 if it s not acceptable again in its totality from a risk reward perspective for our capital providers we could refile for something else that would be and i think we ve laid out some options there over the last couple of years so i will have to wait and see ben ben pham bmo capital markets analyst ok perfect operator shneur gershuni with ubs is online with a question shneur gershuni ubs analyst good morning everyone i was just looking at slide 23 you know where kind of you presented the outlook and the preliminary 22 outlook although there s no number i did try with my ruler to figure it out but i guess my question here is that you sort of highlighted the in terms of the positive benefits and negative benefits obviously the dollar and energy services you know its headwinds but you sort of included moda as well as the benefit of the 21 growth capex i was wondering if you can sort of talk about any other tailwinds that you re seeing you know in your prepared remarks you talked about you know kind of the energy crisis that s going on right now are there any inflation escalators you know tied to ppi and cpi that could potentially benefit enbridge just kind of curious what other tailwinds that we could be thinking about where you could see some operating leverage within the existing system not just with respect to the growth capex coming online al monaco president and chief executive officer yup well maybe i ll just try to go through this quickly first of all on your question around inflation i think as vern mentioned there s a very large majority of our ebitda and revenue that s driven by indexing of some sort that s off of inflation so that s a plus i think in terms of the commodity part of your question you know as you know you know we re not hugely driven by commodity prices given our business mode but there are a couple of things around ngls that we have for example at aux sable maybe there s a little bit of a tailwind with some excess capacity we might have in market gas you know to capitalize on that i would say you know big part of what we ve been focused on in the last two three years though shneur is cost management and you know that s not to be underestimated especially since every dollar you save is certainly very helpful from a balance sheet perspective and so those are the general categories of tailwinds beside the bigger ones that vern mentioned shneur gershuni ubs analyst ok great and just to clarify before asking my second question there isn t like line 3 is bringing more volumes and part of your assets elsewhere we ll see benefits as well too or al monaco president and chief executive officer i m sorry could you just clarify that shneur shneur gershuni ubs analyst it just the fact that like line 3 replacement is now in service that there would be more volumes flowing through that there could be more operating leverage elsewhere in the system al monaco president and chief executive officer yeah i think we re probably going to be pretty much at capacity at least that s the way we ve molded it out so far with line 3 now in service i think the benefits there may be some marginal benefits with additional volumes here and there probably not huge the big upside though of course is now that we have it in places as was mentioned you know there will be some downstream expansion possibility there that you know looks pretty good and remember those are going to be very low capital intense opportunities so right down the fairway for us at this part of the cycle so we ll do well on those shneur gershuni ubs analyst that makes perfect sense and for the second question just to go back to the acquisition of moda just kind of wanted to understand your broader strategy with respect to exports you acquired moda to change your view on spot or it s part of a larger strategy just given the slide that you would put out are you looking to add more to activity to corpus now with respect to having moda in place and would you be expanding that export strategy to include lng potentially as well so al monaco president and chief executive officer well maybe i ll start it off then we ll go to colin so this part of the strategy was really all about the second leg commodity wise so as you know we were the first ones to build that path on the heavy barrels into the gulf coast over the last several years this was really about now covering the light oil side and we re so happy about this because of the sheer competitiveness of the permian and eagle ford on global market scale and so with moda being the lowest cost infrastructure to market we really think we re in ideal position here to capitalize on the upside that we think will come from exports we talked about lng i actually see this as an equally powerful strategy where we re located on the gulf and how we re hooked up to existing lng and importantly i talked about 2 billion of lng projects in development we are lining up really well with new fid projects potentially in the next little while where we ll have captured the pipeline capacity that feeds those lng plants so that s a real big picture at how we re thinking about exports colin any more to add on moda colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline yeah sure and i think i reference you back to slides 10 13 where we re developing out gradually and i d say in a disciplined manner export maps in both crude oil and lng and they re really coming into focus on crude in particularly you can see on slide 10 we ve got a number of a diverse roster here in multiple points across the gulf and that fits the strategy i was talking about so primarily a light focus at corpus yes we re still interested in spot that would be likely a more medium heavy export market and would feed off our seaway path and all the way from canada potentially down the road we could connect seaway over to corpus so that you can get a sense of what we re trying to build out here does that help shneur gershuni ubs analyst no perfect that was a very thorough answer really appreciate the color thanks a lot and have a great weekend al monaco president and chief executive officer ok shneur thanks operator robert catellier with cibc capital markets is online with a question robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst hi good morning you referred a little bit to inflation earlier in your comments and as you re no doubt aware some industrial users have been calling for a reduction in lng exports in order to help mitigate the impact on price so obviously that s a reactionary comment but i m wondering if the current inflation environment has had any change any impact on how you look at the lng fundamentals over the longer term al monaco president and chief executive officer bill do you want to comment on what you re hearing on the ground on that one bill yardley executive vice president gas transmission and midstream yeah i mean rob we re not hearing that to be honest i mean this is i can only say suddenly we re in the market we re in the market that we d hope for you know i think we ve seen a number of offtake contracts signed can think of five very recent ones many of them are those projects that we ve got our eyes on that helped us build out our infrastructure and we think there s more to come so i could get into a much longer answer but the short answer is i don t see the momentum stopping right now robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst ok thank you al monaco president and chief executive officer ok rob operator rob hope with scotiabank is online with a question rob hope scotiabank analyst morning everyone wanted to delve into the mainline volume 2022 outlook maybe as we enter into 2022 like as i understand heavy is still under apportionment there s a bit of a ramp in line 3 there as well so is it just seasonality with some outages in the back half of the year and i guess secondly if you get a favorable mainline ruling could we see you know maybe some dra expansions providing some upside here colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline hey rob it s colin yes we ll provide some more color on this at enbridge day for sure and give you a sense of seasonality as well it is an average i think and i think vern mentioned we re looking at next year you know in the same neighborhood of 2 95 million barrels per day that s an average there s seasonality of that a bunch of factors it s largely full so there may be some operating leverage here and there but that s the gist of it yeah you mentioned apportionment we ve come down nicely i think we were in the 40 to 50 apportionment range and now we re down kind of 10 ish and we ll see where that goes in december i think all market participants are adjusting to the new dynamic with the step change in line 3 capacity and capline as well is coming into service january 1 is line filling right now and by the way that should be a positive pull through our system and the various pipes like sax and mustang as well so i think we feel pretty good about that 2 95 area i ll kind of blur the specificity of it for now but generally full i think is how you should think about it al monaco president and chief executive officer and i think colin to his question around dra opportunity i think in terms of how we re looking at the outlook for 22 at this point we haven t contemplated any of that an additional dra at this point but correct me if i m wrong colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline no that s good clarification yeah that probably bridges back to robert s question at the beginning so we would think about that as a further tranche of growth down the road rob hope scotiabank analyst all right that s helpful and then just circling back to your comments on the mainline recontracting initiative and taking a look at the decision in its totality you know a lot has changed through the you know many years that this has been going on you know with the demise of keystone xl has the amount of contracts on the system you know gone down in priority for you whereas the toll level has increased or kind of maybe puts and takes on how you re thinking about that decision colin gruending executive vice president liquids pipeline yeah again back to totality you re right there are things that have changed probably some favorable some unfavorable it remains industry s general preference to contract the line for all the reasons toll certainty that s been a historical tenet of all our arrangements for the last 25 years access to capacity following 20 years of egress deficit and the toll we re looking at here is as a reminder it s basically an extension of the toll on at the exit of our expiry here and with toll discounts it s actually lower for many so i think we would also you know prefer to contract the line they re all our vulnerabilities out in the planning horizon as trans mountain comes on so again the totality concept applies to that balance of risk reward we re trying to optimize so again we re going to have to carefully review the decision and like i said if it works we ll proceed if not we ll refile something else either a fixed tariff tolling arrangement like the ones we ve had for 25 years or a cost of service arrangement where cash flows are protected al monaco president and chief executive officer and i was just going to mention on that last point colin for rob the other way to look at this is you know what the shippers are actually not very excited about which we ve heard very clearly from them that cost of service is something they d not prefer and there s issues with the commercial structure with the existing type of arrangement so i think it s almost when you triangulate what they ve really pushed for which is contracting we still think that s the best outcome for them and for us and it s been driven over as colin said a long time in discussion with industry rob hope scotiabank analyst thank you operator this concludes the question and answer session i will now turn the call over to jonathan morgan for final remarks jonathan morgan vice president

update any forward looking statements with that i d like to turn the call over to mark mark morelli president and chief executive officer thanks lisa and good morning everyone i m very proud of our third quarter performance the team is making significant progress toward our profitable growth initiatives and portfolio diversification through the course of 2021 the team s exceptional execution features continuous improvement and deeper deployment of the vontier business system we delivered another quarter exceeding our guidance on all metrics despite a very challenging backdrop we achieved nearly one point of core revenue growth and nearly 10 core revenue growth excluding emv given the supply chain headwinds that every other company is also encountering i believe the real standout measure for vontier this quarter is our margin performance we drove 90 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion and 70 basis points of adjusted core operating margin this strong performance driving our earnings growth reflects the efforts by our world class supply chain team and swift price and specific actions taken across the businesses to counter persistent inflation and worsening material availability as well as labor shortages demand for our solutions is solid with order growth excluding emv up mid single digits and our ability to price continues to outpace inflation we ve managed positive price costs even in the face of dramatic cost increases associated with expedited freight but it s becoming more and more challenging given the pace and rate of the inflationary and logistics headwinds and while we were able to reduce backlog during the quarter levels remained elevated and so at the end of the day our ability to deliver growth really comes down to the availability of materials as many of you know the vontier businesses are short cycled and we are continuing to derisk our supply chain through our simplification initiatives and by leveraging local partners with a diverse network we are hyper focused on securing this supply base daily management one of the hallmark fundamentals of our business system is critical to our success in this environment global cross functional teams are collaborating virtually in real time to navigate a multitude of issues for example procurement and r d engineers dynamically problem solve and rewrite softwares to accommodate alternative components we are shipping by air when necessary we operate with long term value creation as our highest priority and that s why our mantra is delivery ahead of cost to that end we remain diligent in our efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities this was clearly evident at our recent vbs growth and innovation conference we had nearly 70 of our senior commercial and engineering leaders together to share best practices teams shared lessons learned ranging from simplification to improve focus and lean portfolio management to experimentation and digital transformation tbr leaders shared how they utilize an agile development process to collaborate closely with customers and to accelerate new product time to market the recently launched vontier data and analytics hub helped automate complex analytics to reduce costs and respond to customers much more quickly at gtt there are many more examples like these to illustrate how we re building better innovation capabilities importantly our efforts to improve return on every r d dollar invested are gaining traction and i look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in september we completed our annual strategic reviews for the first time as a stand alone company i ve never been more excited about our organic and inorganic growth and portfolio diversification opportunities as these reviews highlight the strength of our positions and the runway potential in our markets our recently closed acquisition of drb exemplifies the playbook importance of focusing on attractive markets and company characteristics that deliver value the drb team is making an immediate difference i m excited about the depth of experience they bring with predictive analytics and behavioral economics they uniquely engage and understand the consumer and deliver solutions to their customers solving high value problems they ve invested wisely for growth and you will learn more about their high value workflow solutions and innovative business model in just a couple of weeks during the retail solutions virtual teach in moving to the outlook we re raising our full year 2021 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to 2 82 per share to 2 86 per share to include the impact of drb this represents year over year growth of 14 to 16 or greater than 20 excluding the expected impact from emv this includes continued assumptions for high single digit core revenue growth and core adjusted operating margin expansion of more than 125 basis points we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 90 to 95 reflecting the lack of linearity due to the supply chain pressures on working capital and just as we communicated at the beginning of the year the tale of two halves comparison dynamics provide the best perspective for the second half growth rates with that backdrop as a reminder we are initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of 0 77 to 0 81 this assumes a mid single digit core revenue decline and 50 to 75 basis points of adjusted core operating margin contraction as we look to manage the decremental in the 30 range we believe the unprecedented supply chain constraints limit upside opportunity making the middle of the eps range the highest probability outcome with that i ll turn the call over to dave to provide the financial dave dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark adjusted net earnings for the third quarter were 137 million an increase of 2 from 134 million in the prior year period this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of 0 80 the increase in earnings was primarily driven by continued growth in our non emv businesses and strong price which offset the impact of material inflation resulting in strong fall through and approximately 70 basis points of core adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter core revenue growth in the third quarter was approximately 1 amid strong demand and against the prior year q3 which benefited from a sharp recovery from the pandemic lows as well as regulatory driven demand in north america and in the high growth markets the tale of two halves as we referred to it sequentially revenue grew mid single digits directionally consistent with our historical seasonality in the third quarter core revenue growth was driven by our non emv businesses which grew approximately 10 and was mostly offset by the anticipated roll off of emv and the regulatory driver in mexico which benefited the second half of last year adjusted operating profit for the third quarter was 188 million a growth of 4 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by revenue growth and solid operational execution as we managed through persistent inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions across our operating companies as mark stated through broad pricing actions and the team s continued focus on executing on our profitable growth initiatives we drove approximately 90 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion and 70 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion more than offsetting a headwind of approximately 10 million from raw material inflation and logistics in the third quarter we generated adjusted free cash flow of 119 million a conversion of 87 reflecting some build of working capital during the quarter which remains at very low levels importantly year to date our free cash flow conversion is more than 90 and approximately 100 after excluding the incremental federal tax payment paid in the second quarter of this year relating to our 2020 spend additionally our net leverage stands at 2 9 times adjusted ebitda up 1 2 turns from the prior quarter reflecting the completion of the drb acquisition which was successfully closed in september looking at the performance of our two platforms mobility technologies core revenue declined 1 as gvr declined slightly due to the roll off of emv in north america and the fiscal regulation in mexico excluding the impact of emv gvr core revenue and bookings grew low teens and high single digits respectively which highlights the continued demand momentum especially in retail solutions environmental solutions and further progress in high growth markets in the high growth markets revenue grew low single digits in the third quarter as continued momentum in india and middle east and africa was partially offset by the compare against the prior year mexico fiscal regulation on a year to date basis core growth in our high growth markets is up high teens core revenue growth in our diagnostics and repair technologies platform was 7 driven by high single digit demand at matco and compares with the third quarter of 2020 which saw a strong recovery from the pandemic impacts matco continues to experience a strong demand environment and a growing distribution base reflecting our fifth consecutive quarter of strong net franchisee additions following the pause during the height of the pandemic diagnostics and repair technologies backlog continues to remain elevated as we work through supply chain challenges in this robust demand environment looking at total company sales regionally as i mentioned high growth markets revenue grew low single digits as a result of the tough mexico compare and we continue to make progress in strategically important markets including india the middle east and africa and latin america growth in the developed markets in total was up slightly in the third quarter as growth in western europe and in the non emv portions of our north america business was offset by the impact of emv on our gvr north america business we also continued to make progress on our profit improvement actions that will better position the company for the remainder of 2021 and beyond we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately 3 million in the third quarter we now anticipate that we will recognize a charge of around 15 million in 2021 a bit lower than we were previously planning as we continue to align the pace of actions relative to the strong demand environment this means a remaining charge of approximately 5 million would be shifted from q4 to the first quarter of next year and we anticipate that we will still achieve our original savings objectives for 2022 turning to the outlook assumptions for the full year 2021 we are maintaining our core revenue guide of high single digit growth and our core operating margin expansion target of greater than 125 basis points in 2021 reflecting continued execution on our profitable growth initiatives and cost management and partially offset by persistent inflationary pressures supply chain and logistics constraints and mix that said we are raising our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of 2 82 to 2 86 growth of approximately 14 to 16 year over year reflecting continued momentum and execution in our core business combined with about 0 04 to 0 05 contribution for the in year impact of the acquisition of drb we anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 23 reflecting some benefit from tax planning initiatives that were implemented in the third quarter and on free cash flow conversion we have seen working capital increase for two consecutive quarters while still being at historically very low levels we believe this will put some pressure on our free cash flow conversion and see that being around 90 to 95 for the full year this of course includes the additional federal tax payment that we had in q2 and excluding this our conversion would be around 100 level that we typically expect shifting to the fourth quarter we expect a core revenue decline of mid single digits as a result of the emv compare dynamic while non emv revenues are expected to still grow low single digits despite a tough compare looking on a two year stack basis given the uniqueness of the 2020 compare dynamic non emv growth is expected to be up high single digits adjusted core operating margin is expected to contract 50 to 75 basis points this primarily reflects the difficult comps related to the strength of matco emv and mexico fiscal regulations in the prior year period consistent with the tale of two halves dynamic that we communicated when entering the year as mark stated this translates into adjusted earnings per share of 0 77 to 0 81 overall the third quarter demonstrated our ability to execute in a very dynamic environment and as we round out the year we are on pace with our planned actions to more than offset the earnings impact of emv sunset and to direct resources to take advantage of other growth drivers in attractive end markets with that i will turn it back to mark mark morelli president and chief executive officer thanks dave before i wrap up i want to remind you of the retail solutions teach in on november 19 where aaron and dan will give you a deep dive into our gvr and drb retail focused businesses it will feature a high quality portfolio of scale with a long runway of attractive expansion opportunities and secular growth drivers in closing i hope you see what i see exceptional execution our culture of vbs at work and important progress on our profitable growth initiatives and portfolio diversification we re growing into a more focused higher quality industrial technology company we re excited about the opportunities that come with that to build better teams better innovation and a better planet we re well positioned to deliver sustainable mobility solutions to the market our track record of transformation strategic optionality and strong cash generation drives our long term value creation by will and we re committed to staying laser focused on delivering more profitable growth and compounding returns with that i ll turn the call over to lisa so we can get to your questions lisa curran vice president investor relations thanks mark that concludes our formal comments emma we are now ready for questions questions answers operator we ll take our first question from andy kaplowitz with citigroup andy kaplowitz citi analyst mark or dave could you give us more color into the puts and takes of your margin performance obviously good performance in q3 with the incrementals greater than 40 and the swing to 30 decrementals in q4 isn t overly surprising but as we think about that q4 decremental you mentioned a big part of the issue is the tough comparison for emv strength and matco but can you update us on how you re thinking about price versus material and logistics costs in q4 and really into 22 if possible i know you mentioned price risk cost is positive in q3 but does that swing to negative in q4 dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks andy this is dave as we look into fourth we anticipate that we will still be price cost positive as we have been year to date obviously it s a pretty dynamic environment we want to see where we exit the year before giving you guys an update or steer toward 2022 what i can tell you as we look toward the end of the year we ll see where we exit but as we sit here today we don t anticipate any improvement next year in a meaningful manner so we re going to position ourselves for that accordingly staying price cost positive was by far the biggest kind of margin action out there and as we work through the tale of two halves and we see emv coming off that s obviously pretty good revenue so there can be a mix headwind associated with that but i think you ve picked up on the and i would finally add that from a supply chain standpoint the third was pretty dynamic and we don t see things improving as we get into the fourth in fact probably a little bit worse and so we ve kind of built some of that caution in as well you talked about the incrementals and decrementals we incremented well in the third that obviously probably has a little bit to do with the loss small numbers as we saw some uncertainty in the revenue conversion timing we took some actions that have a magnified impact on incrementals given the lower growth on top and as we look to the fourth against the tough compare the way i think about it is we re decrementing at 30 which is a much lower rate than we ve incremented through the course of this year andy kaplowitz citi analyst very helpful dave and then you mentioned gvr orders excluding emv grew high single digits which seems relatively good but maybe you can give us a little more color into how you re thinking about mobility as emv continues to wind down i know you told us last quarter that there ll still be a similar headwind in 22 from wind down in 21 so do you see enough demand for instance from healthier developed world customers or faster growing customers in developing countries such as india to promote growth as we go into 22 mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes thank you for that question look i feel really good about the initiatives we re taking that are really driving that ex emv growth there i think you re seeing it show up continually and what gives me some confidence there is that we have a set of profitable growth initiatives that are really taking hold and they re reading through we saw strong growth in environmental retail solutions of course auto repair through matco as well as our spare parts business so i think you mentioned the high growth markets there s a number of initiatives there particularly out of india middle east and africa that have been really strong so we ve lined up a pretty good slate of initiatives that we continue to deliver on and we ve got a lot of momentum around that at the same time when you go into next year we got drb for a full year they performed really well in the last the two weeks we had them we ve been really impressed with what we see so far so we re excited to add that to our portfolio and i think you re going to see that read through really nicely next year too andy kaplowitz citi analyst appreciate it mark operator we ll go next to nigel coe with wolfe research brian lau wolfe research analyst good morning everybody this is brian lau on for nigel maybe i just wanted to talk about matco quick so five strong quarters in a row of franchisee adds backlog remains elevated just could you provide an update on the amount of geographies still available for franchisee adds and then how are you thinking about all these franchisee adds ramping into 2022 perhaps driving some growth mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes thanks brian for the question look i understand why you re asking that the business is performing really well to be really concise on your answer we ve got about 30 of our territories that are open and available to us which is kind of unique to compared to the higher quality peers in that space and we ve been building that out and we feel really good about the progress they ve been making the backdrop here is a really strong environment for technicians that continue to buy they re flush with cash and they re out there investing in their businesses and that s reading through in our product lines when you look at diagnostics which is a higher price item they re continuing to actually i would say not continuing they re actually stepping up purchases as well as high dollar toolbox and so when you think about sales that s a real advantage the other thing that bodes well for it is that for this business is that we ve got a really strong vitality which means that every year we bring about 30 products that are new to market and so the key here is to continue that vitality particularly as we go into next year which i m very confident we can because we re providing solutions that technicians want and will continue them buying so we re going to take advantage of the strong backdrop and we re going to keep pushing it forward brian lau wolfe research analyst great and then just a quick follow up with some of the revenue it sounds like pushing to the right do you have any more visibility into 1q 22 versus what s normally a seasonally weaker quarter sequentially mark morelli president and chief executive officer look i think the way we re thinking about 22 is a strong setup but we ll give you more color on that in february as we normally do but the backdrop there is strong great demand environment as well as these tremendous momentum from these profitable growth initiatives so i think the setup is good dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer i would add brian that we ll probably enter 22 with more backlog than we entered 21 but again like the fourth quarter it s going to come down to the supply environment so we really want to see how that develops and that will go a lot toward our visibility operator we ll go next to steve tusa with j p morgan steve tusa j p morgan analyst can you maybe just talk about what you see today if you kind of snap the line what kind of price cost would look like for next year dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer well look year to date price cost and we anticipate through the end of the year has been pretty favorable and as you know this is always a big focus area for us i think it s we re going to have to get a read on the inflationary environment for next year as i said earlier steve i think we re assuming the worst as we make our plans for next year but we have to see how that develops and that will clearly drive our actions part of the setup for that is the fourth and we re leaning into it but i would also say that there s items beyond price cost as we think of the profitability impact from inflation we need to work all parts of the p l in response to that mark do you want to add to that mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes thanks dave look steve i think the key is that this environment is not going to change quickly in other words there s a lot of headwinds that are in this and we feel really good the way that we ve worked through it so far we have a really strong set of initiatives that are paying off i m happy to get into any detail that you all would like but it s pretty clear we ve been ahead of this curve from early on based on those initiatives and as we go into next year we re counting on this environment to be underway and we re rolling out even more initiatives that dig deeper i think that s the nature of this continuous improvement mindset that we have as we continue to peel the onion on this a great example of that is our simplification efforts that actually reduce the number of skus that we need to chase and it enables us to get better alternative sourcing and dig deeper on the components that really matter and so i think that s sort of a new envelope that we re going to be pushing into next year that can even pay off more operator we ll take the next question from andrew obin bank of america david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst this is david ridley lane on for andrew i m just wondering in mobility tech have you seen any slowdown maybe anecdotally around your customers ability to complete projects and willingness to start new projects around labor availability cost inflation some of the supply chain issues just wondering if your sort of orders we re hearing from your salespeople that these are sort of negative factors affecting your order pace mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes it s a fairly short answer no i think that there i understand the labor constrained markets out there and certainly we re working through those ourselves but i feel like there s ways of finding solutions to that and we ve been pretty effective at doing that and i think most of our customers are really in that i m not saying that that doesn t exist maybe in some pockets out there but it doesn t read through when you add it all up david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then just i think we have most of the components on bridging the core operating margin expansion from third quarter down to the fourth quarter guidance could you kind of give us a rank order of those in terms of some of the benefits onetime benefits you were getting in the year ago quarter versus what s getting incrementally worse dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer well look it s tough for me to do the full bridge here in this venue but i will say that i would steer you back to our 30 decrementals and within that obviously the top line decline is associated with our emv product line which is a reasonably high margin item so there s some mix impact associated with that the price cost assumption we should assume that we continue to offset the margin impact but that i would say that dynamic has continued to tighten as the years progressed so we probably see the margin upside from price cost tightening up as we go i think those are the big items operator your next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays trish gorman barclays analyst this is trish gorman on for julian and so just back on the supply environment can you guys talk a little bit more about its impact on gvr relative to diagnostics and repairs and then maybe if that s changed your expectations for emv headwinds in 2022 at all mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes happy to take that question look when you look at the environment for gvr the biggest issue that we got to work through and the risk that we ve been predominantly managing has been through some of the specific gvr factory related material availability and as i ve said in our remarks i think we ve really worked through that admirably well i think we re really proud of the efforts that we re doing there to pay off you talked about diagnostics and repair of course we ve got a factory there for toolboxes and we ve got a lot of supply chain issues because we source a lot of products there but on both accounts there s been risk no question about that and we could have shipped more as dave said in his prepared remarks if we can solve that better and so that s clearly a work in progress but i think when you think about how we think about risk there it s mostly on material availability somewhat on labor shortages and supply as i said but it doesn t rise to the specter of the material availability issues and we continue to work through it admirably well so we re a little bit cautious on the environment but we re optimistic we can continue to work it dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer and on the emv point i think we re going to see how the fourth comes together where we exit the year but as of today no update to our emv outlook for 2022 that we previously provided which is that the impact could be similar to what we see happening in 2021 which is 75 million to 100 million year over year decline trish gorman barclays analyst great that s very helpful and then just maybe a follow up can you just remind us how typical pricing works in both of these segments maybe just like ballpark what is it typically in a normal year kind of low mid single digit maybe and then just the cadence of from when you announced the price increase typically how long does that take for it to become effective mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes so we had a number of price increases this year that were not sort of in schedule within schedule is a pricing increase for the end of the year that sets you up for the beginning of the year and we ve been pretty good at that i would say on a normal basis what we started actually last year about this time was some deep analytics on strategic pricing that we could take we did not actually know that the environment for 2021 was going to be as inflationary as it s been but we got an early start because we recognized there was a strategic pricing opportunity that came out of our simplification efforts and so that read through on a number of price increases through the year based on getting and we got an early start accordingly so i think maybe that gives you a little color on how we think about it and how we re going to continue to prosecute this what i view as a net opportunity for us in the market operator we ll take our next question from andrew buscaglia with berenberg andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst so a lot of the near term price cost stuff is kind of taken so i just want to ask kind of a more philosophical question so i think drb was a great deal it definitely serves the purpose that helps offset the emv headwind but i think the market the multiple kind of beyond at that acquisition and i m wondering with m a still a priority what where do you like investments in some of the kind of longer term growth year type deals or acquisitions or investments how are they prioritized i think going forward i know that won t help you financially near term but i wonder if the stock would just be more sensitive to kind of showing some strategic change toward some growth areas albeit long term mark morelli president and chief executive officer look i think that s a great question i do want to touch on drb but just give me a minute because i want to answer your question really specifically we see a range of deals in our pipeline we are super excited about the cultivation that s been going on i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re coming out of our strategic reviews and i think there s an excellent balance of really growthy type deals out there but we re looking at bolt ons we re looking at adjacencies like drb and we re looking at this growthier space that would provide early stage technologies that are more strategic over the longer term and i think that balance is something you should expect both hardware and software and we re excited about it i think the space is to think about our retail solutions telematics smart cities just to name a few but let me just touch on drb because i think it s really indicative of kind of also where we re going this is a great asset this is an end to end technology platform it combines this deeply embedded point of sale technology and layers on top of it workflow and monitoring software it s got a great recurring revenue base and it does things like integrated payments and digital marketing solutions and so what s happening is you see a business moving up the technology stack and that s exactly the kind of things that we also like as well so more to come andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok yes helpful i agree i agree with that it might just take some time for the market to kind of realize that and i think if the stock is still kind of hanging out here into next year where does share buyback where does that fall in your priority list and if the stock is still kind of floundering do you would that move up in your priority list dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer look i think our focus is always on providing the best opportunity for shareholder return and we continue to think that s through deploying capital on m a obviously things can change in the future but that maintains our primary capital allocation priority right now i would say operator we ll go next to rob mason baird rob mason baird analyst i wanted to see if you could you spoke to the growth in environmental this quarter i was curious how you view the runway on environmental here in the fourth quarter into next year and maybe juxtaposition against how you see that versus the retail solutions side of the business mark morelli president and chief executive officer i think environmental has got drop to it the fundamentals are clearly there it s less impacted by emv a great set of products and solutions that are connected as well as workflow solutions there and so we re continuing to push that opportunity outstanding growth that you ve seen and so we ve also launched a number of really innovative products to market this past year and i think they re helping us really get better traction in that marketplace so we feel good about where we are and we re going to press every opportunity on that so i also feel good about that going into next year a lot of momentum rob mason baird analyst in retail solutions perspective as well mark morelli president and chief executive officer well the great thing is we get to talk to you on retail solutions on november 19 so we re pretty bullish on that opportunity we d love we re excited to showcase that to you a number of really sticky customer serving problems that not only help us sort of line up how customers can do better business and convenience retailing as well as what we are looking at in terms of car wash so really happy to talk about that more in depth on november 19 rob mason baird analyst very good we ll sit tight on that and then just as a follow up there was the mention that you took backlog down some was that the case in matco s business or was that more in gvr dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer that was more in gvr we wish we had taken it down further we talked about being supply chain constrained and we would have been able to get more revenue out the door and more backlog off the books for sure so we re running at very high levels we talked about almost 40 year over year higher but matco and gvr were where we saw the primary challenges in getting backlog down and probably a little more gvr than matco operator our next question comes from julian mitchell barclays trish gorman barclays analyst this is trish on again just a follow up for me you mentioned backlog year over year and you mentioned orders growth kind of ex gvr being up mid single digits what were the total company orders growth in the quarter and i don t know if you have that by matco versus gvr or if you ll disclose that dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer yes on an orders basis on a year over year basis we were down kind of that mid single digits total up it s really the emv dynamic and heading into that tale of two halves that we talked about here so sequentially we tend to see orders come down a little bit but it s really the impact of emv on a year over year basis that i m seeing here in the third so continued robust demand environment and really most all things non emv what we see the emv dynamic picking it trish gorman barclays analyst and just maybe following up on that with the emv dynamic can you just talk about kind of margins by subsegments because i would think we d see a little bit of a difference there given those dynamics dave naemura senior vice president and chief financial officer yes look we don t get too granular on the margin impacts here but emv is clearly above fleet average margin for i would say for vontier all up and definitely for gvr as well and so as we work through that that s a lot of the profitable growth initiatives that we see but also matco hoped a lot because matco s a really strong margin business for us that we get some benefit from operator there are no further questions at this time i will turn the program back over to mark mark morelli president and chief executive officer yes thank you emma look i want to take this opportunity to thank the supply chain team for their outstanding work and for the entire vontier team for embracing our core values for more than a year now and particularly the driven of core value because i believe that s been important establishing vontier as a company that achieves results thanks for joining us

iconic poet roger mcgough with the framed trousers poet roger mcgough presenter of bbc radio 4 programme poetry please says the most valuable gift he ever received was a pair of paul mccartney s old trousers the 83 year old says he was given them by mccartney s brother mike when they were part of pop group the scaffold he has now written a poem about the trousers and turned them into a work of art on canvas his latest book safety in numbers a collection of funny and moving poems about lockdown will be published on thursday he is married to hilary clough a scientist and lives in barnes south west london what did your parents teach you about money not a lot i probably inherited a fear and mistrust of it from them they never had any money my dad worked on the docks in liverpool eventually becoming a foreman he worked hard and died young in his 50s like so many men of his generation my mother worked in a sausage factory and at a laundry we never owned a house or went on holiday we couldn t afford it more than anything my parents taught me about the value of education my mother in particular who was extremely bright saw education as key and made sure i went to a decent school on a scholarship i then went to university on a grant have you ever struggled to make ends meet no after university i became a teacher and started writing poetry in my spare time i made friends with other poets such as adrian henri and brian patten and started doing poetry readings around liverpool then i met john gorman and mike mccartney paul s brother and we formed the scaffold we used to do comedy the next thing we knew we received an offer to go on television and do a weekly comedy show then we started writing songs and had hits called thank you very much and lily the pink which got to number one in the charts so i only spent four years as a teacher and then i quit at the time it was a risk as i didn t know what would happen but since i packed in teaching i ve never earned a monthly wage and i wouldn t say i have ever struggled financially did you make a lot of money as a pop star no but i did have a lot of fun jimi hendrix played on our albums tim rice produced our records and we recorded at richard branson s manor house in oxfordshire suddenly from being a part time poet and teacher i was faffing around living what seemed to be the high life it was great we went touring around the country and i made enough money to put down a deposit to buy a nice house in liverpool but in that industry the money you get just sort of disappears so many people take a cut the managers the rights people i wonder where they are now what was the best financial year of your life i am not sure exactly but it would have been in the 1970s when i stopped singing and dancing and got back to just writing poetry which is what i really wanted to do by then the mersey sound had been published an anthology of poems i wrote with brian and adrian which has sold more than a million copies i had the freedom to say no to gigs if i wanted to and i could make money doing what i loved doing which was writing and that s what i have done ever since what is the most valuable thing you ve been given paul mccartney s old stage clothes in the early days of the scaffold i didn t have many cool clothes because i d been living on teachers wages so mike gave me his brother s old stage clothes two pairs of trousers a shirt and a suit which paul didn t need and had given to him about four years ago i found the trousers and the shirt in my attic sadly the moths had gotten to the trousers all around the crotch so i decided to make them into framed works of art i had the trousers put on a canvas and i wrote a poem called macca s trousers now it is hanging in a local museum i should think one day if i ever get really hard up i could sell them with paul s permission of course there must be someone out there who would buy an old pair of macca s trousers in good company roger mcgough with paul mccartney in 1974 what is your biggest money mistake the american company that was making the iconic animated film of yellow submarine invited me to rewrite the dialogue to make it more liverpool initially all the characters sounded like woody allen talking to steve martin i agreed to do it for a minimal fee i didn t even get a credit that was a mistake it could have led to other opportunities the best money decision you have made buying my home in barnes south west london it s a big four bedroom house in a nice quiet neighbourhood and we ve been here for 30 years i think i paid 300 000 for it it s definitely gone up in value barnes has become quite a trendy and expensive place to live but mainly it s my best money decision because it s important to me to own my own home my mum and dad never did do you save into a pension no i wasn t really thinking about my retirement when i was young i focused on paying off my mortgage if i had stayed in teaching i d have got a good pension instead i get a minimal payment of 100 a week plus my state pension my books and writings are my pension i earn money from royalties and new books i write do you invest directly in the stock market no i ve never wanted to i don t know why exactly i ve just never been interested i m quite cautious with my money if you were chancellor what is the first thing you d do i would offer more funding to libraries and give a tax break to independent bookshops that are struggling on the high street i think that would level the playing field as they try to compete with amazon and the supermarkets i

the dow took its time to get to 36 000 but last week it got there at last and there is a message there for anyone wondering how the current concerns about the environment might change investment over the coming decades step back a moment dow 36 000 the new strategy for profiting from the coming rise in the stock market was the title of a best selling 1999 book by james k glassman and kevin hassett they predicted the dow jones industrial average index of large us companies would reach that level in the next three to five years when they wrote that year the dow was pushing towards 19 000 having more than doubled in the previous five years so the idea that it might double again did not seem too outrageous but it was completely wrong and the authors have had to live with their bosh prediction ever since green shoots environmental concerns are coming to the fore that is not to jeer anyone who writes about financial markets is going to get things wrong i will own up to some pretty bad calls myself rather it is to point out that the dow is not really a true reflection of the direction of the american economy just as the ftse100 index is not one of the uk the footsie by the way has had a very poor couple of decades for it ended 1999 at 6 930 where it was in september before the recent uplift the dow represents solid america with just 30 giant companies those members change as enterprises rise and fall but while it does have both apple and microsoft in there it does not have amazon facebook or google and it certainly does not have upstarts like elon musk s tesla instead there are boeing johnson johnson jpmorgan chase merck mcdonald s walmart and so on it is the american business aristocracy not the noisy disrupters go back 20 years and most of those disrupters either did not exist or were in their infancy amazon was founded in 1995 google 1998 tesla 2003 and facebook 2004 investors were mesmerised by the dotcom boom for it was that which was driving share prices to their peak at the end of 1999 and early 2000 we all knew that communications technology was changing the world economy but it was almost impossible to see quite who would benefit and who not now look at how environmental concerns might change things mark carney former governor of the bank of england and co chair with michael bloomberg of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero has assembled a package of measures with the headline total of 130trillion that is a mind bogglingly huge number roughly the same size as the value of global equities all the companies quoted on stock exchanges around the world and much bigger than annual global gdp of some 95trillion when you try to work out what is actually new funding where the money is supposed to come from and when it all becomes rather cloudy so i think it is more helpful to focus on mark carney s message in an interview on bloomberg tv he said that there s no reason to expect that investors who follow low carbon strategies should have to make do with lower returns than they would if they invested in regular industries you see what he is saying it is that you will make as much money by putting your cash into companies and industries that aim to be carbon neutral as you will in those that either can t or don t try to reach that goal of net zero none of us can know whether that will be proved right or wrong any more than anyone could say in 1999 how the prediction about the dow would look in ten or 20 years time but i think the lessons from that dow 36 000 book are very relevant now here are three one is that the companies that prosper will be those that adapt to social and economic change for example retailers that realised they needed online strategies could mount a better defence against amazon than those that didn t a second is that solid successful enterprises such as apple and microsoft can still be leaders in 20 years time third it simply is not possible to envisage where the opportunities from the shift to net zero will arise many of the facebooks and teslas of tomorrow that will drive that movement do not now exist the task is to spot them and back them when they are still in their infancy that is easier said than done but at least it is clear where the challenge lies
discussions need to begin if they have not already with the us side to work out what will be needed by india from the us to ensure that the pla is defeated in its continuing assault on territory that belongs to india new delhi ccp general secretary xi jinping has sought to neutralise his foes of yesterday the present and even future foes i e those likely to turn against him when the economic situation in china worsens this is similar to the approach adopted by chairman mao especially during the cultural revolution but different from that of his immediate predecessors former general secretaries jiang zemin and hu jintao with rare exceptions both adopted a lenient attitude towards those who opposed the line they adopted inside party fora both abided by the deng xiaoping principle of stepping down after two 5 year terms in the prc s most powerful job deng himself set an example by stepping down from state responsibilities during the close of his career although retaining his influence over his former subordinates to the end even earlier in his career accelerating during the period when hu jintao was general secretary xi had used the anti corruption campaign to pick off those who were uneasy or worse towards his taking over the party after hu since 2015 once he settled into office after taking charge in 2012 xi systematically eliminated loyalists of both jiang zemin as well as hu jintao from key responsibilities including in the military in fact especially in the military which has seen a personnel churn in its ranks not experienced since the 1960s unlike his immediate predecessor hu frequent visits are made by xi to his offices in the central military commission in beijing where he delights in talking to his generals and absorbing their world view which not surprisingly is devoid of any thought of compromise on what the prc regards as its wish list concerning territory and primacy both the anti corruption campaign and the pla play the keystone role in the image building exercises carried out for the ccp supremo and while the first has been useful in cleansing the ccp leadership at central and provincial level of jiang and hu loyalists or those who are less than fulsome in their appreciation and admiration for xi the pla has emerged as the tip of the spear where much of beijing s external relations are concerned especially with its neighbours but extending into other locations as well the foreign policy of china has come to resemble the talk inside a military officers dining room showing a lack of compromise and the promotion of maximalist goals both attitudes favoured by the military the ambience sought to be created is that of constant struggle against a global coalition that is held to be seeking to slow down or entirely sabotage the rise of the prc to global primacy overshadowing the us and overawing its allies and partners there has been an ostentatious testing of hypersonic rockets and the construction of hundreds of silos built to accommodate nuclear tipped missiles they would be a waste for just conventional missiles that have a much more limited capacity for destruction and which anyway have multiple other options to get launched the effort is to a frighten into greater compliance target countries such as taiwan or india and b deter the us and the rest of nato from coming to their assistance should the pla launch a kinetic attack on either cmc threats against taiwan although there are influential voices within taiwan especially in the kmt or in china centred business interests that claim that there is no possibility of the prc going to war against taiwan the administration headed by president tsai ing wen has taken the threats emanating from beijing seriously and so have both tokyo as well as washington present day taiwan s closest allies while the focus has been on big ticket items such as fighter aircraft supplied by the us even more effective may be a cluster of smaller less expensive defensive systems these include sea and land mines multiple drones including the mq 9 and stocks of precision munitions sufficient to inflict substantial casualties on an invasion force president biden has not as the china lobby in the us anticipated would happen walked away from the trump policy of increasing military support to taiwan a massive artillery supply program has been notified in august 2021 to the us congress by the white house a sign of its intent to ensure that taiwan is well protected even where its domestic capability is concerned the biden team messed up in afghanistan by going ahead with the disastrous trump playbook of jettisoning the afghan government and military and handing over the country to the taliban in the manner that president clinton did in 1996 on taiwan fortunately its record has been more assertive and is clearly being driven by far the largest bureaucracy in washington the department of defense dod personnel choices such as laura rosenberg and ely rattner indicate that in some matters at least the biden presidency will not be a repeat of the obama years the loss of taiwan to the prc would be a catastrophe for not just the us but every country intent on ensuring an inclusive free and open indo pacific in the language of prime minister narendra modi another disaster for the us and its allies and partners would be the falling into ccp hands of much of the taiwan semiconductor industry as well as the island s other tech capabilities given the steady development of cyber and kinetic defensive capabilities under president tsai more likely than an all out assault is likely to be a series of actions that in the estimation of the cmc will fall below the threshold that would invite us japan intervention such steps could be a temporary air and sea blockade of taiwan or the seizure of the small islands that are part of taiwan or both in tandem the effort will be to break the will of the taiwanese government to resist an increasing transfer of authority from taipei to beijing given that the ccp leadership now that different and dissenting voices have been almost totally eliminated from the councils of the general secretary appears to be functioning in an alternate reality mode such a course of action humiliating taiwan and at the same time scare away the white house from effective intervention may seem attractive enough for beijing to attempt what the pla leadership in its media hyped triumphalism neglects to factor is the reality of escalation dominance that is still possessed by the us and japan and indeed by india and australia in the waters of the indo pacific given that lack of us action in the advent of an effort by the pla to humiliate taipei would completely cripple expectations of us capabilities in defending its allies and partners in the manner that the afghanistan handover to the taliban is having in much of the muslim majority world it is almost a qualification that takes note of the essential pacifism of a us commander in chief who was even opposed as vice president to taking out osama bin laden in 2011 a given that the us will give a robust riposte to even such a sub critical move by the pla against taiwanese sovereignty this would include steps in the economic sphere joined by the european union such a move would be an economic disaster for the prc and ultimately to xi s leadership at the least he would be forced to name a successor and function as a lame duck until he steps down despite such risks a series of actions short of an invasion of the taiwanese mainland is likely given that the ccp leadership may calculate that a prolonged economic war would hurt the us and the eu as much as it would china and would therefore not be attempted in the very short run this may be right but the spurt in decoupling of foreign companies from china that would follow such adventurism over a us partner in the east china sea would ensure that in brief years it is the prc that will pay the price cmc tactics against india in the case of india the cmc tactics are clearly designed to systematically attempt to encroach on indian land and thereafter refuse to return save for a few places where maintaining a prolonged troop presence is untenable the pla is building structures at speed along the line of actual control lac so as to be in a position to grab additional territory on the indian side whenever possible the belief in the cmc is that once the pla s presence is established in multiple parts of the lac now in indian hands it would be very difficult for india to regain the lost land those in the lutyens zone who believe that talks and efforts at conciliation on india s side can succeed in persuading general secretary xi to withdraw and stop further encroachment of land are themselves living in an alternate reality given the hard knocks that such a view has received especially since mid 2020 it is a surprise that there is still belief in such a track among some policymakers the modi government must avoid the slow bleed that a reactive strategy entails only a non proportional kinetic response by india to such a systematic effort at land grab by the pla at different locations along the lac where india has the military advantage would succeed in deterring the pla from continuing further with its adventurism and force it to withdraw to the long lines of communication on the chinese side and lesser air force capability must be added the lack of acclimatisation of chinese troops to the harsh weather along the himalayas and their near zero exposure in the past to actual combat however even with such advantages on the indian side it would be essential to ensure a steady supply of smart weapons as well as boosting supply of artillery and other battlefield items aukus needs to be aukus plus india and japan intelligence from quad partners especially the us about chinese capabilities and plans as well as data on targets and other assistance would be desirable in order to ensure that the indian army holds out until a knockout blow is delivered on the pla rather than stop before this is done air and naval support would be essential including the denial of sea lanes in the indo pacific to prc vessels until a cease fire becomes tenable to the indian side air to air sea to air and land to air missiles combined with precision munitions together with information exchange will be needed from the us given this it is a safe bet that thus reinforced the indian military will prevail over the pla an outcome that would result in a severe weakening of the position of general secretary xi jinping within the ccp even if he has sought to eliminate all the opposition that he identified as such relying heavily on the s 400 for theatre wide air defences would be risky given the exceptional closeness and information sharing of the russian federation with the peoples republic of china in the military and intelligence sphere the us may ensure that india dodge the caatsa bullet over s 400 sanctions that were gleefully seen as certain by the sino russian alliance but this will not stop the pla from attempting a land grab sufficient in the estimation of xi to give him enough oxygen to overcome the hostility of presently silent but sullen jiang and hu factions within the party such unrest would be added to the growing dissatisfaction among chinese citizens at the worsening economy and captains of both state owned and private business in the prc are already uneasy over the manner in which their freedom of action and in many cases a substantial chunk of their wealth has been eroded by general secretary xi they have been cut to size in the general secretary s drive towards coordinating different segments of the prc in furtherance of his plan to achieve primacy over the us and along the way inflict a humiliating defeat on india in the manner of 1962 action needed from quad keeping the military perpetually mobilised in force on the lac in efforts to prevent further pla encroachment is an option that will result in a multiplication of costs for india both human and financial discussions need to begin if they have not already with the us side to work out what will be needed by india from the us to ensure that the pla get defeated in their continuing assault on territory that belongs to india rather than reacting all the time to pla moves it may be preferable to prepare and when needed carry out a sudden sharp kinetic escalation on the border that would show to the chinese side that their plan of land grab through a thousand intrusions will not work and that the patience of india with such tactics is almost exhausted discussions and more importantly action is needed from the other quad members to prepare for the event of pla aggression against india the credibility of the us not to mention nato is tied up with the success of taiwan and india reversing 1962 along the himalayas the geopolitical fallout in china will be as substantial in the other direction as a victory by india for us credibility something that has been in decline for some time more and more analysts are claiming that the decline of the us vis a vis china is terminal and irreversible these are the conclusions that are being sought to be created by xi jinping and those implementing his all out drive for dominance prime minister modi can ensure that the indian military show such an assessment by the prc to be wrong this would be certain were the world s most populous democracy ensured support from the us in the manner that would end the conflict in a manner as would humiliate those in the ccp leadership who have fashioned a policy based on achieving supremacy no matter what the tactics used a kinetic victory over the pla by the indian military would be the most effective means of checkmating such ambitions for a long time to come and give india the breathing space needed to emerge closer to its full potential

as recently as late october it seemed like novavax nasdaq nvax was becoming an also ran in the vaccine horse race for weeks investors were bailing out of nvax stock on news of merck s nyse mrk antiviral covid 19 pill plus reports of nvax facing production headwinds nvax stock source ascannio shutterstock com but now as positive news is starting to come out it may have been premature to say nvax stock was falling out of the running obtaining emergency use authorization eua in indonesia may signal that the bull case for novavax remains on the table that is while it may not generate massive sales in the u s market sales of its nvx cov2373 vaccine candidate overseas will enable it to hit earnings projections for 2022 investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips yes it s not a lock that novavax gets approval from health authorities in major markets plus an eul emergency use listing from the who world health organization yet with the indonesian eua and its solid demonstrated efficacy its chance of racking up more approvals seems likely what type of upside may be in store for shares as the positive developments continue to come in if the market decides its on track to hit consensus for 2022 earnings and even if it assigns a modest multiple to said earnings a move to at least 300 per share may be in the cards nvax stock the comeback kid of vaccine stocks with johnson johnson nyse jnj moderna nasdaq mrna and pfizer nyse pfe already raking in billions from the rollouts of their respective vaccines it s been easy to write off novavax as a lost cause after all all three had a first mover advantage they ve all but locked up the u s covid 19 vaccine market even success in the international market has looked uncertain the three names mentioned above locking down share in overseas markets as well however with novavax s recent eua in indonesia and the possibly forthcoming authorizations from the u k india indonesia and the who it may be more appropriate to call nvax stock the comeback kid of vaccine plays getting authorizations in the nick of time it may just well be able to sell into still strong demand in markets across the globe story continues not only that it may still have a shot of finding success in the united states as well novavax is expected to file for u s authorization by year s end so it may be able to start rolling out its candidate domestically next year admittedly it s probably not going to have as much success in america as the existing crop but between its possible appeal to the vaccine hesitant as it s a traditional vaccine not an mrna vaccine and the potential for it to become a popular booster if mix and match becomes widespread i wouldn t write off its prospects the path back above 300 per share with growing evidence that its recent rebound will continue how much further could nvax stock climb from here like i hinted above a move back above 300 per share looks more than attainable how so assuming the authorizations keep coming in the chances novavax hits analyst earnings projections for next year climb higher based on sell side estimates the company could earn between 12 62 and 46 33 per share in 2022 with the average estimate coming in at 32 3 per share if hitting this average looks more likely getting back to over 300 per share will be a cinch sure covid 19 vaccine sales have questionable runway that s why the market has assigned modest multiples to vaccine pure plays like moderna but assign mrna stock s 11 5x price to earnings p e multiple to the novavax earnings projections and what do you get a share price of around 371 per share that s more than 93 above the 192 per share it trades for today that s not all if it finds big success with its covid 19 vaccine nvax stock may be able to sustain and grow a more than 300 per share stock price plowing the profits from nvx cov2373 into the development of the rest of its pipeline including nanoflu the company which in years past has generated only minimal revenue stands to become a large consistently profitable business the bottom line on novavax having touted its big potential above i will concede novavax isn t exactly out of the woods with its recent issues continued manufacturing headwinds could get in the way of the worldwide rollout of its vaccine authorization delays could also arise this may cause investors to get skittish about it again sending it tanking once more still likely to see high volatility if you can t handle the wild swings you may want to look elsewhere but if you re looking for a vaccine play where the upside potential is crystal clear nvax remains your best choice on the date of publication thomas niel did not have either directly or indirectly any positions in the

stocks soar to new all time highs the worries that caused the major stock indices to slump 6 in september have been forgotten bullish sentiment has returned big time and the indices have surged to all time highs with the djia and the s p rising for the past five consecutive weeks since early october the djia is up 8 the s p 10 the russell 12 and the naz100 14 global central banks ex european starting to tighten short term interest rates are firming but bond yields are falling which results in real after inflation long rates becoming more deeply negative while the yield curve flattens the us dollar index touches a 14 month high inter day price action on the usdx has been choppy the past three weeks up one day down the next but it rallied to a 14 month high friday following the stronger than expected us employment report but couldn t sustain the gains the usdx has rallied 6 after touching a 3 year low in january this year the yen has been the weakest primary currency against the usd down 10 since early january the euro has fallen 5 5 against the swiss franc over the past eight months and is near a 6 year low weakness in the euro swiss spread is often a sign of bearish eurozone political sentiment thanks to a vibrant commodity especially crude oil market the canadian dollar is one of the few actively traded world currencies that has risen vs the usd this year the cad popped higher last week when the boc was a little more hawkish than expected but drifted lower recently as commodities have weakened and the usd has been strong gold bounced 60 from mid week lows to a 2 month high gold has been out of favour relative to stocks and crypto since it had that spectacular 800 rally to new all time highs from 2018 to july 2020 i ve frequently discussed how gold etf capital flows are an excellent barometer of gold market sentiment in 2019 and 2020 the global gold etf market took 1 100 tonnes of gold but the market turned sellers late in 2020 and so far this year the etf market has sold 280 tonnes a breakout above 1840 could bring new attention to the gold market especially if some currently popular markets fall out of favour i ve traded gold for nearly 50 years and highly recommend the gold monitor written by my good friend dr martin murenbeeld as an excellent source of fundamental analysis i ve read his letter every week for thirty years i d also recommend crescat capital for readers interested in gold they have some nifty charts in their slide presentation decks wti crude oil touched a 7 year high last week but fell 8 to this week s lows wti crude oil surged 35 from mid august to october on perceptions of short term and longer term supply demand deficits the spike in european natgas to all time highs may have been the poster child for such concerns my short term trading in keeping with the on my radar section of last week s notes i started this week flat but looking for opportunities to sell irrational exuberance in stocks and commodities the s p closed last week at ath and gapped higher in the sunday october 31 overnight session those overnight levels didn t hold when the monday floor session started so i shorted the s p with a tight stop the trade held up throughout the monday day and overnight sessions but i was stopped for a tiny loss as the tuesday floor session began our new 2 month old puppy arrived tuesday night and single handedly sidelined me for the next couple of days no sleep i missed getting short crude oil blame the puppy but the wild price swings would probably have stopped me out with a loss thank god for the puppy i re shorted the s p on friday about a dozen ticks below ath after it lurched higher following the employment report but then rolled over and dropped through the floor session opening range i remain short with a stop just below ath i bought the yen on friday in anticipation of it breaking out of the sideways range it has been in for the past three weeks as noted above the yen has been weak against the usd all year and as a result speculators in the currency futures market have built a massive net short position in the yen they might turn buyers if the yen was to rally if something happened and market psychology was to turn risk off the yen would probably catch a haven bid my realized p l was down tiny for the week my unrealized p l is up 0 25 on my radar i ve lived through many wild market swings since i began trading fifty years ago i remember being a speaker at a significant financial conference in toronto when the dow jones tumbled 25 on october 19 1987 there were 1 000 financial professionals at that conference and everybody was in shock i cancelled a trip to chicago and flew straight home worried that the world as i knew it would never be the same again these days that crash in 1987 barely registers as a blip on the long term chart i mostly write about my short term trading i think of it as my day job but i also pay attention to long term trends see the quotes from the notebook section below from that perspective i m worried about the bizarre valuations we see in many markets particularly equities i know ultra low interest rates justify high equity prices i know central banks have flooded the world with liquidity and share prices must rise as the purchasing power of currencies is degraded i know there is no alternative i know my old school metrics are useless for understanding today s valuations and rate of change please forgive me i m not trying to lecture anybody but i m saying that we ve seen this movie before i remember people buying penny mining stocks on the vancouver stock exchange fifty years ago because somebody told them that xyz was going up the companies had no tangible assets and were flying on a wing and a prayer but as my long time friend bob hoye loves to say people will believe the most preposterous stories as long as the price keeps going up i m not saying that the stock market will crash tomorrow i honestly would not be surprised to see it go higher but i think it has been going up because people believe and have been told that it will keep going up those people are putting money into the stock market like never before the major indices fell 6 in september the most prominent tumble we ve seen since september 2020 and then came roaring back the last five weeks to make new all time highs the buy the dip crowd is in an i told you so frame of mind and who can blame them you only need to look at the seasonal trends chart to see the roadmap to higher prices if markets reverse the trend of the last five weeks and take out the september lows i know that seems impossible but it was only five weeks ago that would be the first time we ve seen an interim low broken since the covid crash in march 2020 i think such a break would rattle the market and perhaps trigger some severe selling thoughts on trading why i read so much research listen to podcasts watch videos in the gold section above i mentioned that i ve read martin murenbeeld s weekly gold monitor for 30 years martin doesn t offer a buy this sell that service and that s not what i m looking for when i read his letter i think letters that offer buy this sell that advice are often marketing letters not research letters when i read a research piece i want to be open to new ways of seeing things especially if the ideas in the piece challenge some of the ideas i currently believe to be true for instance i got the idea that the gold etf market was probably an excellent psychological barometer of the overall gold market while reading martin s letters the next step was if that s the case where s the trade another example i recently watched a video prepared by goehring and rozencwajg the most important 2000 years of energy history that challenged conventional wisdom concerning the importance of solar and wind generated power as the world tries to transition away from fossil fuels as i read their research i was thinking if their ideas are correct then a ton of capital is mal invested in the energy markets where s the trade quotes from the notebook what were you thinking scott mcnealy founder and ceo of sun microsystems from an address to an investor gathering in 2002 in 2000 shares of sun microsystems had been trading at 64 which was ten times the firm s annual revenue sun microsystems was one of the hot stocks during the dot com boom at ten times revenues to give you a 10 year payback i have to pay you 100 of revenues for ten straight years in dividends that assumes i can get that by my shareholders that assumes i have zero costs of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company that assumes zero expenses which is really hard with 39 000 employees that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal and that assumes with zero r d for the next 10 years i can maintain the current run rate now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at 64 do you realise how ridiculous those basic assumptions are you don t need any transparency you don t need any footnotes what were you thinking my comment scott mcnealy s speech has become famous within the value investing community what indeed were people thinking when they paid 64 a share 10x sun s annual revenue per share the value investing community would argue that people weren t thinking when they did that they were buying something because they believed or had been told that the share price was going to keep going higher tesla may be the modern day version of sun microsystems if we assume annual revenues are 40 per share then with the stock trading at 1 200 per share the market is pricing tesla at 30x revenue can you imagine elon musk two years from now asking what were you thinking people will believe the most preposterous stories so long as the price keeps going up bob hoye many years ago my comment nobody ever said it better thank you bob this is barney he s a 2 month old

hamish mcrae investors will make as much from companies aiming to be carbon neutral as from those that can t or won t the dow took its time to get to 36 000 but last week it got there at last and there is a message there for anyone wondering how the current concerns about the environment might change investment over the coming decades step back a moment dow 36 000 the new strategy for profiting from the coming rise in the stock market was the title of a best selling 1999 book by james k glassman and kevin hassett they predicted the dow jones industrial average index of large us companies would reach that level in the next three to five years when they wrote that year the dow was pushing towards 19 000 having more than doubled in the previous five years so the idea that it might double again did not seem too outrageous but it was completely wrong and the authors have had to live with their bosh prediction ever since green shoots environmental concerns are coming to the fore that is not to jeer anyone who writes about financial markets is going to get things wrong i will own up to some pretty bad calls myself rather it is to point out that the dow is not really a true reflection of the direction of the american economy just as the ftse100 index is not one of the uk the footsie by the way has had a very poor couple of decades for it ended 1999 at 6 930 where it was in september before the recent uplift the dow represents solid america with just 30 giant companies those members change as enterprises rise and fall but while it does have both apple and microsoft in there it does not have amazon facebook or google and it certainly does not have upstarts like elon musk s tesla instead there are boeing johnson johnson jpmorgan chase merck mcdonald s walmart and so on it is the american business aristocracy not the noisy disrupters go back 20 years and most of those disrupters either did not exist or were in their infancy amazon was founded in 1995 google 1998 tesla 2003 and facebook 2004 investors were mesmerised by the dotcom boom for it was that which was driving share prices to their peak at the end of 1999 and early 2000 we all knew that communications technology was changing the world economy but it was almost impossible to see quite who would benefit and who not now look at how environmental concerns might change things mark carney former governor of the bank of england and co chair with michael bloomberg of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero has assembled a package of measures with the headline total of 130trillion that is a mind bogglingly huge number roughly the same size as the value of global equities all the companies quoted on stock exchanges around the world and much bigger than annual global gdp of some 95trillion when you try to work out what is actually new funding where the money is supposed to come from and when it all becomes rather cloudy so i think it is more helpful to focus on mark carney s message in an interview on bloomberg tv he said that there s no reason to expect that investors who follow low carbon strategies should have to make do with lower returns than they would if they invested in regular industries you see what he is saying it is that you will make as much money by putting your cash into companies and industries that aim to be carbon neutral as you will in those that either can t or don t try to reach that goal of net zero none of us can know whether that will be proved right or wrong any more than anyone could say in 1999 how the prediction about the dow would look in ten or 20 years time but i think the lessons from that dow 36 000 book are very relevant now here are three one is that the companies that prosper will be those that adapt to social and economic change for example retailers that realised they needed online strategies could mount a better defence against amazon than those that didn t a second is that solid successful enterprises such as apple and microsoft can still be leaders in 20 years time third it simply is not possible to envisage where the opportunities from the shift to net zero will arise many of the facebooks and teslas of tomorrow that will drive that movement do not now exist the task is to spot them and back them when they are still in their infancy that is easier said than done but at least it is clear where the challenge lies

iconic poet roger mcgough with the framed trousers poet roger mcgough presenter of bbc radio 4 programme poetry please says the most valuable gift he ever received was a pair of paul mccartney s old trousers the 83 year old says he was given them by mccartney s brother mike when they were part of pop group the scaffold he has now written a poem about the trousers and turned them into a work of art on canvas his latest book safety in numbers a collection of funny and moving poems about lockdown will be published on thursday he is married to hilary clough a scientist and lives in barnes south west london what did your parents teach you about money not a lot i probably inherited a fear and mistrust of it from them they never had any money my dad worked on the docks in liverpool eventually becoming a foreman he worked hard and died young in his 50s like so many men of his generation my mother worked in a sausage factory and at a laundry we never owned a house or went on holiday we couldn t afford it more than anything my parents taught me about the value of education my mother in particular who was extremely bright saw education as key and made sure i went to a decent school on a scholarship i then went to university on a grant have you ever struggled to make ends meet no after university i became a teacher and started writing poetry in my spare time i made friends with other poets such as adrian henri and brian patten and started doing poetry readings around liverpool then i met john gorman and mike mccartney paul s brother and we formed the scaffold we used to do comedy the next thing we knew we received an offer to go on television and do a weekly comedy show then we started writing songs and had hits called thank you very much and lily the pink which got to number one in the charts so i only spent four years as a teacher and then i quit at the time it was a risk as i didn t know what would happen but since i packed in teaching i ve never earned a monthly wage and i wouldn t say i have ever struggled financially did you make a lot of money as a pop star no but i did have a lot of fun jimi hendrix played on our albums tim rice produced our records and we recorded at richard branson s manor house in oxfordshire suddenly from being a part time poet and teacher i was faffing around living what seemed to be the high life it was great we went touring around the country and i made enough money to put down a deposit to buy a nice house in liverpool but in that industry the money you get just sort of disappears so many people take a cut the managers the rights people i wonder where they are now what was the best financial year of your life i am not sure exactly but it would have been in the 1970s when i stopped singing and dancing and got back to just writing poetry which is what i really wanted to do by then the mersey sound had been published an anthology of poems i wrote with brian and adrian which has sold more than a million copies i had the freedom to say no to gigs if i wanted to and i could make money doing what i loved doing which was writing and that s what i have done ever since what is the most valuable thing you ve been given paul mccartney s old stage clothes in the early days of the scaffold i didn t have many cool clothes because i d been living on teachers wages so mike gave me his brother s old stage clothes two pairs of trousers a shirt and a suit which paul didn t need and had given to him about four years ago i found the trousers and the shirt in my attic sadly the moths had gotten to the trousers all around the crotch so i decided to make them into framed works of art i had the trousers put on a canvas and i wrote a poem called macca s trousers now it is hanging in a local museum i should think one day if i ever get really hard up i could sell them with paul s permission of course there must be someone out there who would buy an old pair of macca s trousers in good company roger mcgough with paul mccartney in 1974 what is your biggest money mistake the american company that was making the iconic animated film of yellow submarine invited me to rewrite the dialogue to make it more liverpool initially all the characters sounded like woody allen talking to steve martin i agreed to do it for a minimal fee i didn t even get a credit that was a mistake it could have led to other opportunities the best money decision you have made buying my home in barnes south west london it s a big four bedroom house in a nice quiet neighbourhood and we ve been here for 30 years i think i paid 300 000 for it it s definitely gone up in value barnes has become quite a trendy and expensive place to live but mainly it s my best money decision because it s important to me to own my own home my mum and dad never did do you save into a pension no i wasn t really thinking about my retirement when i was young i focused on paying off my mortgage if i had stayed in teaching i d have got a good pension instead i get a minimal payment of 100 a week plus my state pension my books and writings are my pension i earn money from royalties and new books i write do you invest directly in the stock market no i ve never wanted to i don t know why exactly i ve just never been interested i m quite cautious with my money if you were chancellor what is the first thing you d do i would offer more funding to libraries and give a tax break to independent bookshops that are struggling on the high street i think that would level the playing field as they try to compete with amazon and the supermarkets i would also be in favour of a pandemic support fund for struggling writers and authors what is your number one financial priority my family i want to make sure my four kids and three grandchildren are all right and can get on the housing ladder
the era of anti covid pills begins merck s molnupiravir works by decreasing the ability of a virus to replicate thereby slowing down the disease paris what if a simple pill could help heal from covid 19 us pharma giants merck and pfizer have announced encouraging results for oral drugs while an anti depressant has also shown promise in what could open up a new chapter in the fight against the pandemic what are these treatments they are pills taken orally as soon as the first symptoms of covid 19 appear to avoid serious forms of the illness and therefore hospitalisation this form of treatment has been sought since the start of the global health crisis after months of research merck and pfizer say they have reached that elusive goal early october merck said it was seeking authorisation in the united states for its pill molnupiravir and pfizer followed suit on friday with paxlovid they are both anti virals that act by reducing the virus s ability to replicate slowing down the disease both companies say clinical trials showed a strong reduction in the risk of hospitalisation those who took molnupiravir saw that risk diminish by 50 percent and those who took paxlovid by nearly 90 percent although direct comparisons of these efficacy rates should be avoided because of the different study protocols an anti depressant which is already available to the public fluvoxamine has also shown encouraging results in preventing serious forms of covid 19 according to a study published in october by brazilian researchers in the lancet global health journal why are they important if the efficacy of these drugs is confirmed it will be a major step forward in the fight against covid 19 they would add to vaccines to bolster the world s therapeutic arsenal against the virus treatments already exist mostly in the form of synthetic antibodies but these drugs which usually target those who already have severe forms of the disease are injected and therefore more difficult to administer a pill can be quickly prescribed to a patient who will then take it easily at home merck and pfizer s treatments which so far have not shown many side effects would entail taking around 10 doses over five days the success of these antivirals potentially marks a new era in our ability to prevent the severe consequences of sars cov2 infection british virologist stephen griffin told the science media center what limitations it is difficult so far to properly evaluate merck and pfizer s treatments given both groups have only published statements and have not made the data of their clinical trials available french infectious diseases specialist karine lacombe warned in september that these types of announcements should be treated with caution until the studies can be scrutinised she pointed out that these treatments represent a potentially enormous market for pharmaceutical groups nevertheless some elements indicate that merck and pfizer are not making empty promises for one they both stopped their clinical trials earlier than expected as the results were so strong with the okay of independent monitoring committees where fluvoxamine is concerned the data is available but is not without criticism several researchers have complained that the authors did not just limit themselves to evaluating the frequency of hospitalisations but also assessed the frequency of prolonged emergency room stays this they say complicated the interpretation of data when and how much merck s molnupiravir has already been approved in the united kingdom where health authorities on thursday gave their green light to its use in patients at risk of developing a serious form of the illness such as the elderly obese people or those suffering from diabetes us and eu health authorities are also urgently reviewing the drug the european medicines agency promised on thursday to accelerate proceedings without giving a firm date several countries have already ordered stocks of molnupiravir such as the united states with 1 7 million courses of the drug the us order gives an idea of the steep price of the drug it comes to 1 2 billion which equates to around 700 for a five day course as for pfizer while it has not outlined a price for paxlovid it has promised it will be affordable and subject to a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of countries

i n the 1940s joseph biden senior fell from early wealth to near destitution he moved his young family in with his in laws as he scrabbled for work in scranton pennsylvania before re establishing middle class ease as a used car salesman in delaware for all the weight that his son president joe biden places on the wellbeing of the middle class he also cares deeply about the opportunity to join it or rejoin it and to rise through its ranks listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the president s personal story chimes with something his country sorely needs increased social mobility addressing the essence of his build back better series of bills originally pitched as a 4trn package over ten years but now being haggled over in congress at half that level of spending mr biden has said it lies in providing people a fair chance to build a decent middle class life to succeed and thrive instead of just hanging on by their fingernails if his administration has a signal achievement to date it is the expanded child tax credits in the american rescue plan arp the stimulus package which was passed in march they appear to have reduced child poverty by more than 25 since they went into effect in july the president s camp sees helping the disadvantaged as a way to boost the economy as a whole janet yellen the treasury secretary argued that the plans would support families and enable greater inclusion in the workforce and social mobility helping the disadvantaged and boosting economic growth cecilia rouse the chair of the president s council of economic advisors put it plainly in an interview with the economist most would agree that our current rates of social mobility are too low there is not equality of opportunity kids are not starting at the same place data show that to be inarguable america the avowed land of opportunity now appears a harder place in which to make it than canada or western europe and this is a fundamental flaw in its economy and society ameliorating this through public spending is possible if exceedingly difficult and for mr biden the opportunity to do so is coming to an end the idea that social and economic status should be conferred according to effort rather than hereditary privilege was long seen as quintessentially american in the 1830s alexis de tocqueville commended the continual movement which agitates a democratic community arguing that it stabilised democracy karl marx remarked that america s potential for class consciousness was sadly limited because though classes indeed already exist they have not yet become fixed but continually change and interchange their elements the country s social and economic mobility was only really accessible to white men african americans and women of all colours would have to endure much longer before the american dream could be theirs too but the dream was still there a runaway american dream today however it is receding what economists call absolute mobility the probability that a child will grow up to earn more than their parents has dropped precipitously in a paper published in 2016 entitled the fading american dream a team of social scientists found that americans born in the 1940s had a 90 chance of earning more than their parents had earned at the age of 30 for those born in the 1980s the chance of that had dropped to 50 see chart 1 that remarkable drop is down to a few long running trends especially the emergence of education as the differentiator between economic precarity and success national statistics show that workers with college degrees now have real wages 86 higher than those of workers without what is more those without a degree have seen little increase in real wages since 1979 many less educated men have dropped out of the labour force in 2016 only one in two less skilled men in rural america worked which was 15 percentage points lower than in metro areas writes james ziliak an economist at the university of kentucky real wages that have not budged and lower work force participation have gone hand in hand with ill health which worsens outcomes further anne case and angus deaton of princeton university recently published research showing that the life expectancy of americans without a bachelor s degree is falling on top of this precipitous decline in absolute mobility there have also been losses in relative mobility a measure comparing children s position in the income distribution with that of their parents consider the chance for a child born to parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution to make it to the top fifth in a society where origins did not matter one would expect the likelihood of such a rags to riches ascent to be close to random chance or 20 in america the chance is just 7 5 comparisons with other countries make this look particularly pernicious the land of opportunity is badly outpaced by european welfare states such as britain france and sweden where the chance is above 11 and also by canada intergenerational disadvantage is especially stark for black americans they have only half as good a chance of escaping from the bottom fifth as poor whites do one in five black americans is from a family which has been mired in the bottom fifth of income distribution for three generations for whites it is just one in a hundred those born rich in america by contrast are much likelier to stay rich than their counterparts in other advanced countries their children see higher incomes too hereditary persistence in incomes is a measure of how much you can predict about two people s incomes based on a comparison of what their fathers earned bhash mazumder an economist at the federal reserve bank of chicago calculates that if an american s father made twice as much as his neighbour s father then he would be expected to make 60 more than his neighbour that is much higher than if they were french 41 german 32 or danish 15 though less than if they were brazilians 70 we gotta get out while we re young because children must grow up and enter the labour market before their relative performance can be assessed findings like these are inevitably backwards looking the most recent data provided by studies of intergenerational mobility come from adults born in the 1980s and entering the labour market in the 2000s few experts though imagine that the trend to lower social mobility will turn out to have reversed for later cohorts at best it may have plateaued it could well have worsened the returns to higher education and conversely the penalties for low education show little sign of declining and highly educated people are likely to be married to each other to raise children in stable marriages to live near excellent schools and to invest a lot in supplementing their children s education miles corak an expert on social mobility argues that rising inequality along these dimensions will most likely lower the degree of intergenerational earnings mobility for the next generation of americans coming of age in a more polarised labour market one way of trying to see whether things are merely bad or getting worse is to look for a leading indicator of social mobility some economists think that this can be provided by inequality levels though the matter is far from settled a chart known as the great gatsby curve see chart 2 shows an empirical link with countries where income inequality is high going on to have low rates of social mobility the same pattern has been observed within america too states with high levels of inequality also have worse mobility outcomes the most innovative recent research on this comes from raj chetty nathaniel hendren patrick kline and emmanuel saez they used data from millions of tax returns to produce a high resolution image of mobility outcomes see map this uncovered wide variation within cities the amount of social mobility can depend on the neighbourhood or even the block where people live but it remained inversely related to inequality other factors such as more stable family structure better schools lower segregation were correlated with higher upward mobility inequality is unsurprisingly particularly persistent among black americans in september the census bureau reported that the typical income for white households in 2020 was 61 higher than for black households a gap which has barely changed since 1967 when the data series began the black white wealth gap is unchanged as well at a ratio of one to ten if the relationship between inequality and social mobility is causal rather than just correlational it augurs ill for today s young americans since 1989 the federal reserve has put out quarterly data on the distribution of national wealth its most recent release for the second quarter of 2021 showed for the first time that the top 1 of earners held more wealth than the middle 60 data from the congressional budget office show that the share of national income taken home by the middle 60 of earners in america has fallen and that taken by the top 20 of earners has risen in 1979 the middle 60 took home 50 8 after taxes and transfers in 2018 that share had fallen to 45 1 and the top 20 had gone up to 49 of the take no country can realistically aspire to the absolute equality of opportunity that would lift social mobility to its theoretical maximum but america could at least aspire to a less imperfect distribution of opportunity several tranches of policy that are especially influential on rates of social mobility are in areas in which america happens to lag behind its rich peers the most obvious missed opportunity is the lack of investment in early childhood education programmes and as well a welfare state that does little to reduce income poverty among children those already about to enter the labour force would benefit from better tailored education and training a system of progressive taxation can pay for it all it can also lower potentially unhelpful wealth inequality particularly through levies on inheritances even a president with huge sway in congress would have to take his time pursuing such reforms as far as they might go denmark was not built in a day mr biden is no such president six months ago when the arp provided for 1 9trn in new spending he seemed to labour under the illusion that a democrat controlled congress would give him all he wished the subsequent strength of internal dissent has shattered that illusion that does not mean a social mobility agenda is off the table it does mean making a series of choices together we could break this trap start with the youngsters we have pretty unambiguous evidence that more financial resources have lasting impacts on health and well being and intergenerational mobility says maya rossin slater a stanford economist but before covid 19 america had one of the highest rates of child poverty in the oecd almost triple poland s the reason for this is not a mystery the typical oecd country spends 2 1 of gdp on child and family benefits america spends only 0 6 as originally pitched mr biden s build back better agenda featured a suite of policies intended to make america much less of an outlier including a generous child tax credit that mimicked the child allowances many western countries use to reduce poverty universal pre kindergarten and child care subsidies this pillar of spending is not looking as grand as advertised in the framework put out by the white house on october 28th the expanded child tax credits which have already reduced child poverty were part of a stimulus package passed in march as things stand they will be extended for only one more year universal pre kindergarten would be funded for six years according to the latest negotiations as would a child care subsidy programme universalist programmes including the child tax credit received by most families were appealing when the biden administration was working with an effective blank cheque choosing a universal but short lived programme over a targeted and permanent one is harder to justify as it is more will probably be spent subsidising care homes for the elderly than on children measures which might have improved social mobility for those already in the workplace are being pared back to something much less consequential the president had originally envisaged two years of tuition free community college to every american spending 80bn on worker retraining and the creation of a scheme for paid family and medical leave which america is almost alone in the developed world in lacking all three proposals have been jettisoned because of the objections of some democratic senators there is now roughly as much spending proposed for higher education and workplace training 40bn as there is on expanding medicare so as to better cope with deafness 35bn the supports that remain in place are helpful but comparatively modest and time limited the expanded earned income tax credit which tops up the wages of working class americans would persist for just another year subsidies that allow workers to buy health insurance through the exchanges set up by obamacare would persist for another four years this is not the stuff of the gi bill the vaunted legislation which offered generous education benefits to soldiers returning from the second world war though in ways that worked to the disadvantage of black veterans and helped create the high social mobility of joe biden s youth nor is it the stuff of the new deal an example the administration reached for when it suggested that massive public works projects on climate change mitigation and infrastructure building could provide a new kind of stable job to the working classes mr biden promised that 90 of these jobs would not require a four year degree as the spending available for these proposals has shrunk so too has their chance of instigating a rooseveltian mobilisation convoluted as they are the democratic spending plans look crystal clear compared with their plans to raise revenue european style welfare states require european levels of taxation but mr biden has promised that no family with an income of less than 400 000 will pay more taxes and the 50 50 split in the senate means that kyrsten sinema a democratic senator from arizona has been able to veto conventional alternative ways of raising revenue like increasing rates of tax on capital gains and corporate profits no place left to hide gone too is a sensible proposal to eliminate a loophole allowing inherited assets to escape capital gains tax which might have raised 204bn and some democrats are also threatening to kill the whole proposal unless a tax break allowing the deduction of state and local taxes is reinstated that 90bn annual break overwhelmingly benefits the rich 54 of benefits go to the top 1 of earners as a result the president s stalwarts have grasped at more exotic revenue raising schemes of a sort which should not be designed on the fly as they have been and which risk distorting incentives for investment among these are a new minimum of 15 of tax on accounting profits for corporations a penalty for stock buy backs and newly created levies of 5 8 on households earning more than 10m bringing together all the president s ambitions in a single package would have been hard enough even if the original 4trn had been forthcoming at half that it is impossible and besides very few americans understand what the unwieldy whole is really meant to achieve the white house might profitably pare its ambitions down to the investments most suited to equalising opportunity for america s children if it did so it could at the same time clarify its message the president could claim that the thing he had at least started to build back better was the american dream itself

washington ap the u s economy was supposed to help president joe biden and democrats but as of late it s been hurting them with voters biden on friday praised the u s economy for performing better than the rest of the world saying it s largely because of his 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package and plans for additional spending of roughly 2 75 trillion on infrastructure families schools health care and climate change yet americans have turned pessimistic about the economy as inflation has persisted on tuesday voters in virginia rewarded republican glenn youngkin with a win in the governor s election in part based on a belief that he would be better for economic growth the president could not ignore these realities yet he said friday at the white house that the latest numbers show a ruggedly energetic economy we still have to tackle the costs that american families are facing but this recovery is faster stronger and fairer and wider than almost anyone could have predicted biden said that s what the numbers say the president also acknowledged that voters can t just rely on the numbers they need to feel it in their lives and their bank accounts and their hopes and expectations this question as to whether americans are feeling what the economic numbers show is at the heart of biden s challenge in the months leading up to the 2022 elections when control of the house and senate could possibly slip from the democrats it s not enough for the president to highlight friday s employment report of 531 000 job gains and a 4 6 unemployment report in october so long as the pandemic rages and shortages of basic goods ranging from auto to furniture keep pushing up prices beneath this challenge rests a deeper set of questions about how politics and the economy mingle after the pandemic do americans care more about job growth or inflation are they skeptical that government spending can permanently improve the economy for the better can democrats expect to be rewarded for their results or are voters indifferent to policy achievements these questions also posed an obstacle as house democrats on friday finally approved biden s bipartisan 1 trillion infrastructure deal which had already cleared the senate the house was preparing later friday to move forward with a 1 75 trillion mix of social spending and matching increases after attending the u n climate summit biden suggested at a tuesday news conference in glasgow scotland that the failure to pass his agenda earlier would have no impact on how the democrats fared in the 2021 election i ve not seen any evidence that whether or not i am doing well or poorly whether or not i ve got my agenda passed or not is going to have any real impact on winning or losing the president said even if we had passed my agenda i wouldn t claim we won because biden s agenda passed economists across the ideological spectrum noted that the country faces an unusual situation after the coronavirus the delta variant appears to have hobbled growth late this summer and the rush of money from the government caused consumer and business demand to surge in ways not seen in recent recoveries as a result some reliable indicators of the economy have become less reliable yes there has been a solid recovery in hiring yet so many people have stopped working or seeking jobs that the adjusted unemployment rate is closer to 7 3 instead of 4 6 said heidi shierholz president of the liberal economic policy institute and a former chief economist at the labor department we are still in a huge hole shierholz said coming out of the covid recession has created some unique circumstances that people never experienced before this created a dickensian like framework in which it could be the best of times and the worst of times the economy is poised for the fastest growth since 1984 and the stock market s dow jones industrial average hit a record high this week yet inflation is running high at an annualized rate of 5 4 and eating into paychecks employers are struggling to find workers despite raising wages container ships are stuck waiting to dock at ports creating empty shelves and long delays for consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season inflation is outpacing wage gains and that s a big problem said michael strain director of economic policy studies at the center right american enterprise institute it feels like the economy has gotten worse average gasoline prices have jumped more than 60 from a year ago to 3 42 a gallon according to the american automobile association the jump has been so swift that biden last week called on opec nations to pump more oil even as he simultaneously called for moving away from fossil fuels to have a zero emissions economy by 2050 voters so far seem to believe that the economy would fare better under republicans in tuesday s election in virginia more than a third of voters said the economy was their top priority according to ap votecast of that key group 63 broke for youngkin on the belief that a republican could do more for growth more importantly 54 of virginia voters said they disapproved of how biden was handling the economy that nearly matches a recent ap norc survey in which 58 nationwide disliked the president s economic stewardship a sharp reversal from march when 60 backed biden on the economy republican lawmakers have been effective at hammering biden and democrats on the inflation issue the biden administration initially tried to minimize inflation as a problem by calling it transitory but the consensus by many economists is that it will keep running above the federal reserve s 2 target until the second half of next year senate republican leader mitch mcconnell interpreted the results of tuesday s elections as a rejection of biden s economic policies washington democrats have super charged inflation re created welfare without work requirements and made america significantly less energy independent the kentucky senator said in a wednesday floor speech the american people will not stand for this that s what voters told democrats last night there is also the possibility that biden misread what voters were saying in last year s elections much of the president s ability to create a broader coalition came from opposition to donald trump rather than a full embrace of his ideas paul winfree director of economic policy studies at the conservative heritage foundation interprets the disapproval of biden as a sign that voters see his expansion of government spending as going too far to the left the 2020 election was a referendum on trump as an individual more than anything else winfree said now we see voters saying that the democrats have misidentified their mandate stuart stevens co founder of the lincoln project a conservative group that staunchly opposes trump said that biden has struggled to communicate its successes with the economy he noted that many americans believe the country is on the wrong track even though vaccinations are up the stock market is climbing and the unemployment rate is falling stevens concluded friday on twitter the democratic party has a huge messaging problem

world view print this mining the planet to death by jens glã¼sing simon hage alexander jung nils klawitter und stefan schultz der spiegel from der spiegel the dirty truth about clean technologies the poor south is being exploited so that the rich north can transition to environmental sustainability entire swaths of land are being destroyed to secure the resources needed to produce wind turbines and solar cells are there alternatives foto hedi xandt sabarton getty images der spiegel thereâ s a dirty secret hidden in every wind turbine they may convert moving air cleanly and efficiently into electricity but few know much about what they are made of much of the material inside wind turbines are the product of brutal encroachments on our natural world each unit requires cement sand steel zinc and aluminum and tons of copper for the generator for the gearbox for the transformer station and for the endless strands of cable around 67 tons of copper can be found in a medium sized offshore turbine to extract this amount of copper miners have to move almost 50 000 tons of earth and rock around five times the weight of the eiffel tower the ore is shredded ground watered and leached the bottom line a lot of nature destroyed for a little bit of green power a visit to the los pelambres mine in northern chile provides a clear grasp of the dimensions involved it is home to one of the worldâ s largest copper deposits a giant gray crater at an altitude of 3 600 meters 11 800 feet the earth here is full of metalliferous ore just under 2 percent of the worldâ s copper production comes from this single pit dump trucks 3 500 horsepower strong transport multi ton loads down the terrace roads that line the mine the boulders are transported by conveyor belt almost 13 kilometers 8 miles into the valley where the copper is extracted from the rock this processing requires huge amounts of electricity and water a particularly precious commodity in this arid region the project is operated by antofagasta a london based chilean mining corporation that owns 60 percent of the mine the company built a hydroelectric plant in 2013 almost exclusively to supply electricity to los pelambres farmers protested against it and have blamed the project for water shortages in the region now though the mine is slated to grow even larger the company is pumping additional volumes of desalinated seawater from the pacific coast across the country company executives hope this will enable them to continue operating the mine for a few more years global demand for copper after all is expected to grow immensely for power cables and electric motors and for wind turbines there are great hopes that the green technology can be used to help save the climate but that rescue also entails stripping the planet of precious resources and this is the paradox behind what is currently the most important project of the industrialized world the global energy transition the dilemma which is becoming increasingly apparent is also on the minds of the 25 000 or so delegates at the world climate conference currently taking place in glasgow deposits in the poor south are being exploited so that the rich north can transition to environmental sustainability at least to a lifestyle that appears sustainable mathis wackernagel a resource researcher who lives in california describes it as a disastrous development we havenâ t quite thought the future through â he says wackernagel who was born in basel switzerland in 1962 is one of the most influential figures in the environmental movement he coined two metaphors that have influenced thinking about sustainability around the world one is the idea of the environmental footprint which indicates how much land and sea area is needed to renew the resources that we have consumed according to wackernagelâ s calculations 1 75 earths would be needed for the planet to regenerate itself if all the people on the planet were to behave as wastefully as the inhabitants of germany it would require almost three earths the other is earth overshoot day which marks the day each year on which humanity has used as many resources as the planet can replenish in a year this year that day fell on july 29 the two metaphors serve to underscore wackernagelâ s main point we are using resources of the future to pay for the present â heâ s referring to the daily consumption of around 90 million barrels of crude oil the use of land for buildings roads or arable land â and also the exploitation of mineral resources wackernagel says the biological budget is limited and that humans must decide what they want to use it for if we use it to mine copper then it wonâ t for example be available for the cultivation of beets he says itâ s too short sighted to think that all we have to do to protect the environment is to recreate the fossil fueled world with electricity and swap the six cylinder jaguar for the battery powered tesla few are aware of this fact as they drive their electric vehicle use electricity from wind or solar power or have a lithium ion storage facility set up in the basement â making them feel like pioneers in sustainability many don t realize how extremely polluting the production of raw materials from which climate technologies are manufactured really is who knew for example that 77 tons of carbon dioxide are emitted during the manufacture of one ton of neodymium a rare earth metal that is used in wind turbines by comparison even the production of a ton of steel only emits around 1 9 tons of co2 almost 50 years after american scientist donella meadows and her fellow campaigners warned of the limits to growthâ in their report to the club of rome the overexploitation of nature is taking on a surprising new dimension the massive demand for materials has continually been the underappreciated factor in all the technologies that are intended to help make the world more sustainable wind turbines photovoltaic systems electric cars lithium ion batteries high voltage power lines and fuel cells all have one thing in common inconceivable amounts of raw materials are consumed in their production in a solar park measuring 1 000 by 1 000 meters there are fully 11 tons of silver a single tesla model s contains as much lithium as around 10 000 mobile phones an electric car requires six times as many critical raw materials as a combustion engine â mainly copper graphite cobalt and nickel for the battery system an onshore wind turbine contains around nine times as many of these substances as a gas fired power plant of comparable capacity it is the specific properties they contain that makes these metals so desirable cobalt and nickel increase the energy density in a battery neodymium amplifies the magnetic forces in wind generators platinum accelerates processes in fuel cells and iridium does the same for electrolyzers copperâ s conductivity makes it relevant in every electrical installation around 150 million tons of copper are installed in power lines around the globe and humankind is only at the beginning of its energy transition according to calculations by the international energy agency iea global demand for critical raw materials will quadruple by 2040 â in the case of lithium demand is expected to be as high as 42 times greater according to iea head fatih birol these materials are becoming essential components of a future clean global energy system â over the course of his professional career birol who has a doctorate in energy economics has never really had to deal with these materials until recently his area of focus had always been oil and gas first as an analyst for opec and later at the iea founded in paris in 1974 by the consuming countries in response to the first oil price crisis the crisis painfully demonstrated to governments just how dependent they had become on the drip of a few producing states almost a half a century later birol is now observing how the industrialized nations are falling into a new dependency â not on oil but on metals and it could prove to be even more serious many of these critical commodities come from a small group of countries indonesia and the philippines command around 45 percent of the global nickel supply china supplies 60 percent of rare earth metals the congo is responsible for about two thirds of cobalt production south africa dominates around 70 percent of the platinum market the geographical concentration is even more pronounced than in the oil business opec covers just 35 percent of global supply in mining on the other hand only 10 countries produce around 70 percent of the raw materials by value the good news is that from a geological view there is no shortage of metals even the rare earths are neither rare nor earths nor are they in any way exclusive to china on the other hand mining is becoming more and more expensive and ore quality and raw material content are declining as the tight supply meets surging demand prices are skyrocketing within 12 months important metals have become massively more expensive the price of nickel has risen by 26 percent copper by 43 percent and aluminum by 56 percent the price of lithium carbonate has roughly tripled in a year to more than 20 000 per ton at the same time stocks of metal in warehouses around the world are plummeting itâ s obvious that something is out of balance iae head birol is familiar with the situation from the oil business and the metals markets could also fall into a similar situation birol speaks of the looming discrepancy between ambition and supply between the aspiration to protect the climate and the difficulty of obtaining enough affordable copper nickel and lithium given that the depletion of resources is concentrated in a few countries particularly those that are politically unstable their supply is becoming a global security issue this could lead to disruptions â warns birol and it begs the question how clean are green technologies really foto hartmut schwarzbach argus mining rich soils poor people hamdallaye was a village in northwestern guinea in west africa a settlement of thatched mud huts and shady fruit trees sociologist mamadou malick bah 25 used to live in the village but bah had to leave last year the village and its 700 inhabitants stood in the way of bauxite extraction the reddish ore that lies hidden beneath the earth is considered guineaâ s gold since it is the raw material for aluminum an important light metal in wind turbines and power lines the inhabitants of hamdallaye were resettled in a new village located five kilometers away from the old one in photos the new community built on a spoil heap resembles a desert landscape itâ s like being on mars â says bah not much can grow there indeed the soil is so poor that cbg the partly state owned guinean mining company now has to support the small farmers who previously made a living off their own plots each farmer is provided with the equivalent of 94 euros a month more and more young people are leaving the village says bah and the locals weren t given jobs at cbg anyway companies began mining the bokã region more than 50 years ago and today the excavators run almost nonstop guinea one of the worldâ s poorest countries has the largest bauxite deposits on earth mining concessions have been awarded for a large part of the countryâ s territory and chinese companies are also involved the environmental consequences have been devastating bah says it has resulted in the destruction of natural diversity and sources of drinking water the machinesâ vibration caused his hut in the old village to collapse four years ago but he still hasnâ t received any compensation one controversial aspect of the mining project is the fact that the german government is involved in 2016 berlin provided loan guarantees to the tune of 246 million euros for the expansion of the mine despite criticism from the german environment agency in a report the german economics ministry praised that globalization in guinea could be managed equitably rather than focus on the expropriations of west african farmers the report instead noted that the investment helped guarantee jobs back in germany the report noted that the expansion of the mine would enable the germany based company aluminium oxid stade aos to secure its production for more than 10 years aos is the last remaining german bauxite processor and an important supplier of products for the automotive industry an audi e tron vehicle includes 804 kilograms of aluminum the controversial bauxite mining in west africa is but one example of the disconnect between popular environmentally friendly products made in germanyâ and the origins of their ingredients indeed it is the paradox of abundance that plagues countries like guinea they have enormous mineral resources and yet they fail to attain widespread prosperity but this isnâ t necessarily a given norway is also blessed with resources but it also manages to put that advantage to good use the country is reliable politically its institutions are strong and it has a low crime rate good governance is the key to ensuring that countries like guinea can also profit from the global commodities boom the major deposits can be found in the three aâ sâ â africa australia and the andes all of which are suffering extremely from climate change in all these places water is extremely scarce and enormous amounts of energy are needed to process the ore the crushing and grinding of rock accounts for up to 3 percent of global electricity demand thatâ s more than the entire amount consumed by germany the mining industry even describes itself as being a dirty dusty dangerousâ business no other industry is as destructive to the environment the operations often leave behind a lunar landscape in addition to basins full of contaminated sludge so called tailings in which the residues of the processing are collected around 32 000 of these toxic lakes are located around the world in january 2019 a dam located near an iron ore mine in brazil burst and created a mudslide that poured into the valley and killed more than 270 people in the past ignoring the environment was something that mining companies could afford to do but they face resistance today the weekend before last a protest by indigenous mayans in guatemala against a swiss mining company extracting nickel in the northeast led the country to declare a state of emergency many customers of mining companies especially investors are no longer giving an easy pass to misconduct â at least not within the biggest companies they avoid industries that are considered environmentally dubious even if they are financially promising this is forcing the mining companies to act too we meet all the requirements to be interesting for investors â ivã n arriagada the ceo of chilean copper giant antofagasta has said courting investors arriagada 58 is a modern executive with a masterâ s degree from the london school of economics â and not one of the old school mining tycoons who would never show up without wearing a tie arriagada is seeking to position antofagasta as a pioneer in environmental protection â at least to the extent possible in the industry he says that close to half the water the company uses in mines like los pelambres now comes from the sea instead of the mountains and by 2025 that figure is expected to rise to 90 percent we use every drop of water seven or eight times before it evaporates â arriagada says he also says that the electricity needed is to be generated entirely from renewable sources in the coming year around a dozen companies are involved in the global commodities business switzerlandâ s glencore dominates the cobalt market the u s company albermarle is no 1 in lithium brazilâ s vale is the global leader in nickel and chileâ s codelco and britainâ s antofagasta are leaders in copper all these companies are feeling growing pressure to protect the environment we really need to change our mindset â rio tinto ceo jakob stausholm confessed at a recent investor conference in london the anglo australian company has set the goal of halving its co2 emissions by 2030 at the same time the conditions under which the mining industry can extract mineral resources are growing more difficult over the past 15 years the copper ore content in chileâ s mines has fallen by almost a third to 0 7 percent three generations ago that figure was 2 to 3 percent today the industry has to dig much deeper to extract the same quantities of precious metals than it did in the past â and it consumes correspondingly more electricity and fuel the deposits that are easiest to extract have already been mined and no major new deposits have been exploited in chile in years only 2 percent of all explorations actually result in the construction of a mine it takes luck a lot of perseverance and persistence â says antofagasta ceo arrigiada and on average it takes 16 years from the discovery of a suitable spot before mining operations begin our planning horizon spans decades â he says indeed it is difficult to increase the current supply of metals according to iea forecasts volumes from active and planned mines wonâ t be enough to fill demand for example current mining operations will cover only half of future demand for lithium and cobalt supply and investment plans for many critical minerals fall well short of what is needed to support rapid deployment of solar panels wind turbines and electric vehicles warns iea chief birol arriagada says his company anticipated the uptick in demand in its forecasts but says that the momentum surprised them the main reason for this is the rapidly growing demand for green technologies he says that electromobility is currently responsible for 1 or 2 percent of copper demand by 2030 that share is expected to rise to more than 10 percent the pandemic has created an awareness that we need to act collectively and quickly to address systemic risks like climate change says arriagada his company is profiting from that development foto dylan stewart image of sport ddp electric cars treasures in the chassis depending on the battery type an electric car requires between 150 and 250 kilograms of special raw materials the largest part is comprised of graphite nickel and copper with the rest composed of manganese lithium and cobalt carmakers are now pushing ahead with the expansion of their e fleets and competition has broken out among them over securing supplies of raw materials this spring bmw ceo oliver zipse made a bold pledge to his customers and shareholders he proclaimed that bmw would build the worldâ s greenestâ car itâ s not only the air in the cities that should become clean but also all the links in the value chain for zipse this also means that raw materials canâ t come from mines where children work or waters are contaminated by pollutants with cobalt one of the most important ingredients in modern electric batteries that often happens zipseâ s words may have a whiff of cheap environmental pr but he s likely being genuine after all heâ s simply following economic logic electric cars are all about outperforming internal combustion engines on sustainability otherwise the most important sales argument falls flat even if the production of the raw materials for an e car and its battery devours extreme masses of resources it is still far more environmentally advantageous than driving a conventional vehicle in terms of its carbon footprint the electric car has a clear advantage according to the iea an internal combustion vehicle emits 40 tons of greenhouse gases over a life cycle of 200 000 kilometers more than twice as much as an electric car despite the co2 intensive production of the battery the weakness of the e car is that it requires so many more mineral raw materials than internal combustion vehicles including quite a few critical materials that are often mined under dubious conditions the battery in the ix electric suv recently unveiled by bmw contains about 6 kilograms of cobalt 10 kilograms of lithium and 60 kilos of copper these are all raw materials that are seldom or almost never found in a gas or diesel engine around half of the growth in demand that green technologies will trigger over the next two decades is related solely to the foreseeable boom in electric cars and energy storage bmw is forecasting that by 2030 50 percent of the cars it sells will be purely electric vehicles up from a share of only 3 percent today the company finds itself in a dilemma mine workers in congo shouldnâ t have to foot the bill for affluent people in munich to have clean air we canâ t limit ourselves to just operating sustainably in our own factories â says patrick hudde head of supply chain sustainability and raw materials management at bmw that has prompted the automaker to take an unusual step the company says it no longer wants to rely on intermediaries and their pledges that their raw materials come from clean sources bmw is now buying lithium and cobalt directly from mine operators not in congo where most of the mining is done by hand but from mining companies in morocco australia and argentina which bmw claims it has carefully examined hudde says the selection process was rigorous and that more than 100 suppliers didn t receive contracts because we werenâ t convinced of their compliance with environmental and social standards â but bmw reaches its limits quickly when it comes to its ability to conduct controls the company plans regular and at times unannounced visits by trained auditors employees at suppliers are also able to issue complaints directly to bmw if we become aware of violations we promptly ensure that the grievances are remedied on site â he says ultimately though they are only spot checks bmw relies on its partners to comply with contractually agreed social and environmental standards in the event of a violation the carmaker can ill afford to drop a supplier it would be next to impossible to quickly replace a major cobalt supplier faced with such a predicament a company could try to reduce its use of raw materials by technological means the first generation of toyotaâ s mirai hydrogen car still required 40 grams of platinum per vehicle in new models the amount required has dropped by a third and by 2040 toyota wants to reduce it to 5 grams but even engineering feats like that at best only alleviate the industryâ s dependence on raw materials it cannot be eliminated foto cristobal olivares bloomberg getty images china more powerful than opec that reality has a direct impact on relations between western economies and china with a share of around 50 percent of global demand for raw materials china now occupies a position of supremacy that was reserved for the united states in the middle of the 20th century says peter buchholz the head of the german mineral resources agency dera thatâ s not going to change anytime soon â he says china is the largest supplier of numerous metals at the same time beijing has built up a network of partner countries â and it has made them dependent it pumps capital into countries like chile bolivia and congo buying mining rights and access to scarce resources chinaâ s dominance in processing is even more pronounced the country is the leading producer of 23 out of 26 refined products and its share of rare earths is around 90 percent beijing aims to cover all stages of the value chain from ore to e car batteries china controls about 75 percent of all lithium ion battery production capacity worldwide america and europe have watched with concern as the commodity giantâ s market power grows thierry breton the european unionâ s internal market commissioner warns of total dependence on china â especially for supplies of rare earths ten years ago china demonstrated the leverage it has when it suddenly cut exports of rare earths leading prices to skyrocket and plunging the world into a supply crisis it provided the occasion for germany to formulate a first draft of its raw materials strategy china is using its investments in africa and south america specifically for a geopolitical power play it self confidently secures influence grants loans worth billions and thus creating ties of dependency with an increasing number of countries according to hamburg based economist thomas straubhaar nothing about the moves being made by beijing is by chance the country pursues a sober strategy of power â he says access to raw materials has become an instrument of foreign policy chinaâ s unique position isnâ t due to the fact that the soils in the far east are richer in minerals â there are sufficient deposits of raw materials all over the world in terms of geology germany could even cover some of its metal requirements itself regions like the harz and erzgebirge mountains already have centuries old mining traditions but businesses have instead chosen to purchase metal from abroad â at the price of dependence ultimately it is cheaper to obtain supplies from overseas the main thing is that they donâ t have to get their own hands dirty elsewhere importing countries have sought to counter chinaâ s superiority by reactivating disused deposits in california investors restarted the old mountain pass mine in 2018 to extract rare earth metals and in sweden iron ore mining company lkab is planning to extract rare materials from the waste generated from its exploration activities other companies are exploring the planetâ s last frontiers the treasures that lie dormant in the deep sea billions of tons of metalliferous minerals companies like deep green and uk seabed resources are exploring ways they can commercially exploit the seabed there have also been advances in conveying technologies harvesters weighing up to 250 tons are to transport the raw materials upward using an armored hose they need to be highly reliable and able to withstand extreme water pressure it would be too much trouble to have to keep bringing them back up to the surface for repairs analysts at bcc research are expecting a new commodity rush triggered by deep sea mining with market volume of up to 15 billion by the end of the decade at the same time environmentalists are warning of the destruction of ecosystems that have barely even been explored if the seabed is plowed through by the square kilometer the deep sea canâ t be relied upon as a quick competitive and more importantly environmentally friendly source of raw materials recovering metals from waste provides greater promise foto victor ruiz caballero reuters recycling shredding for new resources the island of peute in the port of hamburg is home to europeâ s largest copper works operated by aurubis the plant has been producing copper for pipes sheet metal and wire since 1907 more than a million tons of copper products each year in addition to the ore delivered from chile peru or brazil the factory relies heavily on recycled materials mountains of the commodity can be found at the facility heaps of shiny reddish copper granulate of varying consistencies some coarse others fine â all of it produced from discarded wire next to the mounds are barrels filled with the shredded remains of computers or mobile phones christian plitzko a metallurgist at aurubis grabs a handful this is where the treasures are that weâ re interested in â he says plitzko who has been with aurubis for 24 years looks down at the shiny green and silver material in his gloved hand this used to be a circuit board in a computer â he says every kilogram of circuit board material contains 250 grams of pure copper it is technically feasible to extract other metals from such waste but the effort remains too great if it were possible to specifically remove for example parts made of neodymium from a circuit board with the help of a barcode and a laser then it might be worth it says plitzko if producers would label their circuit boards we would later in the recycling process be able to specifically remove certain metals before they are melted down â demand for copper has noticeably increased and the smelting furnaces at aurubis are working at full capacity â with production at the factory continuing around the clock seven days a week the company benefits from the fact that copper is an important element in all green technologies and that recycling is a relatively clean method of compensating for the scarcity of the raw material recovering the metal that is built into a circuit board takes just a 20th of the energy required to extract the metal via mining the process enables the industry to cover at least part of its demand for raw materials using methods that do not increase its dependence on source countries more than ever before recycling has become a key element of commodities supply but there is plenty of potential that isnâ t yet being tapped more and more electronic waste is being produced â in the form of discarded mobile phones televisions and refrigerators but instead of ending up at recycling stations a lot of valuable raw materials find their way into landfills or waste incinerators in germany only about 44 percent of electronic scrap is collected while the global rate is lower than a fifth the wind power industry has a particularly significant role to play many turbines from the industryâ s early days are now ready to be replaced most of the materials used in the towers and turbine housings can be reused but its not quite as easy with the rotor blades since they are frequently made with epoxied carbon fiber or fiberglass many end up in the incinerator the producers of electric cars are eager to avoid repeating that mistake they are working on concepts that will make it easier to recycle the valuable materials that are currently being used to manufacture new vehicles half of the aluminum that bmw uses in its engines and auto bodies for example is recycled but the share is significantly lower for materials like nickel cobalt and lithium that are used to produce batteries the electric vehicle era after all has only just begun and there isnâ t yet a huge supply of used batteries available that though will change as soon as e cars make up half or more of all vehicle traffic in the coming years by then bmw plans to have introduced a recycling strategy that leads to lower and lower reliance on primary raw materials foto christian charisius picture alliance dpa electric car pioneer tesla even hopes that it will one day be able to cover almost all of its raw materials needs with old batteries jeffrey brian jb straubel who has been the companyâ s technical mastermind for years alongside elon musk even founded his own recycling company for the purpose he believes there will be a radical shiftâ to lower battery prices when huge numbers of batteries can be 95 98 percent recycled he believes that would be both an ecological and financial breakthrough for automobile manufacturers batteries currently account for roughly a third of the purchase price for an electronic vehicle mostly the result of the expensive materials involved in their manufacture a volkswagen pilot facility has already begun operations in salzgitter right next to the site where a factory will begin operations in 2024 churning out an expected 500 000 batteries for electric cars each year the discarded batteries are disassembled in a corrugated metal warehouse and shredded before the valuable substances inside are then filtered out in the long term the company hopes to recycle 97 percent of all raw materials used currently vw achieves a quota of around 50 percent a number that is expected to soon climb to 72 percent with the help of the new recycling facility vw does not consider old batteries to be hazardous wasteâ but a valuable source of raw materials â still recycling alone wonâ t be sufficient to cover the vast raw material requirements in green industries rates of 45 to 50 percent for copper suggest that there is still some potential for recycling and that the eco balance of battery systems wind turbines and solar parks will improve however this calculation does not add up says aurubis expert plitzko the copper recycled today was produced and used on average 35 years ago when significantly less of it was produced as such the rate is more like 80 percent says plitzko as a society we wonâ t be able to cover our entire demand for copper with recycling â he says we will also need primary copper if we want to cover current and future demand â foto paul langrock that means that even the most ambitious recycling efforts wonâ t be enough to put an end to the ruthless exploitation of our environment nature will continue to be depleted in part because humanity hopes to live work and travel in a more environmentally friendly manner in the future for as long as we continue to maintain our current levels of prosperity we will unavoidably continue to consume more resources which is ultimately damaging to the biosphere if we continue to use more than nature produces we will exceed our planetâ s limits itâ s like a bank account says sustainability expert wackernagel you can overdraw your balance for a time but not forever does that mean that renouncing consumption is the only solution to reducing our hunger for raw materials as some have proposed wackernagel grimaces that sounds to me like far too much individual suffering and sacrifice â he says a good life he continues is also possible within the ecological limits that exist you donâ t need a two ton electric vehicle to transport a person who weighs 75 kilograms an electric bicycle can do the job just as well he says furthermore wackernagel believes a different factor will be decisive when it comes to our societyâ s future sustainability the number of people when he was born in 1962 there were around 3 1 billion people on the planet today there are 7 8 billion if the global reproduction rate doesnâ t change significantly there will be close to 10 billion by the end of the century wackernagel believes that the global population needs to begin dropping again fewer people after all require fewer resources

by sam pizzigati ace researchers dropped two blockbuster reports on us earlier this week the first from the un intergovernmental panel on climate change the ipcc hit on monday with a worldwide thunderclap un secretary general antónio guterres is dubbing this first report s findings a code red for humanity and for good reason our global thermometer is already averaging 1 1 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels if current trends continue we ll reach 3 degrees this century where do we need to be to avert catastrophe for people and natural systems worldwide we can t afford to let global temperatures rise over 1 5 degrees this week s second blockbuster report arrived tuesday sans the thunderclap few media outlets chose to give this second study the economic policy institute s latest look at u s ceo pay any high profile real estate fewer still drew any link between the climate disaster ahead and how much america s top corporate execs are making but that link most definitely does exist indeed that link may well determine whether we avert that catastrophic future the un climate panel sees looming before us the chief execs at america s top 350 publicly traded corporations the new epi study details last year pocketed 351 times the pay of their most typical workers if we re seeing that same level of executive excess a decade from now our environmental goose will be cooked don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free how can what corporations pay ceos impact climate change most folks would find that question a real head scratcher but if we reword that question a bit and ask ourselves whether what corporations do can impact climate change most of us would have no trouble venturing an answer corporations are doing plenty most of us understand to foul our environment and speed climate change their factories vehicles and power plants are spewing out greenhouse gases by the millions of metric tons the companies they buy energy from are spewing out millions more still more millions are coming from extracting the raw materials corporations use to fashion their products corporations sums up the natural resources defense council s joshua axelrod produce just about everything we buy use and throw away and play an outsized role in driving global climate change how outsized the top 15 u s food and beverage companies alone annually generate 630 million metric tons of greenhouse gases more every year than australia the world s 15th largest greenhouse gas source let s pause here for an important reminder our corporate entities in and of themselves don t actually do anything they just exist as inanimate legal constructs people make corporations go and ceos do most of that making ceos decide how corporations operate they collect as compensation for these decisions the latest epi stats confirm outrageously outsized rewards since 1978 ceo pay at big time u s corporations has increased 1 322 percent to an average 24 2 million worker pay in those same years has gone up 18 percent a fraction of just 1 percent per year how can ceos be making so much decades ago most corporate executive compensation came from salary checks most ceo compensation today comes from stock based rewards in our contemporary corporate pay environment ceos reap their windfalls by raising the value of their corporate stock wall streeters typically tie corporate share value to quarterly corporate earnings the higher these earnings profits the more generous the rewards for ceos outrageously high rewards in turn give top corporate execs a powerful incentive to behave outrageously to juice their corporate quarterly earnings by any means necessary what sorts of means over recent decades our most illustrious corporate execs have cooked their corporate books squeezed their workers and cheated their consumers at levels of intensity that would have been unimaginable in the mid 20th century back in those years the decades right after world war ii top corporate execs operated in an environment with clear limits on their behavior in most major u s industries these execs couldn t do as they pleased they faced robust trade unions and adequately resourced government regulators and these execs also faced a tax code that disincentivized greed and grasping individual income over 200 000 in most of the 20 years after world war ii came subject to a 91 percent federal income tax rate rates that high made bad corporate executive behavior a bad bet why bother behaving badly when most of the rewards from that bad behavior would simply end up in the pockets of uncle sam by the 1980s america s mid century constraints on corporate executive behavior had largely evaporated deregulation became a bipartisan watchword in the late 1970s and tax rates on top bracket income fell to as low as 28 percent in the reagan years trade unions meanwhile represented an ever dwindling share of the nation s workforce in this new economic environment most everything top execs could grab they could keep so they grabbed away in 1965 ceos at major corporations averaged only 21 times what their workers made by 1989 that gap had tripled to 61 times since then the gap has tripled again and then nearly doubled to the 351 times the economic policy institute computes for 2020 chief corporate execs in our new gilded age are racking up their awesome rewards doing exactly what their executive forebears did in the original golden age they re squeezing and cheating and abusing the environment these bad behaviors serve a carefully calculated purpose they keep quarterly corporate earnings lush significantly changing these behaviors in other words behaving well would inevitably drag these earnings down consider tyson foods one of the three largest meat processing corporations in the world modern meat processing relies on factory farming animal rights activists have been blasting the cruelty of that farming for years but factory farming has been equally cruel to the environment factory farms generate 37 percent of our world s methane emissions and these emissions have over 20 times the global warming impact of carbon dioxide factory farms produce plenty of carbon dioxide as well and also release plenty of problematic hydrogen sulfide and ammonia don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free any serious tyson foods move to clean all this up would take a wrenching and costly retooling of the company s business model that sort of commitment would jeopardize tyson s bountiful quarterly earnings and executive pay tyson s ceo in 2020 a transitional corporate figure took home nearly 11 million that year a princely sum 294 times the pay of the typical tyson s worker tyson s board chair and former ceo john tyson is now sitting on a 2 6 billion personal family fortune if the successors to tyson s current ceo a decade from now are still pulling down annual jackpots that their workers would have to labor centuries to match we ll know that tyson has been continuing environmentally destructive business as usual and if the overall u s executive pay stats the economic policy institute calculates a decade from now tell the same story for the rest of corporate america we ll know that we simply have no shot at sidestepping climate disaster the economy would suffer no harm epi s larry mishel and jori kandra conclude in their new executive compensation analysis if ceos were paid less and if our ceos ten years down the road do end up pocketing less thanks to steps we can take right now we ll know that our environment still has a fighting chance sam pizzigati co edits inequality org his latest books include the case for a maximum wage and the rich don t always win the forgotten triumph

if you have never read margaret atwood s the handmaid s tale you may likely not know how it erased people of color from the conversation the television series attempted to make amends but the premise stayed very much the same in the novel handmaids who were white women were treated as slaves and black women disappeared this left room for white women to utilize the novel as a backbone for performative activism such activism centers reproductive rights discussion around white plight and ignores the racial inequity of us reproductive care a little background atwood s novel adapted its speculative fiction approach from existing laws and cultural realities present before and after jim crow era united states during an interview with pbs atwood noted that she prefers to call her work speculative fiction instead of science fiction thus gilead isn t a work of total imagination there s precedence for that world it may not mirror the united states in its current form its structure and customs also reflect aspects of 17th century new england puritanism and dictatorships seen in different eras across the globe in the interview atwood lists influences from her childhood such as fahrenheit 452 animal farm and 1984 these novels take a science fiction approach to dystopian themes some of which are rooted in russian historical events and some in american ones in turn gilead the dystopian hellscape in the novel and the series is america atwood details the policies of gilead on page 305 its racist policies for instance were firmly rooted in the pre gilead period and racist fears provided some of the emotional fuel that allowed the gilead takeover to succeed as well as it did this quote indicates if this is speculative fiction that the environment that allowed gilead to come about was inherently racist america and its policies were racist long before 1985 when the book was written if you follow this line of reasoning atwood acknowledges these influences on her work and is genuine about pointing out these problematic systems that largely serve the patriarchy through gender and racial inequity don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the book is set in new england although atwood is canadian she knowingly placed the book in america the entire premise of the book is that a fundamentalist christian regime rose to power as a response to a fertility crisis the novel also indicates that that regime was able to be doubly racist by displacing the blame of a violent coup on islamic fanatics this has the convenient effect of denoting the inherent savagery of the islamic faith and its predominantly colorful worshippers gilead has a clear way of differentiating classes by uniform and station in day to day life although it is not inherently stated the undertone with this classification system reflects eerily on the way a historically racist regime the nazis in germany classified the undesirable elements of their society costuming and context the now popularized handmaid outfits in the novel and the series are a way of removing cultural differences and ignoring the individual atwood s handmaids were all white and it was very clear that their children would be the most desirable in the series there is a single handmaid of color who receives screen time she escapes gilead through a not so well disguised underground railroad style system to the north in this case the north is canada where human rights still exist at face value the outfits seem to touch upon how the patriarchy places women under categorically the same oppression however the series erases key racial discourse in an area of activism that has historically also ignored women of color other cultures have utilized costuming outfits and clothing such as the burqa to limit the attractiveness and individualism of women although the level of women s coverage varies from culture to culture the effect is the same perhaps you made the intellectual leap to assume the costumes served a similar purpose in the handmaid s tale however atwood clarified in the new york times in 2017 that the modesty costumes worn by the women of gilead are derived from western religious iconography the wives wear the blue of purity from the virgin mary the handmaids wear red from the blood of parturition but also from mary magdalene also red is easier to see if you happen to be fleeing okay and what does this mean why is the distinction important atwood did not ignore the racial bias in gilead s rules and policies in the novel and through interviews that reveal her research and influences atwood was forthright about the breeding policies being woefully racist during an interview with penguin she discussed selective breeding as an influence for her work showing the volumes of research she used to design the concept of the novel speaking of the rise of the religious right both globally and in the united states as a more focused microcosm atwood said she read a piece called why nazis slaughtered own super race babies and went on to discuss how racially pure wives were given to men to create super race bred for looks and loyalty stalwart tall blond haired and blue eyed atwood was very aware of the racial influences she would be weaving into the novel and subsequently aware of the show s treatment of the concepts does current activism utilizing the outfits and concepts of the novel acknowledge those key racial influences color blindness is not inclusive the handmaids are used as breeding stock by wealthy influential families after a crisis that rendered most women infertile in gilead handmaids were selected from predominantly white well educated backgrounds and forced to reproduce with their commanders realistically at any point you can substitute the word commander for master and it would effectively hold the same historical context breeding of adult human females is nothing new for women of color in the united states there is a long and well known history of their selection by slave owners for forceful reproduction the curtailing of reproductive rights specifically for women of color is deeply rooted in american history according to a vawnet briefing published in 2016 control of african americans reproductive choices dates back to 18th and 19th century efforts to increase the slave population through procreative exploitation of enslaved women and continues today in the form of discriminatory welfare policies where in the book or the series is this very specific struggle for women of color acknowledged as unique to them the answer is it isn t the show attempts to bring some voices of color into the forefront through characters like moira who is initially a handmaid of color moira flees to canada a woman of color seeking refuge in the north should not be an unfamiliar story if you know anything about american history you see some of her struggle and her role as a black lesbian in gilead as you follow her journey through peripheral breaks in the storyline there is also a black martha marthas in gilead are housemaids and cooks placing women firmly back into the domestic sphere june s husband is a black man however these characters seem to exist on the sidelines and their stories are positioned in such a way that they seem to rescue june in her cause or carry her plotline the show always recenters on the white protagonist don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free performative activism the term is relatively new in the discussion but performative activism has existed for decades you might have heard the term slacktivism coined in 1995 slacktivism was a way of participating in some form of activism without ever really doing the work you could contribute a couple of bucks to a go fund me or put a series of hashtags on a social media post to participate celebrities misused their instagrams so badly in 2020 that their misplaced black lives matter posts on blackout tuesday ruined the conversation by definition performative activism is activism that is done to increase one s social capital rather than because of one s devotion to a cause good intentioned people s actions can still have a negative connotation while gaining visibility through the striking red and white modesty uniform might seem like a strong statement it can also be seen by minorities as a way for predominantly white women to dominate the focus in the conversation a unified unrelenting group of women with a common and clear goal can change the world that change should be for the good of all women and all women should be invited to the conversation and advocated for if we are going to dismantle the patriarchy collective radical intolerance and active refusal to participate are required this post was previously published on medium com
menafn jordan times by akinwumi a adesina ngozi okonjo iweala vera songwe and ibrahim assane mayaki abidjan almost two years into the covid 19 pandemic the unequal nature of the global response to the crisis is glaringly obvious whereas very few african countries have managed to spend the equivalent of even 1 per cent of their gdp to combat this virtually unprecedented health emergency western economies have mustered over 10 trillion or 30 per cent of their combined gdp to tackle it europe and the united states have fully vaccinated respectively 75 per cent and 70 per cent of their adult populations against covid 19 but fewer than 6 per cent of africans have been vaccinated and while some western countries are already administering booster shots africa cannot get initial doses this systemic inequity is equally evident in efforts to address the climate crisis climate disasters like viruses know no boundaries but whereas governments in the global north respond to such events by borrowing on capital markets at negligible cost in order to finance stimulus and investment packages african countries must rely on either a trickle of liquidity through debt suspension initiatives aid pledges or exorbitantly expensive capital market funding none of these options currently provide these economies with the upfront capital investment they need to improve their long term prospects as world leaders head to glasgow for the united nations climate change conference cop26 africa needs decisive collective action rather than more encouraging words we therefore propose a strategic financial and trade package that can transform climate inequality into inclusiveness by ensuring a transformative shift of resources from historic greenhouse gas ghg emitters to africa our plan rests on four pillars first developed economies must keep the promise they made in the 2015 paris climate agreement to deliver 100 billion per year to help cover developing countries adaptation and transition costs after all the commitments that developing countries made in paris were conditional on this pledge failure to fulfill this overdue commitment now with half of the 100 billion earmarked for adaptation costs will undermine the very principle of multilateral action it is a provision in an international agreement and it must be honoured the fact that the developed world mobilised 10 trillion to counter the pandemic in 2020 alone demonstrates just how small an amount 100 billion per year really is yet in that same period official development assistance increased by only 3 5 per cent in real terms the second pillar is to align financial markets with the paris agreement s goals mainstreaming the impact of climate change in investment decisions is critical and judicious deployment of private capital in green sectors will transform african countries and developing economies in general to that end the glasgow financial alliance for net zero chaired by former bank of england governor mark carney has brought together firms with a combined 90 trillion in assets there must now be an urgent and determined effort to channel this private finance into growing climate friendly sectors in africa and other developing countries with that in mind the un economic commission for africa earlier this year proposed a facility that aims to reduce borrowing costs linked to green investments by developing a repurchasing repo market for the continent the initiative which ideally will be financed through seed funding of 3 billion in special drawing rights the international monetary fund s reserve asset is intended to de risk private investments in africa and help the region increase its share currently less than 1 per cent of the global green bond market the republic of south africa recently issued a r3 billion 196 million green bond to refinance its energy sector such issuances are an example of the type of investment that is possible by unlocking bond markets for africa we need to make such investments the rule rather than the exception in addition the african development bank afdb group has proposed establishing an african financial stability mechanism such a scheme will help prevent future financial shocks in africa the only continent without a regional financing arrangement from having spillover effects the third pillar is to provide the significant resources africa needs to enable its economies to adapt to global warming climate change is costingthe continent 7 15 billion annually and threatens both food security and the use of hydropower but sub saharan africa which accounts for less than 4 per cent of global ghg emissions receives just 5 per cent of total climate finance outside the oecd instead of simply waiting for such financing to materialise africa is tackling climate adaptation head on with homegrown solutions the afdb currently devotes 63 per cent of its climate finance to adaptation the highest share of any multilateral financial institution and has committed to double such funding to 25 billion by 2025 the afdb and the global center on adaptation have also created the africa adaptation acceleration programme aaap to help scale up bankable adaptation investments in the region the mobilisation of 25 billion via the aaap will be a first step towards investing in a green recovery for africa lastly any solution to climate change must address trade the lifeblood of the global economy the key to ending our current economic malaise is to ensure continued openness and predictability including by committing to global trade rules that are aligned with the paris agreement s goals regional blocs such as the newly formed african continental free trade area can provide an impetus for hardwiring our commitment to low carbon development we must recognise africa s specific needs acknowledge the continent s vulnerability to climate change and identify the regions and communities where its consequences have caused the most harm next year s un climate summit cop27 will take place in africa and we look forward to welcoming the world but developed countries must fulfill their longstanding climate promises to the

columns the monroe news i have been thinking about the united states of america and what type of government this collective of states is in 1776 we rejected the tyranny of king george iii and the notion of the devine right of kings instead according to the declaration of independence governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed rather than the power to govern coming from god it comes from the people being governed if the leaders of the government derive their power from the people how do the governed transfer that power to the governing by consent that is they can vote for the leaders of their government is our country then a democracy in a pure democracy there is direct participation of citizens in all decision making in a very large collective of people direct participation becomes unwieldly if not impossible we cannot possibly vote on every issue hence we are not a pure democracy perhaps we are a republic which is a form of government that relies on the representation of the people rather than people representing themselves as in a pure democracy the key concept to the word republic is that the leader of the government or state is not a hereditary monarch but rather someone who is elected or installed consequently the leaders need not be elected which we see in many autocratic republics such as the people s republic of china and cuba since we elect those who represent us we can be considered a democratic republic so when tim walberg stated that he did not believe in democracy but i believe in a republic it is noteworthy that he did not say democratic republic on the surface it appears that we may be a democratic republic the problem is that in our current government we the people the common people are not truly represented if you follow the votes of those who represent us you will see an interesting pattern many of their votes seem to follow the money which leads to a form of government called an oligarchy or plutocracy which exists when a government is controlled by the wealthy either directly or indirectly indirectly it consists of regulatory frameworks and programs designed to benefit the wealthy e g trump s tax cut according to opensecrets org it costs over 9 8 million to get elected to the senate and over 2 3 million to get elected to the house money that comes mostly from wealthy individuals corporations and pacs how do these donations correlate with congressional votes although 88 of citizens favor allowing the federal government to negotiate for lower prices on medications according to a kaiser family foundation poll this benefit was eliminated from biden s budget proposal why follow the money since 2013 sen kyrsten sinema d az received 258 236 from the pharmaceutical industry and sen robert menendez d ca received 491 800 in the house rep scott peters d ca received 541 400 since 2013 and rep kurt schrader d or received 433 178 kaiser health news all are opposed along with many republicans to having medicare negotiate prices with big pharma they represent big pharma not their constituents then there is joe manchin d wv according to the latest gallup poll 73 of citizens are in favor of clean energy but he refuses to support clean energy why manchin personally makes roughly half a million dollars a year in dividends from coal company stock he also received 823 207 in campaign funds from the oil and gas industry also five republican representatives david mckinley r wv john curtis r ut garret graves r la mariannette miller meeks r ia and dan crenshaw r tx unofficially attended the glasgow cop26 climate talks together they ve raised more than 2 5 million from the fossil fuel industry over their careers how will they vote on clean energy follow the money we are in danger of becoming a plutocracy and that may mean the end not only of democracy but also our way of life hank cetola ph d is a professor emeritus at adrian college adrian mi and the founder of lenawee indivisible he can be reached at lenaweeindivisible3 gmail com

this article is more than 2 years old getty how should american savers respond to low interest rates one might expect the answer to be simple just invest in stocks instead of bonds or savings accounts and indeed a young saver not only can heed that advice but likely doesn t even need it with target date funds for younger savers automatically allocating their assets nearly entirely into stocks equity investments and thinking further back the ready availability of mutual funds etfs online brokers etc both for individual saving and through retirement accounts provide unprecedented access to equity investing in a way that had not been the case for prior generations in 1980 only 6 of us households owned a mutual fund compared to a fairly steady nearly half of all households since 2000 but that s an incomplete answer as we age experts advise us to shift our investments over time with less in equities and more in bonds or to use target date funds with a glidepath which do the math to automatically adjust asset allocation for example vanguard target date mutual funds start shifting assets at age 40 from 90 equity to only 30 equity at age 72 with the remainder mostly in u s corporate bonds and smaller portions in international bonds and inflation adjusted government bonds so yes when journalists report about potential increases in interest rates as bad news they fail to recognize the very real impact that the historically low interest rates have on older savers and retirees trying to make sure their savings lasts for their lifetime which brings me to mrs watanabe the term equivalent to mrs smith say was coined by the economist in 1997 everyone s mother or auntie seems to be at it with short term interest rates virtually nil and bonds yielding not much more mrs watanabe the ubiquitous japanese housewife who controls the family finances has been getting more daring in her investment habits in the late 90s the metaphorical mrs watanabe invested in high risk high interest bonds issued in japan in yen by foreigners so called samurai bonds these bond issuers were not interested in raising money in yen specifically but instead issued them in japan because japanese investors are willing to accept much lower yields than are their foreign counterparts in the early 2000s as bond rates continued to decline scores of japanese women or actually middle aged japanese men based on a 2015 survey shifted to currency trading and earned a cult status across the world so much so that the bank of japan credited the trading activity by housewives stabiliz currency markets as they bought on dips and sold into rallies as reported in 2019 individuals generally make one transaction per day using margin accounts to leverage modest deposits of about 100 000 yen nz 1483 into wagers worth 10 times that amount said takuya kanda general manager of the gaitame com research institute part of the country s leading internet platform for retail investors later according to reuters traders in japan as well as south korean retirees turned to bitcoin with those same hopes of overcoming low interest rates from traditional investments and that brings us to the present or rather a financial times article from almost exactly a year ago what mrs watanabe can tell us about how to handle low returns observing the ultra low interest rates in bond markets across the developed world the authors speculate that ordinary investors in those countries now experiencing similarly low rates will respond in the same way japanese household investments have propelled at least two peaks in the yen carry trade borrowing at low rates to invest in higher yielding currencies or assets overseas this has taken mrs watanabe into the currencies of brazil and turkey and later to australia the key question is the extent to which global capital flows could also be buffeted by a notional frau muller mme dubois or signora rossi or even if ultra low rates become entrenched in the us ms johnson but again let s go back to the retirees and near retirees who according to the experts out to have the largest share of their retirement savings invested in bonds and other low risk investments as of october highly rated long term corporate bonds yield 2 7 that s considerably less than inflation shorter term bonds yield less inflation protected government bonds have had a negative real inflation adjusted return since the pandemic but hovered at near zero even before then since august of 2019 they re now at about 1 and the stock market the s p 500 had a very dramatic crash in march of 2020 to be sure but is now 40 higher than that pre pandemic high and double its low point the fundamental concepts of investing are based on balancing risk and return but is our government s policy monetary and otherwise by driving down lower risk returns trapping older investors into abandoning the advice meted out to them and obliging them to stay invested in risky assets and to what extent is this artificially keeping the stock market high in this respect the difference between mrs watanabe and mr smith is a simple one american households have a greater ability and willingness to invest in the stock market compared to japanese households who are far more likely to keep their assets in cash even though as bloomberg reported earlier this year brokerages are making new attempts to interest young adults and as s p global market intelligence reported the japanese government is planning to woo more foreign asset managers help broaden the range of investment products and improve the returns in fact in the bank of japan s most recent analysis 54 of assets held by japanese households were in the form of currency and bank deposits compared to 34 in the eurozone and a mere 13 in the us and that difference may yet be understated as the calculation methodology includes in the total insurance reserves pensions and retirement savings three sorts of funds which are in some sense owned by individuals but lack the ability for the individual to make investment decisions factoring these out which then becomes an overstatement by incorrectly including american 401 k plans where savers make their own choices and the japanese hold 78 of their financial assets in currency bank accounts compared to 54 in europe and 17 in the u s what s this mean it might be convenient to say that americans are more savvy by taking advantage of higher returns in the stock market but how many financial experts will if when the market crashes simply scold older investors who quite reasonably felt they had no choice but to stay in the stock market there are no easy answers but the effect of seemingly permanent low interest rates on older savers cannot be ignored as always you re invited to comment at janetheactuary com
dear earthtalk are environmental advocates happy with the biden administration so far b c philadelphia pa overall environmental advocates are much happier with joe biden in the white house than donald trump given his administration s interest in pursuing sustainability and climate goals indeed on day one biden wasted no time making good on several environmentally related campaign promises he signed executive orders rejoining the paris climate accord trump had pulled us out in 2017 revoking the permit for the controversial keystone xl pipeline green lighted by trump in 2017 and halting construction of trump s infamous border wall that among other things restricted the habitat range of wildlife already struggling to hang on in the drought stricken warming addled southwest while biden couldn t get everything done in a day his administration has kept its eye on the conservation ball ever since in early september biden s environmental protection agency epa announced it was restoring protections for alaska s bristol bay the trump administration had blocked those protections in a shortsighted effort to pave the way for construction of a massive gold mine threatening the world s largest sockeye salmon run as well as ecosystems for hundreds of miles around the biden administration has also proposed cancelling controversial trump era petroleum drilling leases in alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge but it s unclear whether this provision will remain in the larger congressional budget reconciliation bill it s currently tied to given potential republican backlash another big move lauded by greens just weeks ago was biden s executive order restoring bears ears and grand staircase escalante national monuments in utah to their original boundaries trump had reduced them by 80 and 50 percent respectively eco advocates also cheered biden s move to restore federal rules designed to guide environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects that the trump administration had scaled back in order to fast track construction permit approvals additionally biden has pledged to overturn trump era rollbacks of endangered species protections so as to preserve the ability of the federal government to designate lands as critical wildlife habitat regardless of their development potential while many are pleased with biden s actions so far others worry they are too little too late activists from the grassroots build back fossil free campaign which includes friends of the earth greenpeace and the center for biological diversity among others decry the biden white house for not already using executive orders to stop fossil fuel project approvals and declare a climate emergency according to a recent analysis by the research and advocacy organization oil change international biden could stop at least 24 major fossil fuel development projects with the stroke of a pen including the controversial line 3 and dakota access pipelines and save upwards of 1 6 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions the equivalent of taking all the cars and trucks off u s roads for a year we are out of time for the president to take his executive powers off the shelf says jean su energy justice director at the center for biological diversity anything less is leaving a scorched future for people and our planet contacts white house moves to restore key environmental review rules build back fossil free buildbackfossilfree org oil change international priceofoil org center for biological diversity biologicaldiversity org earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to
by salome gregory more by this author there are a few stories that offer answers to what tanzania is as it marks its 60th birthday in december a place where the possibilities right now appear bountiful in a few weeks on december 9 tanzania will celebrate its 60th independence anniversary the occasion raises the age old questions what makes tanzania tick and what are the daily struggles that define it what will come to the mind of an ordinary east african when they think of their neighbour this country that some might not be aware that it shares a border with eight states it s a geography that offers a realistic glimpse of everyday life in small town tanzania the streets kibirizi port located 2 6km from kigoma port in kigoma region gives one a realistic glimpse of everyday life in a small town in tanzania business is brisk on this sunny afternoon as traders and their customers trade in fish in the vessels anchored off the shore workers load tonnes of cargo in preparation for the journey across lake tanganyika to eastern democratic republic of congo which relies on supplies from its neighbour across the lake there is a wide variety of goods to be transported predominantly food tomatoes pineapples and soft drinks those who have been involved in this business for many years readily admit that it is a profitable venture they will also tell you how risky and sometimes dangerous it can be hashimu musa 40 who lives in katonga village in kigoma will tell you that the business of transporting goods to drc is rewarding tough trade in drc advertisement for more than six years musa was a familiar figure on the ferry to drc he specialised in selling soft drinks and tomatoes he started with a capital of tsh300 000 130 and by the time he stopped he had managed to invest his profit and is now the proud owner of three fishing boats worth tsh12 000 000 5 215 each which he is managing i travelled for years on the waters of lake tanganyika taking goods to drc it is a well paying business but very risky as it involves a lot of travelling sometimes you make losses because some people ask you to supply goods on credit said musa if you are lucky some pay after long delays but many times you have to write off such debts although he no longer traverses the lake to supply his congolese customers the business will always remain dear to musa because it brought him into contact with partners who helped him to think and plan for the future they encouraged him to expand and diversify his investments he admits that his current business brings good returns which have enabled him to send his children to good schools he has built a new house and his family is living comfortably musa wants others to enjoy his good fortune and is prepared to help them achieve their dreams that is why he is always ready to mentor other traders who are starting in the business almas juma 47 is a beneficiary of musa s mentorship for more than 10 years juma sold fruits in drc with musa s help juma has diversified his business and now hires a boat to transport passengers between the tanzanian and drc ports on both sides of lake tanganyika but it has not always smooth sailing for musa as he has had to face challenges that threatened to bring down his business three years ago he fell victim to a police crackdown on fishing boats he is one of the boat owners whose fishing equipment was seized and destroyed on accusations of using illegal nets many people who were affected died after going into depression they were unable to recover from the trauma some of my friends lost almost everything we were all taken by surprise because the nets had been inspected and approved by the tanzania bureau of standards we are still wondering what made the government to make such a decision says musa he survived but he is not out of the woods yet because one of his boats is still anchored in the dock as he tries to find money to equip it once again perhaps musa should speak to francis john who has in the past 10 years headed the fishermen s association in kigoma john says he has connected several fishermen with banks to get loans to support their businesses one of the greatest challenges affecting the fishing industry is theft thieves steal anything from vessels to engines nets and fuel john says that from february this year fishing equipment worth tsh19 800 000 8 600 has been lost i am aware that some people died in 2018 due to depression after their fishing nets were seized and destroyed nets are expensive ranging between tsh3 000 000 1 300 and tsh3 500 000 1 500 you can imagine how challenging it is to deal with such situations says john fishermen and boat operators continue to battle the challenges and john will not give up trying to help them find solutions and still hopes that the government will act to make it possible musa juma and john are a microcosm of the ordinary tanzanian s struggles and that state they are looking to as part of the solution sometimes does raise the challenge the dar es salaam rapid transit dart transport system typifies it as its most productive dart new wonder in dar it is only five years since the first phase of dart went into operation but it is now so firmly entrenched that it has become one of the identifying features of tanzania in one fell swoop the project planned to take six phases managed to sweep away a host of problems that had bedevilled the city s transport system for decades for one it eased dar s legendary traffic jams as many residents now do not have to use their vehicles opting instead for one of the 140 chinese built golden dragon buses used on dart many private car owners have switched to the transit system to go to work reserving their vehicles for social travel during weekends and the world has noticed this transformative addition to tanzania s urban landscape three years ago dar es salaam received the sustainable transport award in washington ahead of other african cities the dart project was mentioned as a major reason for the award which recognises a city that has implemented innovative sustainable transportation projects dar is the first and so far the only city in africa that has received the award the 20 times it has been given out since 2005 researcher benjamin masebo is one of the contented residents of dar he remembers the days it would take him more than three hours on the road to and from work spending a small fortune on fuel we now take a very short time i would spend up to tsh30 000 13 a day now i leave my car at home and use public transport masebo says william gitambi public relations officer at dart says the first phase built between 2012 and 2015 includes three pedestrian bridges 27 bus stations five terminals the widening of msimbazi bridge and two box culverts at jangwani valley four feeder bus stations and one depot at jangwani in april this year the government released tsh5 7 billion 2 5 million to compensate 77 residents who have been displaced to pave the way for the third phase of the project gitambi says the second phase covers 20 3 kilometres from gerezani to city council brt station it cover kawawa kilwa chang ombe gerezani street sokoine drive and bandari roads and is expected to be completed in december 2022 many struggles however remain kariakoo market the iconic kariakoo market has for many years been one of the landmarks of dar es salaam its reach extends beyond the borders of tanzania serving people in several countries of east southern and central africa any problem that affects it is bound to send shock waves in the whole region such a catastrophe happened on july 7 this year when a fire swept through the famous market many tanzanians could not help but wonder at the sheer coincidence as it was almost five years to the day when beda amuli the architect who designed the market died on july 10 2016 john saho chairman of the market committee says kariakoo has been the lifeline of many people providing them with income generating activities it accommodates traders of different financial means allowing all of them to make a living obviously the market makes a massive contribution to the economy of dar es salaam and that is why the fire was such a huge blow but the traders who depend on the market are not about to give up they are struggling to make a comeback tecla timothy who for more than seven years has been selling clothes at the market symbolises that spirit she is determined to survive her background will no doubt help her get back on her feet because she has overcome many obstacles in the past she started small and joined a women s group of 10 members they would contribute money for one another to build their business by the time the market was razed tecla owned two shops which were destroyed it was not easy surviving such a trauma i went into depression for about a month i had bank and group loans to pay every month i am still struggling to pay through another business i established recently she says she now sells shirts and bedsheets online for cash and on credit she buys her stock from uganda and the business is helping her to support her family before the fire tecla employed three people she contributed to paying the bills and was helping to build the family house while the kariakoo market folks are still licking their wounds there are sunnier headlines elsewhere tanzania s new lower middle income status in september 2018 tanzania launched its first flyover which was named after engineer patrick mfugale the new landmark in dar es salaam took two years to build using a 45 million grant from japan though not directly linked shortly afterwards in july 2020 tanzania was upgraded from low to lower middle income status on the world bank s list that year the bank defined as lower middle income economies countries with a gross national income per capita of between 1 036 and 4 045 the report from the world bank shows that tanzania is among seven countries whose status changed that year akida mnyenyelwa director of policy and advocacy at the confederation of tanzania industries says the upgrade is something to be proud of and urged experts to think of ways to utilise the opportunity for greater benefit he has called for enhanced efforts to create a friendly investment environment according to prof mwanza kamata of the university of dar as salaam the country s new status is a sign that poverty levels are finally starting to slow down and that the country is slowly approaching achievement of the sustainable development goals donald mmari executive director of the research on poverty alleviation repoa a non profit organisation says it is important for the country to find ways to maintain the status and even gain higher ranking one way he suggests is to invest more on agriculture especially because the country is endowed with large tracts of arable land agriculture can employ 65 percent of the population he says another area that needs attention is education according to mmari some african countries have dropped out of the lower middle income bracket due to lack of proper planning strategies in vital areas of their economy in the past few years tanzania has fared relatively well compared with its regional peers but economic growth has slowed significantly this has been attributed to the devastating effects of the covid 19 pandemic real gdp growth rate fell from 5 8 percent in 2019 to an estimated 2 percent in 2020 and per capita growth turned negative for the first time in more than 25 years these things often need a soundtrack and here there has been no shortage cue bongo flava over the years tanzanian music has travelled around the globe and has managed to create a new bond with other peoples there is no doubt that bongo flava beats have deepended the communion between tanzanians and other east africans on social media platforms you can tell that other east africa countries are quite taken with tanzania s bongo flava artistes in uganda and kenya tanzanian musicians pull crowds and could fill stadiums in the pre covid 19 days when social distancing protocols were not in effect isaack abeneko coordinator of the marafiki music festival says music connects people he has attended many music festivals in east africa and everywhere he goes he has felt the vibe that connects people who enjoy the power of live music abeneko a contemporary tanzanian live performer guitarist singer songwriter and choreographer mixes innovative east african melodies and afro fusion he says it is easy for artistes to connect and come out with different collaborations within a very short period of time through his music he has travelled the word and met different people he is always ready to learn from each festival he attends especially those organised by kenyan bands they are a few stories but they offer some kind of answer to what tanzania is on its 60th birthday a place where the possibilities right now appear limitless

an energy crisis in two of asia s key economies that caused power shortages sent fuel prices surging and risked slowing growth is beginning to ease though bitter winter weather will pose further challenges supplies of coal the key source of electricity generation in china and india are beginning to rise again after governments pressed miners to rapidly boost output and lifted imports allowing power plants and major industrial consumers to start rebuilding stockpiles only a handful of provinces in china are still contending with major power outages as a result of tight fuel supply down from about 20 regions in mid october while spot power prices have tumbled in india as electricity shortfalls have been addressed both countries continue to face some risks in winter supply but the shortages have moderated said xizhou zhou washington based managing director of global power and renewables at ihs markit global coal prices that had surged to records on the supply squeeze swelling profits for miners including glencore plc to china shenhua energy co have cratered in recent weeks high quality thermal coal at newcastle port in australia a benchmark in asia the region that s the largest market for the fuel have tumbled more than a third since last month thermal coal futures in china have lost almost 50 since a dramatic rise through mid october the turnaround in the region s energy supply follows a blitz of government interventions both china and india pushed state backed miners to accelerate coal output authorities in beijing have also moved to cap prices of the fuel scrap some fixed rates for electricity curb fuel exports and step up purchases of gas and diesel from overseas that race to add more fossil fuels has also focused attention on a rebound in global greenhouse gas emissions this year and on the vast challenge india and china have to overhaul their energy systems and meet emissions reductions targets they ve outlined in recent days at the united nations cop26 climate summit china s daily coal output has risen by more than 1 million tons in recent weeks to 11 67 million tons and will likely surpass a government target for production of 12 million tons a day the ramp up is exceeding expectations and meaningfully reducing a supply deficit morgan stanley analysts including sara chan said in research notes this week coal inventories at india s power stations rose to 11 2 million tons on tuesday from a low last month of 7 2 million tons major industrial consumers who had coal supply limited as authorities prioritized power stations are also seeing conditions improve metals producer vedanta s power stations had coal stocks for four to five days as of last week up from the equivalent of a single day s supply at the peak of the crisis chief executive officer sunil duggal told reporters on an earnings call power shortages have been easing said michelle leung an analyst with bloomberg intelligence everyone is ramping up their coal production the speed has been quite impressive the crisis was triggered as a post pandemic rebound in industrial activity added demand for electricity just as coal supply declined in the two top consuming nations output was crimped in india as heavy rains flooded key production hubs while china has been reducing capacity and imposed stricter safety standards that lowered production rates still there are ongoing challenges india s coal minister pralhad joshi has asked state run miner coal india ltd to ensure stocks at power plants reach an average 18 days worth of fuel by the end of this month up from six days supply as of tuesday paper producers are running with less than half their typical coal reserves according to a s mehta president of the indian paper manufacturers association and a director at jk paper ltd one of the country s largest suppliers while operations haven t been disrupted companies faced a sizable impact on costs because of the need to compete in coal india auctions or to turn to expensive imports he said in china some utilities haven t completed winter restocking and insist there s only limited additional supply available several industrial sectors that are large energy users continue to have power supply curtailed or face significantly higher electricity costs demand for heating will rise in coming days on a cold snap that could see temperatures drop by eight to 10 degrees celsius according to the nation s weather office central and eastern regions are also expected to be colder in january and february than a year ago as a result of the la nina phenomenon policy measures are mitigating the power shortage risk said lara dong ihs markit s head of greater china power and renewables research it remains to be seen whether the risk can be entirely eliminated during this winter
as we wrote in february astra s research and development capability is its great strength and the results are starting to make themselves visible in the quarter for which astra is about to report and the weeks since eight drugs have performed well in late stage clinical trials compared with a more typical two or three per quarter one a long lasting antibody covid treatment could be a blockbuster a drug that achieves 1bn in annual sales according to some analysts currently the company has eight blockbusters in all and a couple more products are not far off how much should these developments affect astra s valuation as we did in february we have sought the views of a couple of highly qualified fund managers who come from a scientific background over the past six months we have grown increasingly bullish on astrazeneca says trevor polischuk of orbimed the world s largest specialist healthcare investment firm who has a doctorate in neuropharmacology and human anatomy simply put the company s growth profile is the best of the big biopharmaceutical companies we forecast earnings growth of more than 20pc a year compared with a peer group average of less than 10pc this is despite a price to earnings ratio that is only modestly above the group average this results in a peg p e to growth ratio of less than one which is very rare in this sector the group average is 1 7 most importantly the company s growth outlook is based on innovation across a number of products and therapeutic categories which allows for a diversity of growth drivers and low concentration risk bianca ogden a former virologist who now runs the platinum international health care fund does not currently own astrazeneca but not because she thinks poorly of the company astra has done a tremendous job over the past few years everyone now sees it as the key growth story among pharma companies so expectations are high she says i owned it earlier on in its recovery and sometimes wish i still did but when we first invested it was at 30 and we sold it at 60 so it s hard to buy it now at 90 maybe i would buy it if i didn t see better prospects elsewhere in healthcare over the past six months or so a lot of the biotech companies have been in the doldrums so they offer a better risk reward trade off i get worried when i read that astra is the most widely held pharma so i ve put it on the back burner for now

the federal reserve on wednesday held its benchmark interest rate near zero despite the optimism about the economy the fed chairman jerome powell said the us central bank is nowhere near considering a rate hike with most gcc currencies kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a currency basket pegged to the us dollar the region s monetary policies will largely remain latched to the fed s and there are no compelling reasons for any divergence currently lower interest rates and a relatively subdued dollar bode well for gcc economies as these attract more investments to the region the availability of cheap funding at a time the region is in the cusp of a rapid post covid recovery is certain to boost capital expenditures by corporates and government related entities the continuing low fed rates also would checkmate the dollar s gains against other currencies in effect tame relative exchange rates of gcc currencies against other global currencies because of their peg to the dollar could make regional asset classes such as real estate and stocks attractive to foreign investors and help the prospects of sectors such as travel and tourism the continuing surge in oil prices is certain to improve the fiscal balances and external accounts of the uae and its gcc neighbours on top of that a further extension of low interest rate will work as a bonus in terms of cost and availability of funds clearly bankers will not be a very happy lot as the low interest rate environment will continue to squeeze their margins however higher lending volumes supported by improving economies would by and large offset the pressures on banks margins while the global central banks are moving in the direction of winding down monetary stimulus the recent decisions by both the fed and bank of england to hold the rates at record lows point to a very cautious approach although global economic recovery continues the momentum has been weakened by the prolonged impact of the pandemic central banks across the world are trying hard to support economic recovery however there are indications that inflation is headed north as supply chain bottlenecks and rising commodity prices are getting translated into both input and output price surge if the price trajectory inclines upwards for longer we will soon see central banks change their dovish stance

most of human history is irreparably lost to us our species homo sapiens has existed for at least 200 000 years but we have next to no idea what was happening for the majority of that time in northern spain for instance at the cave of altamira paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least 10 000 years between around 25 000 and 15 000 b c presumably a lot of dramatic events occurred during that period we have no way of knowing what most of them were this is of little consequence to most people since most people rarely think about the broad sweep of human history anyway they don t have much reason to insofar as the question comes up at all it s usually when reflecting on why the world seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly the reasons for war greed exploitation and indifference to others suffering were we always like that or did something at some point go terribly wrong one of the first people to ask this question in the modern era was the swiss french philosopher jean jacques rousseau in an essay on the origins of social inequality that he submitted to a competition in 1754 once upon a time he wrote we were hunter gatherers living in a state of childlike innocence as equals these bands of foragers could be egalitarian because they were isolated from one another and their material needs were simple according to rousseau it was only after the agricultural revolution and the rise of cities that this happy condition came to an end urban living meant the appearance of written literature science and philosophy but at the same time almost everything bad in human life patriarchy standing armies mass executions and annoying bureaucrats demanding that we spend much of our lives filling out forms rousseau lost the essay competition but the story he told went on to become a dominant narrative of human history laying the foundations upon which contemporary big history writers such as jared diamond francis fukuyama and yuval noah harari built their accounts of how our societies evolved these writers often talk about inequality as the natural result of living in larger groups with a surplus of resources for example mr harari writes in sapiens a brief history of humankind that after the advent of agriculture rulers and elites sprang up everywhere living off the peasants surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence for a long time the archaeological evidence from egypt mesopotamia china mesoamerica and elsewhere did appear to confirm this if you put enough people in one place the evidence seemed to show they would start dividing themselves into social classes you could see inequality emerge in the archaeological record with the appearance of temples and palaces presided over by rulers and their elite kinsmen and storehouses and workshops run by administrators and overseers civilization seemed to come as a package it meant misery and suffering for those who would inevitably be reduced to serfs slaves or debtors but it also allowed for the possibility of art technology and science that makes wistful pessimism about the human condition seem like common sense yes living in a truly egalitarian society might be possible if you re a pygmy or a kalahari bushman but if you want to live in a city like new york london or shanghai if you want all the good things that come with concentrations of people and resources then you have to accept the bad things too for generations such assumptions have formed part of our origin story the history we learn in school has made us more willing to tolerate a world in which some can turn their wealth into power over others while others are told their needs are not important and their lives have no intrinsic worth as a result we are more likely to believe that inequality is just an inescapable consequence of living in large complex urban technologically sophisticated societies we want to offer an entirely different account of human history we believe that much of what has been discovered in the last few decades by archaeologists and others in kindred disciplines cuts against the conventional wisdom propounded by modern big history writers what this new evidence shows is that a surprising number of the world s earliest cities were organized along robustly egalitarian lines in some regions we now know urban populations governed themselves for centuries without any indication of the temples and palaces that would later emerge in others temples and palaces never emerged at all and there is simply no evidence of a class of administrators or any other sort of ruling stratum it would seem that the mere fact of urban life does not necessarily imply any particular form of political organization and never did far from resigning us to inequality the new picture that is now emerging of humanity s deep past may open our eyes to egalitarian possibilities we otherwise would have never considered wherever cities emerged they defined a new phase of world history settlements inhabited by tens of thousands of people made their first appearance around 6 000 years ago the conventional story goes that cities developed largely because of advances in technology they were a result of the agricultural revolution which set off a chain of developments that made it possible to support large numbers of people living in one place but in fact one of the most populous early cities appeared not in eurasia with its many technical and logistical advantages but in mesoamerica which had no wheeled vehicles or sailing ships no animal powered transport and much less in the way of metallurgy or literate bureaucracy in short it s easy to overstate the importance of new technologies in setting the overall direction of change almost everywhere in these early cities we find grand self conscious statements of civic unity the arrangement of built spaces in harmonious and often beautiful patterns clearly reflecting some kind of planning at the municipal scale where we do have written sources ancient mesopotamia for example we find large groups of citizens referring to themselves simply as the people of a given city or often its sons united by devotion to its founding ancestors its gods or heroes its civic infrastructure and ritual calendar in china s shandong province urban settlements were present over a thousand years before the earliest known royal dynasties and similar findings have emerged from the maya lowlands where ceremonial centers of truly enormous size so far presenting no evidence of monarchy or stratification can now be dated back as far as 1000 b c long before the rise of classic maya kings and dynasties what held these early experiments in urbanization together if not kings soldiers and bureaucrats for answers we might turn to some other surprising discoveries on the interior grasslands of eastern europe north of the black sea where archaeologists have found cities just as large and ancient as those of mesopotamia the earliest date back to around 4100 b c while mesopotamian cities in what are now the lands of syria and iraq took form initially around temples and later also royal palaces the prehistoric cities of ukraine and moldova were startling experiments in decentralized urbanization these sites were planned on the image of a great circle or series of circles of houses with nobody first nobody last divided into districts with assembly buildings for public meetings if it all sounds a little drab or simple we should bear in mind the ecology of these early ukrainian cities living at the frontier of forest and steppe the residents were not just cereal farmers and livestock keepers but also hunted deer and wild boar imported salt flint and copper and kept gardens within the bounds of the city consuming apples pears cherries acorns hazelnuts and apricots all served on painted ceramics which are considered among the finest aesthetic creations of the prehistoric world researchers are far from unanimous about what sort of social arrangements all this required but most would agree the logistical challenges were daunting residents definitely produced a surplus and with it came ample opportunity for some of them to seize control of the stocks and supplies to lord it over the others or fight for the spoils but over eight centuries we find little evidence of warfare or the rise of social elites the true complexity of these early cities lay in the political strategies they adopted to prevent such things careful analysis by archaeologists shows how the social freedoms of the ukrainian city dwellers were maintained through processes of local decision making in households and neighborhood assemblies without any need for centralized control or top down administration yet even now these ukrainian sites almost never come up in scholarship when they do academics tend to call them mega sites rather than cities a kind of euphemism that signals to a wider audience that they should not be thought of as proper cities but as villages that for some reason had expanded inordinately in size some even refer to them outright as overgrown villages how do we account for this reluctance to welcome the ukrainian mega sites into the charmed circle of urban origins why has anyone with even a passing interest in the origin of cities heard of uruk or mohenjo daro but almost no one of taljanky or nebelivka it s hard here not to recall ursula k le guin s short story the ones who walk away from omelas about an imaginary city that also made do without kings wars slaves or secret police we have a tendency le guin notes to write off such a community as simple but in fact these citizens of omelas were not simple folk not dulcet shepherds noble savages bland utopians they were not less complex than us the trouble is just that we have a bad habit of considering happiness as something rather stupid le guin had a point obviously we have no idea how relatively happy the inhabitants of ukrainian mega sites like maidanetske or nebelivka were compared with the steppe lords who covered nearby landscapes with treasure filled mounds or even the servants ritually sacrificed at their funerals though we can guess and as anyone who has read the story knows omelas had some problems too but the point remains why do we assume that people who have figured out a way for a large population to govern and support itself without temples palaces and military fortifications that is without overt displays of arrogance and cruelty are somehow less complex than those who have not why would we hesitate to dignify such a place with the name of city the mega sites of ukraine and adjoining regions were inhabited from roughly 4100 to 3300 b c which is a considerably longer period of time than most subsequent urban settlements eventually they were abandoned we still don t know why what they offer us in the meantime is significant further proof that a highly egalitarian society has been possible on an urban scale why should these findings from the dim and distant past matter to us today since the great recession of 2008 the question of inequality and with it the long term history of inequality has become a major topic for debate something of a consensus has emerged among intellectuals and even to some degree the political classes that levels of social inequality have gotten out of hand and that most of the world s problems result in one way or another from an ever widening gulf between the haves and the have nots a very small percentage of the population controls the fates of almost everyone else and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion cities have become emblematic of our predicament whether in cape town or san francisco we are no longer shocked or even that surprised by the sight of ever expanding slums sidewalks crammed with makeshift tents or shelters overflowing with the homeless and destitute to begin reversing this trajectory is an immense task but there is historical precedent for that too around the start of the common era thousands of people came together in the valley of mexico to found a city we know today as teotihuacan within a few centuries it became the largest settlement in mesoamerica in a colossal feat of civil engineering its inhabitants diverted the san juan river to flow through the heart of their new metropolis pyramids went up in the central district associated with ritual killing what we might expect to see next is the rise of luxurious palaces for warrior rulers but the citizens of teotihuacan chose a different path around a d 300 the people of teotihuacan changed course redirecting their efforts away from the construction of grand monuments and devoting resources instead to the provision of high quality housing for the majority of residents who numbered around 100 000 of course the past cannot provide instant solutions for the crises and challenges of the present the obstacles are daunting but what our research shows is that we can no longer count the forces of history and evolution among them this has all sorts of important implications for one thing it suggests that we should be much less pessimistic about our future since the mere fact that much of the world s population now lives in cities may not determine how we live to anything like the extent we might have assumed what we need today is another urban revolution to create more just and sustainable ways of living the technology to support less centralized and greener urban environments appropriate to modern demographic realities already exists predecessors to our modern cities include not just the proto megalopolis but also the proto garden city the proto superblock and a cornucopia of other urban forms waiting for us to reclaim them in the face of inequality and climate catastrophe they offer the only viable future for the world s cities and so for our planet all we are lacking now is the political imagination to make it happen but as history teaches us the brave new world we seek to create has existed before and could exist

greg tasker special to the detroit news editor s note adam kendall and kate leese were killed in a plane crash seven days after the publication of this story here is our report st james beaver island not far from the village of wood frame buildings that hug the natural harbor of this remote mostly forested island adam kendall and kate leese have planted a couple of acres of red and white wine grapes with the dream of eventually opening a winery and tasting room here on the surface their dream might seem as far flung as this island in the northern waters of lake michigan but the couple has planted roots on a 120 acre tract deep in the woods of the island the third largest in the state their planting of 2 100 vines on a fallow field this past spring came after their own extensive research and consultations with others in michigan s flourishing wine industry it feels like a place somewhere along the road where you could stop and have a glass of wine with new friends said kate leese 35 who grew up in charlevoix a resort town across the lake about 30 miles away our goal is to have that kind of place that brings people together wine grapes have been cultivated by others on the island in the past but not for commercial use the couple says they ll be the first to bottle and sell their wine on the island as well as the mainland it s not hard to imagine that kind of operation happening here on the open lawn behind a turn of the century farmhouse the couple is restoring beyond the clearing where the young vines are sprouting from grow tubes hardwoods frame the horizon apple trees remnants of another farming era and sugar maples exploding in fiery colors dot the bucolic landscape we have wanted to plant a vineyard but it was something that we thought about doing 20 years from now in the future said leese who has a background in biochemistry and who like her husband is passionate about wine so many things came together for us in the last year those things included finding a property on beaver island after a random stop in fall 2019 in the wake of a boat trip up the northwestern michigan coastline they were ready for a more stationary existence after spending three years on the road pulling a renovated airstream around the continental united states working remotely almost immediately after we pulled into the marina here we knew this was the level of quiet we were looking for said kendall 37 a jackson native who has a background as an attorney at night there s almost complete silence here there s no light pollution you can hear every car if one goes by it s the kind of place we had been looking for as our next spot their transient life has included picking up and moving every three or four days seeking out less traveled parks and locales during that time on the road they left their former jobs and created their own company the kinetics company an emergency management consulting firm they have lived in more than 220 places and continued to travel even after finding their niche on beaver island it took them another year to secure the former farm property part of an archipelago beaver island is home to about 600 year round residents it s the kind of place where everybody knows everybody where everybody waves as they pass one another where neighbors pitch in to help one another and where everyone does what they can to help the community although thousands of visitors arrive by plane and ferry each year the 56 square mile island about twice the size of manhattan retains a sense of remoteness most businesses cater to the locals and tourists who want a slower paced vacation there are small inns and other types of lodging as well as restaurants a brewery and small shops paved roads are few and so are the amenities most tourists would find on a destination like mackinac island there s not a single fudge shop you come to the island to unplug and disconnect leese said unique challenges establishing a winery on an island in michigan especially one so far north is an anomaly in the great lakes state michigan is home to about 170 wineries most of them clustered on the peninsulas outside traverse city or in the southwest corner of the state the closest designated wine growing region tip of the mitt lies across lake michigan on the mainland stretching from just south of charlevoix to the straits farther north than other michigan wine regions the tip of the mitt faces unique challenges including colder and windier winters the grape varietals found in other parts of the state chardonnay riesling and pinot noir for example are generally not grown in the region more common are cold hardy grapes like marquette traminette and frontenac beaver island 30 miles from the mainland sits in a microclimate presenting its own set of challenges and advantages winter of course is long and cold the hope is the lingering ice around the island in the early spring will keep the vines dormant the warmer and longer than usual fall because of the surrounding warmer water will help grapes ripen a breeze blows constantly helping keep mildew and mold at bay cloud cover is minimal offering lots of sunny days throughout the growing season i don t think beaver island would be colder than petoskey or minnesota said paolo sabbatini an associate professor of horticulture at michigan state university referencing the planting of cold hardy grapes that have fared well in those regions if they use super hardy hybrid grapes i think they will have a good chance to produce grapes on the island instead cultivating cold tender vinifera could be problematic because of the bitter winter he says noting however that there are techniques to protect the vines in the winter including burying vine canes underground to provide insulation extreme and persistent freezes during winter months can damage or destroy vines in moderate winters the lake effect snow blankets the vines protecting them or they need to be protected by the soil it s like a blanket to protect the vines it s a technique used in a lot of places around the world and also in michigan especially in the southwest he says i wish them the best of luck it s a very cool idea in a very beautiful place experimenting with different root stock and clones the couple has planted cabernet franc pinot noir riesling traminette and noiret as well as zweigelt an austrian grape and pinotage a grape from south africa to name a few their hopes for pinotage a grape not common in michigan are buoyed by an ohio state university study that showed the grape to have a higher annual freezing tolerance there are other elements in their favor the top of their soil was laden with high levels of organic matter the property is a mix of clay sand and limestone nitrogen and ph levels are perfect for grape growing the couple says we are trying to push the boundaries of what might grow here said kendall who has experimented with making wine and ginger beer even while on the road the devil is in the details harvesting of course is a few years away it takes three to four years for vines to mature the couple clipped the vine flowers in the spring and will continue to do so over the next few years to strengthen the plants roots an unexpected late spring frost did cause some vine damage but most of the plants are showing promise the devil is in the details when it comes to wine said douglas olson a winemaker and viticulturist who works with wineries on the old mission and leelanau peninsulas outside traverse city when you taste a great wine that is a very well calculated process all the details were covered to their greatest extent he s referring to such details as soil makeup weather patterns historical data and planting the right grapes really matching what is best for your site cover those details in the beginning stages of a vineyard and you ll be able to reap the reward of that he said the story behind this is fascinating if you were to jump forward if you could get a product out there and have someone in new york or chicago taste a pinot noir grown on an island in lake michigan that s got to be the coolest bottle of wine you could have in your cellar a lot of people would geek out about that but it s got to be a good wine to begin with kendall and leese will trellis the vines in the spring and evaluate their success with their initial planting more vines will be planted their goal is to cultivate six acres production buildings and a tasting room will be built eventually they already have a name antho vineyards a reference to the first sign of color change in red varietals we re not going to be a big winery that s not our goal said kendall who hopes to produce about 1 200 cases of wine per year and export to the mainland we re focused on quality from this particular piece of land even if that means lower volume the road ahead is long but the once nomadic couple is committed their airstream transported by barge to the island and equipped with a wood burning stove rests not far from the vineyard it s their home as they renovate the farmhouse we ve been addicted to change for a good part of our lives leese said during the pandemic all our work travel stopped for the most part our travels these days are to the outer islands it means we can be in the vineyards morning and night it ll be nice to see the vines change and to watch them grow

as the nature of politics and conflict evolves with emerging technology a new buzzword has entered the lexicon of planners and strategists worldwide hybrid warfare also labeled as fifth generation warfare by some is a concept borne out of the blurring of lines between war and peace in a landscape dominated by sophisticated information and communication tools and techniques in hybrid scenarios war is no longer declared it is instead a seemingly perpetual and ever evolving process that can involve economic manipulation diplomatic pressure media propaganda proxies and insurgencies cyber attacks and the managing of a nation s civilian populace in this new war fighting concept information technology becomes the prime weapon as adversaries look for options to pursue strategic ends just below the threshold of traditional armed conflict for russian general valery gerasimov hybrid warfare combines military activities with the protest potential of the populations in his article the value of science is in the foresight he writes that military conflicts that utilise principles of hybrid warfare confirm that a perfectly thriving state can in a matter of months and even days be transformed into an arena of fierce armed conflict and sink into a web of chaos humanitarian catastrophe and civil war but even as the concept garners excitement it is as yet ill defined in the realm of conflict studies referring to the use of all manners of unconventional methods as part of a multi domain war fighting approach these methods aim to disrupt and disable an opponent s actions without engaging in open hostilities prompting some experts to also call it grey zone warfare the strategy in building capacity projecting a soft image may have remained vital throughout most of history but for quaid e azam university assistant professor dr muhammad nadeem mirza its importance enhanced since the start of war on terror especially for the states with a muslim majority pakistan s adversaries have been trying for a long time to exploit the cleavages economic political ethnic social civil military provincial and sectarian within our society he said adding that political instability has further exacerbated the situation he pointed to the rampant use of fake news by pakistan s adversaries in order to sow the seeds of discord within its society and distort the state s image abroad eu disinfo lab s report about indian involvement in distorting pakistan image spreading fake news about it and efforts to impact the mindset of general populace in several states underscores the clear intentions of pakistan s adversaries to isolate it and present it as an irresponsible state which cannot be trusted upon dr nadeem explained india has been involved in hybrid warfare against pakistan for the last 15 years said a phd scholar at quaid e azam university islamabad who specialises in hybrid warfare and requested not to be named he identified four areas that are mainly being targeted the civilian population religious minorities ethnic groups and media particularly social media are being exploited the scholar pointed out on a question regarding the media s role in hybrid scenarios he said that information is a currency in fifth generation warfare and the entire world system runs over it information technology particularly digital technology is the centre point of attention for pakistan s adversaries though legacy media has an editorial policy and control over dissemination of fake news the scholar noted that social media is a factory for generating fake news that dominates the information system a single piece of fake news has the potential to crash any country s stock market not to mention seriously dent its soft identity one expert maintained it is not a war which is fought on borders but a war of capacity to use or misuse information technology against adversaries pre eminent senior journalist muhammad ziauddin shared adding that the state that holds command over information technology wins this war in hybrid scenarios there is a need to realise that you cannot deny the technological superiority of your adversary what you can do is to enhance your own technological capacity to counter or attack it he explained vibrant media hybrid scenarios while there has been concern that an independent media creates space for hostile forces to implement their agenda against pakistan and sabotage its image abroad media practitioners insist that an independent and powerful media is strategically important to mitigate potential threats of hybrid warfare to the country s political diplomatic economic and security interests an anchor and security analyst based in islamabad said an independent and vibrant media is vital for any democratic society to promote its soft identity with the advent of social media it has become even more important to support an independent media he stressed only an independent media can deal with the hybrid threats more effectively by bringing facts to the public also we need to be careful in differentiating between a genuine critique and fake news authorities seem to now even view objective criticism through the lens of hybrid warfare or consider it as fake news this is something we must avoid he added according to the analyst the proposed pakistan media development authority pmda is nothing but an attempt to suppress independent media the government through this proposed media regulator in reality wants to strike at its critics he argued therefore if it comes into effect the proposed media regulatory body would be detrimental for the freedom of press in pakistan a weak and vulnerable media cannot effectively deal with hybrid warfare only a credible and independent media can deal with such threats more robustly there is no point to put extra burden on the media on the pretext of mitigating hybrid threats said senior journalist m ziauddin adding that it is an attempt to restrict media against exposing their wrongdoings he said the state actors should understand that the real issue is not the media but our lack of information technology capacity as well as fake news they should understand that there was no role of media in the recent hacking of the fbr website and an attempt of hacking prime minister imran khan s mobile phone but our technological vulnerability against adversaries he pointed out our history tells us that when there is a war media definitely goes with the state but there should be a red line between what is in the state s or state actors interest because exposing state actors mistakes is a media responsibility m ziauddin added another journalist who covers cross border conflict said the media s role is to report all pros and cons of society or state because highlighting both aspects is essential for development now the question is how those reports are misused by hostile countries to damage any country s image it is the state s responsibility to evolve a strategy to counter the efforts of hostile forces instead of telling the media to not report he insisted it is clear the term hybrid war itself is sometimes misused by states that lack vision to curb media freedom the power of culture culture encompasses all stratums of the society as well as having interlinks with almost everything from environment to education health to basic facilities business to technological development politics to governance and from heritage and interfaith harmony said anum farooq an international educational practitioner and artist based in the uk it would almost be impossible to find an aspect which is not related to culture thus it is imperative that an accurate portrayal of pakistan s soft image is communicated globally she said if we think of the vast heritage and rich culture of pakistan these aspects are really magnificent to establish our soft identity abroad but not a lot in the international community know about it she pointed out the uk based educationist and artist says it is imperative that pakistan takes charge of the reins and show on the global stage what truly encompasses the heart of pakistani national culture adding that the media role in this regard has a great significance in the modern world many nations succeed due to their soft image she added if we think of the leading states of arts culture academia innovation and forward thinking zeitgeists what countries would you think of canada usa and british etc have you ever thought about why primarily it will boil down to their soft image furthermore the strengthening of pakistani culture as well as empowerment through it needs to be key the voices of children and young people are indispensable and are crucial for future strategies anum stressed nifth executive director talha ali kushvaha says strategic importance of media in building pakistan s soft image cannot be denied whoever controls the media controls minds and this is what countries in the world including india is doing if a country like india involved in serious human rights violations not only in jammu and kashmir but in many other indian states could establish its soft identity through its cultural industry why not pakistan which is blessed not only with rich culture and ancient heritage but tourism potential the nifth executive director said the collapse of the health system during the first wave of the covid 19 pandemic has badly exposed the indian governing system but yet the world doesn t comment much about it because it is heavily investing in its cultural industry to capture the world s minds it has reserved its entire rajasthan region for cultural promotion he observed inflation unemployment and social ills are grave in india but yet they are known as a democratic country with a huge potential industry because they have linked up their identity with their old culture and heritage as well as established themselves as custodian of the sub continent culture and heritage pakistan and indian both got independence in 1947 but they have succeeded to build a narrative that pakistan broke the sub continent into parts and forced pakistan to take defensive positions talha said the world is in a state of cultural disaster including pakistan and everything is being done through proper planning there is a need to identify all inclusive and utilize pakistan s real potential which is its youth what pakistan needs to do is to strengthen national narrative and improve communication and technological skills and capabilities to mitigate hybrid threats the pangs of national identity religious freedom has always been jeopardised and under threat in pakistan and that s why we are not able to promote a soft image of the country abroad said peter jacob human rights activist based in lahore we need to work a lot as a country as a society to be able to exercise that soft power that pakistan deserves to build as a country of this size and magnitude and gdp deserves a better place jacob added following these characteristics our flag deserves more respect and prestige in the international community the human rights activist said in modern day states very much rely on soft power that they enjoy besides the hard power the soft power is about how much not only prestige you enjoy but also alliances you can make and enjoy the diversity of those alliances because international trade has to be diverse in most of the countries this soft power is somehow affected and impacted by the kind of impression that a country carries about its education value system practices rule of law its heritance to human rights and protection of the vulnerable communities so whereas pakistan because of history however doesn t enjoy a good reputation on several things be it its banking scams be it money laundering be it performance on international commitments and that is why the development indicators that international organizations collect pakistan is not placed at its very good ranks as far as religious discriminations is concerned of course every country is being scrutinized nowadays whether it media and international forums wherever it is expressed because it ranks those countries the people at large for instance visit a country at large during and for tourism pakistan is one of the countries striving to attract tourists from abroad so these things constitute soft power including the liberty that you feel on the streets of the country their liberty to dining out laugh and sing those things are subject to their freedom following these characteristics our flag deserves more respect and prestige in the international community peter jacob maintained the point of attention the future of the inter faith relations will be very much characterized by the justice system because the minorities in this country are too small and they are unable to form a formidable response to any injustices so it has to be the state and majority people who will have to take the initiative to make this relationship even and fruitful and result oriented that people belonging to minorities communities can show their talents and can use their full potential to contribute to the society and national economy peter pointed out it is to mention here that the supreme court of pakistan in a suo moto case in june 2014 on a letter received from a non governmental organization regarding attack on a church in peshawar in which 81 persons died had ordered federal and provincial governments to take measures in the following areas seven years have passed since the sc passed the orders but yet only few percent works could be done in this regard this correspondent in order to get update on the establishment of special police taskforce spt for the protection of the worship places of the religious minorities approached the federal and all provincial ig offices under the respective right to information laws none of the ig offices except ig office sindh responded to the information requests under the rti law according to the documents received from the ig office sindh the summary for funds has been pending in the provincial finance department for many months and when it gets approval the measures will be taken in this regard dos and don ts experts in different fields are in consensus that states across the world adopt strategies to mitigate implications of hybrid threats and pakistan needs too however they think that the use of the media as the first defence line is dangerous and would leave long term implications on pakistan s image in the world a phd scholar specializing in hybrid warfare at qau islamabad said the state should remain vigilant for hybrid threats but it should prepare itself for the potential challenges the advent of artificial intelligence and bio technology is likely to bring in the next few years dr muhammad nadeem mirza assistance professor qau says it is important now that pakistan should adopt a proactive approach in order to address the issue and try to match its adversaries in projecting its soft image while at the same time countering their nefarious designs through empowering its media industry the first step in that direction would be to put your own house in order and address the cleavages within the society he suggested senior journalist m ziauddin said there is a need to understand that not every criticism is a result of external factors but of internal wrongdoings and discrepancies the state actors involved in evolving strategies should have to take the media in confidence and have confidence in media to mitigate challenges of transformed media he said if something get published critically it doesn t mean that every criticism is planted by adversaries but they need to introspect the state instead of curbing media independence should keep the media on their right side it should engage media practitioners and policy makers through regular briefing on the evolving security environment rather than pushing them against the wall m ziauddin suggested it will be our failure if the state uses the media as a front defence line the thought that the state can mitigate the challenges of hybrid warfare through a controlled and vulnerable media is harmful to the state media can be a factor but it cannot be used as the first defence line the senior journalist maintained there are two propaganda tools that are important in modern days education and media nifth executive director talha ali kushvaha said if we want to utilize media with its true potential to expose the malicious design of adversaries against pakistan we need to employ media experts to propagate pakistan s perspective in the world he said that we need the most sophisticated media regulatory body with qualified media actors to spread pakistan s narrative to the world rather than increasing media vulnerability through strict policing and regulations

okay so most of the time i m more or less against the idea of writing in the first person for any reason in a journalistic context majoring in journalism tends to do that to you but i ve just stumbled upon a news article that has implications not just for petrolheads like you and i but also for the rest of the world photo google creative commons fair use electric vehicle ev photo google creative commons fair use the article in question comes to us from the home website of nasdaq the second largest american born stock exchange in the world so to say when nasdaq publishes an article telling you to invest in a specific industry investors tend to listen before starting it s worth mentioning that this nasdaq article was written for stock investors not car enthusiasts more than a few times it occurred to me that it may be best to just stay in my lane and avoid the topic altogether the reason i decided against doing so ultimately came down to the fact that investor funding has a direct impact on what cars do and don t get manufactured it s a phenomenon that directly impacts the choices of cars you or i are able to drive therefore this is absolutely something worthwhile that said i couldn t help but be surprised when this article was titled oil is back over 80 time to buy exxonmobil perhaps never before in online news media has there been so much to unpack in around 17 syllables but let s try just for a laugh first of all why in the middle of a near global energy crisis and oil coming in at around 80 per barrel of crude would the average joe investing in crude oil be an intelligent idea and why exxonmobil specifically well the answer involves an understanding of a complex global economy and more than a little 4 d chess playing being car enthusiasts we know more than enough about the worldwide microchip shortage as it happens the same forces involved in starting that shortage impacts every facet of the manufacturing industry including petrochemicals we aren t able to have a one on one dialogue with the author of this particular nasdaq article still we can at least infer that they expect the production of petroleum products to eventually once again meet the demand it saw in the days before the global health crisis 18 months or so ago but what has me scratching my head especially and as we all know as car enthusiasts is why they ve failed to take the currentrevolution well actually nasdaq hasn t left out s at all it s also worth mentioning that there aren t any factual inaccuracies in the article s data either instead where the error in their thinking occurs at least in my mind is the magnitude with which the all electric revolution is changing the world of motoring right this very second to quote directly from the source material climate change and its attendant need to abandon fossil fuels do not appear to be hurting exxon s stock price in a world that remains thirsty for oil now granted even just five years ago god that feels like an eternity now that quote would have been 100 correct but this isn t 2016 this is the 2020s and times are changing fast evidently a lot faster than stock exchangers so high in their ivory towers that they can t even see the ground anymore if the world is still so hopelessly dependant on oil then why did ford recently announce they d be investing 11 billion in alternative energy infrastructure what about toyota who s announced they d invest as much as 13 6 billion we could go on and on all day long but the point is as we car enthusiasts have known for quite some time now evs are a lot closer to making companies like exxonmobil and chevron sweat a lot more than they may be right now don t believe me maybe look at tesla s latest market capitalization numbers and get back to me as gearheads it hasn t been easy to accept alternative power sources for our cars if there s anyone who loves things that burn oil more than petrochemical companies it s muscle car fans with their big block v8 motors even so for the most part the average car enthusiast has already begrudgingly conceded the fact that it s electric cars not gas or diesel that s going to be the path forward for humanity and to that effect even autonomous vehicles as well if american car culture that stereotypically drags their heels on any change in automotive tech is faster to adapt than one of the world s most trusted stock exchanges i think it reveals deep seated issues with our society that spans way way beyond just petrolheads that s without opening the can of worms regarding exxonmobil and chevron s latest legal catastrophes and how so often both companies manage to make legal troubles disappear so to speak so then as a moral decision and maybe even a financial one investing in a company like exxonmobil is probably not a very good idea stock trading is generally a long term occupation for as many legal snafus as the world s biggest oil firms find themselves in lately there s no guarantee that there s enough time to sell your shares before the next scandal potentially brings the whole thing crumbling down it might be best then to just save your pennies and buy that aftermarket do hickey for your car at autozone instead it might end up being a safer investment in the auto industry than exxonmobil stock one day at the end of the day deciding whether investing in exxonmobil is a good or bad idea

my husband went to france and all i got was this lousy head cold ok there may have been a few regional cheeses a real roquefort a pyrenees sheep s milk cheese and a wee wedge of an aged raw cow s milk tomme that made their way back to brunswick from his speaking gig in toulouse the cheese was delicious but this head cold is killer he bears the blame for bringing the first head cold in 20 months into our home because he had it first his symptoms appeared within a day of his toulouse amsterdam jfk pwm fight sequence landing him back in maine we knew it was only a head cold because he tested negative for covid before he left france and a couple of days after he landed stateside he was at the tail end of his travail the lingering cough and bouts of sneezing stage when i d just started to feel under the weather it began with a scratchy throat i treated that minor annoyance with a new england distillery gunpowder rye hot toddy sweetened with honey from my own bees that was both tasty and helped me nod off that night but in the following days the sore throat blossomed into laryngitis and the virus stuffed my sinuses so full i wished my face would pop at the height of it all i emailed my editor to ask about taking the week off from writing my column she was willing but then i decided i was made of heartier stuff besides i work almost entirely remotely so there was no chance of me giving this cold to anyone else plus i had a couple of containers of the good stuff in the deep freeze in the basement clear deeply golden chicken broth if you ve read this column for a while you know i am always giving advice about using a stockpot to suck every drop of flavor out of any animal vegetable or mineral that makes its way into your kitchen i ve told you to make stock from vegetable scraps lobster bodies and corn cobs pea pods parmesan rinds fish bones stewing hens chicken feet seaweed and duck carcasses advertisement these broths and stocks are mostly made from leftovers they are delicious but the good stuff is killer that s due to the care with which i select the raw ingredients 3 raw pasture raised chicken backs 2 chopped and washed local leeks 2 peeled and finely chopped yellow carrots 1 trimmed and finely chopped fennel bulb and a bunch of fresh thyme tied with a piece of kitchen twine the clarity of the broth comes by very very gently coaxing the flavors out of these ingredients so they combine in a liquid worthy of my sickbed sippy cup yes i make this broth for the sole purpose of drinking it while i or my kids or my friends are well under the weather to get it just right from the start rinse and dry the backs and sauté them in a bit of schmaltz or vegetable oil don t skip this step because browning the bones both adds color those golden brown bits tinge the finished product a deep yellow and clarity cooking meat proteins at this point helps keep them from coagulating into a cloudy broth remove the bones and slowly sweat the vegetables next this step contributes sweetness to the broth return the browned backs to the pot add enough cold water to just cover them and toss in the bundled thyme at no point in this entire process should the heat under the pot be any higher than low making the good stuff takes time at least four six is better eight is best hours on the stove never should the mixture boil or even simmer for that matter in her book olives and oranges recipes flavor secrets from italy spain cyprus beyond rockport chef sarah jenkins writes that when making a rich stock a few bubbles should just barely rise slowly from the bottom of the liquid every few minutes take her advice when the bubbling every few minutes time is up remove the pan from the stove and strain the broth cool it then refrigerate overnight strain the broth again this time through four layers of cheese cloth now you have the good stuff freeze it in eight ounce containers until you need it it will keep in the freezer for up to six months advertisement i make no claims that the good stuff is a miracle cure for the common cold but i can attest to it taking the edge off along the road to recovery from any cold you might catch

cold as i tried to lubricate my larynx with cough drops the gentleman seated across from me suggested a slice of raw ginger instead explaining that if i held it there between my tongue and the roof of my mouth i would be roaring like a proud lioness in no time it is in his honor that i add a slice of ginger to this cold symptom remedy makes 1 cup 8 ounces of your best clearest chicken broth 1 1 8 inch slice fresh gingerroot 2 small sprigs of thyme 1 slice of lemon pinch of salt combine all the ingredients in a small pot over low heat gently warm the liquid for 5 minutes pour the entire

there s a common misperception that medicaid is only for poor and low income seniors but actually with a little proper and thoughtful estate planning all but the very wealthiest people can often qualify for program benefits in 1965 congress established the medicare program to enhance insurance coverage and ensure greater financial solvency for seniors regardless of income current health status or past medical history at the same time they outlined parameters for medicaid a state managed means based program to provide additional coverage to low income and disabled individuals and families unlike medicare however medicaid is not a federally run program operating within broad federal guidelines each individual state decides its own medicaid eligibility criteria eligible coverage

free e newsletters profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing taxes retirement personal finance and more straight to your e mail profit and prosper with the best of expert advice straight to your e mail sign up what makes the medicaid program especially attractive however is its ability to cover long term nursing home care costs and many home health care costs things not covered by medicare imagine working saving and investing over a lifetime only to see your wealth quickly wiped out by the costs of long term care assets that otherwise could provide a meaningful legacy to your family strategies to meet income requirements given both the cost and growing need for long term care medicaid has become a highly prized benefit providing coverage for long term nursing care as well as many home health services but the current income limit for medicaid waivers in most but not all states is 2 382 month 28 584 per year per individual if your income exceeds your state s medicaid eligibility threshold there are two commonly used trusts that can be used to divert excess income in order to maintain your program eligibility qualified income trusts qits also known as a miller trust this is an irrevocable trust into which your income is deposited and subsequently controlled by a trustee whom you select there are very tight restrictions on what the income placed in the trust can be used for e g both a personal and if applicable a spousal needs allowance as well as any medical care costs including the cost of private health insurance premiums but because the funds are legally owned by the trust rather than you individually they no longer count against your medicaid income eligibility also known as a miller trust this is an irrevocable trust into which your income is deposited and subsequently controlled by a trustee whom you select there are very tight restrictions on what the income placed in the trust can be used for e g both a personal and if applicable a spousal needs allowance as well as any medical care costs including the cost of private health insurance premiums but because the funds are legally owned by the trust rather than you individually they no longer count against your medicaid income eligibility pooled income trusts similar to qits these are irrevocable trusts into which your surplus income can be diverted to maintain medicaid eligibility in order to take advantage of a pooled income trust however you must qualify as disabled your income is pooled together with the income of others and managed by a non profit charitable organization that acts as trustee and makes monthly disbursements to pay expenses on behalf of the individuals for whom the trust was created any funds remaining in the trust upon your death are then used to help other disabled persons in the trust essentially these income trusts are specifically designed to create a legal pathway to medicaid eligibility for those with too much income to qualify for assistance but not enough wealth to pay for the rising cost of much needed care strategies to meet asset requirements like income limitations the medicaid asset test is complicated and varies from state to state generally your home s value up to a maximum amount is exempt as long as you still live there or intend to return beyond that however most states require you to spend down other assets to around 2 000 person 4 000 married couple to qualify you could choose to simply transfer ownership of your assets to other family members but that introduces a number of new risks from losing those assets as a result of that person getting divorced experiencing a bankruptcy lawsuit or dying before you plus you re relying on that individual to be both trustworthy and financially prudent and it s not as simple as it sounds considering medicaid s five year look back period more on that in a bit alternatively you may want to consider asset protection trusts you can transfer most or all of your assets to a trust which if properly designed removes those assets from your estate often referred to as medicaid trusts these asset protection structures can help you not only to qualify for medicaid benefits but also protects your assets from other potential creditors if income generating assets like stocks and bonds are placed in the trust you can choose to still receive the income from those assets you can even transfer your home to the trust and retain the right to live in it for the duration of your life then upon your death the assets will be distributed to your beneficiaries according to the trust documents what s more beneficiaries will enjoy a step up in basis on any trust assets when they receive them avoiding capital gains on the increase in value accrued during your life you can transfer most or all of your assets to a trust which if properly designed removes those assets from your estate often referred to as medicaid trusts these asset protection structures can help you not only to qualify for medicaid benefits but also protects your assets from other potential creditors if income generating assets like stocks and bonds are placed in the trust you can choose to still receive the income from those assets you can even transfer your home to the trust and retain the right to live in it for the duration of your life then upon your death the assets will be distributed to your beneficiaries according to the trust documents what s more beneficiaries will enjoy a step up in basis on any trust assets when they receive them avoiding capital gains on the increase in value accrued during your life spousal transfers and refusals medicaid laws permit the transfer of assets between spouses without being subject to the five year look back period or any penalties married couples therefore can transfer any assets in the name of the spouse who needs care to the other spouse a few states e g new york and florida even permit something called spousal refusal where the healthy spouse can legally refuse to provide support for the spouse needing care making them immediately eligible for medicaid services while medicaid does have a right to request that a healthy spouse financially contribute to a spouse who s receiving care they sometimes opt not to go through the required legal action to seek payment even if they do they re generally willing to significantly discount the cost of services so this could prove an effective strategy one other option you might want to consider for reducing your countable assets is the establishment of an irrevocable funeral trust which allows both you and your spouse to prepay funeral and burial expenses some very wealthy couples even opt to pursue a medicaid divorce where the couple legally divorces solely for the purposes of protecting their assets for the healthy spouse why planning well in advance matters it s never too late to begin creating a health care plan but like all planning the more time you have the more flexibility you ll have and the easier it will be medicare employs a five year look back period when investigating an applicant s finances transfers of certain assets made less than five years before you require home care or enter a nursing home or assisting living facility may be disallowed this means for medicaid purposes you ll still be deemed to own them and required to spend them down before qualifying for program coverage and transfers to a trust just like transfers to individuals are still subject to this look back period keep in mind that medicaid gives you little to no choice regarding where you receive care only facilities with medicaid approved beds can accept you and your ability to remain in your own home when receiving care decreases since many states only cover limited home health care services through their medicaid programs so it s a good idea to sit down with your financial adviser to carefully explore your various long term care insurance options before deciding on a strategy thirty states and the district of columbia offer state tax incentives to residents who purchase long term care insurance policies and almost all states participate in the long term care partnership program which allows people who ve purchased long term care insurance to qualify for medicaid while preserving some of their assets

last year the united states signed into law 5 500 pages of legislation most of which dealt with economic stimulus but it dealt with something else too ufos the revelations have explosive implications that will cause us to reexamine our scientific paradigms of human origins where do we come from this is probably the most fundamental question within the human condition and to even attempt answering it we must explore the origin of all life on earth the legislation contained the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2021 in the committee comment section is a heading entitled advanced aerial threats the provision mandates that the director of national intelligence collaborate with the secretary of defense to forge a detailed report the so called ufo report which discloses everything the government knows about unidentified flying objects ufos a moniker they have now discarded in favor of others such as unidentified aerial phenomena uap or anomalous aerial vehicles aav in 2020 the u s navy confirmed that three videos circulating the internet were indeed authentic and were captured by navy jet pilots pentagon spokeswoman sue gough admitted that the images of the rapid moving glowing vehicles one sphere shaped another acorn shaped a metallic blimp and many others were being studied by the newly formed unidentified aerial phenomena task force uaptf abiogenesis and the origin of life of earth abiogenesis is the prevailing although highly speculative and controversial narrative about how life originated on earth essentially this theory holds that over millions of years of primordial evolutionary processes non living matter transitioned into living cells then simple cellular life forms gradually began to develop via natural selection and after epochs of competition driven genetic mutation adaptation a myriad of biodiverse species were born this theory has been propped up since the 1950s as scientific fact and proponents of it point to a series of experiments from the 50s in which some amino acids were successfully synthesized from inorganic compounds the problem is some amino acids are not remotely equivalent to the proteins required to constitute even the most basic cellular life and then even these proteins fall far short of the wondrous complexity that is a living cell in fact the more molecular biotechnology advances so to does our understanding of how incredibly complex cells are directed panspermia is the theory that an intelligent species intentionally inoculated our planet to stimulate the development of life iweta0077 adobe stock panspermia and directed panspermia alternative origin of life theories alternatively the theory of panspermia holds that life arose elsewhere in the universe through unspecified processes and was then spread to planet earth by a medium like an asteroid comet meteorite or space dust modern definitive studies have concluded that complex organic molecules exist within this solar system and in interstellar space it is then quite probable that these fundamental building blocks of life arrived here by way of these mechanisms directed panspermia on the other hand can be defined as the deliberate transportation of complex organic life through space with the goal of introducing species onto lifeless but habitable astronomical objects in other words an intelligent species utilizing high technology intentionally inoculating planets or moons in order to stimulate the development of life this is not science fiction highly acclaimed world renowned scientists like francis crick leslie orgel sydney brenner and many others endorse this theory and published extensive studies on the subject it s worth mentioning that brenner shared a nobel prize for his work on deciphering the genetic code and that francis crick along with james watson discovered the dna helix won the nobel prize and gave birth to genetic science as we know it darwinian and definition of life disclaimers it s important to point out that life itself is not easily defined there are hundreds of definitions and in some cases entire chapters have been exclusively devoted to defining this fundamental word concept according to modern biologists jane reece and neil campbell the phenomenon we call life defies a simple one sentence definition the definition preferred by nasa is that life is a self sustaining chemical system capable of darwinian evolution in other words life is matter that can reproduce itself and evolve as survival dictates this brings us to charles darwin the favoring of directed or undirected panspermia should not be misinterpreted of a revolt against the concept of darwinian evolution unfortunately darwinian evolution has accumulated a great deal of connotations and assumptions which intertwine the origins of life alongside the process by which life adapts to its environment it is commonly believed that darwin s origin of species is well established scientific fact the process of evolution meaning the natural selection driven genetic mutations adaptations is well established science however this process as the origin of all life is not at all scientific fact additionally there s strong evidence in modern studies of molecular biology that the competitive nature of this process has been overestimated and that the process may be much more symbiotic while darwin s origin of species is held as well established scientific fact the process of evolution as the origin of all life is not mario breda adobe stock the dawn of man evolutionary theory of man genetic studies literature indicates that primates diverged from mammals about 85 million years ago then the various great ape subfamilies diverged around 15 to 20 million years ago from there it is speculated that a locomotion transition to bipedalism occurred about six to seven million years ago this theoretical transition enabled the earliest human ancestors to migrate throughout the globe however some anthropologists studying the development of bipedalism have stated that this evolution in gait alone could not have sufficiently empowered these primates to fan out around the world these professionals have found that bipedalism tool construction and the manipulation of fire would have be necessary to achieve spread of human ancestors it is further believed by the leading authorities that these advancements then triggered rapid encephalization perpetual brain growth beginning around two million years ago finally we have archaic and modern humans emerging from a complicated tree of interbreeding hominin species around 400 000 200 000 years ago the so called ancient astronaut hypothesis ancient greek thinkers like plato pythagoras and many others wrote in great detail about how the deities of mythology were real had initiated the natural processes as well as inoculated the planet with life of course these ideas came after thousands of years of paradigmatic belief in pantheons of deities as the creators of humanity and the world these religious paradigms were largely relegated to mere tradition with the rise of darwinism and the industrial revolution there exists a centuries old ideological death match between religious and scientific worldviews which took hold during the renaissance when roman church authorities responded to scientific explorations by condemning them and their ideas under the threat of death and excommunication in the mid twentieth century authors of alternative history began publishing books about out of place artifacts and thereby popularized a fusion of science and mythology that has become known as the ancient astronaut hypothesis this concept asserts that the deities of ancient mythology were actually intelligent non human species who utilized advanced technology to establish life on earth and bequeathed the arts and sciences of civilization to humanity in the distant past this mainstream popularization was fueled in part by an ever growing collection of sightings by people across the world of anomalous aerial phenomena and by the progress made in aerospace related fields the ancient astronaut hypothesis posits that the deities of ancient mythology were intelligent non human species who came to humanity in the distant past danielegay adobe stock the heresy of believing in otherworldly deities a deity can be defined as a supernatural being that has the capability of influencing the forces of nature observes humanity and periodically intervenes in the affairs of human beings it s interesting that by this definition an elder species that observes and occasionally interacts with human civilization is well within the parameters of scientific probability even with countless sightings physical evidence of high tech in ancient times and the postulations of great thinkers like crick newton einstein tesla pythagoras plato the notion that such deities or elder life forms are at least intermittently present and observing mankind s civilization is often met by vitriolic ridicule and skepticism most of the opponents of this concept whether they re aware of it or not are incited by flawed reasoning intravenously fed into their consciousness by darwinian evolutionist zealots who themselves are guilty of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance if not outright scientific misconduct these authorities were much chagrined by the work of dr francis crick and his colleagues as his intellectual prowess was and is beyond reproach due to his and watson s discovery of the dna helix they the oligarchic authorities regard these theories as heresy tragically ironic and this is why even to this day the mainstream public is mostly unaware of them aavs and the advanced aerospace threat identification program in a televised interview with cbs correspondents the republican us senator marco rubio r fla who at the time was the vice chair of the intelligence committee explained that the bottom line is these things are flying over your military bases and you don t know what they are because they aren t yours and they are exhibiting potentially technologies that you don t have at your disposal that to me is a national security risk and one that we should be looking into in public statements such as this state officials are approaching the subject as if these could potentially be foreign adversaries who have made secret technological leaps they re also acting as if the u s military hasn t been studying these phenomena for years they have created in 2007 and dissolved in 2012 the advanced aerospace threat identification program was uncovered in 2017 it was run by intelligence official louis elizondo who publicly called for disclosure of the project s findings the program was then succeeded by the unidentified aerial phenomena task force uaptf in 2020 under the umbrella of the u s department of defense while existence of the project has been made public its findings and those of previous programs are still classified hopefully some of the information which has been financed by taxpayers will come to light with the report due to come out 1 june 2021 in 2017 hawaiian astronomers discovered the first ever interstellar object as it passed through our solar system and they named it oumuamua which means messenger from the distant past nagualdesign cc by sa 4 0 harvard s top astronomer and oumuamua in late 2017 hawaiian astronomers discovered the first ever interstellar object as it passed through our solar system they named it oumuamua at first it was designated a comet but then it turned out not to fit the criteria for a comet so they changed it to an asteroid but then they realized it had come from outside our solar system and therefore needed its own new designation as an interstellar object the name itself is hawaiian and roughly translates to messenger from the distant past avi loeb is the chairman of harvard s astronomy department who has boldly pointed out that the object is moving too fast to be an inert rock and is not emitting jets of steam like a comet his position is that it cannot be a lump of rock as has been suggested and in his expert opinion the only scenario that fits with the data is an object that originated from another intelligent civilization loeb has also pointed out that it s arrogant believe that we are alone in the universe or even an especially unique species expert opinions on extraterrestrial intelligence from the moonwalkers apollo astronaut al worden made an appearance on good morning britain some years ago before the show wrapped up the host asked him if he believed in extraterrestrials worden responded that he did and that he knew they existed because he saw them everyday the hosts laughed misinterpreting his statement as a joke but he wasn t joking and told them so he went on to explain that in his expert opinion in the distant prehistoric past an intelligent species seeded life on earth he then suggested reading sumerian mythology before the host flew into a panic ending the program another moonwalking astronaut buzz aldrin has stated publicly that an anomalous 200 meter tall object on mars is in his expert opinion evidence of a non human civilization but perhaps the most intriguing of the moonwalkers is edgar mitchell and his email that was uncovered by the wikileaks revelations in an email sent from mitchell to the clinton camp while hillary clinton was secretary of state and running for president mitchell wrote remember our nonviolent eti from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to earth they will not tolerate any forms of military violence on earth or in space eti is short for extraterrestrial intelligence and zero point energy is a clean inexhaustible energy source what does ufo report mean for human origin paradigms what conclusions can be drawn from this 180 degree reversal by the us government and what impact does it have on human origin paradigms first and foremost the us government s long held position that these ufos are simply misconstrued aerial optical illusions has all the while been a complete farce no surprised there for the discerning researcher also it seems that quite a few of the previously mentioned vitriolic skeptics are due up for a long humiliating force fed cornucopia feast of cold crow meat but what these disclosures really mean is that theories like those of francis crick james watson sydney brenner leslie orgel and others are being tremendously reinforced it s one thing to speculate that somewhere out there in the distant reaches of the universe or multiverse there are other intelligent life forms but if such life forms are present right here then the likelihood of their influence regarding the origination of life on this planet goes up ten thousand fold in this realm of theoretical science there s a concept known as the fermi paradox this controversial paradox posits that based on the age of the universe approximately 15 billion years old its vast size so large its boundaries are unknown and given what we know about our own

joanna fogg perched at the prow of her boat looks out at the 350 oyster cages rocking in the mount desert narrows that make up the bulk of bar harbor oyster co the business that she and her husband jesse have spent the past seven years building from the ground up the black plastic floats spread across about 22 acres may not look like much to some and may even be an eyesore to others but fogg hopes that one day people will see them as beautiful her farm may not conjure the same quintessential working waterfront images as a lobster boat and brightly colored buoy fogg said but she thinks it should hold the same meaning this is what it looks like to feed people and feed people she does even with a projected harvest of about 100 000 oysters this year fogg can t keep up with the demand of bar harbor let alone a state that is rapidly growing its brand as a premier destination for farm grown seafood fogg s business is just one of the hundreds of maine sea farms contributing to the state s successful aquaculture industry selling oysters mussels seaweed and salmon as fast as they can be grown the practice has been around for thousands of years but only in the past few has it become a vital economic engine for the state advertisement but as more farms have cropped up so have coalitions and interest groups concerned about maine s coastline being overrun by industrial size operations that pollute the state s pristine waters and take valuable bottom from maine s iconic nearly half billion dollar lobster industry in 2019 the last year of normal harvest and value data before the pandemic maine s aquaculture industry had an estimated direct economic impact of 88 4 million and employed an estimated 622 employees a nearly 15 percent increase in value over three years according to data from the 2016 maine aquaculture economic impact report from the university of maine s aquaculture research institute by next year the industry is expected to employ around 880 workers across production and over 1 600 across the supply chain by 2030 employment is projected to exceed 1 000 direct workers and over 2 000 across the supply chain maine characterizes its lease sites in three ways experimental leases are smaller in size up to 4 acres and shorter in duration up to three years and cannot be renewed unless they are for scientific purposes while standard leases are larger up to 100 acres longer in duration up to 20 years and can be renewed according to the maine department of marine resources limited purpose aquaculture sites or lpas are only one year in duration but can be renewed at the end of each year there are about 178 active aquaculture leases 46 leases under review and 762 small lpa sites in maine according to data from the department of marine resources as technology advances and its popularity grows it seems like the sky s the limit for what is despite its ancient roots a relatively young industry but not everyone in maine is sold on aquaculture advertisement aquaculture in maine at its core aquaculture simply refers to growing plants or animals in water whether the farm is located on land or in salt or fresh water according to sebastian belle director of the maine aquaculture association the practice is thought to have started with carp farming in china as far back as 2000 b c according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations but it didn t gain worldwide traction until much later between 1700 and 1900 a d however aquaculture as it is practiced today didn t get underway until around 1970 when farmers began to work with more species today maine grows about 24 species but belle said the big three are salmon oysters and mussels with salmon capturing more of the gross revenue but oysters holding more lease sites beyond food aquaculture also produces sport fish baitfish ornamental or aquarium fish sea vegetables research animals and fish eggs and can be used in stock restoration in which hatchery fish and shellfish are released into the wild to help rebuild wild populations or coastal habitats such as oyster reefs advertisement the aquaculture sector in maine has been growing by roughly 2 percent per year for the past decade and belle expects that growth rate to increase possibly even double in the next few years aquaculture first really hit maine in the 1970s or 80s belle said growing from virtually no acres of farms to about 600 and then reaching a plateau for about 15 years over the past few decades it has increased to nearly 1700 acres of farmed ocean and if recent years are any indication that number will just keep going up we cannot land enough we cannot grow enough because the maine brand is so well respected belle said there is an increased demand particularly among young people for healthy locally grown sustainable protein he said the demand is insane belle said noting that seafood saw a 25 percent to 35 percent boost in customer sales during the pandemic when people were no longer able to eat out at restaurants if we can hold that the demand will be even stronger gov janet mills also has noted the increase in demand advertisement in her 10 year economic development plan mills includes the importance of pursuing sustainable fishing opportunities such as aquaculture to complement traditional fishing and meet the growing demand for a traceable food supply that is changing the way we fish and farm expansion breeds controversy as the industry grows in maine so do the chances of it generating controversy large scale aquaculture farms particularly in water finfish farms have been criticized for years because of their high risks for ocean pollution from nutrient and effluent buildup possible negative impacts on the wild fish population and the potential impact on the fish themselves and therefore consumers from crowding antibiotics and disease bivalve aquaculture mussels oysters and scallops and kelp or marine algae farming are considered more environmentally beneficial because they don t require fresh water or fertilizers don t need to be fed and in the case of bivalves filter the water however according to belle while salmon used to be the big bad wolf of aquaculture raising the most opposition that is no longer the case advertisement in 2018 a proposed 40 acre lease for mere point oyster co on brunswick s maquoit bay spurred over a year of debate hours of hearings and at least one lawsuit opponents spoke out about conflicting uses of the bay unknown but potentially negative environmental impacts and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds belle doesn t buy it most times the objections come from people who don t want to look at hear or smell a commercial working waterfront he said but since there is no way under the existing system for somebody to object to the impacts on viewscape they re hiring well paid public relations consultants and enlisting the commercial fishing community the lease whittled down to 28 acres by owners doug niven and dan devereaux was ultimately approved in 2019 but the opponents aren t giving up their fight against large scale aquaculture one group previously known as save maquoit bay and now known as the protect maine s fishing heritage foundation has been particularly vocal about its concerns over what it s called industrial aquaculture large leases especially those over 30 acres owned by out of state or international companies striving to maximize profits at the expense of the ocean according to executive director crystal canney the state s regulations which she believes are too relaxed have set the table for industrial aquaculture advertisement a single person can lease up to 1 000 acres of the ocean 100 acres per lease for up to 10 leases for 100 years and can transfer the lease without a public hearing she noted and with a 95 percent lease approval rate she worries maine is setting itself up for failure the group s current battle is against a proposed 110 acre penned salmon fishery in frenchman bay backed by norwegian investor mikael roenes the american aquafarms proposal includes 30 150 foot salmon pens that would eventually produce about 30 000 metric tons or 66 million pounds of fish the project would be on two sites one encompassing 56 acres and the other taking up 60 acres protect maine s fishing heritage along with frenchman bay united an umbrella organization of five different groups opposing the plan worry that the farm will overtake valuable lobstering grounds while polluting the pristine waters a die off of over 100 000 salmon at a cooke aquaculture site in august has prompted more opposition and questions surrounding the proposal cooke aquaculture is currently the only salmon farming operation in the state and has over 600 acres of lease sites along the coast advertisement protect maine and frenchman bay united said in a news release in september that the die off is just another example of how industrial scale in water fish farms threaten the environmental and economic health of coastal areas at every turn industrial scale aquaculture is given the benefit of the doubt whereas lobstermen and fishermen have their feet held to the fire canney said in the release we need evidence that maine s oversight agencies are putting the health of our waters first and not turning a blind eye to industrial scale aquaculture damaging our oceans a need for more planning protect maine s fishing heritage has called for a statewide conversation with regulators and stakeholders to create a plan for the future of aquaculture growth in maine they re pushing for lease size and length limits and a hearing for lease transfers among other changes the state hasn t done its homework canney said leases are exploding and the state is approving them willy nilly because the governor has a 10 year strategic plan that promotes aquaculture at any cost the group says it isn t against all aquaculture in maine advertisement in fact the small owner operated model especially for farms under 10 or 20 acres is one the group supports canney said however she said the more acres a site takes up the more lobstering grounds are lost the more other uses for the area disappear and the more risks there are for the environment i do not think that getting greedy and having hundreds of acres is something that s good for maine canney said fogg of bar harbor oyster has a different mindset i was definitely in the school of thought originally that small owner operated is always the best way to go she said but the longer i m involved in it the more i understand that big isn t always bad and that big is relative i want to be big enough that i can afford a couple of year round employees who maybe get benefits realistically two of these oyster strings and one boat is not going to do that it s not even going to afford us health insurance alex de köning one of the owners of acadia aquafarms the state s largest mussel grower said the state s regulatory process is thorough enough as it is it takes years to get through the lease approval process which can help weed out the bad applications he said but that approval time coupled with the few years it takes to grow product to market size also requires businesses to start big to help minimize that time sometimes growers will start out with lpas to begin growing a small operation and then expand this can contribute to the impression that aquaculture is exploding de köning said advertisement according to jeff nichols spokesperson for the department of marine resources the number of new applications has more than tripled in the past five years going from 13 in 2015 to 42 in 2020 during that time the number of new leases issued per year increased at a similar rate jumping from seven in 2015 to 20 in in 2020 total acreage leased in the state increased by about 300 acres during that five year span however nichols said it s important to note that the total footprint of leases remains relatively low at approximately 1 600 acres statewide compared to the 3 5 million acres of total state waters that s because the lpa sites are small designed for people just starting out or who only want to operate on a very small scale overall the number of active leases per year has remained fairly constant nichols added a global opportunity aquaculture is growing even faster globally than it is in maine advertisement according to a 2020 food and agriculture organization of the united nations report on the state of the world s fisheries and aquaculture global aquaculture production rose 527 percent between 1990 and 2018 compared with a 14 percent increase in wild catch fisheries production in the same period aquaculture production is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030 a 32 percent increase from 2018 according to the university of maine aquaculture research institute s economic impact report the majority 62 percent of food fish will be produced by aquaculture by 2030 the united states is the third largest market for seafood but ranks 15th in aquaculture production asian markets have so far dominated the space with an 89 percent share over the past 2o years according to the united nations seafood is the most valuable traded food commodity and the united states imports over 90 percent of its seafood some enterprising mainers hope to see that start to change and according to belle the state is uniquely positioned to make that happen advertisement we have amazing environmental conditions he said we have very clean water a lot of coastline and we still have a working waterfront we have a long tradition in maine of going down to the water to make a living and there are a lot of people who are experimenting with it to diversify their income base factor in organizations such as the aquaculture research institute bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences umaine s darling marine center the gulf of maine research institute the downeast institute and others and maine has the best research infrastructure for cold water aquaculture in america he said with a clean and extensive coastline and ample opportunity for research maine colleges and industry partners are now preparing the workforce that will be needed to meet the demand aquaculture is multidisciplinary belle said and employers are looking for workers with skills ranging from a good handle on math and science to traditional husbandry and farming practices last month the maine aquaculture association released a new set of occupational standards for the industry the first of its kind to set the training needs and standards for the industry for use in new aquaculture training programs in several college programs throughout the state belle expects that these training programs will attract people from other states and countries putting maine on the map for being a center for excellence advertisement last year the gulf of maine research institute also launched an online portal the maine aquaculturist a centralized resource hub to help aquaculture farmers start or maintain their operations experiments with new species according to the department of marine resources in maine there are 21 active lease sites for salmon all owned by cooke aquaculture 36 lease sites for mussels and 93 for oysters several businesses such as cooke are licensed on multiple sites for multiple species in 2019 maine aquaculturists harvested about 2 3 million pounds of mussels valued at just over 4 million and 13 9 million pounds of oysters valued at about 9 7 million data for salmon was not immediately available the big three are aquaculture s main breadwinners but many aquaculturists are experimenting with new and emerging techniques to farm species such as seaweed eels and scallops that they believe have enough market potential to disrupt that hierarchy for example seaweed aquaculture which didn t exist in maine or the united states until 2009 harvested just 14 500 pounds in 2015 according to data from the department of marine resources an estimated value was not available advertisement by 2018 that figure had increased to 53 500 pounds valued at 37 897 just two years later in 2020 maine harvested over 497 000 pounds valued at 301 285 briana warner president and ceo of atlantic sea farms the state s first kelp farm and now its largest seaweed supplier and processor expects that number to double next year that s not even a blip compared with what the market can do warner said the united states imports 98 percent of its seaweed the majority of which is produced in asia and generally arrives dehydrated for sushi the company now partners with about two dozen fishermen and women up and down the maine coast atlantic sea farms gets the seeds started in its nursery and gives the seedlings to fishermen primarily lobster fishermen to grow on lines in the offseason fishermen then harvest the seaweed using the same equipment needed for lobstering and sell the harvested seaweed back to atlantic sea farms which produces kelp based products for sale online in grocery stores and for use by some restaurant chains advertisement the goal warner said is for kelp farming to become a viable environmentally friendly supplemental or one day even primary income source for maine fishermen especially as the looming threat of climate change casts a shadow over the maine lobster industry we are completely dependent on lobster monoculture she said there are few diversification opportunities on the water without diversification we are uniquely vulnerable in a way we ve never been before warner isn t the only one who sees potential in an aquaculture segment traditionally dominated by asian farms earlier this year american unagi an eel aquaculture company started construction on a 10 million 27 000 square foot facility in waldoboro the new building will expand the company s production to over 500 000 pounds or about 5 percent of the u s eel market according to owner sara rademaker maine is one of two states that harvest glass eels also known as elvers as they find their way to rivers from their ocean spawning areas advertisement once the elvers are harvested they re usually shipped to asian countries such as japan china taiwan and korea where they are reared to adult size for the food fish market many are then shipped back to the u s to be used in sushi rademaker isn t out to replace maine s elver fishery which in 2019 was the state s second most valuable with landings valued at 20 1 million for 9 750 pounds landings remained about the same in 2020 but took a substantial hit in value because of the pandemic instead she works with the fishery purchasing the toothpick size translucent eels from the local harvesters growing them to market size in american unagi s land based facility and then selling them to wholesalers or restaurants as this aquaculture industry grows in maine we re almost this hybrid rademaker said calling it a nice representation of how we can connect aquaculture to the wild harvest fishery in a way that fits it made sense to snap this onto the economy to help diversify something that maine s already really good at send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

president biden has said for months that his infrastructure bill which the house passed friday and his build back better deal which has new momentum will boost the economy for years to come economists largely agree that the bills would probably strengthen prosperity and job growth over time even if there is less certainty about what the measures would add to u s debt and what they would mean for the economy in the short term now that the infrastructure bill is becoming law and the other measure appears to be advancing biden s vision for how to remake the economy is coming into sharper focus the white house has frequently touted the bills as historic investments the initial versions pitched in the spring were massive and often seemed aspirational with so many initiatives the final deals while about half as big as biden s initial 5 5 trillion vision are still expected to be transformational advertisement taken together they would total about 3 trillion in spending over the next decade a sum that in some ways eclipses the total spending of even the new deal and greatly increases the government s role in the u s economy he has had to pare back many of his campaign ideas such as a sweeping overhaul of medicare and biden s policy impact may not prove as lasting as that of franklin d roosevelt or lyndon b johnson also many of biden s policies especially in the build back better act are funded only for a few years to keep the bill s price tag down biden would essentially be leaving his legacy in the hands of a future congress at heart biden s sweeping policies are an attempt to boost the productive capacity of the nation increase the number of americans working outside the home and create a more fair and equitable economy after decades of struggle for low income and middle class americans in recent decades the wealthiest americans have pulled further away from everyone else and the pandemic made these disparities even more striking biden and democrats have called for a more balanced economy that helps lift more people this political and economic experiment will now be put to the test the infrastructure bill is a significant investment in roads bridges ports pipes and more that is widely expected to make business deliveries and commuting easier in the united states the build back better bill invests heavily in child care preschool education for 3 and 4 year olds paid parental leave and elder care these initiatives are expected to make it easier for americans especially moms to work outside the home because they know their young children and older relatives will have good care estimates from independent groups such as oxford economics and moody s analytics predict the pace of growth will be higher and the number of people working will increase in the coming years if these bills are signed into law largely because their models forecast that the gains from higher productivity and more women working will be greater than any drag from the tax increases to pay for the initiatives advertisement oxford economics predicts 0 5 percentage point higher growth in 2022 and 0 9 percentage point higher grow in 2023 according to economist gregory daco in a report released thursday moody s analytics predicts stronger growth and 2 4 million jobs by the end of 2025 as spending ramps up on road construction and in preschools combined with additional infrastructure investment build back better is quite a significant boost to economic activity said daco chief u s economist at oxford economics the infrastructure bill will now become law the build back better package which ranges between 1 75 trillion and 2 trillion depending on what survives still must clear more hurdles but many democrats are newly optimistic that they can push it into law not all models agree that biden s agenda will result in big gains the penn wharton budget model from the university of pennsylvania predicts the build back better bill would have a slightly negative impact on growth over the coming decade largely because it estimates that some proposed but not agreed to tax hikes on big corporations and wealthy individuals will be a drag on the economy advertisement a major reason the house and senate have not passed the build back better bill yet is because moderate democrats want to see the nonpartisan congressional budget office s assessment of its costs and benefits the cbo said in august the infrastructure bill would add at least 256 billion to the debt over the next 10 years biden has said his bills are fully paid for but the cbo has not had sufficient time to parse the 2 135 page climate child care and health care plan yet senate democrats meanwhile have not said whether they would even agree to the house bill suggesting that key details could change in the coming weeks the build back better bill is widely expected to be close to if not fully paid for when the cbo runs its final tally the bill includes a 15 percent corporate minimum tax on big companies a new tax on firms that perform stock buybacks and a new surcharge tax on americans with incomes above 10 million these initiatives along with heftier enforcement of tax cheats should be close to covering the costs the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation found the new tax provisions alone would raise 1 5 trillion in revenue in total biden s initiatives would add only a small fraction to the debt compared with the 2017 gop tax cut that is on track to add 1 9 trillion over a decade advertisement but there are a number of gimmicks in the bill that will probably make the real price tag larger the generous child tax credit expires in one year the credits to make health care more affordable expire in four years and the sweeping new pre k programs last for only six years the true cost of the bill would probably be closer to 4 trillion if these programs were extended the full decade according to nonpartisan analysis from the penn wharton budget model and the committee for a responsible federal budget when you add in the costs of making all of these short term programs permanent you will see that we re adding a whole new structural deficit to the federal budget said tori gorman policy director for the concord coalition which advocates for a balanced federal budget it seems a little ridiculous to pass legislation that s not fully paid for when we haven t even paid for the promises we already made other policy experts argue that these big investments are needed to make the u s economy competitive against china and other large economies they point out that it is incredibly cheap for the nation to borrow money right now because interest rates are at historic lows making it a wise time to invest advertisement this is about doing what s right for our economic future in terms of climate change and in terms of investing in our children said betsey stevenson a university of michigan economist and former member of president barack obama s council of economic advisers this is a historic investment in child care sen joe manchin iii of west virginia one of the last hold out votes that democrats need has raised concerns about whether inflation could get worse from all of this government spending americans are already on edge about inflation which is at a 13 year high biden promised friday the bills would lower costs in the long term many economists agree for example 17 nobel laureates in economics signed a letter saying biden s policies would ease longer term inflationary pressures many of biden s investments roads and transit building more affordable homes lower drug costs and reducing child care costs should result in a more productive economy and lower prices but it takes time to implement these programs and the results may not be felt right away advertisement the u s economy is suffering from severe supply chain problems and many businesses are struggling to hire all the workers they need additional government spending runs the risk of pushing inflation up in the next year some warn if a home builder can t find a construction worker how will we find a person to repair a road or fix the bridge they are going to experience the same constraints said peter boockvar chief investment officer of bleakley advisory group but the details of the bills matter many of the tax and fee increases start right away which should help contain inflationary pressures gripping the broader economy the child tax credit should also help alleviate the burden of higher gas food and rent prices on low and moderate income families families earning up to 150 000 a year receive a credit of 300 a month for each child under 6 and 250 a month for each child 6 to 17 subsidies for child care and health care should make those payments more affordable for many families advertisement overall inflation might be a bit higher but for low and middle income households inflation will probably be lower said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the infrastructure deal has been widely praised and passed with bipartisan support it will be the largest boost in spending on infrastructure in decades the build back better package continues to be negotiated in the house and senate in the latest version of the deal more than half of the money goes to addressing climate change and investing in young children through a universal pre k program the monthly child tax credit payments and a cap on child care expenses for many families at 7 percent of income at a fundamental level economies grow because there are either more workers entering the labor force or because the existing workers are more productive for much of the past decade the nation struggled with weak productivity gains one of many factors holding back the recovery from the great recession there has been a recent boost of productivity from rapid digitization during the pandemic the hope is these major bills will drive further improvements in productivity that can pay off for years to come advertisement on the workforce side of the equation the united states was a leader on women s participation in work outside the home in the 1980s and 90s but now the united states is lagging behind many other advanced economies in europe canada australia and japan many economists predict a boost in working women from the build back better plan especially if the final version includes both paid parental leave and expanded child care we know from a lot of empirical research that these policies will boost labor supply they will help people who have care responsibilities fully participate in the economy white house economic adviser heather boushey said at a recent washington post live event as democrats debate the final details the house added a controversial increase in the state and local tax deduction known as salt to 72 500 from 10 000 this change would allow wealthy homeowners to deduct more of their property taxes and expenses it is a popular change in states like new jersey and new york where there are many expensive homes and high property taxes but critics across the political spectrum have blasted the salt change as a giveaway to the rich running contrary to democrats message that this bill is supposed to tax the wealthy and big corporations to make much needed investments in young people climate change mitigation and the care economy according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the salt change would be the third most expensive proposal in the build back better bill why are they doing this tweeted jason furman former head of obama s white house council of economic advisers this increase alone will go almost exclusively to households making over 1 million while the final details are being worked out on the build back better plan the emerging consensus is that these bills are a major attempt to address barriers that have long held back the u s economy from its full potential

making money is about asset allocation the secret of making money is very simple buy low sell high winners have a good asset allocation strategy plus luck losers do the opposite they sell low buy high during the pandemic retail investors have come back to the stock market in droves the reason is very simple they are getting lower and lower returns on their bonds and bank deposits even though they lost money before in the stock market taking bets there is not only fun but if they strike it rich they feel good tell their friends and before you know it every tom dick and harry is piling in people love to boast about their winnings but they rarely talk about their losses advertisement asset allocation strategy is far more important than you can imagine this is the first thing your financial planner or adviser will talk about where do you put your money and how effective is your strategy when i was running the foreign exchange reserves portfolio in hong kong the expert in charge always repeated the fundamental principles of returns risk and liquidity what is the return on assets roa what is the risk of capital loss how much liquidity should you have actually it is never just roa but roe return on equity because you can always increase your returns through leveraging namely buying assets funded by debt your equity assets net of liabilities remains the same but the leverage assets or liabilities growing larger than equity increases the downside is your returns increase at the cost of incurring volatility risk since sharp drops in asset price would also exponentially increase your losses liquidity is very important because if you don t have cash you might not be able to buy an opportunity worse you may be forced to sell assets even at a loss to meet your contractual obligations crowded exits that is when everyone is trying to exit the market creates panic selling and huge losses to everyone liquidity crises are the main reason central banks exist to provide emergency liquidity when needed most financial crises occur because liquidity crises end up as solvency crises selling assets at huge losses while the real value of debt increases makes many borrowers bankrupt and eventually the banking system also fails when non performing loans outweigh the bank s equity if all depositors pull out of the bank the bank goes bankrupt in a chain reaction there are three knows in this business know yourself know your business and know your risks knowing yourself because you are your own customer is very important because your investment strategy must fit your individual and special needs a young person can afford to invest for the long term and therefore take more risks a person on the point of retiring just wants a steady income and can t afford to lose his or her capital but i know young people who are extremely conservative and remain poor whereas some silver haired investors bought bitcoin or high tech stocks and ended up very rich luck and skills decide who ends up in tears because there are few consistent winners kyb or know your business means you must know what business you are in and what you are buying or selling investment is a business that must be learnt with discipline it means buying with your eyes wide open gambling is buying with your eyes shut if you don t know what you are buying then you are gambling therefore it pays to study the business and products before you invest and if you don t know allocating a small amount to learn is not a bad strategy knowing your risks is related to the first two every product has different risks and even if you think you understand the risks when the price drops suddenly you find that your risk appetite is much less than you think so cutting losses by selling the shares may end up saving you from worse losses but may also mean opportunity lost because the shares may rebound suddenly only you yourself can find out whether you have such nerves of steel to buy when everyone is panicking or sell when everyone is buying you pay to learn that the standard investment allocation is between real assets such as your house antiques or gold versus financial assets typically bank deposits bonds or stocks physical assets protect you against inflation but often have no liquidity your house is not an investment to be traded it s a necessity but most wage earners have something like half the bulk of their assets in housing half in financial assets the half in financial assets could be roughly divided into 5pc 10pc in cash 20pc in provident epf insurance or retirement funds and the remainder in mutual funds or stocks advertisement the first principle we all learn is diversification or never put all your eggs in one basket the second is investment style value investing or momentum investing the former is applied by the famous investor warren buffett and the latter is used by chartists who draw technical charts on when to buy or sell by following market trends buffett s style has made him lots of money because his secret is actually to invest in good businesses that have good franchises locked in profits protected by franchise grip on market such as walmart apple and coca cola chartists care less about value but buy when the market is moving and sell before it heads south technical chartists essentially follow the crowd and enjoy the market momentum with the aim of getting out before the market turns but calling the top or the bottom is very difficult in essence the market is driven by greed and fear don t be too greedy i know many long term investors who started out as speculators they held onto their winning streak refused to sell and ended up with losses when the stock tanked of course each successful investor has his or her own unique style some like the famous bernie madoff make up the profits through false accounting in essence do your homework what is too good to be true often is the principle of strategic asset allocation is much more universal in application because every day or minute we are allocating our precious time another asset to decide what to do for the short term the urgent or mundane or the long term important but difficult we never value our time properly many postponing difficult decisions because they don t know how to make the decision or because they think they have time later on to make that decision then covid 19 comes and you lose your job or become ill and then regret that you do not have enough cash are not prepared for contingencies or have not kept yourself healthy through daily exercise and discipline another area of blindness in asset allocation is to remember that you are your own best asset a career choice between a salary or wage earner or a business venture is an asset allocation decision do you commit yourself to a long term low income stream or devote your talent to a high risk high return business in most small businesses the main asset is not physical assets but the owner s own talent reputation and brand the reason why your parents want you to be a professional is they are hedging the bet if you are trained as a professional you get a steady income if you fail as an entrepreneur you can still go back to being a professional notice how some successful politicians are doctors if they fail as a politician they can go back to a steady income and customers as a doctor risk hedged the really dangerous politician is one whose future income depends on being a politician so they bet your money and future with their political asset allocation strategy and since politics needs money are you surprised that money politics corrupts absolutely money politics is a businessman buying insurance that the politician might even benefit his business on the other side money politics is the politician s asset allocation strategy of using money to beat his competition winner takes all and the loser is the public of course some career choices are not made by the individual but by circumstances sometimes beyond their control jk rowling was a divorcee with a young child in relative poverty when she decided to write the harry potter series that made her billions your talent may be worth more than what your employer thinks you are worth your worth depends on how confident you are in your ideas and will to succeed life is not a 100 metre dash but a marathon those with will and stamina succeed but prosperity is also related to the bigger picture we all agree that china has outperformed in terms of gdp growth and wealth creation and yet investing in the chinese stock market has not been good however the recent growth in the chinese stock market is in tech stocks just as the outperforming us stocks are the tech stocks one wechat comment i saw asked why the best talent in china went to america to help in the tech boom but they did not make as much money as their less talented colleagues who remained in china advertisement on the other hand the best tech companies in the us such as google microsoft and ibm are run by indians indian top tech talent went either for these american big companies or remained in the indian software houses like infosys wipro or hcl technologies which are software service companies to the us european markets the chinese tech talent in the us went into business themselves creating the zooms of this world but most stayed as tech specialists for a salary on the other hand those who remained in china created the alibabas tencents or xiaomis that made them billionaires chinese education focused on stem science technology engineering and mathematics skills stressing iq intelligence quotient whereas indian education was english based with excellent social or eq emotional quotient skills thus indian management skills are much appreciated in top western multinationals but chinese technical skills without articulation in english meant that very few of them could reach the top in the west on the other hand chinese eq is well adjusted to chinese society so those with high tech and high chinese eq succeed in a chinese environment no wonder taiwanese and even chinese malaysian tech talent have done very well in china the key lesson from this story is that education choice in iq versus eq is also an asset allocation decision the asian mentality and culture is that if our generation does not do well we invest heavily in education for our children to prepare them for the next generation the best universities in the world have far higher asian intakes than their own local populations so much so that there is now reverse discrimination against asians thus the key investment allocation strategy is to kyb know how the bigger context is changing and where you want your future to be in if you think that global risks are greater and more uncertain then you hedge your bets it is not surprising that many asian families are now scattered around the world becoming more multicultural they are actually diversifying their geographical risks to where the best returns are asians are much more open to risk because they understand that without risk there are no opportunities but iq alone is not enough eq or the ability to emotionally get everyone to work together is critical group action enables the collective to defend itself against the predator look at how starlings or bats fly together as one large dance to defend themselves against attacking hawks a single stray is immediately picked off and killed asians are lucky that they grow up in a high growth zone so their wealth has done much better than someone growing up in the middle east latin america or africa but even if on average the group performs well it does not mean that an individual will perform well thus to join the outperform group one must use brains rather than brawn education is still the key to a better life asset allocation is therefore not just about managing money but managing one s own life and destiny choose wisely your future depends on it

joanna fogg perched at the prow of her boat looks out at the 350 oyster cages rocking in the mount desert narrows that make up the bulk of bar harbor oyster co the business that she and her husband jesse have spent the past seven years building from the ground up the black plastic floats spread across about 22 acres may not look like much to some and may even be an eyesore to others but fogg hopes that one day people will see them as beautiful her farm may not conjure the same quintessential working waterfront images as a lobster boat and brightly colored buoy fogg said but she thinks it should hold the same meaning this is what it looks like to feed people and feed people she does even with a projected harvest of about 100 000 oysters this year fogg can t keep up with the demand of bar harbor let alone a state that is rapidly growing its brand as a premier destination for farm grown seafood fogg s business is just one of the hundreds of maine sea farms contributing to the state s successful aquaculture industry selling oysters mussels seaweed and salmon as fast as they can be grown the practice has been around for thousands of years but only in the past few has it become a vital economic engine for the state advertisement but as more farms have cropped up so have coalitions and interest groups concerned about maine s coastline being overrun by industrial size operations that pollute the state s pristine waters and take valuable bottom from maine s iconic nearly half billion dollar lobster industry in 2019 the last year of normal harvest and value data before the pandemic maine s aquaculture industry had an estimated direct economic impact of 88 4 million and employed an estimated 622 employees a nearly 15 percent increase in value over three years according to data from the 2016 maine aquaculture economic impact report from the university of maine s aquaculture research institute by next year the industry is expected to employ around 880 workers across production and over 1 600 across the supply chain by 2030 employment is projected to exceed 1 000 direct workers and over 2 000 across the supply chain maine characterizes its lease sites in three ways experimental leases are smaller in size up to 4 acres and shorter in duration up to three years and cannot be renewed unless they are for scientific purposes while standard leases are larger up to 100 acres longer in duration up to 20 years and can be renewed according to the maine department of marine resources limited purpose aquaculture sites or lpas are only one year in duration but can be renewed at the end of each year there are about 178 active aquaculture leases 46 leases under review and 762 small lpa sites in maine according to data from the department of marine resources as technology advances and its popularity grows it seems like the sky s the limit for what is despite its ancient roots a relatively young industry but not everyone in maine is sold on aquaculture advertisement aquaculture in maine at its core aquaculture simply refers to growing plants or animals in water whether the farm is located on land or in salt or fresh water according to sebastian belle director of the maine aquaculture association the practice is thought to have started with carp farming in china as far back as 2000 b c according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations but it didn t gain worldwide traction until much later between 1700 and 1900 a d however aquaculture as it is practiced today didn t get underway until around 1970 when farmers began to work with more species today maine grows about 24 species but belle said the big three are salmon oysters and mussels with salmon capturing more of the gross revenue but oysters holding more lease sites beyond food aquaculture also produces sport fish baitfish ornamental or aquarium fish sea vegetables research animals and fish eggs and can be used in stock restoration in which hatchery fish and shellfish are released into the wild to help rebuild wild populations or coastal habitats such as oyster reefs advertisement the aquaculture sector in maine has been growing by roughly 2 percent per year for the past decade and belle expects that growth rate to increase possibly even double in the next few years aquaculture first really hit maine in the 1970s or 80s belle said growing from virtually no acres of farms to about 600 and then reaching a plateau for about 15 years over the past few decades it has increased to nearly 1700 acres of farmed ocean and if recent years are any indication that number will just keep going up we cannot land enough we cannot grow enough because the maine brand is so well respected belle said there is an increased demand particularly among young people for healthy locally grown sustainable protein he said the demand is insane belle said noting that seafood saw a 25 percent to 35 percent boost in customer sales during the pandemic when people were no longer able to eat out at restaurants if we can hold that the demand will be even stronger gov janet mills also has noted the increase in demand advertisement in her 10 year economic development plan mills includes the importance of pursuing sustainable fishing opportunities such as aquaculture to complement traditional fishing and meet the growing demand for a traceable food supply that is changing the way we fish and farm expansion breeds controversy as the industry grows in maine so do the chances of it generating controversy large scale aquaculture farms particularly in water finfish farms have been criticized for years because of their high risks for ocean pollution from nutrient and effluent buildup possible negative impacts on the wild fish population and the potential impact on the fish themselves and therefore consumers from crowding antibiotics and disease bivalve aquaculture mussels oysters and scallops and kelp or marine algae farming are considered more environmentally beneficial because they don t require fresh water or fertilizers don t need to be fed and in the case of bivalves filter the water however according to belle while salmon used to be the big bad wolf of aquaculture raising the most opposition that is no longer the case advertisement in 2018 a proposed 40 acre lease for mere point oyster co on brunswick s maquoit bay spurred over a year of debate hours of hearings and at least one lawsuit opponents spoke out about conflicting uses of the bay unknown but potentially negative environmental impacts and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds belle doesn t buy it most times the objections come from people who don t want to look at hear or smell a commercial working waterfront he said but since there is no way under the existing system for somebody to object to the impacts on viewscape they re hiring well paid public relations consultants and enlisting the commercial fishing community the lease whittled down to 28 acres by owners doug niven and dan devereaux was ultimately approved in 2019 but the opponents aren t giving up their fight against large scale aquaculture one group previously known as save maquoit bay and now known as the protect maine s fishing heritage foundation has been particularly vocal about its concerns over what it s called industrial aquaculture large leases especially those over 30 acres owned by out of state or international companies striving to maximize profits at the expense of the ocean according to executive director crystal canney the state s regulations which she believes are too relaxed have set the table for industrial aquaculture advertisement a single person can lease up to 1 000 acres of the ocean 100 acres per lease for up to 10 leases for 100 years and can transfer the lease without a public hearing she noted and with a 95 percent lease approval rate she worries maine is setting itself up for failure the group s current battle is against a proposed 110 acre penned salmon fishery in frenchman bay backed by norwegian investor mikael roenes the american aquafarms proposal includes 30 150 foot salmon pens that would eventually produce about 30 000 metric tons or 66 million pounds of fish the project would be on two sites one encompassing 56 acres and the other taking up 60 acres protect maine s fishing heritage along with frenchman bay united an umbrella organization of five different groups opposing the plan worry that the farm will overtake valuable lobstering grounds while polluting the pristine waters a die off of over 100 000 salmon at a cooke aquaculture site in august has prompted more opposition and questions surrounding the proposal cooke aquaculture is currently the only salmon farming operation in the state and has over 600 acres of lease sites along the coast advertisement protect maine and frenchman bay united said in a news release in september that the die off is just another example of how industrial scale in water fish farms threaten the environmental and economic health of coastal areas at every turn industrial scale aquaculture is given the benefit of the doubt whereas lobstermen and fishermen have their feet held to the fire canney said in the release we need evidence that maine s oversight agencies are putting the health of our waters first and not turning a blind eye to industrial scale aquaculture damaging our oceans a need for more planning protect maine s fishing heritage has called for a statewide conversation with regulators and stakeholders to create a plan for the future of aquaculture growth in maine they re pushing for lease size and length limits and a hearing for lease transfers among other changes the state hasn t done its homework canney said leases are exploding and the state is approving them willy nilly because the governor has a 10 year strategic plan that promotes aquaculture at any cost the group says it isn t against all aquaculture in maine advertisement in fact the small owner operated model especially for farms under 10 or 20 acres is one the group supports canney said however she said the more acres a site takes up the more lobstering grounds are lost the more other uses for the area disappear and the more risks there are for the environment i do not think that getting greedy and having hundreds of acres is something that s good for maine canney said fogg of bar harbor oyster has a different mindset i was definitely in the school of thought originally that small owner operated is always the best way to go she said but the longer i m involved in it the more i understand that big isn t always bad and that big is relative i want to be big enough that i can afford a couple of year round employees who maybe get benefits realistically two of these oyster strings and one boat is not going to do that it s not even going to afford us health insurance alex de köning one of the owners of acadia aquafarms the state s largest mussel grower said the state s regulatory process is thorough enough as it is it takes years to get through the lease approval process which can help weed out the bad applications he said but that approval time coupled with the few years it takes to grow product to market size also requires businesses to start big to help minimize that time sometimes growers will start out with lpas to begin growing a small operation and then expand this can contribute to the impression that aquaculture is exploding de köning said advertisement according to jeff nichols spokesperson for the department of marine resources the number of new applications has more than tripled in the past five years going from 13 in 2015 to 42 in 2020 during that time the number of new leases issued per year increased at a similar rate jumping from seven in 2015 to 20 in in 2020 total acreage leased in the state increased by about 300 acres during that five year span however nichols said it s important to note that the total footprint of leases remains relatively low at approximately 1 600 acres statewide compared to the 3 5 million acres of total state waters that s because the lpa sites are small designed for people just starting out or who only want to operate on a very small scale overall the number of active leases per year has remained fairly constant nichols added a global opportunity aquaculture is growing even faster globally than it is in maine advertisement according to a 2020 food and agriculture organization of the united nations report on the state of the world s fisheries and aquaculture global aquaculture production rose 527 percent between 1990 and 2018 compared with a 14 percent increase in wild catch fisheries production in the same period aquaculture production is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030 a 32 percent increase from 2018 according to the university of maine aquaculture research institute s economic impact report the majority 62 percent of food fish will be produced by aquaculture by 2030 the united states is the third largest market for seafood but ranks 15th in aquaculture production asian markets have so far dominated the space with an 89 percent share over the past 2o years according to the united nations seafood is the most valuable traded food commodity and the united states imports over 90 percent of its seafood some enterprising mainers hope to see that start to change and according to belle the state is uniquely positioned to make that happen advertisement we have amazing environmental conditions he said we have very clean water a lot of coastline and we still have a working waterfront we have a long tradition in maine of going down to the water to make a living and there are a lot of people who are experimenting with it to diversify their income base factor in organizations such as the aquaculture research institute bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences umaine s darling marine center the gulf of maine research institute the downeast institute and others and maine has the best research infrastructure for cold water aquaculture in america he said with a clean and extensive coastline and ample opportunity for research maine colleges and industry partners are now preparing the workforce that will be needed to meet the demand aquaculture is multidisciplinary belle said and employers are looking for workers with skills ranging from a good handle on math and science to traditional husbandry and farming practices last month the maine aquaculture association released a new set of occupational standards for the industry the first of its kind to set the training needs and standards for the industry for use in new aquaculture training programs in several college programs throughout the state belle expects that these training programs will attract people from other states and countries putting maine on the map for being a center for excellence advertisement last year the gulf of maine research institute also launched an online portal the maine aquaculturist a centralized resource hub to help aquaculture farmers start or maintain their operations experiments with new species according to the department of marine resources in maine there are 21 active lease sites for salmon all owned by cooke aquaculture 36 lease sites for mussels and 93 for oysters several businesses such as cooke are licensed on multiple sites for multiple species in 2019 maine aquaculturists harvested about 2 3 million pounds of mussels valued at just over 4 million and 13 9 million pounds of oysters valued at about 9 7 million data for salmon was not immediately available the big three are aquaculture s main breadwinners but many aquaculturists are experimenting with new and emerging techniques to farm species such as seaweed eels and scallops that they believe have enough market potential to disrupt that hierarchy for example seaweed aquaculture which didn t exist in maine or the united states until 2009 harvested just 14 500 pounds in 2015 according to data from the department of marine resources an estimated value was not available advertisement by 2018 that figure had increased to 53 500 pounds valued at 37 897 just two years later in 2020 maine harvested over 497 000 pounds valued at 301 285 briana warner president and ceo of atlantic sea farms the state s first kelp farm and now its largest seaweed supplier and processor expects that number to double next year that s not even a blip compared with what the market can do warner said the united states imports 98 percent of its seaweed the majority of which is produced in asia and generally arrives dehydrated for sushi the company now partners with about two dozen fishermen and women up and down the maine coast atlantic sea farms gets the seeds started in its nursery and gives the seedlings to fishermen primarily lobster fishermen to grow on lines in the offseason fishermen then harvest the seaweed using the same equipment needed for lobstering and sell the harvested seaweed back to atlantic sea farms which produces kelp based products for sale online in grocery stores and for use by some restaurant chains advertisement the goal warner said is for kelp farming to become a viable environmentally friendly supplemental or one day even primary income source for maine fishermen especially as the looming threat of climate change casts a shadow over the maine lobster industry we are completely dependent on lobster monoculture she said there are few diversification opportunities on the water without diversification we are uniquely vulnerable in a way we ve never been before warner isn t the only one who sees potential in an aquaculture segment traditionally dominated by asian farms earlier this year american unagi an eel aquaculture company started construction on a 10 million 27 000 square foot facility in waldoboro the new building will expand the company s production to over 500 000 pounds or about 5 percent of the u s eel market according to owner sara rademaker maine is one of two states that harvest glass eels also known as elvers as they find their way to rivers from their ocean spawning areas advertisement once the elvers are harvested they re usually shipped to asian countries such as japan china taiwan and korea where they are reared to adult size for the food fish market many are then shipped back to the u s to be used in sushi rademaker isn t out to replace maine s elver fishery which in 2019 was the state s second most valuable with landings valued at 20 1 million for 9 750 pounds landings remained about the same in 2020 but took a substantial hit in value because of the pandemic instead she works with the fishery purchasing the toothpick size translucent eels from the local harvesters growing them to market size in american unagi s land based facility and then selling them to wholesalers or restaurants as this aquaculture industry grows in maine we re almost this hybrid rademaker said calling it a nice representation of how we can connect aquaculture to the wild harvest fishery in a way that fits it made sense to snap this onto the economy to help diversify something that maine s already really good at send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
