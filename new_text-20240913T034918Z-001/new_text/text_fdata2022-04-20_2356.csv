february 2022 with a load factor of 77 8 the load factor is trending upward in march with several weeks exceeding 90 percent booked loads marking the first time seen loads at this level since the

a small biotech company that saw its stock evaluation rocket after revealing it had developed a drug that could potentially reverse the cognitive decline of alzheimer s which would be the first of its kind is now facing allegations of manipulating or falsifying data cassava sciences an austin texas based company revealed last year that its drug simufilam showed incredible promise in early trials and it was rewarded with incredible stock growth peaking at 135 per share after spending years under the 5 mark but then the skeptics arrived with now multiple experts pointing out irregularities in published data even making major accusations that the company and associated researchers had manipulated data the company is now facing an investigation from the securities and exchange commission sec and has had some of its trial data either rescinded or marked by journals as potentially manipulated this is the second major controversy to strike a newly developed alzheimer s drug in the last 12 months with biogen s aduhelm also receiving a wave of scrutiny after it received approval from the food and drug administration fda last year the biotech company cassava is facing multiple allegations that it and associated researchers have manipulated data and doctored photos related to trials for its alzheimer s drug simufilam cassava s stock price experienced rampan growth after it revealed promising data from trials of its alzheimer s drug it has since floundered amid mounting allegations of data manipulation the allegations are centered around two researchers hoau yan wang of cuny in new york city and cassava s own lindsay burns who had previously published two studies related to the brain late last year the journal of neuroscience issued an expression of concern regarding data published by the two researchers at the end of 2021 reports retraction watch this means that the editors of the paper have doubts over the accuracy of the data published last month another study authored by the pair that is key to cassava s findings was hit with an expression of concern from neurobiology of aging what is alzheimer s alzheimer s disease is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain in which build up of abnormal proteins causes nerve cells to die this disrupts the transmitters that carry messages and causes the brain to shrink more than 5 million people suffer from the disease in the us where it is the 6th leading cause of death and more than 1 million britons have it what happens as brain cells die the functions they provide are lost that includes memory orientation and the ability to think and reason the progress of the disease is slow and gradual on average patients live five to seven years after diagnosis but some may live for ten to 15 years early symptoms loss of short term memory disorientation behavioral changes mood swings difficulties dealing with money or making a phone call later symptoms severe memory loss forgetting close family members familiar objects or places becoming anxious and frustrated over inability to make sense of the world leading to aggressive behavior eventually lose ability to walk may have problems eating the majority will eventually need 24 hour care source alzheimer s association advertisement last year new york city based law firm labaton sucharow filed a citizen s petition to the fda saying it had grave concerns about the quality and integrity of the laboratory based studies surrounding this drug candidate and supporting the claims for its efficacy retraction watch reports the law firm is representing investors who had shorted the company s stock and would financially benefit from the company s price decreasing only weeks late plos one retracted five papers from wang the new york times reports that cuny has launched an investigation into wang which is still ongoing the wall street journal reported in november of last year before the first expression of concern was issued the the sec had launched an investigation into the company as it potentially defrauded investors by using manipulated trial data to inflate its stock price cassava received funding from the national institutes of health to develop the drug and is now facing an investigation from that agency as well the times reports the drug was apparently able to reverse the cognitive decline associated with alzheimer s in two thirds of patients no other drug on the market is able to do that only one drug may have the ability to even slow down the cognitive decline biogen s aduhelm which many also doubt even works has been rejected for medicare coverage in the u s and whose developers have also been accused of improper data practices experts noticed that some fluctuations in biomarkers reported in the studies did not make sense and cast doubts over the study s findings that type of discrepancy really raises questions in terms of the rigor as well as the reliability of these results dr william hu a neurologist at rutgers university told the times another study found that the drug could restore the shape of some proteins in the brain which dr thomas südhof a neuroscientist at stanford university said there s just no possibility no rational way this could happen per the times elisabeth bik an expert on image manipulation who has also found other studies that have used doctored photos reported that she had found signs of cassava doctoring visuals in its study the company s stock has suffered as a result of the allegations it was as high as 90 91 per share in early november before the wsj report was released and has since cratered to 22 46 as of closing bell tuesday

provided by xinhua out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius said by matthew rusling washington april 19 xinhua as the u s federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates higher fear of a u s recession is mounting but there remains no consensus among economists and analysts with some maintaining that the u s economy can avoid a downturn my expectation is that we will see a u s economic recession by the end of this year or the beginning of next year desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua adding that this will occur as the fed shifts to a more hawkish monetary policy stance to fight inflation there is no recent precedent of the federal reserve having had to reduce inflation by as much as 4 percentage points without precipitating an economic recession lachman said one factor that makes a recession likely is that fed tightening will occur at a time of bubble like conditions in the u s stock market and housing market lachman said consumer prices soared 8 5 percent in the 12 months through march according to the u s labor department and many economists believe the fed s coming rate hikes to avoid more inflation will spark an economic downturn provided by xinhua economists at deutsche bank expressed concerns of inflation over the next two years and a recent bloomberg survey of economists tagged the odds of recession at 27 5 percent up over 7 percentage points from just a month earlier goldman sachs group inc said the odds of recession were about 35 percent over the next two years former treasury secretary larry summers has in recent months warned of an impending recession with the odds of a hard landing in the next two years better than half and quite possibly two thirds or more according to a recent bloomberg interview but other analysts expressed optimism james paulsen chief investment strategist of the leuthold group a u s investment research firm told xinhua inflation is up and there s this narrative that the fed is woefully behind the curve and the only way they can shut it down is over tightening and killing off the economy but if you just step back from the emotion i don t see the list of things that generally produce recession paulsen said we ve got some of the greatest job creation we ve ever had going paulsen said recession generally occurs when there are bad balance sheets but we don t have bad balance sheets paulsen said household debt to income ratios are the best they ve been in the past 25 years paulsen noted liquidity s never been this high in the household sector he said noting there are around 18 trillion u s dollars in deposit assets provided by xinhua corporations made record profits in 2021 and banks are also in good shape inflation is high there s no doubt about that but it s special circumstances where you deal with supply shortages as a result of restricting the labor supply due to covid he said but i don t see where that alone necessarily is a cause of recession he said tightening is occurring no doubt and with about a one year lag that will certainly slow the growth of the economy but we tighten in every recovery and i don t think that means we recess he said typically once the fed starts to tighten it takes several more years before we have recession he said one of the fed s main challenges is to get inflation back down to its 2 percent mandate via rate hikes without going too fast and furious which could sharply boost unemployment taken at face value historical patterns suggest the fed faces a hard path to a soft landing goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius wrote in a research report on sunday as quoted by bloomberg quint a joint venture involving bloomberg indeed out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years hatzius noted however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently hatzius said hatzius projected the odds of a recession in the next 12 months were around 15 percent as quoted by bloomberg quint provided by xinhua the international monetary fund imf s baseline forecast shows a softening of u s economic activity but at the moment we don t forecast a recession tobias adrian director of the imf s monetary and capital markets department said tuesday having said that there are risks around that baseline adrian said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank if further adverse shocks are hitting further supply shocks or further adverse shocks to real activity certainly we could see worse outcomes than what is forecasted in the baseline he added the u s economy is on track to grow 3 7 percent in 2022 0 3 percentage point lower than the january projection before growth moderating to 2 3 percent in 2023 according to the imf s newly released world economic outlook report

two new cruise operations found themselves the unintended targets of the international sanctions imposed on russia and its financial institutions after the invasion of ukraine while many of the worlds cruise lines scheduled to operate in europe this summer have been working to reorganize itineraries to replace ports especially in the eastern baltic swan hellenic and havila voyages have the added challenge that they had financed their new ships through russia s gtlk a well established financier to the maritime industry many people were surprised that gtlk the state transport leasing company and its subsidiaries in europe and asia were not included in the early rounds of sanctions led by the united states and european union many of russia s banks and their leasing arms were included in the first rounds of sanctions but gtlk which is under the direct control of russia s ministry of transport and has a large portfolio in transportation rolling stock aviation and maritime leasing was not targeted until april 8 both of the cruise operators however had anticipated that gtlk from which they are leasing their vessels would likely be part of the sanctions finnvera and finnish export credit granted an export credit and a buyer credit guarantee to a division of gtlk in december 2021 valued at over 200 million for two cruise ships being built at helsinki shipyard for swan hellenic the 12 year agreements were for the sh minerva which was delivered to swan hellenic late in 2021 and a sister ship sh vega which was recently floated out at the shipyard the leasing agreements between swan hellenic and the subsidiaries of jsc gtlk each provided for a purchase option we exercised these irrevocable purchase options at a relatively early stage well before the recent eu decision explains a spokesperson for swan hellenic on march 13 for sh minerva and on march 31 for sh vega the company notified gtlk as the leaseholder that it was exercising its options to buy the vessels the legal procedures transferring ownership of the vessels to swan hellenic are now therefore at an advanced stage and due to be completed imminently the company says while noting that swan hellenic and its subsidiaries banks or sub contractors were not cited in the sanctions swan hellenic reports that operations of its first cruise ship are continuing and the second vessel is due to start her maiden voyage at the end of may a third larger cruise ship recently named sh diana is under construction and due to be delivered early in 2023 norway s havila voyages however said today havila capella was temporarily taken out of service on thursday april 14th after conditions in the company s financing meant that the ship s insurance was affected by sanctions against russia havila launched its coastal voyages late in 2021 with the first of four cruise ships with the plan to lease all the ships from subsidiaries of gtlk a hong kong based leasing company which is a subsidiary of gtlk took delivery of the ship from the tersan shipyard and is leasing it to havila which notes that the ship is registered and operates under norwegian regulations however uncertainties in the sanctions caused issues with their liability insurance and forced the ship to cancel its scheduled departure from bergen havila kystruten is working along all conceivable channels to find a short term solution to get havila capella back into operation as soon as possible the company wrote in a stock exchange filing on april 19 in the company s assessment a short term solution requires the participation of the norwegian authorities in relation to sanctions against russia they anticipated the potential issues with the financing of the vessels and reported in march they began working to refinance the one ship that has been delivered and three still under construction in turkey and currently owned by tersan they however did not anticipate the insurance issue and found themselves caught in a loophole that prevents the ship from sailing saying that the ship is norwegian except for rent payments being sent to the gtlk subsidiary havila is proposing a temporary solution to resume sailing the company is also days away from the scheduled delivery of its second vessel which is due to enter service next month the third and fourth vessels are due to be completed later this year
file photo william bill ackman ceo and portfolio manager of pershing square capital management speaks during the sohn investment conference in new york city by svea herbst bayliss reuters billionaire investor william ackman liquidated a 1 1 billion bet on netflix on wednesday locking in a loss of more than 400 million as the streaming service s stock plunged following news that it lost subscribers for the first time in a decade ackman s hedge fund pershing square capital management made an abrupt u turn selling the 3 1 million shares it had bought just three months ago as netflix shares tumbled 35 to 226 19 in january the investor funneled over 1 billion into the streaming service just days after a disappointing forecast for subscriptions pushed the share price lower now a second bout of negative news about subscribers the company said it had lost 200 000 prompted the fund manager to turn his back on a company he had showered with praise only weeks before in a brief statement announcing the move ackman said proposed business model changes including incorporating advertising and going after non paying customers made sense but would make the company too unpredictable in the short term while netflix s business is fundamentally simple to understand in light of recent events we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty he wrote advertisement advertisement pershing square which now invests 21 5 billion buys shares in only about a dozen companies at a time and needs a high degree of predictability in its portfolio companies ackman said rather than wait around for things to improve at netflix ackman locked in losses that are calculated to be more than 400 million people familiar with the portfolio said after the sale pershing square s portfolios are off roughly two percent for the year ackman said netflix said it had lost 200 000 subscribers in its first quarter falling well short of its modest predictions that it would add 2 5 million subscribers its decision in early march to suspend service in russia after it invaded ukraine resulted in the loss of 700 000 members profitable hedges helped pershing square survive the early days of the pandemic in 2020 and then again in recent months as interest rates began to rise the last three years have been among the best in the hedge fund s lifetime including a 70 2 gain in 2020 advertisement advertisement but ackman also acknowledged in his statement on wednesday that he had learned from leaner times when his fund backed valeant pharmaceuticals a disastrous bet that cost the hedge fund billions in losses one of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis that is why we did so here he wrote reporting by svea herbst bayliss with additional reporting by tiyashi datta in bengaluru editing by sriraj kalluvila bernard orr

when you get home after work do you hang up your coat put down your bag and kick off your shoes or do you skip that last part preferring to stay shod rather than get out the slippers following a report by scientists proving that the soles of our shoes can carry all manner of nasty organisms into the house this particular point of etiquette is a hotter topic than ever especially when it comes to having guests over for some there s no greater insult than being asked to de shoe at the door while others hate having road residue tramped through their immaculate halls or fear a stiletto heel will damage their expensive floors so who is right the shoes off brigade or the shoes on crowd five brilliant writers argue their case and an etiquette expert gives her verdict stephen webster pictured is very firm on his views on the matter and horrified by the thought of dirty shoes traipsing through his home shoes off slippers on no discussion stephen webster society jeweller should a visitor be in any doubt about what to do when they arrive at my home there s a rug at the door spelling it out quite literally it reads shoes off in block capitals that means any and all shoes wellies trainers flip flops designer heels off precious hardly along with my wife assia i just happen to be baffled i ll admit horrified by the idea of people tootling about my lovely clean home in shoes that have only recently bounced through puddles muddy verges and possibly worse so it s rather cheering to learn that there is now some scientific back up for our view that whatever is lingering on the soles of your shoes is best left at the front door to be fair i arrived at this robust footwear stance later in life although even growing up in gravesend in the sixties the notion of shoes off was if not instilled certainly inherently understood and while i don t remember my mum being a stickler for the notion she would definitely have had something to say if she saw either me or my brother head upstairs with our plimsolls on were you raised in a house that let guests wear shoes or asked to take them off stock image to be honest i didn t give the subject much thought until i met assia 26 years ago she s from russia where taking your shoes off is part of the culture as i discovered when i visited the home of one of her friends and for the first time encountered a rack just inside the front door on which to put my shoes and slippers alongside it by way of exchange now i m resolute why would anyone ever wear their dirty outdoor shoes indoors it s not fussiness just simple hygiene through my work as a bespoke jeweller i know that this shoes off policy is shared around the world in most of asia eastern europe and the middle east a refusal to do so is a sign of disrespect at the offices of my gem dealers in thailand i even take my shoes off on the street lining them up alongside the others here in the uk of course the whole issue is more complicated riven with anxieties about etiquette class and embarrassment i have friends who seem mortified that i have taken my shoes off inside their home clearly wondering if i think they re uptight but i would do it anyway besides i see taking your shoes off as a lovely symbol of welcome of shedding the world outside either way as our doormat makes clear there are no concessions chez webster whether our visitors are rock stars we ve had members of duran duran bon jovi and the sex pistols over our threshold or women who feel incomplete without a pair of towering heels there are no exemptions not even for louboutins some friends now come furnished with their own slippers and although we have had a bit of resistance from first time guests over the years it only lasts as long as it takes for assia to pop a glass of vodka in their hand and point firmly at our basket of spare slippers make yourself at home she tells them really what could be a nicer welcome than that esther walker pictured is reasonably flexible when it comes to wearing shoes in the house sometimes having a pair on while on the ground floor of her home but not upstairs take some house booties with you esther walker writer my mum who is an artist thought that dirt was healthy so i grew up in a pretty messy house she had no rules about shoes off or shoes on you did what you liked in my own house while i m more fastidious than my mum i think it s good for you but only up to a point i can t say i can bring myself to mind too much about shoes my children automatically take theirs off as soon as they get home flinging them in opposite corners of the hallway or kicking them under the sofa i take mine off before i go upstairs but yes i probably wear my shoes around the ground floor is that terrible i ve never had to consider whether i want say a plumber to remove their boots before they go upstairs to fix the boiler because i ve never met one who didn t immediately take them off without being asked but i do think there is something very odd about arriving for a party then being asked to take off your party shoes they re part of the outfit at the very least they should warn you when they issue the invitation if they don t you could take your lead from my friend who always travels with a pair of house booties just in case claudia connell pictured likes to keep her home clean but could never dream of asking guests to take their shoes off hot sticky bare feet disgust me claudia connell writer a week of meal replacement shakes meant my little black dress zipped up first time my newly highlighted hair had been blowdried and i applied my make up with extra care to complete my sophisticated cocktail party look i sported bare feet with week old chipped nail polish and heels in desperate need of an aggressive session with a pumice stone that wasn t my plan of course i left my house wearing black russell bromley heels but they were confiscated at the door why because the party hostess was one of those wretched people who insists that guests remove their footwear before they cross her threshold it s to protect the wooden floors you don t mind do you i did mind and the floors were laminate but everyone else was shoe less and i didn t want to make a scene i was wearing nude shoe liners but they d have looked even more ridiculous had i kept them on sipping champagne in my bare feet while making small talk was awkward and embarrassing i didn t stay long as i didn t want to have to use the bathroom who wants to be barefoot in someone else s loo being asked to take your shoes off when you visit someone is becoming increasingly common with house proud homeowners caring more about their flooring than the comfort of their guests it s all very well but when i visit people s homes i ve generally walked from my door to the car and then to their door no traipsing through muddy fields and cow pats i always wipe my feet carefully and if i honestly thought my shoes were filthy then i would slip them off some even offer guests slippers to put on at the door but unless they re buying a brand new pair for every visitor then the idea turns my stomach how many other hot sticky feet have been in those slippers before me it hasn t happened to me yet but there are some hosts who allow people to keep their shoes on provided they slip those plastic covers that look like shower caps over them hang on a minute am i having a cup of tea a biscuit and a gossip or appearing in an episode of silent witness i m always amused when the shoes off homes have pet dogs dogs dribble and moult and drag their bottoms across the floor i don t what do they imagine their dogs are walking in when they let them off the lead i can guarantee my soles are more hygienic than their mutts paws there was one dinner party where the hosts had gone to great trouble with the food and table decoration but i couldn t take any of it in because all i could focus on was my feet not coming into contact with the bare feet of the person sitting next to me when it comes to my own home i m obsessively clean and tidy but i d never dream of telling guests to take their shoes off if mud gets on the wooden floor i ll wipe it off if it gets on the stair carpet then i ll let it dry and whip out the dyson if you care more about your carpet then your visitor s comfort then don t have people over feet are ugly stains can be removed from flooring but i can t wipe clean the image of someone s hairy toes and yellow nails from my mind libby purves pictured is of the belief that the declining popularity of doormats is leading to more people asking guests to take their shoes off buy yourself a doormat or two libby purves broadcaster of all the investments you make in your home among the greatest is the doormat ideally two doormats a tough bristly one outside in the hallway if it s a flat with a metal bootscraper in the country then a miraculously absorbent one beyond to suck out all remaining moisture turtle mats are great and no i have never had a free one this is honest journalism on top of that provision one vital lesson to instil in children and if necessary partners and regular friends is the art of wiping your feet not a quick token dancefloor shuffle but fierce pressurised movement back and forth on the outer bristles then a swish on the turtle within the sacred domestic space you should be almost able to eat your dinner off the soles of everyone s shoes frankly i blame the decline of the british doormat for this fashion for demanding that every visitor goes shoeless beyond the hall as if in an eastern temple taking wellington boots off is reasonable though it is polite to offer slippers instead any decent soul will comply with the anxiety of those householders who do insist on ordinary street shoes being removed fiddly laces and all but it is not a hospitable necessity and can lead to embarrassing sock hole toe moments or very cold bare feet if you have acres of white fluffy carpet in one room just keep the dirty beast visitors out of it if you must if you have a baby crawling everywhere remember what our grannies would say you eat a peck of dirt before you die a peck by the way is about 16 pints kathy lette asks her guests to take their shoes off but not only for physical comfort but also for the social ease put your barest foot forward kathy lette novelist men are so much luckier than women not only do they not have to give birth but they only require three pairs of shoes for their whole adult lives during a recent spring clean i was amazed to discover that i own 58 pairs of shoes and as i m only 5ft 3in most of the heels are high i was once invited to a party to honour al pacino desperate to impress i wore my highest shoes but the razor thin heel kept catching in the thick shag pile carpet meaning i was reduced to walking like a dressage horse so as not to trip over the hollywood star was already casting dubious looks in my direction when i suddenly succumbed to gravity and toppled face forward onto the floor before him so this current trend for hostesses encouraging guests to remove their shoes is a blessed relief for me not just for the physical comfort but also for the social ease kicking off shoes lowers the tone staid women suddenly start dancing as barefoot bopping won t lead to bunions toffs who normally send their shirts out to be stuffed casually stretch bare tootsies across coffee tables it s also interesting anthropologically what i ve noticed is that the better dressed a man is the more holes in his socks while more humble fellas hosiery is clean and pristine the same goes for women the more posh the frock the more flaky the pedicure the more plain the smock the more polished the toes i m now suggesting all my guests cast off their shoes and just put their best feet forward the etiquette expert s verdict liz wyse editor of debrett s etiquette if you re too proud of your wall to wall white carpet or polished boards to allow shoes inside send a subtle signal by greeting guests in slippers or socked feet a reasonably observant guest should note the prevailing shoes free culture and volunteer to remove their own footwear if your guest remains oblivious you can always soften the blow with a rueful apology i m sorry i know i m completely obsessed with the carpet rugs floor but would you mind taking off your shoes i make everyone do it as for guests always be prepared to remove your shoes in other people s houses that means ensuring that your feet are shod in respectable looking socks or tights no holes visible that are clean and sweet smelling if you are appalled by the idea of spending an evening in an unshod state why not slip a pair of fold up slippers or delicate ballet flats into your handbag

by timothy gardner washington reuters the biden administration on tuesday opened applications for a 6 billion program to help nuclear power plants struggling with rising costs as it seeks to stop the generators from shutting down under its goal of transitioning to clean energy the u s nuclear power industry s 93 reactors generate more than half of the country s carbon free electricity according to the department of energy doe but 12 reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful in addition safety costs have soared after the 2011 tsunami at japan s fukushima plant and after the sept 11 2001 attacks the industry produces toxic waste currently stored on site at plants across 28 states the doe said it will take applications from owners of nuclear plants for the first round of funding in its civil nuclear credit program until may 19 it will prioritize reactors that have already announced their intention to close the program intended for plants in states with competitive electricity markets was funded by the infrastructure bill that passed last year energy secretary jennifer granholm said the administration is using every tool available to get the country powered by clean energy by 2035 a goal of president joe biden s including by prioritizing the existing nuclear power fleet the 6 billion in funding is designed to be distributed gradually the doe can appropriate 1 2 billion over the next four years with the last four year period ending in 2035 officials said in february they hope the program can begin to help one or more plants this year pg e nyse whose plan to shut its two diablo canyon reactors in california in 2024 and 2025 has been approved by the state legislature and regulators indicated that the nuclear credit program would not change its plan immediately as a regulated utility we are required to follow the energy policies of the state said pg e spokesperson suzanne hosn when asked about the doe program at this time the state has not changed its position regarding the future of nuclear energy in california the program could help a range of utilities including pseg and constellation energy corp which currently do not have plan to shut plants the plan was praised by senator joe manchin a conservative democrat who has so far stymied biden s clean energy legislation in the massive build back better bill which included billions of additional dollars in tax credits for nuclear power generation manchin has said in recent weeks he could go along with narrower legislation that makes investments to fight climate change this program will keep our reactors operating preserving american jobs reducing emissions and bolstering our energy security manchin said
palo alto calif abortion opponents have been actively trying to pass legislation to limit access to abortions even though some doctors say emergency contraception like plan b is not a form of abortion women s reproductive rights advocates are worried restrictions will make accessibility for the pill even more difficult dr mary jacobson is an obgyn who studied at stanford and has dedicated her career to women s health i am very concerned about women s reproductive rights jacobson said jacobson said it s more important than ever to educate people about emergency contraception to prevent the need for abortion in the first place emergency contraception is to be taken by women who have had unprotected intercourse prior to pregnancy jacobson said unprotected intercourse could mean that they have contraception but they misused it let s say they missed a few days of birth control or the condom broke or unfortunately maybe they got sexually assaulted so it s taking a medication after unprotected intercourse prior to pregnancy jacobson said there s a misconception that it can cause termination of pregnancy but it cannot it most commonly works by preventing or delaying ovulation however these misconceptions have caused there to be a lack of access to emergency contraception pills if the patient wants to get it over the counter the pharmacies may not stock it jacobson said the pharmacies may have it behind the counter where the patient has to ask for it and that can be very uncomfortable to ask a person for it and with other customers around them so that violates their privacy patients may not be able to afford it even patients with insurance maybe they don t want their on their parents insurance plan and they don t want to use the insurance one patient who says she experienced judgment when seeking emergency contraception is alisabeth macon she lives in arizona one time we did have a condom break the only place to go is like the two pharmacies in town macon said and this is when it was still behind the counter and it was like 50 or 60 so being like 22 years old that isn t the easiest thing to get and then also just having to go up and ask for it and having the pharmacist s kind of look at you like you re a horrible person macon says she always wanted to have kids but she wanted them when she was ready for them now she says she s been blessed with two children by waiting to become a mom i own a house i have a good job i can provide for my kids macon said and my mom was a single mom and she can never do those things so i feel like she had kids before she was ready and so it was kind of nice to have kids when i wanted to have kids and be excited for them and to be able to take care of however she says lack of access is still a big issue in her small town that s why she got involved with alpha medical a telemedicine company with a focus on women s health and a mission to provide access to care for some of the country s most underserved in rural areas across the u s jacobson is alpha s chief medical officer the woman can click in using her smartphone and complete a medical intake form online that gets automatically sent to one of our providers our provider reviews that and then prescribes medication that can send medication to an external pharmacy jacobson said it s one method to provide better access dr jacobson said a change in federal and state policies will have the biggest impact getting access means maybe providing more affordable options maybe providing free access to contraception jacobson said it means providing insurance for more people it means educating starting with sexual health education in school and i think that education is the key to increasing access to care to women s reproductive health she said she knows some people oppose plan b for various reasons but she believes since it takes effect before pregnancy that is when an egg attaches to the uterus it will alleviate the need for women to decide whether to end a pregnancy later on
provided by xinhua out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius said by matthew rusling washington april 19 xinhua as the u s federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates higher fear of a u s recession is mounting but there remains no consensus among economists and analysts with some maintaining that the u s economy can avoid a downturn my expectation is that we will see a u s economic recession by the end of this year or the beginning of next year desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua adding that this will occur as the fed shifts to a more hawkish monetary policy stance to fight inflation there is no recent precedent of the federal reserve having had to reduce inflation by as much as 4 percentage points without precipitating an economic recession lachman said one factor that makes a recession likely is that fed tightening will occur at a time of bubble like conditions in the u s stock market and housing market lachman said consumer prices soared 8 5 percent in the 12 months through march according to the u s labor department and many economists believe the fed s coming rate hikes to avoid more inflation will spark an economic downturn provided by xinhua economists at deutsche bank expressed concerns of inflation over the next two years and a recent bloomberg survey of economists tagged the odds of recession at 27 5 percent up over 7 percentage points from just a month earlier goldman sachs group inc said the odds of recession were about 35 percent over the next two years former treasury secretary larry summers has in recent months warned of an impending recession with the odds of a hard landing in the next two years better than half and quite possibly two thirds or more according to a recent bloomberg interview but other analysts expressed optimism james paulsen chief investment strategist of the leuthold group a u s investment research firm told xinhua inflation is up and there s this narrative that the fed is woefully behind the curve and the only way they can shut it down is over tightening and killing off the economy but if you just step back from the emotion i don t see the list of things that generally produce recession paulsen said we ve got some of the greatest job creation we ve ever had going paulsen said recession generally occurs when there are bad balance sheets but we don t have bad balance sheets paulsen said household debt to income ratios are the best they ve been in the past 25 years paulsen noted liquidity s never been this high in the household sector he said noting there are around 18 trillion u s dollars in deposit assets provided by xinhua corporations made record profits in 2021 and banks are also in good shape inflation is high there s no doubt about that but it s special circumstances where you deal with supply shortages as a result of restricting the labor supply due to covid he said but i don t see where that alone necessarily is a cause of recession he said tightening is occurring no doubt and with about a one year lag that will certainly slow the growth of the economy but we tighten in every recovery and i don t think that means we recess he said typically once the fed starts to tighten it takes several more years before we have recession he said one of the fed s main challenges is to get inflation back down to its 2 percent mandate via rate hikes without going too fast and furious which could sharply boost unemployment taken at face value historical patterns suggest the fed faces a hard path to a soft landing goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius wrote in a research report on sunday as quoted by bloomberg quint a joint venture involving bloomberg indeed out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years hatzius noted however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently hatzius said hatzius projected the odds of a recession in the next 12 months were around 15 percent as quoted by bloomberg quint provided by xinhua the international monetary fund imf s baseline forecast shows a softening of u s economic activity but at the moment we don t forecast a recession tobias adrian director of the imf s monetary and capital markets department said tuesday having said that there are risks around that baseline adrian said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank if further adverse shocks are hitting further supply shocks or further adverse shocks to real activity certainly we could see worse outcomes than what is forecasted in the baseline he added the u s economy is on track to grow 3 7 percent

jon healey los angeles times by many metrics the u s econ omy is chugging along at a healthy clip the latest readings on some key economic indicators are all good unemployment is low quarterly profits are high home construction is up retail sales continue to grow and the gross domestic product showed solid growth and yet a recent survey found that 4 in 5 americans expect a recession this year people are trying to talk themselves into a recession right now said david shulman an economist who advises ucla s anderson forecast more 100 monthly check proposed to cover high gas prices more us inflation jumped 8 5 in past year highest since 1981 more delicate dance for economy even shulman sees trouble coming however just not until 2024 that s because of the eye popping acceleration in inflation which could eventually trigger a downturn those who live in parts of the country characterized by gasoline sucking commutes and high housing costs may suffer more than others to help you understand the risks and what you can do to prepare for them here are some facts and pointers about recessions and the current economic situation what is a recession the national bureau of economic research a private nonprofit not a government agency is the group that economists regard as the official scorekeeper of recessions it defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months typically that s meant at least two consecutive three month periods when gdp has declined taking inflation into account that s the technical definition what recessions mean in human terms is a surge in unemployment as demand for goods and services drops causing businesses to lay off workers which further suppresses demand for goods and services with companies retrenching instead of expanding the unemployed have a tough time finding work which exacerbates the slowdown it s a vicious cycle that the government tries to interrupt by pumping cash into the economy normally by paying unemployed workers a portion of their previous wages for several months but also occasionally by sending stimulus checks or enacting tax holidays in the most recent recession the federal government and california s state government opted for stimulus checks there is also a psychological dimension when consumers lose confidence in the economy and rein in their spending that s happening now according to the conference board s survey of consumer confidence which found the public growing more pessimistic about the future despite feeling better about their current situation when you see 6 for gasoline shulman said you feel poor in some people s minds that s a recession what causes a recession economists point to a variety of factors that can send the economy into reverse the u s has endured three recessions so far in the 21st century and each had a different cause the downturn from march to november 2001 was tied to steep losses in the stock market first when the dot com bubble burst in late 2000 then when terrorists flew planes into the world trade center on 9 11 the great recession which ran from december 2007 to june 2009 was caused by a financial industry meltdown tied to the subprime mortgage fiasco and the brief but extreme downturn from february to april 2020 was a consequence of covid 19 and the government ordered restrictions on travel and commerce the common thread in each of those was a sharp decline in demand either businesses and individuals had less money available or they weren t able to spend what they had the situation is dramatically different today demand is extremely strong because there s plenty of money sloshing around the economy a situation created by rock bottom interest rates high employment rising wages and aggressive federal borrowing and spending to cover stimulus checks among many other things but file this one in the too much of a good thing category because the demand has greatly exceeded the supply of goods and services everywhere you look you see nothing but an insane degree of consumption said economist christopher thornberg founding partner of beacon economics in los angeles defenders of the big federal aid packages say that millions of americans affected by covid needed a rescue but thornberg counters no matter how you slice it the federal government overstimulated this economy at an insane level over this last year rapidly rising stock and home prices helped increase u s household net worth by more than a third since the start of the pandemic americans are flush we feel rich and therein lies the problem thornberg said we re not rich the economy does not have the capacity to produce products at the level people want them in other words this is false wealth this mismatch which some economists blame entirely on the federal reserve pumping money into the system and others attribute at least in part to the covid related problems in supply chains at factories and in service industries exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine is driving prices up and prices will continue to go up thornberg said until demand and production capacity are back in synch in response the federal reserve is starting to raise interest rates making it more expensive to borrow money that change will affect businesses as well as consumers jim doti an economics professor at the center for economic research at chapman university said the fed is also dropping hints that it will start selling some of the bonds in its portfolio doing so would increase upward pressure on interest rates and reduce the supply of money the one two punch of higher prices and higher interest rates applies the brakes to a growing economy the fed s goal is a soft landing in which the tighter money supply eases demand while still allowing for some economic growth but there are plenty of economists who fear that the fed waited too long and acted too meekly allowing inflation to become powerful enough to trigger a downturn there is no soft landing thornberg said the horse is out of the barn what can you do to defend yourself certified financial planner barbara ginty host of future rich podcast said the covid 19 pandemic highlighted the importance of a personal emergency fund she has heard clients call themselves emergency proof but 2020 proved that you yourself might not have an emergency but you cannot prevent an emergency of a global event having that good emergency fund can alleviate a lot of that financial stress she said nevertheless millions of americans don t have a stash to draw on if things go south according to a bankrate survey last year a little more than half of the people sampled didn t have enough saved to cover three months of expenses and a quarter of the people sampled had no emergency fund at all so although the economy is still humming along it s a good idea to try to set aside some money and the place to start financial advisers say is by creating a budget budgets are your financial strat egy said author jesse mecham founder of the personal finance site youneedabudget com and a strategy can involve cutting back but it doesn t have to mean that specifically or necessarily a budget is just a plan it s not a task master it s not a warden and you re now in prison creating a budget is mainly an exercise in figuring out where your money is coming from and going to and seeing which things can be adjusted and which ones can t the main point mecham and ginty said is understanding where your money is going and what s most important to you you just have all these different options if you re very aware of what your money is doing and what you need it to do mecham said most americans just really aren t aware of what their money is doing they re very reactive thanks in part to the stimulus checks americans saved far more during the early days of the pandemic than they had in the previous four decades although the savings rate has since come back down to earth how much you ll need in your emergency fund depends on your personal situation and your dependents ginty said but having enough to cover one month of expenses is a good starting point mecham said a financial cushion can give people time to find the silver lining in a downturn for a lot of people it s an opportunity he said you can be more picky about the job you accept more picky about the clients you choose to work for more strategic about how to share child duties
one of the three contenders for the republican nomination in alabama s u s senate race told his business supporters that he wants more legal immigrants to prevent americans from getting wage raises if there s a shortage of labor you ve got to pay labor more to do the jobs that you need done business owner and u s army veteran mike durant said in a video acquired by breitbart news during a march 10 zoom call with supporters at an alabama consulting firm bmss inc durant complained to his business supporters that public pressure forced federal gop legislators to block a business lobbying campaign in congress to admit more legal immigrants by offering more green cards why would you not want more green cards available so that people can legally come into this country and work i mean we need that this country was built on immigration it s completely illogical and it s because every decision they re making is based on politics and what s going to play well to my base versus what s right in this moment for the people that i represent durant s phrase the people that i represent refers to his business supporters and would be a considerable rejection of president donald trump s winning campaign platform in 2016 several articles have noted durant s backing from coastal investors including trump opponents who donate to his campaign via several groups those groups include the donor directed political action committees called america s promise and more perfect union alabama patriots pac a newly formed entity has embarked on an aggressive advertising campaign promoting mike durant on television and digital platforms across the state yellowhammer news reported in february in turn that group s money comes from another group yellowhammer reported alabama patriots pac on december 1 received a 1 million contribution from america s promise former cisco systems chairman and ceo and republican megadonor john chambers of palo alto california contributed 250 000 to america s promise chambers is a leading advocate for more green card workers including workers imported from india according to an october 2019 report by breitbart news many millions of indian graduates should be allowed to take white collar jobs from u s college graduates says a coalition of top u s business leaders the u s india strategic partnership forum is a spin off of the u s chamber of commerce it is run by the current and former ceos and presidents of cisco boeing deloitte adobe caterpillar dell fedex medtronic marriott pepsico and other companies the forum s 20 page pitch says the us india strategic partnership forum usispf is committed to creating the most powerful strategic partnership between the u s and india promoting bilateral trade is an important part of our work but our mission reaches far beyond this it is about business and government coming together in new ways to create meaningful opportunities that have the power to change the lives of citizens amid the corporate blurb the group admits it wants to allow the free movement of indian graduates from low wage india into the high wage u s economy saying usispf s workforce mobility committee will continue to make the case for the free flow of skilled labor in both countries the group is led by former cisco ceo john chambers and it met with india s prime minister narendra modi on october 21 breitbart reported in april fortune com reported former president donald trump has vowed to drive the 10 house republicans who voted to impeach him out of office but gop donors political action committees and even some democrats poured money into those candidates coffers 2 900 from john chambers the former executive chairman and chief executive officer of cisco systems inc other donors include the founder of asurion and founders advisors durant s company pinnacle solutions based in huntsville alabama provides logistics and training services to the u s military durant s campaign did not respond to questions from breitbart news durant s push for more green card workers is great for investors nationwide but is also a direct threat to the jobs and wages of many american workers in alabama including nurses engineers software experts accountants and many professionals at the state s universities and durant s push for more green cards also threatens to push alabama further behind the rest of the united states coastal investors vs the heartland during the last several decades the u s federal government has extracted 45 million immigrants from their home countries according to a pro migration site newamericaneconomy org but just 163 000 of the migrants or one third of one percent live in alabama and more than 99 percent live in other states this means that 99 percent of any new inflow of green card workers will settle in other states primarily the coastal states of new york california florida and texas the migrants movement into those other states will minimize economic incentives for coastal investors to hire alabamians in far away alabama when republicans champion mass immigration they re reducing any incentives for business to come into their own states said mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies he said that american employees in alabama and their towns are kept low status less prosperous and less dynamic because mass immigration is rendering the people irrelevant to coastal investors for example alabama gained only 182 million in late stage venture capital investments in 2020 according to a report by ssti org those investments added up to just 0 12 percent of the 156 billion invested nationwide the vast majority went to states whose economies were inflated by imported workers consumers and renters such as california new york and texas mike durant s plan is about as sensible as the university of alabama agreeing to start on the 99 yard line and letting the opponent start on the one yard line responded jay palmer an alabama based immigration and human trafficking adviser who was an immigration advisor to president donald trump in august 2021 breitbart news reported a major study by west coast investors which showed that the vast majority of wealth generated by an immigration amnesty would flow to the coastal states because that is where migrants prefer to live for example the investors data showed that alabama would gain just 1 1 billion of a projected national gain of 121 billion the government delivered population of low cost foreign tech workers into california for example has helped create 11 trillion in stock value for investors in one section of silicon valley but that inflow also minimizes investors interest in american graduates especially alabama s workers this economics of the investors one for you two for me migration policy is rarely recognized by gop politicians in the heartland states few gop politicians or even democrats understand the scale and impact of the migration policies backed by their local chambers of commerce or out of state investors this investor push is designed to steer wages and wealth away from the ordinary americans who backed trump in 2016 and toward the investor class who turned on trump to support candidate joe biden in 2020 tilting the playing field in alabama even when jobs are created in alabama durant s plan is unfair to alabama s graduates who need jobs and careers at decent wages palmer added i encourage him to go to the graduations at the university of alabama alabama state or auburn and tell the graduating classes that they re now in competition with people for the same job and lower wages he said the federal government migration policy tilts the labor market within the states including alabama against american graduates it tilts the market by allowing employers to hire foreign graduates with the dangled promise of government provided green cards for them and their families palmer said employers have to pay americans with cash which reduces the employers profits and stock values but the government allows employers to pay foreign graduates with the non cash deferred bonus of government provided green cards that are worth at least 500 000 he said green cards are extremely valuable because they allow foreigners and their children to live and work in the united states they can also be used as tickets for citizenship which would enable the foreign graduates to bring their chain migration families into the united states the dangled green cards have helped create roughly 1 5 million imported white collar workers nationwide mainly from india and china the reduced wages made possible by the green card programs spike the investors wealth on wall street for example fortune 500 companies lost 100 billion in stock value when trump blocked the 2020 inflow of additional h 1b and l 1 visa workers most of whom hope to get green cards according to a pro business study the dangled green cards also help employers hire cheap foreign workers in alabama for jobs that would otherwise provide a good living to alabama voters and their families the variety of jobs that green card workers fill is shown on the myvisajobs com site for example the data for 2020 shows that companies applied to get hundreds of green cards as bonuses to migrants with jobs titles such as poultry processor mechanical engineer catfish packager business analytics specialist nanny quantitive modeling analyst assistant professor concrete pumping specialist aircraft technician chinese specialty food cook human resources manager prep cooks design engineer and accountants in many cases the indentured foreign workers must stay on the job for low wages long hours and several years before the employers apply for the bonus prize of a green card the resident population of green card workers helps lower wages and raise rents for americans throughout alabama but many investors and progressives are cheering for more immigrants even though at least 10 million american men have been pushed to the economic sidelines by employers preferences for younger healthier and more compliant migrants many of those americans were being pulled off the economic sidelines in 2020 by trump s low immigration high wage boom immigration politics this business cheerleading for more more and more legal immigrants to take more jobs rent more houses and fill more markets is accompanied by frequent declarations that of course illegal immigration is bad why would you not want more green cards available so that people can legally come into this country and work durant said may 10 what we need to stop is illegal immigration if you make it harder to come here and work legally more people are going to do it illegally it s certainly important not to encourage illegal immigration but it s equally important actually more important to raise the number of immigrants we re bringing into the country said new york times columnist gail collins given the very low birthrate in america we ve got to attract all the willing workers we can she said on april 11 investors wealthy people and most politicians do not care about the impact of immigration on ordinary americans said palmer we know they don t care because if they did they would have more than two sentences on immigration policy on their website he said durant s opponents rep mo brooks r al and former business council of alabama president and ceo katie britt have positions staked out on the immigration issue posted to their websites as your senator i will work to make sure that we pass immigration laws that are aimed at protecting american workers says the site for rep mo brooks r al as long as there are foreign workers who are willing to work for lower wages than americans special interests will continue to undercut american workers by falsely claiming that immigration is necessary to address chronic labor shortages the biden border crisis is also unfair to those that come to america the right way legally in pursuit of the american dream says the website for katie britt i support legal immigration that promotes growth for alabama families jobs and communities in april she added additional statements durant s website touts his support for former president donald trump s border wall and his opposition to illegal immigration mike durant believes we need to build the wall that president trump started but joe biden suspended says durant s website he opposes any pathway to citizenship that rewards lawbreakers and would deport illegals back to their country of origin forcing them to come here through legal channels however durant acknowledged he has more to learn about u s immigration protocol i don t know the green card process as well as i need to durant told his allies at bmss i plan to study up on that a little bit more

through no fault of their own developing countries face a perfect storm of famine political upheaval and debt crises russia s invasion of ukraine and the western led sanctions it triggered are partly to blame as are covid 19 lockdowns in advanced economies which deprived poor countries of vital tourism and export revenue millions of lives are now at risk but mitigation is possible it should start at this month s spring meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank policymakers have much to address starting with spiralling food prices the russia ukraine conflict involving countries that between them supply 29 of the world s wheat has contributed to a 67 increase in wheat prices since the beginning of this year export bans imposed by other wheat producers are also fuelling price increases as is a fertiliser shortage because of reduced supplies from belarus and russia unsurprisingly famine is spreading the first countries to be hit are those that were in desperate straits prior to russia s invasion including afghanistan the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia nigeria pakistan sudan south sudan syria venezuela and yemen rapidly joining them are countries that rely on imported grain and were already facing acute food insecurity such as burundi djibouti el salvador eswatini guatemala honduras lebanon lesotho madagascar mozambique and namibia united nations world food programme executive director david beasley recently issued a stark warning if you think we ve got hell on earth now you just get ready if we neglect northern africa northern africa s coming to europe if we neglect the middle east middle east is coming to europe rising food prices and hunger will make riots and political upheaval more likely even before the ukraine war began people had been plunged into crisis in afghanistan ethiopia myanmar somalia syrian refugee camps yemen and elsewhere in march large scale protests erupted in countries including cameroon india pakistan spain and sri lanka governments that can take preventive action are already doing so egypt for example which imports around 80 of its wheat from russia and ukraine recently introduced a price cap to counter the soaring cost of unsubsidised bread the government already subsidises bread for most of the population the government also announced an economic aid package totalling 130 million egyptian pounds us 7 million these measures were made possible by assistance from the imf and saudi arabia but many countries have yet to receive such help failure to cooperate is driving famine and conflict astonishingly global stocks of rice wheat and maize the world s three major staples are apparently at historic highs even stocks of wheat the commodity most affected by the ukraine war are well above levels during the 2007 2008 food price crisis while estimates suggest that about three quarters of russian and ukrainian wheat exports had already been delivered before the invasion a serious debt crisis is also developing as many low income countries stretched to their limit by covid 19 are hit by higher food and fuel prices lower tourism revenues reduced access to international capital markets trade and supply chain disruptions depressed remittances and a historic surge in refugee flows developing country debt has soared to a 50 year high at about 250 of government revenues around 60 of countries that were eligible for the pandemic related g20 debt service suspension initiative are experiencing or at high risk of debt distress moreover slower global growth and rising inflation together with tighter financial conditions in richer countries are spurring capital outflows from developing economies forcing them to devalue their currencies and increase interest rates as world bank president david malpass recently noted never have so many countries experienced a recession at once malpass added that advanced economies stimulus policies have helped to make matters worse by fuelling price rises and increasing inequality around the world finding a genuinely global solution to these problems is now vital in past debt crises rich countries used the imf and world bank to push the adjustment burden onto developing economies arguing that they must undertake reforms before receiving assistance but the most potent forces buffeting indebted low income economies today are global and beyond their control and imf and world bank member countries must pool resources and cooperate to address them the good news is that powerful shareholders in these institutions have proven capable of collective action last august for example they agreed to a new us 650 billion allocation of special drawing rights the imf s reserve asset but because special drawing rights are distributed according to countries imf quotas most of the allocation went to the largest economies worse still major imf and world bank shareholders have failed to channel resources to where they are most needed instead to limit their possible exposure to any losses they keep insisting on conditions that prevent rapid deployment this approach also threatens to hinder the imf s new resilience and sustainability trust and the world bank group s emergency financing a far bolder collective approach is now required the united states china japan the european union and the united kingdom depend on global security and prosperity they must work together to prevent famine conflict and a developing country debt crisis that will tip the world into recession they can prevent famine by acting in concert to calm global wheat and other grain markets and to take measures to keep exports flowing they can reduce the risk of conflict by not hobbling emergency imf and world bank assistance with conditionality and they can build on the g20 debt initiative by creating a debt restructuring mechanism in which they all participate two core elements are crucial to managing today s developing country crisis powerful countries must refrain from beggar thy neighbour trade fiscal and monetary policies that wreak havoc on developing economies and they must use their combined resources in the imf and the world bank to act quickly and unconditionally to avert disaster the challenges facing poorer countries are unprecedented and that means the cooperative response from richer economies must be too

relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which

productive capacity of any particular field geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and

insights no germany isn t the world s most crypto friendly country by sam reynolds what s the first thing you associate eu with when it comes to business devastatingly high taxes and a fierce bureaucracy so it s of some surprise when germany recently took top spot away from singapore as the world s most crypto friendly jurisdiction according to a ranking by coincub the rationale no taxation on crypto if you sell it after a year of holding if you sell it over 600 euros or 648 prior to that one year point you are taxed under the usual capital gains regime to be sure this is a very

crypto derivatives trading which pumps through hundreds of billions of dollars a day in volume is also subject to the usual capital gains tax too germany s crypto friendliness quickly slips away if you look at it under this rubric a pepe meme about the complexity of defi and taxes author unknown crypto has naturally gravitated to hubs like singapore because of the lack of capital gains tax singapore is an island city with no natural resources so in order to jumpstart its development as a hub it created a tax friendly regime to encourage trade with no capital gains tax there s no need to worry about the length of holding when experimenting with new protocols you re just able to trade granted singapore has made some moves that would be considered anti crypto but this still doesn t mean the country should be considered crypto unfriendly the monetary authority of singapore mas discourages crypto trading by the general public because it knows that if enough people get rekt after leveraging their retirement savings they will complain to politicians who will ask for more oversight and control this oversight and control just isn t in the dna of a financial hub like singapore s but despite this discouragement the lack of capital gains tax still exists and anyone that wants to trade can go right ahead singapore also discourages other behavior like drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco and accompanies both with hefty vice taxes no such vice tax exists for crypto technician s take bitcoin btc returned above 40 000 which is the midpoint of its three month long price range

nasdaq wtfc announced net income of 127 4 million or 2 07 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2022 an increase in diluted earnings per common share of 31 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 total loans excluding paycheck protection program ppp loans increased by 796 million or 9 on an annualized basis core loans increased by 486 million and niche loans increased by 310 million ppp loans declined by 304 million in the first quarter of 2022 primarily as a result of processing forgiveness payments total assets increased by 109 million totaling 50 3 billion as of march 31 2022 total deposits increased by 124 million net interest income increased by 3 3 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 as follows increased 16 7 million primarily due to earning asset growth and improvement in net interest margin decreased by approximately 6 7 million due to two fewer days in the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 6 7 million due to less ppp interest income net interest margin increased by six basis points primarily due to improved earning asset mix related to liquidity deployment and lower rates on interest bearing liabilities recorded 2 5 million of net charge offs or three basis points on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 6 2 million of net charge offs or seven basis points on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2021 recorded a provision for credit losses of 4 1 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to a provision for credit losses of 9 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 the allowance for credit losses on our core loan portfolio is approximately 1 31 of the outstanding balance as of march 31 2022 down from 1 33 as of december 31 2021 see table 11 for more information non performing loans decreased to 0 16 of total loans as of march 31 2022 down from 0 21 as of december 31 2021 mortgage banking revenue increased to 77 2 million for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 53 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company recorded a 43 4 million increase in the value of mortgage servicing rights related to changes in fair value model assumptions as compared to a 6 7 million increase recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 recorded net losses on investment securities of 2 8 million in the first quarter of 2022 related to fair value changes in equity securities as compared to net losses of 1 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 tangible book value per common share non gaap decreased slightly to 59 34 as of march 31 2022 as compared to 59 64 as of december 31 2021 the decline in tangible book value per common share was primarily driven by a decline in the market value of available for sale securities as of march 31 2022 nearly offset by earnings in the quarter see table 17 for reconciliation of non gaap measures edward j wehmer founder and chief executive officer commented wintrust kicked off 2022 with an impressive first quarter reporting record quarterly pre tax pre provision income highlighted by continued expansion of net interest income our diversified loan book exhibited strong growth while credit quality remains extraordinarily good the company s future prospects remain bright as we believe our asset sensitive interest rate position will allow us to capitalize on potentially rising interest rates wintrust reported net income of 127 4 million for the first quarter of 2022 up from 98 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 additionally pre tax pre provision income non gaap was a record level of 177 8 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 146 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 mr wehmer continued the company experienced robust loan growth as loans excluding ppp loans increased by 796 million or 9 on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2022 we continue to pick up new market share and grow organically as all of our material loan portfolios exhibited strong growth in the first quarter of 2022 we are still experiencing low commercial line of credit utilization and feel confident that we can continue to grow loans given our robust loan pipelines and diversified loan portfolio our loans to deposits ratio ended the quarter at 83 6 and we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan demand mr wehmer commented net interest income increased by 3 3 million in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to earning asset growth and improvement in net interest margin the expansion in net interest income is particularly impressive when considering there were two fewer days in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 additionally the company s robust loan growth has continued to more than offset the declining contribution from ppp loans during the quarter we also improved our net interest margin and increased our quarterly net interest income run rate by increasing our investment portfolio by 1 2 billion mr wehmer stated we have maintained our asset sensitive interest rate position which we expect to benefit us as short term interest rates rise based on modeled contractual cash flows including prepayment assumptions approximately 80 of our current loan balances are projected to reprice or mature in the next 12 months further we project that assuming an immediate and parallel 25 basis point rate hike the cumulative increase to net interest income in the subsequent 12 months is approximately 40 50 million such projections incorporate a number of assumptions and could differ materially depending on various factors including competition and the macroeconomic environment mr wehmer noted we recorded mortgage banking revenue of 77 2 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 53 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 loan volumes originated for sale in the first quarter of 2022 were 896 million down from 1 3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company recorded a 43 4 million increase in the value of mortgage servicing rights related to changes in fair value model assumptions as compared to a 6 7 million increase recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 we are focused on expanding our market share of purchase originations and finding efficiencies in our delivery channels to reduce costs in light of the challenging interest rate environment based on current market conditions we expect that mortgage originations in the second quarter of 2022 will remain relatively similar to the first quarter of 2022 commenting on credit quality mr wehmer stated i am impressed that we have yet again reset our record low level of non performing loans at 0 16 of total loans as of march 31 2022 during the first quarter of 2022 we continued our practice of pursuing the resolution of non performing credits and executed a loan sale that reduced non performing loans by approximately 9 million with associated net charge offs of 413 000 the first quarter of 2022 continued the trend of benign quarterly net charge offs at 2 5 million and the company recorded a provision for credit losses of 4 1 million the allowance for credit losses on our core loan portfolio as of march 31 2022 is approximately 1 31 of the outstanding balance we believe that the company s reserves remain appropriate and we remain diligent in our review of credit mr wehmer concluded our first quarter of 2022 results continued to demonstrate the multi faceted nature of our business model which we believe uniquely positions us to be successful we expect to leverage our differentiated diversified loan portfolio to outperform peers with respect to loan growth which should allow us to continue to expand net interest income we are focused on taking advantage of market opportunities to prudently deploy excess liquidity into earning assets including core and niche loans and investment securities while maintaining an interest rate sensitive asset portfolio we are opportunistically evaluating the acquisition market which has been active for both banks and business lines of various sizes of course we remain diligent in our consideration of acquisition targets and intend to be prudent in our decision making always seeking to minimize dilution the graphs below illustrate certain financial highlights of the first quarter of 2022 as well as historical financial performance see supplemental non gaap financial measures ratios at table 17 for additional information with respect to non gaap financial measures ratios including the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures ratios graphs available at the following link summary of results balance sheet total loans excluding ppp loans increased by 796 million as core loans increased by 486 million and niche loans increased by 310 million see table 1 for more information as of march 31 2022 virtually all of the ppp loan balances originated in 2020 were forgiven with only 40 million remaining on balance sheet of which

have yet to apply for forgiveness also during the first quarter of 2022 a portion of excess liquidity was deployed increasing investments by 1 2 billion total liabilities increased 115 million in the

estimated contribution to net interest margin from net free funds is calculated using the rate paid for total interest bearing liabilities table 7 interest rate sensitivity as an ongoing part of its financial strategy the company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates by modeling many different interest rate scenarios the following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one year time horizon assuming increases of 100 and 200 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points the static shock scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static i e no growth or constant balance sheet conversely the ramp scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual parallel change in market rates over twelve months actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies the interest rate sensitivity for both the static shock and ramp scenario is as follows static shock scenario

interest margin of the company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable equivalent basis in this non gaap presentation net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the company s efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio which is calculated by dividing non interest expense by total taxable equivalent net revenue less securities gains or losses measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the company s equity the

while shanghai residents are struggling with food shortages they have an abundant supply of lianhua qingwen a traditional chinese medicine tcm composed of extracts of a dozen herbs which has been widely used to treat covid 19 in china although the effectiveness of the medicine is not supported by reliable clinical data as shanghai is distributing the herbal capsules to the city s 26 million residents false claims that the drug can effectively protect against covid 19 have flooded chinese social media in the past two weeks the stock of the drug manufacturer shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical company surged and then plunged within days thanks to online backlash traditional chinese medicine and china s soft power the chinese government has celebrated the country s success in fighting against covid 19 the spread with its zero covid policy with measures including city wide lockdown control of individual movement via a health code monitoring system massive covid testing and the application of tcm in treating the diseases some of the rumors about the drug stem directly from the government the white paper of the chinese state council fighting covid 19 china in action issued in 2020 states that tcm including lianhua qingwen have significantly reduced the incidence rate prevented cases with mild symptoms from worsening increased the cure rate lowered the fatality rate helped nucleic acid turn negative and sped up the rehabilitation of recovered covid 19 patients some critics believe that tcm has become a means for china to strengthen its economy at home while improving its soft power abroad according to the chinese pandemic control playbook local governments have to distribute tcm for free during pandemic outbreaks and lianhua qingwen has somehow out beaten other tcms and become the most popular free gift to residents under lockdown a report from china economic weekly revealed that shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical company the manufacturer of lianhua qingwen has made rmb 3 3 billion profit approximately usd 51 8 million in the past nine months by selling the herbal capsules primarily to government institutions in hong kong every household has received at least two packs of lianhua qingwen during the city s fifth wave of outbreaks shanghai is also sending lianhua qingwen to the city s 26 million residents but the free gifts are not warmly received as many of the city s residents are still struggling with food shortages shanghai based twitter user lex tang said this is the second time they distributed lianhua qingwen what we are lacking is vegetables and meat not lianhua qingwen as the drug has been distributed there has been a flood of misinformation on chinese social media about the effectiveness of lianhua qingwen false claims in social media marketing on april 6 a news report coming from shijiazhuang where lianhua qingwen s manufacturer is based appeared on the state affiliated people s daily net the news headline world health organization who recognizes tcm s effectiveness in the treatment of covid lianhua qingwen is proven reliable to prevent and treat 世防治获得可靠依据卫组织认可中医药治疗新冠疗效 连花清瘟防治获得可靠依据 immediately went viral on chinese social media and the stock of shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical company surged the report was based on a who report published on march 31 2022 that sums up an expert meeting on the evaluation of traditional chinese medicine in the treatment of covid 19 while the experts agreed that the studied tcms are beneficial in the treatment of covid 19 in mild to moderate cases the report does not mention anything about tcms effectiveness in preventing infection the who s findings were rebuked on april 10 by a video blogger shuiqian xiaoxi 睡前消息 who further questioned the credibility of the randomized controlled trials rcts of lianhuaqingwen capsules in addition to the small and randomly picked sampling size of 284 patients from nine hospitals the findings of the rcts are published in the paper efficacy and safety of lianhua qingwen which is co authored by jian zhenhu the son in law of the herbal capsules manufacturer despite the criticism the pharmaceutical company carried on its social media marketing campaign on april 12 a viral post titled lianhua qingwen decreases infection rate among close contacts by 76 密接者用连花清瘟降低阳性感染率76 was published on several online news platforms and later the title was turned into a hashtag by a number of opinion leaders who crowned shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical company as a corporation with a social conscience at the same time a large number of testimonies emerged online regarding the effectiveness of lianhua qingwen but the majority of these testimonies have a similar content structure here is one example of the promotion text circulated on social media 24歲在法國留學 得了 omicron 吃蓮花清瘟好的 無後遺症 不說支持不支持 在我身上反正是有效的 而且我是藥學部學生 已經有法語版的研究了 24 year old studying in france infected with omicron took lianhua qingwen and recovered no sequelae i won t say if i support the medicine or not but it works on me i am a pharmacy student and now related research is coming out in french later some social media opinion leaders revealed that they had been approached by online advertising agencies to promote lianhua qingwen hijacking of promotion hashtag and content a backlash followed as many are outraged by the unethical commercial promotion tactics to debunk the spread of disinformation some netizens started picking up the promotion hashtag to criticize the marketing campaign here is one example on weibo lianhua qingwen decreases infection rate among close contacts by 76 such a shameless way to earn money i have two questions 1 as big vs have they registered themselves as the medicine s spokesperson according to related requirements 2 has the percentage cited in the hashtag been approved by the regulatory body if this is indeed illegal does the regulatory body need to investigate the matter some copied the structure of promotion contents to spread mockeries of the herbal capsules i am a 24 year old studying in japan i suffered from chronic enteritis took 5 packs of lianhua qingwen and recovered my neighbour who lost both of his legs in a car accident took 10 packs and his legs grew out again his son suffered from brain damage took 10 packs and now he is studying in cambridge on april 16 dr dingxiang lilac an influential public figure on health issues shared a post written by a truck driver who complained that one third of the voluntary delivery worker manpower in shanghai had been mobilized to deliver the capsules rather than food in a separate post the health platform further addressed the medical problem involved dr lilac argues that lianhua qingwen cannot prevent covid infection and its side effects remain unknown sending it to healthy residents in shanghai is completely unnecessary and should not have been done full text xibai xu xuxibai april 16 2022 in fact a number of countries including singapore the usa australia and new zealand have either warned against the use or banned the import of lianhua qingwen for treating covid hong kong has seen one case of liver failure related to the overuse of the herbal capsules many big vs have deleted the promoted content to avoid being criticized by other netizens meanwhile the chinese censor which always acts fast in cracking down on online rumors and unverified claims has yet to remove clean claims that suggest lianhua qingwen can prevent covid infection leading some to believe the marketing campaign is a state sponsored scam
boron critical mineral rare earth the boron market is set to grow as the energy sector continues to ggrow demand for boron is expected to rise with increased demand from the technology sector 5e advanced materials nasdaq feam new york new york usa april 19 2022 einpresswire com the boron market is set to grow as the energy sector continues to advance demand for boron is expected to rise with increased demand from new and emerging sectors such as electric vehicles high efficiency wind turbines and advanced solar panels boron is not strictly a rare earth mineral but studies argue it should be included in this valuable set rare earth elements are valuable because they have magnetic and optical properties which create technologies in components such as audio speakers hard drives camera lenses mri imaging and monitors of all sorts but there is a cost to mining them as post mining purification processes create hazardous waste boron is a potential alternative providing clean and superconductive energy efficient benefits while being cheaper and more environmentally friendly research by shi bo cheng cuneyt berkdemir and a w castleman jr from the department of chemistry and physics at pennsylvania state university shows that boron doped lanthanide superatom clusters mimic the valence electron configuration of certain rare earth elements and may serve as rare earth analogs their work is published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences huge demand for near rare earthsthe rare earth market and near rare earths such as boron will see rapid growth as the development of new technologies continues the new report says that the increased demand for rare earth metals in hybrid and electric vehicles combined with the shift towards cleaner energy may drive its market growth according to global market insights inc this growing industry was valued at 13 2 billion in 2019 and is expected to hit nearly 19 8 billion by 2026 registering a cagr compound annual growth rate of 10 8 current driving factors and geographical presenceas per multiple reports there are 2 main reasons behind the increasing demand for rare earth materials over the last years they are the global demand for magnets has grown rapidly over the past few years with asia pacific leading this trend driven by various factors such as growing product requirements and increasing adoption of cost effective products in asian countries including china and japan the magnet market witnesses significant growth across different end use industries like electrical electronics e e automotive industry and others growing product demand across asia pacific has driven an increase in magnetsâ popularity globally due to their efficient manufacturing process which helps reduce costs while delivering high performance results the increased focus on clean energy is another trigger factor driving up consumption levels geographical market share breakdownin the future north america will hold a higher market share for rare earth metals than it does currently the u s â s investment in production and product r d will increase its dependence on these resources from other countries less over time and reduce their dependency so they can use this to develop new products more easily this region has a high demand for alloys colorants optical instruments and magnets which are expected to grow with an impressive cagr through the forecast period of ten years or more the asia pacific region is likely to be the largest regional market by 2026 accounting for more than 55 of global demand chinaâ s presence in this region has allowed it a significant portion of its rare earth metal reserves thus increasing its need and consumption over time the growth will be due largely in part to domestic demand and export demands from other asian countries such as japan which are also looking into acquiring these resources by any means necessary recent technological advancementsautomobile industrythe market for rare earth permanent magnets is expected to grow over the next five to ten years the major reasons behind this growth are their properties such as remanence and high coercivity that keep these magnets from losing magnetization even after long periods these metals find many applications in automotive markets and depend on them the growing market for hybrid vehicles is expected to drive a stronger demand shortly as they use more rare earth magnets per vehicle when compared with conventional cars on average each hybrid car contains 650 grams of neodymium or 1 000 grams of neodymium however theyâ re working rapidly on reducing dependence and working on alternatives for example toyotaâ s new magnet is an improvement on its predecessors because it doesnâ t require the use of rare earth elements that are scarce the publication projects for this technology to be implemented in various applications by 2021 and further developed for application in high performance vehicle drive motors by 2025 according to a press release from toyota their newest development will not need either terbium or dysprosium both relatively expensive minerals needed when creating magnets previously used within cars instead they have replaced neodymium with lanthanum and cerium two other earth metals overproduced currently making them cheap enough without being too hard to find as well this innovation including a significant amount of the culled materials will likely make way into everything we see around us wind energya new development in wind turbine technology has made direct drive turbines a viable option for customers with rare earth magnets weight is reduced and maintenance issues are eliminated making this an attractive investment opportunity the most popular generator used in wind turbines is a boron inside permanent magnet theyâ re used in offshore turbines because they produce high power density and small size with the highest efficiency at all speeds these generators offer a low lifetime cost for large annual production of energy the majority have neodymium magnets that contain smaller quantities of dysprosium to make them even more efficient when spinning faster or slower than their peak speed in 2018 most offshore wind turbines in europe used generators containing permanent magnets as did approximately 76 of those worldwide however replacing these with onshore counterparts may be possible where power and size are not crucial factors the increasing demand for gadolinium a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors is driven by its use as fresh fuel to control and regulate the coreâ s reactivity investments are being made in the energy market which will lead to an increase in consumption for example ornl announced plans to collaborate with six new industry projects advancing commercial technologies related to nuclear power the contract and many such having entailed it from 2018 are projected to increase the market demand of gadolinium in the coming years the growing demand for rare earth is also anticipated to be driven by the growth of consumer electronics and nuclear energy industries according to world nuclear association the u s has more than 30 of the worldâ s electricity generation and will contribute with two new nuclear reactors soon role of near rare earth metals in safer nuclear energythe future of nuclear power is thorium thorium generates little dangerous weapons grade waste compared to uranium and its radioactive byproducts only last for a few hundred years instead of thousands or millions like those from uranium this heavily reduces the threat associated with nuclear proliferation as we know it today the byproduct of monazite mining is a mineral containing 15 different rare earth metals and the element thorium regulators force companies to keep it safely tucked away but thereâ s little they can do with this radioactive substance that emits low level radiation however thorium is not rare and it exists in ample quantities on most continents india possesses a particularly abundant supply of thorium which means countries outside of china may want to gear up their own mining industry even though they donâ t have any control over monazite solar energy industryboron is to be utilized as an energy storage medium showing its potential benefits in the framework of solar systems development boron has been found to reduce power loss during the transfer from areas with high productivity levels such as europe where needs are higher and more demanding producing hydrogen or building up transmission lines produces a significant amount of energy loss that can range between 50 60 a cycle is described in which boron can store and transport solar energy from a production site this process would solve the long range transportation problem and address problems with storage for future use of renewable energies like solar power we discuss how using boron could help resolve both energy efficiency issues related to transporting materials over long distances while also being environmentally safe at the same time this is true for many practical energy transmission purposes even though the same amount of energy can be taken up dissociating 5 1 kilograms boria as 6 7 times smaller mass hydrogen one kilowatt day the boria could be considered a carrier for demand on stored received power from an external source transmitted to another device or object such as batteries and appliances in our homes which also use electrical currents to run them boron power systems promise to provide emission free energy from smaller reservoirs than hydrogen can using fireproof substances boriaâ s high specific binding energy and the undemanding nature as cargoes of both it and elemental boron means they will convey energy lightly and compactly even in small shipments if successfully demonstrated boron powered vehicles would show the ability to run on public roads without depending on special fueling stations since their ash could be sent away by any ordinary freight carrier operators could blast boron pellets with propane torch flames and show that they donâ t burn demonstrating that fuel fed fires during accidents were not possible the demonstration vehicles could have fuel ash reservoirs two or more times larger than would be safe on a hydrocarbon burning vehicle since equal energy would require no more than 1 7 times the size of those in current designs should allow for greater speed and range beyond what is currently available despite the initially high cost of fuels like borax there seems to be no reason why a small demonstration fleet wouldnâ t form the nucleus of a quickly growing group of voluntary early adopters demand by the energy industrythe usage of elements in clean energy technologies is not equal wind turbines and electric vehicles account for 7 or 9 respectively while permanent magnet generators used in wind turbine only accounts for 37 one should note that terbium isnâ t found in traction motors but instead itâ s a necessary element to make them work properly projections regarding future supply of near rare earth metalsfollowing the 2010â 2011 rare earth crisis and concerns over chinaâ s dominant role in the supply chain several countries have supported geological exploration and mining projects to diversify supply some of these include reopening the mountain pass mine in america which is now open following a two year shutdown after closing down temporarily from 2002 2012 and opening mount weld located on australiaâ s western border with south africa there are six mines under construction or preproduction twelve more that are currently at the feasibility stage while forty nine total preferably less are still being developed these projects will begin production in the next few years and contribute to a diversification of supply although it is impossible to determine which mines will be financially viable we can make estimates based on technical information from each project chinese companies are increasingly buying up minority shares in foreign rare earth mines allowing them to obtain information on major developments happening worldwide shenghe resources owns both the kvanefjeld project and mountain pass mine for example in the united states particularly when this has created additional tensions questions have been asked about whether or not the government should fund technical projects in which information is fed directly to chinese competitors conclusionwind turbines and electric vehicles are just two of many sectors that will need near rare earth elements in the long term itâ s unlikely thereâ ll be much change in how frequently theyâ re used compared with other technologies like ict healthcare or defenseâ but in the short term things may be different the demand for clean energy technologies should be primarily regulated by market dynamics expected between 3 and 10 depending on the scenario however thereâ s a strong political commitment to these products that may significantly impact the next decade while many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing demands of specific sectors one important consideration is how public policy affects those variables for example while itâ s assumed that markets will naturally regulate demand levels from 2018 2030 by varying rates ranging between 3 10 this number can easily change if certain policies pass through government systems additionally some businesses such as tesla continue producing good quality products even when their stocks crash because they believe strongly enough in what theyâ re doing while the world shifts towards green energy for one reason or the other it is clear that the future of green energy is heavily reliant on rare earth minerals and their untapped potential in hardware as a means to increase the efficiency of current equipment and as a means to be developed into a clean energy source of its own the global trade tensions and market fluctuations wonâ t affect scientific progress and will be a safe bet in either case the most effective way to balance the market in the short term is by curbing demand we could do this by promoting innovation and green technologies while working towards climate ambitions at a product level reducing consumption of rare earth

the infield mix in cincinnati got a bit less crowded yesterday when third baseman noelvi marte was suspended for 80 games after testing positive for boldenone a banned performance enhancing substance that loss of marte figures to substantially impact the club s plans in the first half of the season as charlie goldsmith of the cincinnati enquirer notes that the 22 year old was slated to start anywhere from six to nine of every ten games for the club this season that leaves around 50 to 70 starts in the first half of the season to be accounted for though the reds fortunately have plenty of options at their disposal who will be able to help cover for marte s absence in particular goldsmith notes that offseason addition jeimer candelario is expected to get the lion s share of playing time at third base which would open up starts at first base for the likes of christian encarnacion stand and jonathan india as well as dh starts for outfielders such as spencer steer and jake fraley while cincinnati s decision to not only decline to deal from the crowded infield mix in order to improve other areas of the roster but also bolster said infield with the addition of candelario was somewhat surprising at the time in light of marte s suspension the choice to maintain the club s depth ahead of the 2024 campaign appears to have been a wise one while marte s absence appears likely to increase the playing time available for several players the specific positions where that playing time is less certain given the number of versatile players the club has at its disposal manager david bell recently indicated to reporters including goldsmith that elly de la cruz and matt mclain would remain focused on shortstop and second base respectively in light of marte s injury while spencer steer will continue to be a regular presence in the club s outfield mix that being said bell also noted that candelario still figures to see some time at first base meanwhile each of de la cruz mclain and even steer are capable of playing all around the infield and india figures to play a mix of first second third and left field this season with encarnacion strand likely to get regular time between first base and dh some dh starts likely to be offered to catcher tyler stephenson and the likes of tj friedl will benson and jake fraley fighting alongside steer for regular time in the outfield the club still has more regulars competing for playing time than room in the starting lineup while it should be noted that injuries and under performance can allow those playing time issues to resolve themselves naturally throughout the season it appears that the club s positional mix is largely healthy entering the season that even goes for india and mclain despite the fact that the pair have both largely sat out games to this point in the spring india made his spring debut just yesterday after being slowed entering camp by a tear of his plantar fasciitis as debut that was right in line with what was expected last month mlb com notes that bell has indicated to reporters that india should have plenty of time to prepare himself for opening day later this month and it seems reasonable to expect that the same would apply to mclain who bell indicated is slated to make his spring debut tomorrow india will look to build on a 2023 season that saw him slash a league average 244 338 407 in 119 games while battling the aforementioned plantar fasciitis while mclain figures to be a key fixture of the club s lineup after slashing an excellent 290 357 507 in 403 trips to the plate during his rookie season last year also poised to make his spring debut tomorrow is left hander nick lodolo who goldsmith adds is probably not in position to make a start during the first week of the regular season per bell with the reds targeting a potential first start of the regular season on april 9 against the brewers that would leave lodolo poised to miss the first two turns through the starting rotation to open the season meaning the club could start the season with a rotation of hunter greene frankie montas graham ashcraft andrew abbott and nick martinez it s a big season for lodolo who struggled to a 6 29 era and 5 79 fip in seven starts last year before missing the remainder of the 2023 season with a stress reaction in his left tibia prior to his injury marred 2023 season lodolo entered the 2022 campaign as a consensus top 40 prospect in the sport and made 19 starts for the reds pitching to a 3 66 era with a 3 90 fip in 103 1 3 frames
provided by xinhua out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius said by matthew rusling washington april 19 xinhua as the u s federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates higher fear of a u s recession is mounting but there remains no consensus among economists and analysts with some maintaining that the u s economy can avoid a downturn my expectation is that we will see a u s economic recession by the end of this year or the beginning of next year desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua adding that this will occur as the fed shifts to a more hawkish monetary policy stance to fight inflation there is no recent precedent of the federal reserve having had to reduce inflation by as much as 4 percentage points without precipitating an economic recession lachman said one factor that makes a recession likely is that fed tightening will occur at a time of bubble like conditions in the u s stock market and housing market lachman said consumer prices soared 8 5 percent in the 12 months through march according to the u s labor department and many economists believe the fed s coming rate hikes to avoid more inflation will spark an economic downturn provided by xinhua economists at deutsche bank expressed concerns of inflation over the next two years and a recent bloomberg survey of economists tagged the odds of recession at 27 5 percent up over 7 percentage points from just a month earlier goldman sachs group inc said the odds of recession were about 35 percent over the next two years former treasury secretary larry summers has in recent months warned of an impending recession with the odds of a hard landing in the next two years better than half and quite possibly two thirds or more according to a recent bloomberg interview but other analysts expressed optimism james paulsen chief investment strategist of the leuthold group a u s investment research firm told xinhua inflation is up and there s this narrative that the fed is woefully behind the curve and the only way they can shut it down is over tightening and killing off the economy but if you just step back from the emotion i don t see the list of things that generally produce recession paulsen said we ve got some of the greatest job creation we ve ever had going paulsen said recession generally occurs when there are bad balance sheets but we don t have bad balance sheets paulsen said household debt to income ratios are the best they ve been in the past 25 years paulsen noted liquidity s never been this high in the household sector he said noting there are around 18 trillion u s dollars in deposit assets provided by xinhua corporations made record profits in 2021 and banks are also in good shape inflation is high there s no doubt about that but it s special circumstances where you deal with supply shortages as a result of restricting the labor supply due to covid he said but i don t see where that alone necessarily is a cause of recession he said tightening is occurring no doubt and with about a one year lag that will certainly slow the growth of the economy but we tighten in every recovery and i don t think that means we recess he said typically once the fed starts to tighten it takes several more years before we have recession he said one of the fed s main challenges is to get inflation back down to its 2 percent mandate via rate hikes without going too fast and furious which could sharply boost unemployment taken at face value historical patterns suggest the fed faces a hard path to a soft landing goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius wrote in a research report on sunday as quoted by bloomberg quint a joint venture involving bloomberg indeed out of 14 post wwii u s tightening cycles 11 were followed by a downturn within two years hatzius noted however only eight of them can be even partially attributed to fed tightening and soft or softish landings have been more common more recently hatzius said hatzius projected the odds of a recession in the next 12 months were around 15 percent as quoted by bloomberg quint provided by xinhua the international monetary fund imf s baseline forecast shows a softening of u s economic activity but at the moment we don t forecast a recession tobias adrian director of the imf s monetary and capital markets department said tuesday having said that there are risks around that baseline adrian said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank if further adverse shocks are hitting further supply shocks or further adverse shocks to real activity certainly we could see worse outcomes than what is forecasted in the baseline he added the u s economy is on track to grow 3 7 percent in 2022 0 3 percentage point lower than the january projection before growth moderating to 2 3 percent in 2023 according to the imf s newly released world economic outlook report

world bank group president david malpass left and imf managing director kristalina georgieva take part in the the way forward responding to global shocks and managing uncertainty event during the 2022 spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank group wbg in washington april 19 in this handout photo made available by the wbg the international monetary and financial committee the development committee and g20 meetings will be held in a hybrid format and participants of those restricted meetings may participate in person or virtually epa yonhap the international monetary fund slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point tuesday citing russia s war in ukraine and warning that inflation was now a clear and present danger for many countries the war is expected to further increase inflation the imf said in its latest world economic outlook warning that a further tightening of western sanctions on russia to target energy exports would cause another major drop in global output the imf said other risks to the outlook include a sharper than expected deceleration in china prompted by a flare up of covid 19 lockdowns rising prices for food energy and other goods could trigger social unrest particularly in vulnerable developing countries the imf said downgrading its forecasts for the second time this year the global crisis lender said it now projects global growth of 3 6 percent in both 2022 and 2023 a drop of 0 8 and 0 2 percentage points respectively from its january forecast due to the war s direct impacts on russia and ukraine and global spillover medium term global growth is expected to decline to about 3 3 percent compared to an average of 4 1 percent in the period from 2004 to 2013 and growth of 6 1 percent in 2021 what has russia s invasion of ukraine cost a crisis on top of a crisis with devastating human costs and a massive setback for the global economy imf managing director kristalina told a food security panel tuesday imf chief economist pierre olivier gourinchas gives a presentation at the world economic outlook at the international monetary fund during the 2022 spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank group wbg in washington april 19 in this handout photo made available by the imf epa yonhap the imf has estimated that ukraine s gdp will collapse by 35 percent this year while russia s output will shrink by 8 5 percent in 2022 while emerging and developing europe including both countries will contract by 2 9 percent but imf chief economist pierre olivier gourinchas told a news briefing that a tightening of sanctions against russia to include restrictions on energy exports could double russia s gdp decline to 17 percent by 2023 the european union highly dependent on russian energy saw its 2022 growth forecast cut by 1 1 percentage points while britain now faces slower economic growth and more persistent inflation than any other major economy next year spillover from higher energy prices a loss of confidence and financial market turmoil from this step would cut another 2 percentage points off global growth forecasts gourinchas said the war which russia describes as a special military operation has caused a humanitarian crisis in eastern europe displacing some 5 million ukrainians to neighboring countries the imf said the war has exacerbated inflation that already had been rising in many countries due to imbalances in supply and demand linked to the pandemic with the latest lockdowns in china likely to cause new bottlenecks in global supply chains gourinchas said central banks face increased pressure to fight inflation with tighter monetary policy and a further tightening of sanctions could accelerate this move which could cause more difficulties for developing economies the war adds to the series of supply shocks that have struck the global economy in recent years like seismic waves its effects will propagate far and wide through commodity markets trade and financial linkages gourinchas said reduced supplies of oil gas and metals produced by russia and wheat and corn produced by both russia and ukraine had driven up prices sharply in europe the caucasus and central asia the middle east and north africa and sub saharan africa but is hurting lower income households around the world more the imf said it had revised downward its medium term outlook for all groups except commodity exporters who benefit from the surge in energy and food prices the imf said inflation was now projected to remain higher for longer driven by war induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures and it warned the situation could get worse if supply demand imbalances deepened for 2022 it forecast inflation of 5 7 percent in advanced economies and 8 7 percent in emerging market and developing economies a jump of 1 8 and 2 8 percentage points from january s forecast inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries gourinchas said he said the u s federal reserve and many other central banks had already moved toward tightening monetary policy but war related disruptions were amplifying those pressures the imf said there was a rising risk that inflation expectations become de anchored prompting a more aggressive tightening response which could put pressure on a wider range of emerging market economies financial conditions tightened for emerging markets and developing countries immediately after the invasion and the repricing has been mostly orderly but further tightening was possible as well as capital outflows the war had also increased the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards cross border payment systems and reserve currencies a move gourinchas said would be a disaster reuters
financial stability risks have risen amid russia ukraine conflict imf report xinhua 09 14 april 20 2022 washington april 19 xinhua financial stability risks have risen along many dimensions although no global systemic event affecting financial institutions or markets has materialized so far the international monetary fund imf said tuesday global financial conditions have tightened notably and downside risks to the economic outlook have increased as a result of the russian ukraine war according to the newly released global financial stability report gfsr the tightening has been particularly pronounced in eastern europe and middle east countries with close ties to russia reflecting lower equity valuations and higher funding costs the imf report said emerging and frontier markets are facing tighter financial conditions and a higher probability of portfolio outflows with forecast at 30 percent now up from 20 percent in the october 2021 gfsr the latest report warned that a sudden repricing of risk resulting from an intensification of the war and associated escalation of sanctions may expose and interact with some of the vulnerabilities built up during the pandemic leading to a sharp decline in asset prices the sharp rise in commodity prices which has exacerbated preexisting inflation pressure poses challenging trade offs for central banks between fighting record high inflation and safeguarding the post pandemic recovery the report said the report urged policymakers to take decisive actions to rein in rising inflation and address financial vulnerabilities while avoiding a disorderly tightening of financial conditions that would jeopardize the post pandemic economic recovery it is extremely important to tighten monetary policy at this point in order to prevent an unmooring of inflation expectations tobias adrian director of the imf s monetary and capital markets department said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank at the moment medium term inflation expectations are well anchored but of course there s a risk of de anchoring so there s a risk that expectations would move beyond the target level in a markable manner adrian said in response to a question from xinhua the imf official noted that the intended consequence of monetary tightening is to get to a tightening of financial conditions that slows down aggregate demand slows down economic activity which in turn brings down inflation so some tightening of financial conditions is intended adrian said but of course you don t want a disorderly tightening of financial conditions so disorderly is the kind of sell off and dash for cash that we saw in march 2020 at the onset of the covid pandemic to avoid unnecessary volatility in financial markets it is crucial that central banks in advanced economies including the u s federal reserve provide clear guidance about the normalization process while remaining data dependent the imf report added in the coming years the report said policymakers will need to confront a number of structural issues brought to the fore by the war in ukraine and the associated sanctions against russia including the trade off between energy security and climate transition market fragmentation risks and the role of the u s dollar in asset allocation web editor zhong wenxing liang jun
imf cuts 2022 global growth forecast to 3 6 pct amid russia ukraine conflict xinhua 09 22 april 20 2022 photo taken on april 19 2022 shows the imf headquarters in washington d c the united states the international monetary fund imf on tuesday slashed global growth forecast for 2022 to 3 6 percent amid the russia ukraine conflict 0 8 percentage points lower than the january projection according to its newly released world economic outlook report photo by ting shen xinhua washington april 19 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on tuesday slashed global growth forecast for 2022 to 3 6 percent amid the russia ukraine conflict 0 8 percentage points lower than the january projection according to its newly released world economic outlook report the ukraine crisis unfolds while the global economy is on a mending path but has not yet fully recovered from the covid 19 pandemic the report said noting that global economic prospects have worsened significantly since the forecast in january a severe double digit drop in gross domestic product gdp for ukraine and a large contraction in russia are more than likely along with worldwide spillovers through commodity markets trade and financial channels the report showed this year s growth outlook for the european union has been revised downward by 1 1 percentage points to 2 8 percent due to the indirect effects of the conflict making it a large contributor to the overall downward revision according to the report the u s economy is on track to grow 3 7 percent in 2022 0 3 percentage points lower than the january projection before growth moderating to 2 3 percent in 2023 the chinese economy is expected to grow 4 4 percent this year 0 4 percentage points lower than the previous projection followed by a 5 1 percent growth in 2023 the report showed china s national bureau of statistics said on monday the country s gdp grew 4 8 percent year on year in the first quarter marking a steady start in 2022 in the face of global challenges and a resurgence of covid 19 cases analysts said the full year growth target of 5 5 percent set by china s policymakers is still attainable but requires greater efforts given increasing economic headwinds global growth is projected to decline from an estimated 6 1 percent in 2021 to 3 6 percent in both 2022 and 2023 0 8 and 0 2 percentage points lower for 2022 and 2023 respectively than in the january projection the report noted the report laid out five principal forces shaping the near term global outlook the russia ukraine conflict monetary tightening and financial market volatility fiscal withdrawal slowing growth in china and pandemic and vaccine access inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries imf chief economist pierre olivier gourinchas said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank he said even prior to the russia ukraine conflict inflation surged on the back of soaring commodity prices and supply demand imbalances and many central banks such as the u s federal reserve had already moved toward tightening monetary policy conflict related disruptions amplify those pressures said gourinchas we now project inflation will remain elevated for much longer for 2022 inflation is projected at 5 7 percent in advanced economies and 8 7 percent in emerging markets and developing economies 1 8 and 2 8 percentage points higher than the january projection the report showed financial conditions tightened for emerging markets and developing countries immediately after the conflict gourinchas noted several financial fragility risks remain raising the prospect of a sharp tightening of global financial conditions as well as capital outflows he said on the fiscal side policy space was already eroded in many countries by the pandemic said the imf chief economist the surge in commodity prices and the increase in global interest rates will further reduce fiscal space especially for oil and food importing emerging markets and developing economies the report also warned that the conflict increases the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards cross border payment systems and reserve currencies such a tectonic shift would cause long run efficiency losses increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years gourinchas said in response to a question from xinhua the imf chief economist said at the press conference that the multilateral organization thinks fragmentation is more of a longer run risk than a short run risk we are not anticipating that there will be immediately severe dislocation but you could see countries sort of de globalizing or reverting and undoing some of the gains from trade integration gourinchas said and that s certainly a source of worry for us the imf urged central banks to adjust their policies decisively to ensure that medium and long term inflation expectations remain anchored noting that clear communication and forward guidance on the outlook for monetary policy will be essential to minimize the risk of disruptive adjustments several economies will need to consolidate their fiscal balances the report noted adding that this should not impede governments from providing well targeted support for vulnerable populations especially in light of high energy and food prices embedding such efforts in a medium term framework with a clear credible path for stabilizing public debt can help create room to deliver the needed support according to the report gourinchas also argued that even as policymakers focus on cushioning the impact of the war and the pandemic other goals will require their attention noting that the most immediate priority is to end the war he also urged countries to close the gap between stated ambitions and policy actions on fighting climate change secure equitable worldwide access to the full complement of covid 19 tools to contain the virus as well as ensure that the global

by svea herbst bayliss boston reuters three months ago hedge fund manager william ackman cheered when netflix s stock price suddenly dropped buying up 3 million shares as other investors fretted over weak subscriber growth at the streaming company on tuesday the billionaire investor s hedge fund pershing square capital management was likely nursing losses as netflix shares tumbled 26 in after hours trading after the company reported losing subscribers for the first time in a decade ackman who routinely moves stock prices by buying into or exiting a company did not say how much he paid for his netflix stake which he unveiled to his investors on jan 26 but he did say that he began acquiring the stake on jan 21 the day after netflix s announcement sent its stock plunging from jan 21 through jan 26 netflix shares traded in a range of 351 46 to 409 14 the 26 drop in netflix shares in after hours trade on tuesday bringing them to 257 98 would imply a loss for ackman s fund on the netflix investment of roughly 26 at the low end and a loss of 37 at the high end before netflix s january outlook its stock had been trading around 500 indeed its shares had been dropping for months and ackman called them undervalued for ackman the drop while unwelcome may not be entirely unexpected as he had warned his investors earlier this year that netflix would face near term variability in quarterly growth and profitability long term however he said he expects to see double digit annual revenue expanded operating profit margins and earnings per share growth of more than 20 a year a pershing square spokesman declined to comment the pershing square holdings fund was already nursing small losses through the end of march before netflix shares dropped on tuesday which likely pulled returns down even more but these returns stand in stark contrast to three years of high double digit gains for the fund that includes a 70 2 rise in 2020 the firm s assets now total 21 5 billion including permanent capital in which would be sellers can exit only if there are new buyers this allows ackman to worry less about potentially jittery investors wanting out and having to sell positions to meet redemptions ackman has weathered big slides before including when shares in fast food chain chipotle cost his fund some 145 million in value in late october 2017 he joked in an interview with reuters at the time that his investment team would be eating chipotle until the stock price returned to 500 a share on tuesday chipotle closed at 1 632 03 reporting by svea herbst bayliss editing by leslie adler

business and profits the us president joe biden and prime minister narendra modi s virtual meeting followed by the 2 2 summit between indian minister of external affairs s jaishankar and defence minister rajnath singh in washington with u s counterparts antony blinken and lloyd austin stressed on hefty 150 billion business agenda and expanding its deals in a stream for the last many years on nuclear space and cyber security the energy import from russia is a minor irritant as it is a mere 2 per cent of indian business that would be in the russian ruble india s biz offers huge savings to the us arms producers who have raked in 5 436 billion profits for several trillion dollar sales since 2001 largely from the indian subcontinent the us is lured by the expanding new arms bazaar india has concerns about the links between russia and china the us press secretary explained after the 2 2 defence ministerial meeting between the two countries to the american press in response to why india does not choose to opt for a harsh tone against russia us officials emphasised new delhi s diplomatic approach to ensure regional security the us official says india of course is facing a very tense situation along the line of actual control and when india sees the tight links between china and russia that s obviously going to impact their thinking the us understands that even if its companies set up manufacturing units in india as per its make in india priority they will repatriate huge profits and the 20 largest us arms manufacturers will continue to create employment at home a country in economic crisis particularly post afghanistan scenario finds the indian magic touch soothing even as european nato allies remain cautious on the ukraine war the gap between india and the us on the ukraine issue was evident the white house s expansive preamble spoke of close consultations on the consequences of the brutal war prime minister modi was unequivocal on the bucha killings in ukraine the terse indian preview outlines a broader agenda and exchange of views on developments in south asia the indo pacific region and global issues of mutual interest both sides look forward to

multiple projects and many of these are very strategic as the us tries to capture the asian market it saves huge sums as india is cost effective and provides easy access to the asia market at a low cost south asia and southeast asian economies as per the us perspective have hefty foreign exchange reserves stronger financial systems and an unassailable place as the world s manufacturing powerhouse their stock markets like those in the developed world have posted gains during the pandemic while other emerging regions lost this strategic interest makes the white house ignore india s deals like oil and other purchases from russia it is as per their estimate not more than 2 per cent of overall indian engagements the way the us intends to proceed is expected to give it a wide leeway and boost a sagging economy the indian soft push helps the us gain in monetary terms and india develops a manufacturing asian export bazaar in over a decade the writer is a veteran journalist an

washington financial stability risks have risen along many dimensions although no global systemic event affecting financial institutions or markets has materialized so far the international monetary fund imf has said global financial conditions have tightened notably and downside risks to the economic outlook have increased as a result of the russian ukraine war according to the newly released global financial stability report gfsr the tightening has been particularly pronounced in eastern europe and middle east countries with close ties to russia reflecting lower equity valuations and higher funding costs the imf report was quoted as saying by xinhua news agency emerging and frontier markets are facing tighter financial conditions and a higher probability of portfolio outflows with a forecast of 30 per cent now up from 20 per cent in the october 2021 gfsr the latest report warned that a sudden repricing of risk resulting from an intensification of the war and associated escalation of sanctions may expose and interact with some of the vulnerabilities built up during the pandemic leading to a sharp decline in asset prices the sharp rise in commodity prices which has exacerbated preexisting inflation pressure poses challenging trade offs for central banks between fighting record high inflation and safeguarding the post pandemic recovery the report said the report urged policymakers to take decisive actions to rein in rising inflation and address financial vulnerabilities while avoiding a disorderly tightening of financial conditions that would jeopardize the post pandemic economic recovery it is extremely important to tighten monetary policy at this point in order to prevent an unmooring of inflation expectations tobias adrian director of the imf s monetary and capital markets department said at a virtual press conference during the 2022 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank at the moment medium term inflation expectations are well anchored but of course there s a risk of de anchoring so there s a risk that expectations would move beyond the target level in a markable manner adrian said in response to a question from xinhua the imf official noted that the intended consequence of monetary tightening is to get to a tightening of financial conditions that slows down aggregate demand slows down economic activity which in turn brings down inflation so some tightening of financial conditions is intended adrian said but of course you don t want a disorderly tightening of financial conditions so disorderly is the kind of sell off and dash for cash that we saw in march 2020 at the onset of the covid pandemic to avoid unnecessary volatility in financial markets it is crucial that central banks in advanced economies including the us federal reserve provide clear guidance about the normalisation process while remaining data dependent the imf report added in the coming years the report said policymakers will need to confront a number of structural issues brought to the fore by the war in ukraine and the associated sanctions against russia including the trade off between energy security and climate transition market fragmentation risks and the role of the us dollar in asset allocation live tv

russia s new offensive in the east was confirmed as very much underway so why the fall in oil prices traders suggest it s because xi jinping has only steeled his resolve to keep china locked down for as long as it takes as xi could never be wrong at least rules have been relaxed over access to groceries but as noted above these sudden dips in oil prices have occurred more than once in past months

corporate fraud and other wrongdoing our securities fraud litigators are regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconductabbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors
