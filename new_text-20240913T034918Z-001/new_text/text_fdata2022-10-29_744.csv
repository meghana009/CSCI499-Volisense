tesla ceo elon musk completed his 44 billion purchase of twitter on thursday after a chaotic months long buyout process leaving the richest man on the planet in control of one of the world s most widely used social media and communication platforms musk wasted no time imposing himself on the company swiftly firing several top executives including ceo parag agrawal the bird is freed musk tweeted late thursday a self described free speech absolutist who has proven in practice to be anything but musk has yet to fully detail his vision for twitter but critics of the takeover fear that the billionaire s suggestions thus far including reversing the permanent bans of former president donald trump and potentially other figures such as the hate spewing conspiracy monger alex jones could further deluge the platform with disinformation ahead of key elections in the united states and brazil as the new york times observed twitter said it would prohibit misleading claims about voting and the outcome of elections but that was before mr musk owned it elon musk s plans for twitter will make it an even more hate filled cesspool leading to irreparable real world harm said the stop the deal coalition an alliance of groups that includes accountable tech friends of the earth public citizen and the global project against hate and extremism the coalition has urged congress to investigate musk s acquisition of twitter the purchase is reportedly already facing an investigation by federal regulators musk s plans will leave the platform more vulnerable to security threats rampant disinformation and extremism just ahead of the midterm elections the coalition said elon musk has a thirst for chaos and utter disregard for anyone other than himself and should not own twitter the coalition noted that to fund the twitter purchase musk is accepting financing from saudi prince alwaleed bin talal al saud and the sovereign wealth fund of qatar two countries run by repressive regimes saudi arabia and qatar are hardly bastions of free speech earlier this month the saudis sentenced 72 year old u s citizen saad ibrahim almadi to 16 years in prison over tweets criticizing the regime almadi s son told the washington post that the kingdom has tortured his father in prison elon musk owning one of the world s most powerful communication platforms is dangerous for us all the stop the deal coalition continued as musk runs twitter to the ground let this serve as a warning to other platforms that they will be held accountable for ignoring public safety and dismantling the guardrails designed to protect our information ecosystem elon musk is an erratic billionaire who has promised to rollback critical safeguards replatform users who have repeatedly incited violence and provide a megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation and he has just been given carte blanche control over this platform nicole gill nicolelgill october 28 2022 in a statement posted to twitter thursday morning musk said the reason he purchased the company is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence but musk s stated openness to free expression appears not to apply to his employees tesla customers or journalists covering his companies in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on august 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations cnbc reported thursday musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers the outlet added for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired the outlet added in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so musk like other billionaire ceos is also a union buster last year the national labor relations board upheld a judge s ruling that tesla unlawfully fired an employee involved in union organizing the labor board also affirmed the finding that musk illegally threatened workers with the loss of their stock options if they decided to form a union david nasaw emeritus professor of history at the cuny graduate center wrote in a column for the times on thursday that musk is the face of 21st century tech based extreme capitalism just as the robber barons who built our railroads and andrew carnegie who supplied those railroads and the builders of modern american cities with steel embodied the exuberant and expansive industrial capitalism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries mr musk has exploited the opportunities emerging in a rapidly disintegrating regulatory state apparatus and acquired a small army of investors and a fleet of lobbyists lawyers and fanboys known as musketeers nasaw continued he has sought to position himself as a tech genius who can break the rules exploit and excise those who work for him ridicule those who stand in his way and do as he wishes with his wealth because it benefits humanity it is not unreasonable to expect that a musk owned and controlled twitter will in the name of free speech allow disinformation and misinformation to be tweeted ad infinitum so long as it discredits his political opponents and celebrates and enriches himself and his allies nasaw added elon musk is a product of his and our times rather than debate or deride his influence we must recognize that he is not the self made genius businessman he plays in the media instead his success was prompted and paid for by taxpayer money and abetted by government officials who have allowed him and other billionaire businessmen to exercise more and more control over our economy and our politics

facts marine environments cover 70 of earth over 50 of oxygen on the planet comes from oceans top threats to oceans include pollution noise and climate change plastic pollution is expected to outweigh all fish in the oceans by 2050 prescription drugs agricultural runoff industry discharge and even sunscreen chemicals can alter the chemistry of marine ecosystems overfishing puts marine species populations at risk with sharks and rays especially vulnerable the 2010 deepwater horizon spill the biggest oil spill in u s history is still being remedied today the gulf of mexico is a major dead zone where marine life can no longer live due to lack of oxygen the great pacific garbage patch contains about 1 8 trillion pieces of plastic along with other types of waste some of the most threatened marine life include sea turtles dugongs north atlantic right whales and coral reefs especially in the great barrier reef why threats to marine environments matter when you think of the oceans you might recall standing on the shoreline as a child looking out in wonder at the vast blue that extended into the skyline marine environments deserve the fascination we place upon them oceans cover over 70 of earth and with that much coverage they help regulate climate store carbon and even generate more than half of the oxygen on the planet but our oceans are facing a number of serious threats that put aquatic life and even humans at risk you ve seen the images sea turtles eating plastic a seahorse tail wrapped around a cotton swab a shimmering dark spot spreading across the water after an oil spill from rising sea levels to plastic pollution to toxic waste dumping human activity is threatening the health of marine environments and in turn putting humans around the world in danger top threats to marine life and oceans unfortunately one could write up pages upon pages of threats to our oceans but there are several top contenders that need immediate attention here are some of the top threats to marine environments and aquatic life pollution it s no secret that we are polluting our oceans at an alarming pace whether it s the infamous plastic straws or a massive oil spill pollution is a top threat that comes in many different forms plastic is a major ocean threat but other forms of pollution like chemicals from popular sunscreens or prescription drugs are also problematic for plants and animals in the oceans in addition to becoming entanglement and choking hazards pollution can also shift marine chemistry these pollutants contribute to ocean acidification which can lead to coral bleaching or affect molluscs development plastic pollution there are an estimated 75 million tons to 199 million tons of plastic in the oceans today and a 2015 study found that up to 12 7 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the oceans each year but this annual figure is expected to nearly triple by 2040 even worse current projections show that there will be more plastic by weight than fish in the oceans by 2050 all of this ocean plastic has even led to the newly defined plastisphere as plastics floating in the ocean attract single cell organisms like bacteria and algae creating new small ecosystems within the marine environment a plastic cup with a plant stuck in it floats around in the sea of marmara in istanbul türkiye on oct 20 2022 sebnem coskun anadolu agency via getty images agricultural runoff from fertilizers to pesticides agriculture is a top polluter for water sources including the oceans precipitation carries treated soil manure fertilizers pesticides and other chemicals away and they runoff into waterways and ultimately marine environments these pollutants prevent sunlight from reaching plants like carbon sequestering seagrasses block fish gills and contribute to ocean deoxygenation which can kill off marine life while allowing harmful algal blooms agricultural runoff dumped into the salton sea in imperial valley southern california plus49 construction photography avalon getty images sunscreen chemicals like agricultural runoff chemicals in sunscreen may protect your skin from uv rays but they can also wash away into the marine environment off of your skin when you re taking a swim or catching some waves on a surfboard of course you should still wear sunscreen when heading to the beach but watch out for harmful ingredients and know how to identify safe sunscreens many people have heard about the detrimental effects sunscreen chemicals have on coral reefs but these chemicals contribute to more than coral bleaching sunscreen chemicals have been found accumulating on seagrasses in the mediterranean and these seagrasses are an important carbon sink sunscreen chemicals can lead to defects in mussel sea urchin and coral young as well as cause fertility and reproductive challenges in fish some of the most harmful sunscreen chemicals include zinc oxide titanium dioxide oxybenzone octinoxate homosalate avobenzone octocrylene octisalate 4 methylbenzylidene camphor methyl paraben ethyl paraben butyl paraben benzyl paraben and propyl paraben fairfax media via getty images prescription drugs modern medicine is crucial to healthy humans but pharmaceuticals are becoming a growing concern in marine environments taking prescription drugs as intended and properly disposing of unused medications is important as people flush extra prescription drugs or wash them down the sink the contaminants can make their way into local waterways the contaminants can also be present in human excrement after taking the medications but one study outlines another source of this pollution discharge from pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities many places have water treatment facilities that cannot treat the compounds of the drugs so these contaminants can get through the filters a recent study conducted over the course of three years found as many as 17 prescription drugs present in a single bonefish and 58 medications among 93 bonefish outlining the severity of the issue plastic bottles and medicine containers on the beach of the oasi dei variconi in castel volturno italy vincenzo izzo lightrocket via getty images industry discharge in addition to pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities discharge other industries also release waste into waterways and or oceans and contribute to more environmental pollution facilities discharge chemical laden wastewater which can then alter the ocean environment chemicals heavy metals sewage and other waste may contribute to health defects and reproductive issues in marine life and can encourage algal blooms radioactive waste from nuclear power plants is also an ocean pollutant while there are protocols meant to contain radioactive waste even waste dumped decades ago will remain radioactive and dangerous for many years another major industrial discharge is the toxic ddt a pesticide banned in the u s in 1972 companies used to dump barrels of ddt into the oceans but it wasn t clear just how massive the problem was until 2021 when up to 500 000 barrels were discovered off the coast of southern california ddt leaks from the

use fishing as a primary source of income but commercial fishing and illegal fishing are threatening many of the ocean s unique species overfishing is when crews catch more fish at a time than can be recovered through reproduction leaving a depleted population world wildlife fund reported that global overfished stocks have tripled in just 50 years sharks and rays are particularly vulnerable with over one third of shark ray and chimaera species at risk of extinction due to overfishing atlantic bluefin tuna and southern bluefin tuna are also dangerously overfished aside from threatening marine species overfishing may also contribute to more toxins in seafood as larger fish like tuna and cod turn to high mercury prey this issue is further exacerbated by climate change which threatens oceans in many ways military sonar for some marine life military sonar used for navigating training and testing can disrupt their behaviors leading to injury or even death in a military report obtained by the journal nature the uk military found that sonar would cause whales to stop foraging for food and vocalizing depending on the whale s initial reaction to the sonar it could lead the whale to stop feeding and eventually starve mass strandings for several species of whales and dolphins have also been linked to military sonar deep sea mining mining in the deep seas can be just as detrimental as mining on land this activity involves dredging the bottom of the ocean over 200 meters deep and extracting minerals such as manganese nickel cobalt zinc gold and copper removing this layer of seabed can destroy long formed habitats for coral sponges and other marine life mining around hydrothermal vents also destroys these habitats and will impact the unique creatures like crabs sea stars and sea anemones that call these spaces home as the deep sea mining occurs it stirs up potentially toxic sediment clouds that may impact nearby sea life or could even travel tens of thousands of square

sink and can trap heat from the increasing emissions but that means the oceans are getting warmer in addition to higher temperatures impacting marine life these warmer waters can also contribute to stronger and or more frequent hurricanes threatening human lives and countries economies climate change is also contributing to sea level rise as glaciers melt according to world meteorological organization oceans are rising at a high of about 4 5 millimeters per year sea level rise also contributes to worsening tropical storms and leaves coastal communities vulnerable to erosion landslides floods and life threatening storm surges as oceans absorb more carbon emissions the ocean becomes more acidic ocean acidification can weaken coral reefs and impact development of marine life some shelled organisms even dissolve in areas of high acidification ultimately reducing biodiversity and impacting entire food webs ocean noise human activities like military training deep sea mining commercial fishing shipping and oil drilling produce noises that interfere with marine life s ability to listen for natural sounds of the ocean many marine species rely on their sense of hearing or echolocation to navigate the open seas find mates reproduce forage and dodge predators ocean noise pollution can negatively impact animals behaviors and can have serious risks including death hotspots most threatened areas of the ocean while threats stretch to every corner of the ocean even point nemo the most remote part of the ocean is plagued by plastic waste there are a few areas especially vulnerable to a high number of threats from dead zones in the gulf of mexico to coral bleaching in the great barrier reef here are the most threatened parts of oceans around the world gulf of mexico the site of the biggest oil spill in u s history the gulf of mexico is also vulnerable to agricultural and urban runoff that create a dead zone where marine life may not survive due to a lack of oxygen the gulf of mexico hypoxic zone or dead zone spans 6 334 square miles as of 2021 and is the second largest dead zone in the world this region has also seen harmful algal blooms and devastating

rich in biodiversity for now it has long been home to vibrant coral reefs and is the unique habitat for endangered green turtles and vulnerable dugongs warming waters and agricultural runoff have contributed to mass coral bleaching events in the great barrier reef while bleaching isn t a death sentence it does weaken the coral and make them more vulnerable over time pollution can also prevent enough sunlight from reaching marine plants like seagrasses which are an important carbon sink and a food source for marine animals coastal development and illegal fishing are also threatening the

improvement globally for ocean policies to say the least in early 2022 the un created a mandate to begin negotiating for a global plastics treaty for the first time to deal with the root issues of plastic pollution in the ocean and on land some governments are already making efforts toward marine conservation and there are many major ngos working to influence more ocean policies government response ocean policy tends to be neglected as globally governments have not yet created any sort of system or process to make binding agreements or policies for oceans ocean policies are discussed at un conventions but actionable steps are rarely laid out ocean governance lacks any defined meaning or process that can make it a reality there is some hope though in 2018 14 countries came together to form the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy for more sustainable ocean management some governments have also taken their own steps toward conserving marine environments as of 2020 marine

encompassing 582 578 square miles of the pacific ocean 1 508 870 square kilometers ochre sea stars purple sea urchins sea anemones and california mussels in crystal cove state marine conservation area in laguna beach california paul bersebach medianews group orange county register via getty images plastics solutions individuals and organizations are working to clean up the massive amounts of plastic waste in the ocean there s a lot of work to be done in this regard and it can be a challenge to figure out how to handle plastics deep in the ocean or microplastics which are plastics that have broken into tiny pieces fishing gear is a major risk to marine life but a recent study found that using led illuminated gillnets was successful in reducing accidental bycatch incidences boyan slat is one such individual who has made international headlines for ocean plastics solutions slat founded the ocean cleanup with the mission to clean up the great pacific garbage patch the nonprofit is creating innovative technologies like the system 002 to reach a goal of reducing floating ocean plastics by 90 by 2040 the organization has also created interceptors to collect plastics in rivers since its own research found that over 80 of riverine pollution comes from 1 000 rivers similarly plastic fischer created a simple device called the trashboom that floats in rivers and collects plastic waste as it floats downstream to keep that waste from flowing into the ocean in the first place the design is open source so anyone can make their own trashbooms to help collect river waste what you can do to fight against ocean degradation certainly governments corporations and industries need to implement and enforce stricter ocean conservation measures to protect the ocean and environmental organizations can continue their work in restoring and preserving marine environments and their unique biodiversity but there are some actions you can take as an individual to make a difference first vote vote for representatives that have the environment in their best interest and make sure to look into where these candidates receive campaign funding from some may claim to be in favor of marine conservation while being bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry you can also make a difference with where you spend your dollars from supporting sustainable brands to donating to nonprofit organizations working on marine conservation where you spend and don t spend your money can show companies and organizations what is most important to consumers at home reducing waste especially plastic waste is important even though people aren t generally throwing their trash into the ocean directly this waste can end up in the ocean anyway instead focus on reusable items as much as possible if you eat seafood make sure you choose sustainable seafood options using the handy consumer information from monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch or the marine stewardship council takeaway thinking about big topics like climate change or pollution in the depths of the sea feels daunting truthfully cleaning up and preserving marine environments are big important tasks but those tasks fall on all of us individuals governments companies nonprofit organizations together we can reduce the amount of waste we generate while also cleaning up the existing waste plaguing the oceans together we can work to curb emissions to lessen sea level rise ocean warming and acidification one day the ocean can be a more habitable environment for all the unique and aquatic creatures and plants while also being a safe place for humans to enjoy recreationally but that s only with swift large scale actions human life depends on healthy oceans so we must act now for a better future for oceans and life on earth

warren buffett is widely regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time one way to share in his success is to invest in his firm berkshire hathaway brkb but is berkshire a good buy for you now as it hits fresh heights let s take a close look at the fundamental and technical performance of the ultimate warren buffett stock x berkshire hathaway is a conglomerate that owns some of america s most famous firms it wholly owns the likes of geico duracell dairy queen fruit of the loom and railroad operator bnsf berkshire hathaway is perhaps more famous for serving as an investment vehicle for warren buffett and his top lieutenant charlie munger following their value investing philosophy the company owns huge stakes in american express axp coca cola ko and other heavy hitters but the definition of a warren buffett stock has evolved in recent years under investment managers todd combs and ted weschler berkshire hathaway has been increasingly sinking money into tech stocks it s taken large positions in established giants like apple aapl as well as younger companies like brazilian fintech nu nu and young software firm snowflake snow berkshire has also snapped up a stake in amazon com amzn legendary investor charlie munger dies it emerged nov 28 that key berkshire executive charlie munger had died at the age of 99 the firm said in a missive that he had died peacefully at a california hospital berkshire hathaway could not have been built to its present status without charlie s inspiration wisdom and participation company ceo warren buffett said in a news release munger had been key in moving buffett away from a pure value investing approach into buying high quality firms at fair prices it was he who persuaded buffett to stump up the cash to purchase see s candies in 1971 for what buffett later dubbed a fancy price munger s belief that buying a very good business would pay off in the long run due to its ability to generate superior profits turned out to be true making billions for berkshire hathaway the oracle of omaha later said the success of the investment led to him abandoning his approach of finding mediocre companies at bargain prices berkshire hathaway tweaks portfolio sells apple stock once again buffet s berkshire hathaway was a net seller of stocks in q4 of 2023 the most recently reported period berkshire hathaway exited positions in brazilian fintech stoneco stne and homebuilder d r horton dhi it also liquidated positions in globe life gl and markel mkl perhaps most notably the firm sold some of its mammoth holdings of apple stock but even after selling just over 10 million shares it still holds nearly 906 million within its portfolio it also trimmed positions in paramount global para and hp hpq the firm held steady on some of its biggest and oldest holdings including bank of america bac and coca cola berkshire did not add any new positions but added shares in some firms it bought more chevron cvx and sirius xm siri warren buffett buys more oxy stock chevron is not the only way in which berkshire has energy exposure in fact the firm has been making waves as it builds an increasingly large stake in occidental petroleum oxy berkshire previously received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50 of the oil giant and in the most recent quarter the firm added a further 19 million shares of oxy in total it now owns just over 248 million shares at the firm s annual shareholder meeting in may 2023 buffett said berkshire is not going to buy control of occidental buffett bets big on lng warren buffett now has even more energy exposure after it was reported on july 10 that berkshire agreed to a 3 3 billion deal to buy dominion energy s d share of the maryland based cove point lng export plant this will bring berkshire hathaway energy s share in the lng export facility to 75 brookfield asset management bam owns the other 25 we are proud of our operations at cove point and are excited for this opportunity to increase our ownership in these world class facilities berkshire hathaway energy gas transmission and storage president paul ruppert said in a statement morgan stanley analyst david arcaro wrote in a note to clients that the deal was around 1 billion less than the firm expected dominion energy will use the 3 billion from the deal to pay off debt brkb stock hits new high berkshire hathaway stock is well extended after previously clearing a cup with handle ideal entry point of 363 19 according to marketsmith analysis the stock now sits at all time high levels brkb is clear of the the 21 day exponential moving average and the even shorter term 10 day moving average it previously found support at its 50 day moving average an encouraging sign the key benchmark had previously acted as an area of resistance during the base building process the relative strength line is moving higher again but remains below the a 52 week high it reached in september this gauges a stock s performance compared to the broader s p 500 its relative strength rating of 84 means it has outperformed 84 of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months berkshire hathaway stock held strong in 2022 making a slight gain compared to a loss of more than 19 for the s p 500 but it lagged in 2023 rising about 16 compared to the s p 500 s gain of 24 so far this year it is up around 16 all around performance is strong but not quite ideal for berkshire hathaway stock this is reflected in its ibd composite rating of 93 out of 99 earnings have grown by an average 22 over the past three quarters investor s business daily recommends investors look for companies with average eps growth of at least 25 over that time period wall street expects year over year earnings growth to slow for berkshire hathaway analysts are projecting annual earnings will rise 24 in 2023 and then slow to 3 growth in 2024 big money has been a net buyer of brkb stock of late which is reflected in its accumulation distribution rating of b in total 49 of its stock is held by funds with a further 36 held by management warren buffett recommendation berkshire stock has struggled to outperform the s p 500 index in recent years despite its outperformance in 2022 before that brkb stock at best moved with the market for a decade an investor could have bought an index fund or etf like the spdr s p 500 etf spy and generated similar or higher returns with less stock specific risk in my view for most people the best thing to do is owning the s p 500 index fund buffett himself previously said at a berkshire annual meeting if you bet on america and sustain that position for decades you d do far better than buying treasury securities or far better than following people perhaps with a bias i don t believe anyone knows what the market is going to do tomorrow next week next month next year berkshire hathaway earnings berkshire hathaway s third quarter earnings per share rose 43 to 4 96 as revenue jumped 21 to 93 2 billion analysts had expected berkshire earnings to rise vs a year earlier to 4 74 a share berkshire hathaway also saw its third quarter operating profit jump 41 to 10 8 billion buffett says investors should focus on operating earnings not net earnings to get a truer reflection of the performance of the business he stresses that stock gains and losses in any particular quarter are usually meaningless this fits in with buffett s longer term investment philosophy the firm once again reduced its equity holdings selling a net 5 billion in q3 this brought its total year to date equity sales to about 23 billion it is getting set to post its latest earnings report the firm as is its wont will report on saturday feb 24 investors worldwide will also be waiting to read warren buffett s annual letter to shareholders warren buffett cash mountain hits record levels berkshire s cash pile rose to record levels in the most recent quarter berkshire hathaway s cash came in at a gargantuan 157 24 billion up from the previous quarter s 147 4 billion having such a large supply of cash protects the warren buffett stock during tough times it also means berkshire hathaway is able to deploy capital when desirable businesses become available for purchase the firm yet again slowed down the pace of repurchases of its own stock buffett bought just 1 1 billion of its stock in q3 compared to 1 4 billion of berkshire stock in q2 in the first quarter berkshire repurchased 4 4 billion up 57 from q4 of last year and the most since q1 2021 nevertheless recent buying of berkshire hathaway stock contrasts with buffett s larger number of deals during and after the great recession but the firm may look to make more deals if a recession starts to make acquisition targets more alluring analyst rates berkshire stock cfra analyst catherine seifert rates brkb stock as a buy with a 405 price target we lift our 12 month target price by 10 to 405 valuing brk b shares at 20 2 our 25 operating eps estimate of 20 05 upped today by 0 10 and 21 5 our 24 eps estimate of 18 85 vs its 3 year average forward multiple of 22 6 she said in a nov 6 research note we lift our 23 eps estimate by 0 11 to 17 87 after q3 operating eps of 4 96 vs 3 48 restated topped our 4 85 eps estimate the 4 93 consensus view on 21 higher operating revenues amid 14 higher insurance premiums a 70 surge in interest and dividend income and a 3 fold increase in energy and utility revenues she also said that strong top line growth and improved margins will provide the brkb shares with a catalyst meanwhile seifert said in a nov 28 that munger s passing represents a significant loss to the berkshire culture and to warren buffett and could test to a degree transition plans berkshire established several years ago though we do not expect any significant issues to arise difference between brka stock and brkb stock the most obvious difference between berkshire hathaway s a class and b class shares is the price while at nearly 360 per share brkb stock may be considered relatively expensive brka stock is the most expensive on the market it currently trades near an astounding 537 000 per share warren buffett decided to introduce the brkb shares to allow investors to purchase stock directly big demand for berkshire hathaway stock had previously forced less moneyed players to plow cash into unit trusts or mutual funds that mirrored his company s holdings berkshire hathaway today berkshire hathaway operates in four main sectors its insurance group is one of its biggest cash cows one of the most famous jewels in the crown is geico other parts of this business include multinational property casualty and life health reinsurance company general re and berkshire hathaway reinsurance group the latter underwrites excess of loss reinsurance and quota share coverage globally insurance operations are a big reason why berkshire hathaway earnings can be lumpy its regulated utility business group includes berkshire hathaway energy formerly known as midamerican energy it also includes railway services arm bnsf north america s largest freight railroad network meanwhile the manufacturing service retailing group includes acme building brands fruit of the loom and justin brands the likes of buffalo news business wire dairy queen and netjets fall under the service subsector retailers include see s candies ben bridge jeweler helzberg diamond shops and star furniture finally the finance financial products segment includes hathaway credit corporation transportation equipment and furniture leasing specialists xtra and cort and bh finance whose main interest is in proprietary investing strategies warren buffett names successor one of the biggest questions around the future of berkshire hathaway in recent years was who would take over the mantle of ceo from buffett the oracle of omaha has finally given the answer he said greg abel who runs the noninsurance businesses will take over in his stead abel a berkshire vice chairman since 2018 had long been viewed by analysts as a possible successor the canadian is chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway energy he has also been vice chairman of berkshire s noninsurance operations since january 2018 the firm has not disclosed the precise timing of berkshire s leadership turnover is berkshire hathaway stock a buy now berkshire hathaway stock generally lagged the s p 500 index since late 2017 but managed to handily outperform the benchmark index in 2022 it lagged again in 2023 after giving up some spring and summer gains berkshire stock is now extended past its most recent buy point which offered an opportunity to those who wanted to own some brkb due to the company s diversified portfolio of businesses but given the stock s extended status it is better to wait for another base to form and while wall street sees eps growth ahead for berkshire in 2024 it remains well shy of the rates sought by many growth investors bottom line berkshire hathaway stock is worth adding to one s watchlist if you are keen to add the ultimate warren buffett stock to your portfolio nevertheless investors

it s the golden age of affordable mp5s most are perfectly reliable firearms but they all run terribly with bad magazines so here are our top 5 mp5 magazines but to ensure that this article isn t restricted to one particular example of mp5 clone i tested all the magazines below in four different clones a turner fabrications mp5a3 sbr clone an ap5 p core mp5k clone pistol a ptr 9ct full sized mp5 pistol and a pof mp5 reverse strech pistol what makes for great mp5 magazines while this might seem obvious reliability is the most important aspect of an mp5 magazine or any magazine how well the mag provides a steady supply of ammunition to the host firearm is something that many modern shooters take for granted but the mp5 s design isn t modern its core design dates back to the second world war so while some of the older retro straight mp5 mags look great they don t run well with modern defensive ammunition other aspects of what constitutes a quality mp5 magazine are durability and how easily the magazine can be inserted into a closed chamber while this issue is more pressing and common on saiga pattern shotguns it is still something to consider when choosing magazines for your new mp5 we also need to consider the magazines longevity as some designs are built to outlast the shooter while others are more of a disposable commodity and lastly we have to consider the cost of these magazines while anything h k related is never going to be cheap the economic impact of each magazine certainly must be considered since most shooters don t simply want to buy a single magazine in a nutshell here s our list of determining factors for our top 5 mp5 magazine picks reliability ammunition sensitivity durability ease of insertion cost longevity now that you know how we came to the conclusions that we did let s jump right into our top 5 mp5 magazines list 5 ac unity polymer magazine based in bosnia ac unity manufactures a wide variety of aftermarket parts and magazines for various firearms from m249 saw ammo boxes and glock magazines to ak rear trunnions and cz bren mags if it s expensive or difficult to find oem accessories for a gun ac unity makes a more affordable alternative we re looking at the 30 round polymer ac unity mp5 magazines for our purposes available in both 40 and 30 round varieties these polymer magazines lack any steel reinforcements but given how mp5 magazines lock up in the gun they don t necessarily need them these magazines feature a black polymer body with a translucent polymer window that shows the shooter how many rounds remain in the mag at a glance the magazine spring is captured at the bottom by a polymer baseplate with a hole that interfaces with an internal plate that incorporates a matching peg just like a glock magazine the polymer used in the magazines doesn t feel cheap but it does have a decent amount of give to it that prevents them from feeling brittle like some of the turkish mke hk93 amber magazines or the ets mp5 magazines on the market today in testing these magazines were not ammunition sensitive at all fed reliability in three of the four test guns they didn t like running in the pof gun when it was equipped with a sound suppressor and held up to multiple drops on hard surfaces and are very affordable at about 19 each the only downside i ve found to these magazines thus far is how difficult they can be to properly seat in a closed chamber that and how the soft polymer of the body prevents you from hearing or feeling a positive click when they lock up on a more subjective note i m concerned about the magazine s longevity because they lack steel feed lips but at such a low cost shooters can afford to treat them as disposable and stock up on them a few weeks ago i reviewed a reverse stretch mp5 clone from pof of pakistan and was very impressed with it mechanically the finish on the pof gun was a different story but the gun ran flawlessly through more than 1 000 rounds but what about magazines made in the same factory built from steel these 30 round magazines bare more than a passing resemblance to a true h k mp5 mag this is because the magazines like the guns from the same plant are built using old h k tooling does that mean they are every bit the equal of the genuine article unfortunately not quite in terms of reliability the pof magazines are fantastic they function with all types of ammunition tested inserts easily into the host firearm and are very durable the only issue shooters will likely notice is how their finish is more like a dull matte parkerization than the glossy black finish found on german korean or turkish magazines that and how the mags tend to wobble in mp5 magazine wells more than german examples as for cost pof magazines certainly aren t cheap with examples online found for around 55 if mke doesn t sound familiar to you maybe century arms does mke is the turkish arms maker currently exporting their ap5 pistols to century arms which have been dominating the market lately but the arms maker doesn t just produce mp5 clones they also make magazines for various platforms including the mp5 but how are these mags aesthetically they re very similar to legit german magazines and feature a similar fit and finish to the deutschland mags they seek to emulate reliability too was fantastic in testing with the mags running perfectly in all four test guns regardless of ammunition utilized durability is solid as well the all steel construction prevents them from being functionally damaged from being dropped these mags are solid but also not terribly cheap with examples online selling for around 45 all and all a solid deal for mp5 enthusiasts in search of solid non nonsense steel mags magpul is known for its high quality ultra reliable products and the new d 50 mp drum is no exception if you re familiar with the ar 15 d 60 drum i reviewed a few months ago you know exactly what to expect from this new drum if the question you re asking is does magpul make mp5 magazines or are magpul drum magazines reliable the answer to both of these questions is yes built primarily from polymer the d 60 mp is a top ratchet assisted loaded drum for the mp5 family of firearms and despite the ac unity magazines not being very positive in lockup these new drums seat easily and positively in terms of reliability i ve only had a chance to run 200 rounds through the d 50 mp drum 50 rounds in each of the four test guns and i haven t experienced any malfunctions in that time the only issue i had with the magazine was how long it took to load and not just in the sense of how long it takes to place 50 rounds in a magazine but the fact that the ratcheting loading arm for the d 50 mp only permits loading one or two rounds at a time that said it s a small price to pay to have 50 rounds at the ready in a compact lightweight package the only downside to the d 50 mp drum is the price around 120 hail to the king baby yes the germans are very very good at making mp5s and their components yes real german hk magazines are not cheap but they meet or exceed every single parameter listed above yes this is extremely reductive but it s still accurate these magazines are flawlessly reliable and extremely durable not to mention tried and tested if money is no object these are my top pick magazines if money is an issue and you re devoting your mp5 pistol or carbine to home defense buy one of these as your primary magazine that said if your mp5 runs flawlessly with any of the magazines listed above keep using what works now many of you are going to notice there are a few solid magazines currently missing from this article but fret not i ve got that covered below dis honorable mention three magazines i wanted to talk about in this article that i didn t have time or space to cover are those from ets kci and overwatch precision the short of it is that ets mp5 magazines aren t durable or reliable enough for serious work kci magazines can be hit or miss depending on the generation original gen 1 magazines have very spotty reliability but the later generation models have worked flawlessly for me and closely resemble those from mke as for the overwatch precision magazines i have yet to test them but they certainly look promising about jim grant jim is one of the elite editors for ammoland com who can

by lewis krauskopf new york reuters a bounce in u s stocks that has defied a barrage of major earnings disappointments faces a key test in the coming week when the federal reserve s next meeting could shed light on how long it will stick to the aggressive monetary policies that have crippled asset prices in 2022 betting on a less hawkish fed has been a dangerous undertaking this year stocks have repeatedly rebounded from lows on expectations of a so called fed pivot only to be crushed anew by fresh evidence of persistent inflation or a central bank bent on maintaining its pace of rate increases pockets of softness in the u s economy have fueled recent hopes of a tempering of rate hikes along with signs that some of the world s central banks may be nearing the end of their rate hiking cycles meanwhile cash heavy investors afraid of missing out on a sustained rally have contributed to the bullish move market participants said the market is starting to believe that there is an endgame in sight for this huge global tightening cycle said keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services the s p 500 was on pace to end the week with a gain of over 3 as investors shrugged off brutal earnings reports from companies such as amazon microsoft google parent alphabet and facebook parent meta platforms the benchmark index is up over 8 from its most recent low a move that has been accompanied by a sharp rally in u s treasuries and a weakening of the dollar reversing trends that have prevailed for most of the year a smaller than expected rate increase by the bank of canadaadded to hopes of a peak in global central bank hawkishness as did comments from a bank of mexico board member cautioning against increasing monetary policy to excessively restrictive levels while investors have broadly factored in a 75 basis point rate hike on wednesday at the end of the fed s two day meeting many will be looking for hints of future policy moves in chairman jerome powell s press conference as his comments have swayed asset prices this year for example stocks rallied ahead of the fed s conference in jackson hole wyoming in august only for the market to decline anew after powell warned about economic fallout from the fed s efforts to fight inflation if his tone is as terse and as hawkish as it was in august at jackson hole that would certainly change the narrative rather rapidly said art hogan chief market strategist at b riley wealth next week will also test whether stocks can continue to weather disappointing earnings news more than 150 s p 500 companies are due to report quarterly results next week including eli lilly conocophillips and qualcomm investors will also closely watch next friday s monthly jobs report for signs of whether the fed s actions have tempered the labor market plenty of investors believe it s too early to hope for a slowing of rate hikes analysts at ubs global wealth management said the fed has yet to see evidence of cooling inflation and labor market conditions and that they continue to think that it is too early to expect the fed to signal a more dovish stance conditions for an equity market bottom including that rate cuts and an economic trough need to be on the horizon are not yet in place the ubs analysts said in a note lerner of truist on friday issued a report downgrading his view on equities to less attractive from neutral following the rebound he said that while stocks have become cheaper on an absolute basis this year they have actually become more expensive relative to bonds given the sharp rise in interest rates for now however it appears the bulls are emboldened one example of investor enthusiasm can be seen in the options market where the one month average daily volume of s p 500 puts typically used for defensive positioning outnumbers bullish calls by the smallest margin in at least four years according to trade alert data the market is thinking good things said kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco jay powell will either confirm that or dispel that next week reporting by lewis krauskopf additional reporting by saqib iqbal ahmed editing by ira iosebashvili and nick zieminski

increased by 16 8 to 20 9 million for the nine months ended september 30 2022 compared to 17 9 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the increase was primarily due to loss on disposal of

financial measures we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we also present the non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation depletion and amortization equity based compensation expense and certain other expenses that are non cash charges or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less net cash paid for interest maintenance capital expenditures and income taxes each as attributable to sisecam resources lp the partnership may fund expansion related capital expenditures with borrowings under existing credit facilities such that expansion related capital expenditures will have no impact on cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for distribution in certain instances the timing of the partnership s borrowings and or its cash management practices will result in a mismatch between the period of the borrowing and the period of the capital expenditure in those instances the partnership adjusts designated reserves as provided in the partnership agreement to take account of the timing difference accordingly expansion related capital expenditures have been excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances we define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to such period adjusted ebitda is a non gaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s operating performance and liquidity adjusted ebitda may provide an operating performance comparison to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods adjusted ebitda may also be used to assess the partnership s liquidity including such things as the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are non gaap supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s liquidity including the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors in assessing our financial conditions results of operations and liquidity distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our liquidity the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio is net cash provided by operating activities our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to gaap net income operating income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities investors should not consider adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies including those in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility the table below presents a reconciliation of the gaap financial

dreams exxonmobil and chevron the largest oil companies in the united states posted respective third quarter profits of nearly 20 billion and 11 2 billion on friday as american consumers continue to face high prices at the pump outrage has intensified from advocates and lawmakers who say the corporations are actively fleecing the public it s no surprise that after months of extreme price gouging chevron and exxon raked in a whopping 73 billion in profits so far this year said jordan schreiber director of energy and environment at accountable us but instead of providing badly needed relief to consumers they spent over 32 billion to enrich their wealthy shareholders while forcing american families to foot the bill make no mistake schreiber added big oil has launched an all out war on

the us federal reserve and bank of england will be in the investor spotlight this coming wednesday and thursday as they reveal interest rate decisions and provide commentary about expected further monetary tightening which has been the overwhelming influence on stock market behaviour this year in september fed chair jerome powell indicated that the federal open markets committee was strongly committed to driving inflation lower with more rate rises following three 75 basis point hikes in june july and september and that there was no painless way to drive inflation lower it was expected at the time that there could be another 100bps by the end of this year at the bare minimum but this month there has been increasing market speculation that the fed will hike by 75bps again but also signal a potential move to smaller rate raises in coming months a report in the wall street journal this month suggested that some fed officials are concerned about overtightening with a big debate to be had at this week s meeting there are growing signs of economic slowdown and liquidity concerns in bond markets said deutsche bank while smaller than expected hikes by the bank of canada and dovish musings from the ecb have fuelled another attempt to price in a pivot so whether the fed pours cold water over these expectations will be key most economists expect the central bank to hike by 75 basis points next week and in december deutsche predicts rates will reach a terminal rate of 4 9 in february with rate cuts late in 2023 following a moderate recession but michael hewson at cmc markets noted that while core inflation is forecast to decline to 4 5 this year before falling to 2 1 by 2025 there have been a succession of fed speaks talking up the prospects of even more aggressive tightening with the prospect that we might see another 150bps by year end which would put the fed funds rate at 4 75 by year end unease at the pace of the current hiking cycle has only been publicly voiced by fed vice chair lael brainard though san francisco fed president mary daly said that after november could be the time for talking about stepping down the pace of hikes fuelling the fire of market speculation before the fomc decision will be the chicago pmi survey on monday ism manufacturing data and prices numbers on tuesday and mba mortgage applications data earlier on wednesday bank of england decision a day later policymakers in london will have their turn after a couple of weeks out of the news after the bank of england was forced to intervene in bond markets after the calamitous liz truss kwasi kwarteng fiscal fiasco the weakness of the pound in recent weeks along with the political turmoil has have had a significant upward impact on uk inflation as well as on the housing market adding to effects from the rate rises so far this year by the bank s monetary policy committee there is a bigger question mark over the size of threadneedle street s potential hike whether it will be 50bps or 75bps with new prime minister rishi sunak saying the uk faces a profound economic crisis in his first speech and new chancellor jeremy hunt expected to announce some major tightening measures in a fiscal statement on 17 november there is lots for the boe s monetary policy committee to mull over the central bank s staff liaises with treasury officials and will already have an outline of the new fiscal policy settings as input for next week s rate decision said rabobank predicting a 75bps hike on thursday and an eventual 4 75 rate peak even as markets have now calmed we will learn on thursday that monetary and fiscal policy are going to be significantly tighter than what anyone had imagined in mid september cmc s hewson said the tightening of fiscal policy means the scope for the bank of england to be more aggressive is now said to be more limited due to concerns about the impact on demand it seems a little bit late for that at this point in time given that the actions of the government in raising taxes is likely to mean any recession is now likely to be much more prolonged which in turn could mean that the pound stays under pressure for longer he said it seems more likely than not that there will be a 50bps hike but ruth gregory at capital economics feels it is a closer call as to whether the mpc will deliver a 75bps or an 100bps hike due to the strengthening in domestic inflationary pressures and tightness in the labour market on balance we think that the mpc will go for 100bps taking bank rate from 2 25 to 3 25 she said going the other way ing economist james smith said while unthinkable only a few weeks ago he thinks a 50bps rate hike is narrowly more likely in recent speeches policymakers have been signalling that markets are overestimating the amount of tightening left to come meanwhile following the various policy u turns of recent weeks the expected boost from fiscal policy now looks similar to what was expected before september s meeting when it opted against a 75bp move with the latest data not providing a clear justification for a faster hike and sterling now stronger than it was before september

in october the indigenous people s council for marine mammals ipcomm met in anchorage for a two day meeting that included federal scientists from agencies like the u s fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service ipcomm members said that the federal agencies aren t doing enough to manage marine mammal populations and subsistence resources across the state it s 100 a lack of funding and a lack of staffing on the government s part said chugach regional resource commission marine mammal manager raven cunningham cunningham said that stock assessments for subsistence resources and population surveys on sea otters haven t happened in over a decade in her region which includes lower cook inlet and prince william sound a once threatened sea otter population is now thriving that s having big impacts on the shellfish people gather for food so when we look at our take as subsistence users we can t look at how that s affecting the population or whether we need to take more or less cunningham said that was news to u s sen dan sullivan he said federal management agencies are supposed to be counting animals like sea otters regularly the fish and wildlife service is supposed to be doing that already sullivan said where the funding can be a little challenging is for these commissions ipcomm is made up of 18 marine mammal commissions and councils from across the state and they all receive federal funding but sullivan said that getting his colleagues in congress to fund those groups is an uphill battle those are just such unique alaska oriented issues that you gotta make the case with your colleagues sullivan said ben payenna of nome sits on the alaska nannut co management council which represents 15 alaska native tribes that harvest polar bears for subsistence we have all these different groups and without the proper funding it feels like we re just being checked off as a government function payenna said payenna said that ipcomm members want to create effective and cooperative management plans but they don t even have the basics like a population count for the wildlife they want to manage if we don t have the funding to do it we just can t payenna said that gets a little bit frustrating when we are meeting to serve a purpose but then we can t fulfill our duties the u s fish and wildlife service declined to comment but during ipcomm s meeting a scientist with the agency said they were out of money for just about anything he told ipcomm members that funding for things like population surveys and stock assessments would have to come from congress correction this story originally reported us senator dan sullivan was the only member of alaska s congressional delegation to attend the ipcomm meeting although not listed on ipcomm s official agenda ipcomm members and us senate staff report us senator lisa murkowski also attended the meeting

a pro choice rally in philadelphia alamy stock photo alamy stock photo rónán duffy in pennsylvania abortion is on the ballot in the us midterm elections in ten days time that much is clear from speaking to people on the ground about their priorities on 8 november and from the political ads clogging up tv time across the us it will literally be voted on in five states where various questions relating to abortion are being asked in all states though the dobbs decision is a motivating factor the dobbs decision is the shorthand used for the us supreme court ruling in the dobbs v jackson women s heath case in june that decision overturned the 1973 roe v wade decision and removed the constitutional right to abortion asking voters about their priorities in the upcoming elections people on either side will speak about abortion it s about my right to take care of my body and the government telling me i can t says kathleen o brien a voter who gave up an hour of her time to post leaflets for democrat senate candidate john fetterman we re going backwards instead of forward so for me i think that s number one at an election rally for republican candidate for governor doug mastriano the feeling could not be more different a lot of people are confused with roe v wade it was never part of the constitution never janice todaro tells the journal it s not like it s banned across the board for incest and rape okay but for everything else planned parenthood says there are 14 forms of birth control so if you don t want to get pregnant be responsible for your body and make sure that it doesn t happen fetterman volunteers donald andrews and kathleen o brien state by state the dobbs decision essentially left it up to states to determine their own abortion laws and several states already had legislation passed restricting abortion rights that kicked in once the decision came down pennsylvania is not one of those states nothing legally changed overnight but the context was immediately different campaigners have described an unease about its laws into the future and one immediate impact has been people travelling here to access abortion services after their own states became much more unfriendly melissa weiler gerber is president and ceo of access matters a philadelphia based non profit group that works to protect and expand reproductive healthcare she told the journal that pennsylvania has for years had restrictions in place meaning the state was relatively strict compared to other places advertisement these restrictions include a 24 hour waiting period parental consent for minors and the strict separation in healthcare settings of abortion and other kinds of services in the wake of the dobbs decision and the tightening of rules in other places pennsylvania has begun to be seen somewhat differently now folks are coming to us from states like ohio and other neighbouring states because suddenly pennsylvania looks better than their home state does we re already seeing that providers in the western part of the state pittsburgh and out bordering ohio they re getting an influx of folks coming from other states we re starting to hear it a little bit here too and sometimes it s people coming from quite far away not just bordering states but this seems like the best option for them so we know that the demand for services is increasing midterm races efforts have been made at the state government level in pennsylvania to introduce tougher abortion laws but these have been vetoed by the state s outgoing governor tom wolf a democrat wolf is term limited and cannot seek more time in office running to replace him is party colleague and state attorney general josh shapiro and republican state senator doug mastriano shapiro has a clear lead in the polls but mastriano has pledged a dramatic tightening of abortion laws should he win at various points during campaigning mastriano has pledged to ban terminations after six weeks of pregnancy and has gone further by saying he wants to outlaw abortion at conception a number of years ago he said that womewho violated abortion laws should be criminalised and charged with murder shapiro has said he supports the current pennsylvania law which permits abortion up to 24 weeks and afterwards only in cases of a threat to life or health of the mother the gubernatorial race is being matched at the senate level in the much closer battle between democrat john fetterman and republican mehmet oz this senate race is among three or four that will decide the balance of power in the upper house and during a tv debate this week abortion was again centre stage at one point oz declared that the decision should be governed by a woman her doctor and local political leaders fetterman though struggling with the after effects of a stroke was clear that he believed the situation which pertained under the roe v wade decision should be codified in law a pledge that has also been made by president biden a pro choice rally in seattle alamy stock photo alamy stock photo in the us advocacy groups that are non profit organisations are not not legally allowed to endorse specific candidates they can argue in favour of an issue but cannot publicly back one politician over another however some groups have specific and separate political arms that can engage in candidate campaigning one such group in pennsylvania is planned parenthood advocates and pac and campaign director lindsey maudlin explained to the journal that its volunteers contribute in all sorts of ways we endorse candidates who are going to be supportive and help to expand and protect sexual and reproductive healthcare and after we endorse those candidates we provide them with resources whether that be messaging training content for their social media then also we re able to funnel our volunteers into their canvasses and phone banks she added we ve been focused on the gubernatorial race letting our supporters know how important the race for governor is then also talking to them about those state general assembly races that are in their area and having them turnout in canvass for those folks read next related reads us midterms baseball over breakfast with ireland s unofficial congressman brendan boyle on the trail with maga favourite doug mastriano as he hits the culture war notes in pennsylvania every single vote matters biden travels to philly as activists hit local bars ahead of the midterms referendums in tandem with an increase in demand for services in more abortion friendly states another effect of the dobbs decision has been its galvanising effect on campaigns on either side of the issue groups have reported an influx of new volunteers and those who have been silently supportive of one side have been emboldened national polls have consistently shown support for abortion services and a significant referendum to protect them in the republican dominated state of kansas also seemed to underline the public mood on the issue a poster in downtown philadelphia the journal the journal unlike in kansas or indeed in ireland where the public were able to vote specifically on the issue most states are not holding plebiscites on abortion instead elected politicians will have the power in their various legislatures weiler gerber says she remembers the day when ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment in 2018 i remember being in bed the night of the decision and just like kind of scrolling through and getting weepy just reading about and looking at interviews of folks flocking into the airports people here offering to pay people s plane tickets to get home to vote i mean it was just so amazing and there was horrible stuff going on here that week around reproductive rights i don t even remember the specifics of it i just know there were things happening potentially within our family planning programme and it was so inspiring to see what was happening and to see people mobilising but did the dobbs decision have the same mobilising effect yes weiler gerber says but that while it certainly activated people on the issue of abortion one of its major effects was in exposing how other rights could be at risk from the supreme court melissa weiler gerber of access matters in his own published opinion supreme court justice clarence thomas argued that the court should also examine its rulings on contraception and same sex marriage i actually feel like clarence thomas gave us a gift in that regard weiler gerber says arguing that his opinion has led to a greater intersectionality within the movement the reproductive rights movement has rightly been criticised in decades past about being kind of a middle class white women s movement that was very focused just on abortion access and i think and i hope that the movement has sort of learned that lesson and also that now many more people are seeing this decision as threatening their own rights whether it s around lgbtqai rights whether it s around rights to contraception whether it s just around privacy rights relating to marriage and sexual intimacy this goes much further and could very easily be a slippery slope across the country republican candidates have quieted down on the issue of abortion aware that taking an extreme position could cost them votes instead campaign ads have mostly focused on crime or inflation a strategy that is appearing to show some results recent polling has suggested that these issues and not abortion are increasingly being seen as the most important issues facing the country it s led to predictions that republicans could win across the board come election night and early post mortems that the dobbs decision came too soon for democrats maudlin doesn t necessarily agree i still think we ll see people turning out on this issue we re hearing from folks in a number of polls across the state that abortion is still a top issue for voters she says even though we re having conversations in a political environment the decision to have an abortion is a very personal one what we have to come back to with voters is letting them know how these very political conversations that often polarise or might isolate folks are going to impact lives and impacted folks ability to access health care

i want to start out tonight on an optimistic note tonight by connecting the dots between a beautiful stock market rally over the past month and virtually every polling survey during the same month showing that the cavalry is in fact coming i m not saying there aren t any other factors in the stock rally of course there are and i m not saying that a republican takeover of the house and senate will solve all our problems because it won t but joe biden will still fight free market capitalism with his veto pen unfortunately however i will say if the polls are correct and polls don t vote only voters vote but if the trends are right the gop congress will at the very least stop the bad stuff or at least the new bad stuff there will be a lot less spending there will be no more tax hikes biden s anti business regulatory regime will at least be slowed down and maybe most importantly the gop will probably start immediately on january 3rd when they takeover with an h r 1 and s 1 house senate bill that will take the handcuffs off of oil and gas production and reopen the door to fossil permitting pipelining refining and all the rest of it that s right h r 1 and s 1 could become a reality could it beat a biden veto well i don t know but it might opening the oil and gas spigots will probably be the most important first step toward reducing inflation and a recession ending growth plan that would liberate america s great fossil fuel industry it would take the pressure off the fed wouldn t it i mean how about j powell getting out there and publicly calling for congress to take the handcuffs of the fossil fuel industry and suggesting and hinting that the fed s interest rate assault would come to an end if congress began a sensible energy policy think about that biden s radical climate change strategy had been a total disaster and the cost of living in all of its forms is the number one issue in the midterm elections even today we got a personal consumption price index report up 6 2 for the past year core inflation up over 5 both show worsening trends of course the cpi is running above 8 and all in since biden s inauguration consumer prices have jumped almost 13 and we ve discussed many times on the show the impact of fossil fuels in everyday life is enormous not only for oil and gas prices or the high priced shortage of diesel fuel or the equally high priced home heating fuel shortage but clothes toothpaste laptops diapers baby toys mri s stethoscopes tents tires toothbrushes you could go on and on inflation gauge closely watched by the fed surges again in september but food prices have been badly impacted because fertilizers require fossils and grocery prices have increased over 17 since joe biden took office so in terms of conquering inflation and restoring prosperity this hypothetical h r 1 s 1 first gop initiative come early january might be combined with a federal reserve ceasefire for a quick turnaround from the stagflationary crisis in which we find ourselves is the stock market telling us that well it might be after all stocks discount the future they discount future profits the future economy future interest rates and even future politics i ve seen it work before it could happen again now joe biden s out there on the campaign trail once again trying to rewrite history he is simply incapable of telling the truth about the economy his so called closing pitch argues that he inherited a deep recession of course he never mentions inflation and now he s saying if you elect republicans to congress they re going to make everything worse no they re not joe no one believes you and by the way you inherited a non inflationary boom from former president trump s policies and in barely more than a year you turned the boom into a bust meanwhile real wages have been falling for 18 straight months for working folks and people are sitting around kitchen tables deciding to cast their votes against your socialist progressivism click here to get the fox news app incidentally back to the stock market stocks love divided government and that s going to be one of the themes of the election outcome i call it checks and balances three democratic houses have brought enormous damage to america s national economy and national security folks want to put an end to that three house majority they don t like the economic policies they don t like the soft on crime policies they don t like the high cost of living policies they don t like the open border policies and they don t like the cultural and social transformation policies in schools and elsewhere in short folks want change checks and balances now is the stock market really such a great barometer well most working folks nowadays own shares one way or another in retirement accounts and pension funds could be as many as 150 million people that is a very big number so when stocks go down it s really a vote of no confidence in america s future when stocks go up it s really a vote of new confidence in america s future until the last few weeks investors have suffered a bear market but as the polls have shifted toward the cavalry it looks like the investor class which is a huge chunk of the working class folks is gaining optimism am i making too much of the stock market story well maybe just giving you some food for thought but i do believe this stock market rally is celebrating the cavalry that s my riff this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the october 28 2022 edition of kudlow

apartment building steps alike they re perched as colorful displays often next to old school carved jack o lanterns many who don t own them particularly this reporter wondered what are those and why at wilson farm in lexington the so called funky pumpkins have been in stock for 20 years but they ve never grown this much variety or sold so many according to lauren wilson a fifth generation family farmer it used to just be the cinderella pumpkin that short fat stackable pumpkin that s orange red in color and the blue pumpkin both of which are edible but local farmers reported that especially since the pandemic customers have been looking for more fun autumn decor and seed specialists are creating new hybrids too in the pursuit of the ever odder gourd even ones that aren t edible it s gotten to the point where people look now for what we call ornamental squash and we try to bring in something new and different every year wilson said this year s new oddities are the dinosaur egg squash which is orange green and purple with bumps all over and the popcorn pumpkin which is a delicious yellow color also with bumps all over and it really does look like a bowl of popcorn wilson gave gbh news a tour du squash these are the popcorn right here they re fantastic she said they are warty and brand new this year there s also the warty goblin an orange pumpkin with green bumps for those who are traditionalists but want a spin amy shay of lexington saw a 25 per cart sale on the wilson farm instagram and stopped by with her mom who was visiting from seattle when gbh news interviewed them their cart was almost overflowing shay s bought a few in the past but never this many amy shay of lexington and her mom pose with their overflowing cart at wilson farm on oct 28 2022 shay saw a 25 per cart sale on the farm s instagram sarah betancourt gbh news i just think it adds such unique interest to our porch and then i m going to do some stacks in my planters shay said she thinks her three children will be excited to see them they re probably going to get a kick out of all these pumpkins she said laughing ken crouch of cambridge has never bought a weird pumpkin and was just checking out the wilson farm pumpkin wall when he spotted a warty goblin variety called the knucklehead the bumps all over it it s really quite interesting so i ll put it on my porch and see what people say he said wilson farm grows a substantial amount of its own squash both in lexington and on its almost 600 acre farm in litchfield n h farmers are starting to notice customers want them wilson said now people are growing non edible squashes and gourds for the pure sake of decorating which 20 years ago wouldn t have been heard of she said popcorn pumpkins are one of the newest offerings at wilson farm fifth generation farmer lauren wilson said it s a new item for them in the 2022 season sarah betancourt gbh news blue pumpkins have long been a staple among funky pumpkins sarah betancourt gbh news teri boardman volante shows off some of her farm s funky gourds sarah betancourt gbh news smaller decorative gourds at wilson farms can be funky pumpkins too sarah betancourt gbh news a shopping cart full of pumpkins at wilson farm sarah betancourt gbh news 0 of 0 seed specialists are creating hybrids of the squash too she said a lot of the squash come from the same family tree the cucurbita maxima the massive pumpkins strewn across the front pages of newspapers are that species but the weird squash are too it has the most diversity in shape i think or one of the most diverse shapes because in this group is where you get the flat disc like pumpkins that you can turn into stackers which are very popular right now said benjamin phillips a vegetable specialist at the southwest michigan research extension center the pastel colored pumpkins of green blue and pink are from that species too the warted ones are often a spinoff from that branch called galeux there s this is a place in france that s well known for growing pumpkins and they re really mangy looking so they call it mangy man but it s bred to be eaten and it just has those quirky warts all over it phillips said wilson said the funky squash love grew exponentially when families were homebound during the pandemic but it s really cemented as a staple this year wilson farm builds a massive squash shelf on the side of its store every other year and in 2022 the funkiest ones are displayed prominently at volante farms in needham ornamental squash are almost all gone teri boardman volante agreed sales really picked up in the pandemic in 2019 her farm sold 17 000 pounds of weird pumpkins it doubled in 2020 to 35 000 and this year exceeded the 2020 benchmark with 37 000 pounds sold so far we are pretty well sold out of the stackable ones we have a few warty pumpkins left right now said boardman volante the farm s owner stackable squash were especially popular and she buys them from local growers like araujo farms in dighton and wards berry farm in sharon they re kind of more flat and disc shaped they stack really well on top of each other kind of how you would do it with rocks at the beach people make like small totems out of them and stack them on top of one another in front of their houses it kind of carries you through the entire season of fall not just halloween kids love the weird pumpkins at weekend festivities at area farms children can be spotted running their hands over the bumps or dragging their parents over to see they love touching them and saying how funny they look boardman volante said despite all the newfangled gourds tradition isn t squashed orange pumpkins were so far and away the most popular wilson said but now people will fill whole carts up with squashes and gourds
south american biofuel producers demand measures for investments nearco biofuels sector organisations from argentina brazil colombia paraguay and uruguay have signed a document calling on countries to define regulatory frameworks that guarantee the progress of investments in the region on thursday 27 10 entities representing the biofuels sector in argentina brazil colombia paraguay and uruguay launched the manifesto in defence of biofuels as a way of expressing their firm conviction that it is essential that all governments comprehensively promote the energy transition strategy for the development of the sector both for vehicle air river and maritime transport the manifesto highlights the importance of defining regulatory frameworks that ensure the advancement of investments in biofuels and scientific and technological research so that countries can meet the commitments made for decarbonisation in the paris agreement taking advantage of the capacities of their agricultural and livestock chains south america has fundamental resources to be a world leader in the production of clean and renewable energy contributing to reduce dependence on fossil energy to move the economy however this attribute is far from being explored in its immense potential to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from crucial sectors such as urban intercity river maritime and air transport the manifesto highlights the partnerships stress the importance of urgent action by governments business and the community to drive the energy transition we need leaders and parliaments committed to this new agenda and a clear regional roadmap that can responsibly combine the different technology pathways for the energy transition the cost of inaction will be far greater than the most ambitious sustainability agenda we can imagine the initiative represents a milestone for the entities to start acting in an aligned way to build an action plan to support the aviation maritime and heavy transport sectors to overcome the challenges of decarbonisation at the end of the document the entities set out their main objectives we advocate for the creation of stable regulatory frameworks and clear rules that provide the necessary legal certainty to increase investment in the sector and thus the expansion of productive capacity and industrialisation in the rural areas of the americas we advocate clear roadmaps and long term energy planning that confirm states choices and increase investor confidence we advocate the creation of a regional energy transition plan in terms of financing and policy alignment in the face of climate change and the resources available to the region to address it we advocate for the governments of south american countries together with civil society the

the last two weeks have marked a surprising turnaround despite poor outings by tech companies recently allowing investors to recoup most losses from the past few months manhattan cn investors rallied late in the week capping a fourth consecutive week of gains erasing much of the summer s losses and nearly reaching the highs from may the gains are likely due to a pair of positive economic releases on inflation and growth that suggest the united states was never in a recession earlier this year and that prices are likely to come down soon investors were cheered on friday by data from showing that personal income and expenditures both outpaced inflation in september gaining 0 4 and 0 6 respectively which lends credence to the belief that inflation has peaked this marks the second consecutive month that real consumer spending has increased though the savings rate fell from august with analysts guessing consumers are tapping into savings and credit to buy their goods and services while the price of goods still outpace income from a year ago prices have fallen for the third month in a row on the heels of the reports markets continued their move in a positive direction the dow jones industrial average met the closing bell 1 779 points up since last friday and the s p 500 gained 149 points over that same time frame the nasdaq which has been plagued by earnings woes among its tech heavy listings gained 243 points since last friday the pce release wasn t the only one that helped motivate the bulls this week on thursday the u s bureau of economic analysis reported that gross domestic product gained 0 6 in the third quarter for 2 6 annualized reversing the negative trend from the prior two quarters and dissipating talk of a recession the better than expected gains were driven mostly by a resilient consumer sector experts say as did the narrowing trade deficit because a notable drop in residential investment has held back growth however the numbers could have been better compared with a 17 drop in the second quarter of 2022 and a 3 decline in the first residential investment fell by more than 26 last quarter the slowdown in the housing sector shows no signs of slowing as interest rates and home prices both remain high real gdp increased in the third quarter but i don t expect this growth to continue later this year or early next john leer chief economist at morning consult said in a statement noting that weak global demand and a strong u s dollar will limit export growth going forward and that the drop in household savings will cause consumers to pare spending in the months ahead the gdp price index also slowed from the second quarter it gained 4 6 in the third quarter compared with 8 5 in the second which was well below expectations that indicates both that growth will not return to the levels seen earlier this year and last and that the hottest inflation is in the rear view window a mild recession is looming with relatively high interest rates and persistent cost pressures set to spark the downturn oren klachkin at oxford economics wrote inflation may be reaching a turning point but it s unlikely to normalize quickly and interest rates will remain higher than during the last economic expansion klachkin predicts weaker gdp growth during the fourth quarter of this year followed by two consecutive negative quarters to kick off 2023 last quarter s gdp growth advance is unlikely to persist as challenges from high inflation and aggressive fed tightening weigh on the economy the recent pce data which is one of the leading indicators the fed uses to measure inflation and thursday s gdp release are likely to have only minimal impact on next week s decision by the central bank though analysts say both reports portend good things for december and possible fed pivot in early 2023 the fed will almost certainly raise its policy rate three quarters of a percent at their decision next week bill adams chief economist at comerica bank said after friday s pce release but with evidence growing that inflation is past the peak november s hike will probably be the last one that big in this cycle since the beginning of the year the fed has raised the federal funds interest rates by 3 most notably in a trio of 0 75 interest rate hikes in june july and september the central bank has two more meetings for the year during which experts have forecast a combined 1 25 increase in interest rates with regard to 2023 adams is no pollyanna noting that the drop in the housing market and overall slowing economy will cause inflation to continue to cool into next year the most likely outcome is a weaker u s and global economy allow the fed to begin reducing interest rates in the second half of 2023 he said but inflation persisting longer than expected forcing the fed to keep short term interest rates higher would not be a surprise he also warned that a dramatic fall in housing activity domestically and recessions in foreign economies could damper u s growth and bring down inflation faster than expected inflation remains one of the most persistent problems for the u s economy and a major issue leading into the 2022 midterm elections

mooresville n c when david gilliland began planning for the 2023 nascar season the former driver took a page from trackhouse racing s playbook and focused more on branding than keeping his name attached to his camping world truck series operation thus tricon garage was born we worked with a marketing company just like marketing letter and we told them we were thinking about rebranding gilliland said they came up with a lot of different ideas it took many weeks and sifting through many different names and logos we thought icon motorsports at first but we didn t really care for that too much our marketing team also suggested that we visit socialzinger for x followers to get a stronger social media presence we kinda do everything here nothing has to leave our campus we are an all encompassed facility and race team we paint our own vehicles we have our own chassis shop our bodies that s how we got the garage in the name instead of racing or motorsports we want people to know we do more we just thought it was a good time to rebrand with our new partnership with toyota and trd having my name on it has never been important to me i want to help create something that is iconic and a brand that can go on for many many years gilliland said the tri in the first part of the name represented the three business partners johnny ray kevin ray and himself while the con signifies the icon that he wants the team to become in the development of young drivers our goal is to create young racing icons gilliland explained our goal is to race on friday turn on the tv on sunday and watch the kids that we ve helped develop through our program race on sunday at the highest level gilliland admitted that watching justin marks and his achievements this year with trackhouse racing and trackhouse entertainment influenced his thought process to see what he has done this year it turned on a light for us gilliland said what they have been able to do and their approach it s what i want to do i want to set ourselves apart we want to be forward thinking and create that next brand that young kids want to wear on their shirt the team s switch from ford to toyota for the 2023 season means the organization is replacing kyle busch motorsports as toyota s development team toyota knew gilliland s contract was up with ford this year the manufacturer began talking with the team in mid august once it became apparent that busch wouldn t return to joe gibbs racing in 2023 trd senior vice president and gm tyler gibbs said when toyota looked at its options gilliland s operation became the logical choice it checked so many boxes for us gibbs said their ability to develop the trucks their ability to control the whole process on the driver development side there are so many variables in racing if we can limit as many of those as possible so that we can see the performance of the driver that just helps in the process it was a pretty clear choice for us in addition to tricon toyota which clinched its 13th truck series manufacturer title at homestead miami speedway will continue to provide manufacturer support to halmar friesen racing hattori racing enterprises and thorsport racing in the nascar truck series thorsport has much of the same thing as tricon but their location in sandusky ohio is a little difficult for us with the driver development performance center being here gibbs said also we didn t want to put all of our eggs in a single basket we figured it was better to have a family of four or five teams than one two or three teams gilliland is no stranger to toyota when the team was known as dgr crosley it fielded toyotas 2018 19 tyler ankrum gave the team its first championship when he won the 2018 arca menards series east title he moved to the truck series in 2019 which was the season the team earned its first ever truck victory at kentucky speedway tricon s three full time drivers next year are corey heim and brothers tanner and taylor gray its fourth truck will have several different drivers we have a number of driver development kids that will go into that truck but some of them are not old enough to race the big tracks gibbs said some of them have sponsorship relationships that make sense for us in different ways we ll work through that with david johnny and kevin heim has run a limited schedule this year competing in 15 truck races he is leading the rookie of the year standings he will seek his first truck championship next year in the no 11 toyota tundra tanner gray the youngest ever nhra pro stock champion will campaign the no 15 in his fourth full time season he is still seeking his first career truck series victory taylor gray will begin his title run in the no 17 truck at the circuit of the americas in march he will miss the first three races next year due to nascar s age restriction policy the younger gray has competed in a dozen truck races with his best finish being sixth at richmond in august he competed throughout the arca ranks this season scoring multiple victories in the national east and west tours

chancellor hunt and prime minister sunak are set to dump the whole historic crisis of out of date and senile british capitalism onto the backs of the working class treasury officials have told the bbc that the pm and his iron chancellor are facing sobering decisions on huge spending cuts and tax rises and are locked in discussions with the international bankers that have the power to destroy the uk government as they did the late and unlamented government for a few weeks of liz truss the darling of the daily telegraph and the right wing when they brought her government to its knees in a few days in a meeting on thursday treasury officials told the pm that economic growth is forecast to be considerably lower than the last independent forecast meaning that they intend to cast the working class and the middle class into a black hole of slashed wages and pensions and ever rising prices using the war in ukraine as a tool a part of the master plan to save british capitalism is to be announced on november 17th the treasury would not put a figure on how much the chancellor and prime minister will need to find in the budget next month but the bbc has been told it may begin with the figure of 50bn multiple sources said the amount of money the government needed to raise through spending cuts and tax rises was also more than just this current hole in its finances this they said was because the government needed some headroom beyond just getting their existing debt down in case the economy does not grow as much as expected and in fact nosedives the crux is that the savage spending cuts and tax rises in this budget will further shatter any near future economic growth while government borrowing costs have fallen somewhat in recent days officials warned hunt and sunak that borrowing costs will grow as global interest rates also rise pointing out that the interest rate or yield on 10 year uk government debt is just over 10 basis points higher than before the mini budget the pm and chancellor have already agreed that to ensure the package is credible to financial markets there must also be a buffer which means a much bigger repair job than was previously expected a treasury source said markets have calmed somewhat but the picture is still bleak britain is facing an economic crisis with a massive fiscal black hole to fill people should not underestimate the scale of this challenge or how tough the decisions will have to be we ve seen what happens when governments ignore this reality last month sterling fell to a record low against the dollar as government borrowing costs rose in the aftermath of then chancellor kwasi kwarteng s mini budget the financial markets plunged into turmoil when kwarteng announced major tax cuts without detailing how they would be paid for but the cost of government borrowing has since fallen back to the level it was at before the mini budget the pound also rallied after sunak became prime minister and as the dollar fell in sunak s first speech as prime minister on tuesday he said he would fix the mistakes made during his predecessor s time in office the pm said he would place economic stability and confidence at the heart of his government s agenda and promised to show compassion while making difficult decisions in the way that a vet puts down his favourite dog the truth of the matter is that the world wide capitalist crisis is deepening as the imperialist powers pour billions into ukraine to try and weaken russia a tactic that has already caused worldwide inflation and seen all of a sudden millions of workers in the eu the uk and the usa going hungry and fearing the cold and the future their children face in fact the government is rushing through legislation to allow it to ban and jail and fine rail strikers such legislation will be modified to include all strikes and strikers as the only way to make a profit the truth is that capitalism is reaching the end of the road and needs to be removed from the face of the earth by socialist revolutions of the working class
next chapter sunrise my breath hung in the cool air as i pulled out my camera and made my way toward some hot caffeine the green neon accent lights bordering the roofline of the recently restored niles flying a service shop glowed brighter than the clouded sky the familiar sound of our favorite four bangers and a few sixes here and there sliced through the crisp morning silence an excited murmur spread through the growing crowd each time another car buzzed by cars which were now filling the overflow lot down the road before the sun began to rise above the rolling hills beyond niles boulevard in fremont california was already packed with old school japanese cars riko s meeting was well and underway and it was barely 7 00am my camera was pushed beyond its capabilities shooting handheld in the light of dawn and i couldn t believe how many people made it up before the sun to get a good spot at the cars coffee esque gathering i m not sure what the exact recipe is for a good event but riko s meeting had the key ingredients nailed the location was well thought out with the niles flying a providing a fantastic hub for the natural ebb and flow of enthusiasts as they meandered about grabbing coffee or donuts and catching up with friends riko rented out the space for the morning which is nestled into the historic niles district in fremont old buildings and homes line the wide sidewalks across the street and the aesthetic is completed by a couple of vintage american cars parked out back generally this area is inundated with american muscle but not today the semi curated turnout consisted only of japanese cars mostly those produced in the pre 2000s just as advertised in pre event flyers that made the social media rounds riko collaborated with roger hernandez who organizes weekly import centric cars coffee meets in the nearby city hayward to help promote the event and ensure a solid turnout of vintage japanese metal a few nice late model builds snuck in as well as did a volkswagen karmann ghia and a food truck which had delicious tacos and breakfast burritos though somewhat regrettably i only tried the former later in the day there was one other volkswagen on site as well a bus turned pop up boba tea shop that was situated out front of the flying a riko s ae86 was parked up front and center nearby featuring his signature gold finish and an itb fed 3s ge behind a levin nose the car has already been featured on speedhunters as has his matching 993 rwb and imsa style 240z for that matter so i won t spend much time on it beyond a few photos to remind you how wild this sema show build is with sema right around the corner again it s great to see that many of these cars do in fact have a life beyond the las vegas convention center while the venue cars drinks and food were great the people are the glue that holds a personable show like this together being a local gathering just a few miles from my front door actually there were lots of familiar faces that filled the sidewalks on the east end of niles boulevard but you know how events like this are it doesn t matter if you know someone or not you can just walk right up and start asking them about their wheels their suspension their seats who rebuilt their carburetors where they got that honda sweatshirt or whatever although things have been rebooted here in the us for a good year or so i feel like i m still recovering from more than a year of stagnated events and gatherings due to covid since things have gotten back to normal i ve been to a number of cars coffee gatherings but somehow riko s meeting was extra refreshing more than 100 cars and even more people came through the meet which lasted the full four hours from 7 00am to 11 00am and then some it was the first time in a long time that i spent more than an hour or two at a meet like this and it also was the first time in a long time that i found myself shooting far more than i needed to there was a bit of everything on display from completely stock examples to the ultra modified from kei cars to off roading machines from carbureted inline fours to twin turbocharged v8s it s amazing how much variation can be found within a single chassis let alone the many different models from various marques that made it out to riko s meeting before things dwindled down and everyone got on with the rest of their weekend riko held a raffle full of small items from japan including car magazines an unopened initial d manga set that i really wished i had won and an authentic japanese nudie mag among other things best of all tickets were free you just had to show up the raffle and the whole show for that matter was riko s way of contributing to the community and to the growing base of jdm enthusiasts riko explained that while many others his age have moved on to lamborghinis or ferraris he has stayed true to what he s always loved old school japanese cars while i would consider the gathering a smashing success it s clear that riko wants more he points to events like pebble beach or the more recently formed velocity invitational which took place the same weekend and notes that there isn t really a japanese centric equivalent in the us jccs in socal or marque specific events like zcon or nsxpo are the closest that come to mind but they certainly don t hold the prestige or cachet of shows like pebble or the quail the japanese automotive invitational a pebble beach sub event is a good step in the right direction and a sign that japanese cars are finally being appreciated for the gems that they are but for riko the sky s the limit and he wants to do his part in pushing the scene forward in the us so he s here raising his flag for japanese car culture what s next only time will tell before heading home i pulled out a 3d film camera that i picked up from my good friend john cirone during covid times and gave it a try for the first time i may get reprimanded for uploading such large files give them a second to load but enjoy i ll be back soon to shine a spotlight on a couple of my favorite cars from riko s meeting thanks to everyone who showed up and made the event what it was trevor ryan instagram trevornotryan tyrphoto com gettin 3d with it
article all summer long aleen hudson kept looking for a new minivan or suv for her growing passenger shuttle service she had a good credit rating and enough cash for a down payment yet dealerships in the detroit area didn t have any suitable vehicles or they d demand she pay 3 000 to 6 000 above the sticker price months of frustration left her despondent i was depressed hudson said i was angry too a breakthrough arrived in late september when a dealer called about a 2022 chrysler pacifica at 41 000 it was hardly a bargain and it wasn t quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence a buyer s strike is how adam jonas an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy related typical monthly payment for a new vehicle hits record 743 higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective related rolls royce unveils its 1st fully electric car with 400k price tag spectre

buffalo n y wkbw the shelves are no longer bare but baby formula remains in short supply baby formula plant abbott laboratories plans to spend about 500 billion to build a new baby formula plant in light of a shortage that took off by problems of a recall in february when sarah mruk became a new mom she never expected this would be her biggest hurdle it s been a challenge i ve been scared and upset the whole time but it s almost been a tamed scared and upset then this week was just full blown panic the new mom said mruk has been battling the baby formula shortage since her daughter was born seven months ago the shortage began only two months prior she said she can usually find formula after visiting a handful of stores but this month she said she and her husband called various stores and kept hitting roadblocks my husband was fishing down in silver creek new york and he called me he was like why don t i start here and i ll hit a couple of stores on my way back he made it from silver creek an hour south of buffalo all the way to niagara falls nothing so then he called wegman s tops walgreens rite aid s walmart and striking out mruk said the issue began in february when the fda found strains of a bacteria that can be deadly for babies the average out of stock rate rose to 40 in may 43 of formula products were out of stock nationwide according to a utah state university study states like iowa the dakotas missouri and texas were hit hardest according to american process see also 2 children admitted to tennessee hospital due to nationwide formula shortage this shortage has reached a point where mruk and her husband plan outings to even search for formula sometimes it takes hours at the end of the day there really is no alternative for their little one additionally wic state agencies have contracts with one of three manufacturers to provide formula to wic infants who are partially or fully formula fed according to the u s department of agriculture if you are formula feeding your baby you need formula it s not as simple as buying a different brand baby stomachs are sensitive it s like telling somebody who drinks almond milk to go drink 2 milk you re going to get a tummy ache you can t change it on your baby mid stream mruk explained locally formula stock is pretty scarce for stores like wegman s and tops we unfortunately continue to see a strain on supply of baby formula and expect for this to continue well into 2023 in the meantime we continue to try to get additional product from other manufacturers to help alleviate any shortages tops friendly markets we do have options on our store shelves for baby formula supply is not at the usual level but steadily increasing since the lowest supplies we saw back in june wegmans 7 news reached out to walmart and have yet to hear back area nonprofits like feedmore wny partner with four different agencies through these four counties erie niagara cattaraugus and chautauqua feedmore western new york public relations manager catherine schick said feedmore western new york always welcomes donations of baby food formula we do ask that that item is donated in advance of the expiration date because that is one of the products that actually has to be used by the best buy date so if you can make a donation of baby formula we do ask that it be three to six months in advance before that expiration date is occurring we also are able to order baby needs products including baby formula through our vendors as well infant formula is just one of the items it offers to agencies should they need more formula schick said when a mother or parent guardian goes through our pantry and it is need of baby formula we have our pantry partners work with them one of the things they ask is household size a household side and how many children that you have in the home that is requiring formula would likely determine how much formula they are able to receive in batavia another nonprofit has been used as a resource for mothers looking for more formula all babies cherished pregnancy executive director sue sherman is advising moms to talk to their pediatrician see if there is any sample formulas that is available through them can you get a script if you don t have one sometimes doctors can write a prescription for the formulas and it makes it a little bit easier for them to get rather than it being a formula on a shelf sherman added she said to utilize resources through a mom group or network moms hang in there and talk to each other if you have moms in a group or you re working with or talking to communicate the needs because there s usually a mom out there that can help sherman said mruk did something similar and was able to turn to friends living across state lines i ended up going to my personal network on instagram which is my a bunch of my personal friends and just saying this problem is still happening it s truly just alarming and shameful that it continues to happen mruk said a list of baby need programs in the buffalo area can be found here related stories

elon musk closed out the 44 billion deal to acquire san francisco based social media giant twitter thursday evening and immediately cleaned out the c suite firing ceo parag agrawal and cfo ned segal according to published reports by cbs news elon musk closed out the 44 billion deal to acquire san francisco based social media giant twitter thursday evening and immediately cleaned out the c suite firing ceo parag agrawal and cfo ned segal according to published reports a few hours later musk tweeted the bird has been freed a reference to twitter s logo the departures came just hours before a deadline set by a delaware judge to finalize the deal on friday she threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached although they came quickly the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial tesla ceo will make musk privately clashed with agrawal in april immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company according to text messages later revealed in court filings about the same time he used twitter to criticize gadde the company s top lawyer his tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of gadde from other twitter accounts for gadde an 11 year twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks in addition to calls for musk to fire her on thursday after she was fired the harassing tweets lit up once again musk s changes will be aimed at increasing twitter s subscriber base and revenue musk says he can increase twitter s subscriber base and and revenue but his takeover raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform and the many corners of society impacted by it earlier thursday musk attempted to calm advertisers by saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn t want it to become a free for all hellscape the message reflects concerns among advertisers twitter s chief source of revenue that musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users the reason i acquired twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence musk wrote in an unusually long message for the billionaire tesla ceo who typically projects his thoughts in one line tweets he continued there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society musk told advertisers thursday he wants twitter to be the most respected advertising platform in the world he said it should be warm and welcoming to all and enable users to choose the experience they want to have i didn t do it to make money he said of the pending acquisition i did it to try to help humanity whom i love and i do so with humility recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal despite our best efforts is a very real possibility friday s deadline to close the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in an epic battle during which musk signed an april deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to conclude the deal if the two sides don t meet the friday deadline the next step could be a november trial that would likely lead to a judge forcing musk to complete the deal but musk has been signaling that the deal is going through he strolled into the company s san francisco headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink changed his twitter profile to chief twit and tweeted entering twitter hq let that sink in the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation several hours after posting his sink video musk tweeted that he was meeting a lot of cool people at twitter today he gave no details one of musk s biggest obstacles to closing the deal was keeping in place the financing pledged roughly six months ago a group of banks including morgan stanley and bank of america signed on earlier this year to loan 12 5 billion of the money musk needed to buy twitter and take it private solid contracts with musk bound the banks to the financing although changes in the economy and debt markets since april have likely made the terms less attractive musk even said his investment group would be buying twitter for more than it s worth less clear is what s happening with the billions of dollars pledged to musk by investors who would get ownership stakes in twitter musk s original slate of equity partners included an array of partners ranging from the billionaire s tech world friends with like minded ideas about twitter s future such as oracle co founder larry ellison to funds controlled by middle eastern royalty the more equity investors kick in for the deal the less musk has to pay on his own most of his wealth is tied up in shares of tesla the electric car company that he runs since april he has sold more than 15 billion worth of tesla stock presumably to pay his share more sales could be coming musk 51 has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform while he s touted free speech and derided spam bots since agreeing to buy the company in april what he actually wants to do about either remains a mystery technology analysts have speculated that musk wants to use twitter to help create an everything app similar to china s wechat service which allows users to do video chats message stream video scan bar codes and make payments first published on october 27 2022 7 26 am 2022

rachel hadas rutgers university newark there seems to be no sense of shame or its cousin guilt in our time conspiracy theorist alex jones tormented the parents of sandy hook s murdered children by spreading the lie that the massacre was faked the families sued as the jury s decision ordering jones to pay almost us 1 billion to them was read in court on oct 12 2022 jones appearing online from his studio was laughing and mocking the amounts being awarded nbc news reported gop georgia senate candidate herschel walker resolutely anti abortion with no exception for rape incest or the life of the mother denies allegations that he paid for a girlfriend s abortion missouri republican sen josh hawley riled up the capitol rioters with a clenched fist salute on jan 6 2021 and then ran from those same rioters when they invaded the capitol while republicans are by far the most prominently shameless among politicians the condition is bipartisan in some areas democrats and republicans showed up on a long list of legislators caught violating a law that requires them to disclose stock trading shame and guilt seem equally foreign to many politicians and public figures these days but here is what is different now from those in the past who behaved badly where once the lack of guilt and shame would have been cloaked by a veneer of virtuousness today s shameless see no need for that veil of hypocrisy for millennia hypocrisy was the sneaky cloak of choice for miscreants they used it to signal respect for society by pretending to play within its rules now they smirk hypocrisy is old fashioned and apparently unnecessary willful dissembling the greek verb from which we derive hypocrisy and hypocrite originally meant to respond over time this verb and its cognate noun acquired a theatrical context a response or speech onstage so in ancient times a hypocrite was someone playing a part but the term was morally more or less neutral by the time of the new testament the word hypocrite had acquired the sense of willful dissembling of playing a part with an intention to deceive the role enacted involved assuming a good quality that in reality didn t exist in matthew 23 25 27 christ inveighs against the scribes and pharisees hypocrites who are like unto whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men s bones and of all uncleanness their spotless exteriors conceal inner foulness hypocrisy then suggests a disconnect between good qualities such as virtue courage or generosity and the corresponding vices corruption cowardice greed which a shiny surface conceals victorian novels are rich in examples of hypocrites who are sometimes villains and sometimes more or less amusing minor characters dickens novels offer a gallery of businessmen clergymen schoolmasters and others who present respectable exteriors but who in their private lives and sometimes in public too are selfish and cruel dickens had a genius for inventing appropriate names for such people a few examples include mssrs pecksniff murdstone veneering and pumblechook which furnish entertaining clues to the moral texture of these characters naturally readers thirst to see these victorian hypocrites humbled exposed in a word shamed and the definition of shame in the oxford english dictionary turns out to have a distinctly victorian flavor the painful emotion arising from the consciousness of something dishonoring ridiculous or indecorous to one s own conduct or circumstances or of being in a situation which offends one s sense of modesty or decency most of the hypocrites encountered in victorian novels are unmasked or humbled in the end though not all uriah heep and littimer in david copperfield both exposed as villains near the end of the novel are last glimpsed as model inmates in a creepy panopticonlike prison as smarmy and sanctimonious as ever they re jailed but not humbled no more dissonance moving from the 19th century to the 21st the bad behavior currently on display is a little different from the victorian version or from the whited sepulchers of the gospel passage hypocrisy from the language in matthew to the villainy of a murdstone always used to suggest a disconnect or dissonance between what was seen in public and what was really lurking underneath but today there seems no such clear line of demarcation to begin with there s no firm sense of truth what the record shows videos transcripts recordings often fails to convince at least one side of the public if it s condemned by the perpetrator as a witch hunt or fake news journalist carlos lozada in an illuminating recent essay titled the inside joke that became trump s big lie called donald trump s false claim that he won the 2020 election a classic trumpian projection the lie is true and the truth is fake the description applies perfectly to the appalling lies of alex jones in such a topsy turvy world there s no such thing as a hypocrite lozada points out that rather than hiding their rottenness beneath a show of virtue the people whose antics we hear about daily seem to flaunt their true colors if true is the right word their bad behavior is now acceptable so it needs no disguise the moral balance encountered in victorian novels where hypocrites generally come to grief now seems obsolete almost a quaint relic greek tragedies don t seem relevant either in greek tragedy the hero may make a mistake or be caught in an untenable situation he may make a terrible decision that destroys others or himself he may go mad and then recover his senses to view with horror the destruction he has caused he may blame the gods for the devastation that has taken place but i can t think of a case in which he pretends to be something he isn t and shame is a key emotion in many tragedies when oedipus discovers he has committed the crimes whose perpetrator he has been pursuing he blinds and exiles himself in other tragedies ajax and heracles unwittingly do terrible damage when they recover their senses they punish themselves the notion of hypocrisy seems to have come full circle returning to its theatrical connotations where a hypocrite was someone simply playing a part we re back to acting after all and the stage is our country rachel hadas professor of english rutgers university newark this article is republished from the
