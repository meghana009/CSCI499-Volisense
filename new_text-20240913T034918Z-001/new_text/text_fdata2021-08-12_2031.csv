claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank disinformation to scare people according to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers there has not been a single case of ade the question is it true vaccines do not stop infection stock made this claim about 18 minutes into the school board meeting when he said no vaccine ever stops infection the sources the answer stock s claim that no vaccine ever stops infection needs context there isn t a single vaccine that is 100 efficacious meaning they stop infection some of the time but not all of the time what we found according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc all covid 19 vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid 19 as seen in clinical trial settings and research shows growing evidence mrna covid 19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions but the vaccines aren t quite 100 effective in a release from pfizer biontech the vaccine was 95 4 effective against covid 19 moderna announced the vaccine was greater than 90 efficacy against cases of covid 19 and more than 95 against severe cases the cdc reported the johnson johnson vaccine was 66 3 effective in clinical trials what s interesting about vaccine efficacy is that it doesn t function in a bubble so vaccine efficacy is highly dependent upon how much infection you have in your community kohli said so when you have high rates of infection in the community the vaccines don t work as well and then when the infection rates are lower the vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection goes up it s also obviously dependent on our behaviors she said the question is the vaccine responsible for the current spike in covid 19 cases at about 19 minutes into the meeting stock said with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of covid 19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin d levels are at their highest the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus centers for disease control and prevention the answer no the vaccine has not caused a recent spike in covid 19 cases what we found dr payal kohli told verify that vitamin d does support immune function but that has nothing to do with the recent rise in cases the rise in cases is because the delta variant is more contagious than the alpha strain the question is ivermectin vitamin d and or zinc an approved treatment for covid 19 stock mentions about 20 minutes into the video that he had successfully treated 15 patients with this antibiotic cocktail the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer no that treatment plan has not been approved by the food drug administration fda or the centers for disease control prevention cdc what we found ivermectin is not approved for use in treating or preventing covid 19 in humans the fda warned ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms and there are topical on the skin formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses according to the fda kohli said zinc and vitamin d can be used to bulk up immune function but there isn t scientific evidence that exists to date that supports the use of those two drugs along with ivermectin to treat covid 19 the question is it true that people who have recovered from covid 19 get no benefit from vaccinations at all stock made the claim at about 21 minutes into the video the sources the answer no a study in the united states shows individuals who had covid 19 and are unvaccinated are more at risk of contracting the virus again what we found dr beau m ances with washington university and a member of the american neurological association told verify the chance for a vaccinated individual to catch covid 19 or variants is significantly reduced at washington university in st louis we are having a large uptick in the number of individuals with covid coming into our hospital and it is primarily those individuals who have not been vaccinated versus those that have been vaccinated ances said that doesn t mean that everybody who gets vaccinated is not going to still not have it he said and we know there have been outbreaks that have been present but the overall morbidity and mortality of those individuals is significantly reduced dr gabriel t bosslet with the indiana university school of medicine told tv station wthr the claim stock made holds no merit all the studies are that people who previously had covid 19 when you measure antibody levels before and after the vaccine it goes up said bosslet so i have no clue where data comes from and frankly that defies all logic what i would tell people is if you hear stuff like this that runs completely counter to everything that the scientists and physicians have been telling you for the last 18 months you need to talk to your doctor and bounce this off of other sources you need to go and talk to other physicians not just people who are going to confirm your prior beliefs he told wthr

justin elliott and robert faturechi pro publica this story was originally published by propublica in november 2017 with the administration of president donald trump rushing to get a massive tax overhaul through congress sen ron johnson stunned his colleagues by announcing he would vote no making the rounds on cable tv the wisconsin republican became the first gop senator to declare his opposition spooking senate leaders who were pushing to quickly pass the tax bill with their thin majority if they can pass it without me let them johnson declared johnson s demand was simple in exchange for his vote the bill must sweeten the tax break for a class of companies that are known as pass throughs since profits pass through to their owners johnson praised such companies as engines of innovation behind the scenes the senator pressed top treasury department officials on the issue emails and the officials calendars show within two weeks johnson s ultimatum produced results trump personally called the senator to beg for his support and the bill s authors fattened the tax cut for these businesses johnson flipped to a yes and claimed credit for the change the bill passed the trump administration championed the pass through provision as tax relief for small businesses confidential tax records however reveal that johnson s last minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country both worth billions and both among the senator s biggest donors more ron johnson defends pass through tax provision as democrats accuse him of doing the bidding of his top donors more from propublica the secret irs files dick and liz uihlein of packaging giant uline along with roofing magnate diane hendricks together had contributed around 20 million to groups backing johnson s 2016 reelection campaign the expanded tax break johnson muscled through netted them 215 million in deductions in 2018 alone drastically reducing the income they owed taxes on at that rate the cut could deliver more than half a billion in tax savings for hendricks and the uihleins over its eight year life but the tax break did more than just give a lucrative and legal perk to johnson s donors in the first year after trump signed the legislation just 82 ultrawealthy households collectively walked away with more than 1 billion in total savings an analysis of confidential tax records shows republican and democratic tycoons alike saw their tax bills chopped by tens of millions among them media magnate and former democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg the bechtel family owners of the engineering firm that bears their name and the heirs of the late houston pipeline billionaire dan duncan usually the scale of the riches doled out by opaque tax legislation and the beneficiaries remain shielded from the public but propublica has obtained a trove of irs records covering thousands of the wealthiest americans the records have enabled reporters this year to explore the diverse menu of options the tax code affords the ultrawealthy to avoid paying taxes the drafting of the trump law offers a unique opportunity to examine how the billionaire class is able to shape the code to its advantage building in new ways to sidestep taxes the tax cuts and jobs act was the biggest rewrite of the code in decades and arguably the most consequential legislative achievement of the one term president crafted largely in secret by a handful of trump administration officials and members of congress the bill was rushed through the legislative process as draft language of the bill made its way through congress lawmakers friendly to billionaires and their lobbyists were able to nip and tuck and stretch the bill to accommodate a variety of special groups the flurry of midnight deals and last minute insertions of language resulted in a vast redistribution of wealth into the pockets of a select set of families siphoning away billions in tax revenue from the nation s coffers this story is based on lobbying and campaign finance disclosures treasury department emails and calendars obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit and confidential tax records for those who benefited from the bill s modifications the collective millions spent on campaign donations and lobbying were minuscule compared with locking in years of enormous tax savings a spokesperson for the uihleins declined to comment representatives for hendricks didn t respond to questions in response to emailed questions johnson did not address whether he had discussed the expanded tax break with hendricks or the uihleins instead he wrote in a statement that his advocacy was driven by his belief that the tax code needs to be simplified and rationalized more bice how would you spend 88 million diane hendricks and uihleins gave it away in campaign donations in two years more diane hendricks three others resign from beloit college board of trustees my support for pass through entities that represent over 90 of all businesses was guided by the necessity to keep them competitive with c corporations and had nothing to do with any donor or discussions with them he wrote by the summer of 2017 it was clear that trump s first major legislative initiative to repeal and replace obamacare had gone up in flames taking a marquee campaign promise with it looking for a win the administration turned to tax reform getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill shaping up even better than projected trump tweeted house and senate working very hard and smart end result will be not only important but special at the top of the republican wishlist was a deep tax cut for corporations there was little doubt that such a cut would make it into the final legislation but because of the complexity of the tax code slashing the corporate tax rate doesn t actually affect most u s businesses corporate taxes are paid by what are known in tax lingo as c corporations which include large publicly traded firms like at t or coca cola most businesses in the united states aren t c corporations they re pass throughs the name comes from the fact that when one of these businesses makes money the profits are not subject to corporate taxes instead they pass through directly to the owners who pay taxes on the profits on their personal returns unlike major shareholders in companies like amazon who can avoid taking income by not selling their stock owners of successful pass throughs typically can t avoid it pass throughs include the full gamut of american business from small barbershops to law firms to in the case of uline a packaging distributor with thousands of employees so alongside the corporate rate cut for the at ts of the world the trump tax bill included a separate tax break for pass through companies for budgetary reasons the tax break is not permanent sunsetting after eight years proponents touted it as boosting small business and main street and it s true that many small businesses got a modest tax break but a recent study by treasury economists found that the top 1 of americans by income have reaped nearly 60 of the billions in tax savings created by the provision and most of that amount went to the top 0 1 that s because even though there are many small pass through businesses most of the pass through profits in the country flow to the wealthy owners of a limited group of large companies tax records show that in 2018 bloomberg whom forbes ranks as the 20th wealthiest person in the world got the largest known deduction from the new provision slashing his tax bill by nearly 68 million when he briefly ran for president in 2020 bloomberg s tax plan proposed ending the deduction though his plan was generally friendlier to the wealthy than those of his rivals a spokesperson for bloomberg declined to comment johnson s intervention in november 2017 was designed to boost the bill s already generous tax break for pass through companies the bill had allowed for business owners to deduct up to 17 4 of their profits thanks to johnson holding out that figure was ultimately boosted to 20 more u s sen ron johnson could vote against tax overhaul tuesday in committee more u s sen ron johnson backs tax cuts dismisses 1 trillion projected increase in federal debt more corporations and businesses would receive nearly half of federal tax cut in wisconsin that might seem like a small increase but even a few extra percentage points can translate into tens of millions of dollars in extra deductions in one year alone for an ultrawealthy family the mechanics are complicated but for the rich it generally means that a business owner gets to keep an extra 7 cents on every dollar of profit to understand the windfall take the case of the uihlein family dick the great grandson of a beer magnate and his wife liz own and operate packaging giant uline the logo of the pleasant prairie wisconsin firm is stamped on the bottom of countless paper bags uline produced nearly 1 billion in profits in 2018 according to propublica s analysis of tax records dick and liz uihlein who own a majority of the company reported more than 700 million in income that year but they were able to slash what they owed the irs with a 118 million deduction generated by the new tax break liz uihlein who serves as president of uline has criticized high taxes in her company newsletter the year before the tax overhaul the couple gave generously to support trump s 2016 presidential campaign that same year when johnson faced long odds in his reelection bid against former sen russ feingold the uihleins gave more than 8 million to a series of political committees that blanketed the state with pro johnson and anti feingold ads that blitz led the milwaukee journal sentinel to dub the uihleins the koch brothers of wisconsin politics johnson s campaign also got a boost from hendricks wisconsin s richest woman and owner of roofing wholesaler abc supply co the beloit based billionaire has publicly pushed for tax breaks and said she wants to stop the u s from becoming a socialistic ideological nation hendricks has said johnson won her over after she grilled him at a brunch meeting six years earlier she gave about 12 million to a pair of political committees the reform america fund and the freedom partners action fund that bought ads attacking feingold in the first year of the pass through tax break hendricks got a 97 million deduction on income of 502 million by reducing the income she owed taxes on that deduction saved her around 36 million even after johnson won the expansion of the pass through break in late 2017 the final text of the tax overhaul wasn t settled a congressional conference committee had to iron out the differences between the senate and house versions of the bill sometime during this process eight words that had been in neither the house nor the senate bill were inserted applied without regard to the words engineering architecture with that wonky bit of legalese congress smiled on the bechtel clan the bechtels engineering and construction company is one of the largest and most politically connected private firms in the country with surgical precision the new language guaranteed the bechtels a massive tax cut in previous versions of the bill construction would have been given a tax break but engineering was one of the industries excluded from the pass through deduction for reasons that remain murky when the bill with its eight added words took effect in 2018 three great great grandchildren of the company s founder ceo brendan bechtel and his siblings darren and katherine together netted deductions of 111 million on 679 million in income tax records show and that s just one generation of bechtels the heirs father riley also holds a piece of the firm as does a group of nonfamily executives and board members in all bechtel corporation produced around 2 3 billion of profit in 2018 alone the vast majority of which appears to be eligible for the 20 deduction who wrote the phrase and which lawmaker inserted it has been a much discussed mystery in the tax policy world propublica found that a lobbyist who worked for both bechtel and an industry trade group has claimed credit for the alteration in the months leading up to the bill s passage in 2017 bechtel had executed a full court press in washington meeting with trump administration officials and spending more than 1 million lobbying on tax issues marc gerson of the washington law firm miller chevalier was paid to lobby on the tax bill by both bechtel and the american council of engineering companies of which bechtel is a member at a presentation for the trade group s members a few weeks after trump signed the bill into law gerson credited his efforts for the pass through tax break calling it a major legislative victory for the engineering industry gerson did not respond to a request for comment bechtel s push was part of a long history of lobbying for tax breaks by the company two decades ago it even hired a former irs commissioner as part of a successful bid to get engineering and architectural services included in one of president george w bush s tax cuts the company s lobbying on the trump tax bill and the tax break it received highlight a paradox at the core of bechtel the family has for years showered money on anti tax candidates even though as the new yorker s jane mayer has written bechtel owed almost its entire existence to government patronage most famous for being one of the companies that built the hoover dam in recent years it has bid on and won marquee federal projects among them a healthy share of the billions spent by american taxpayers to rebuild iraq after the war the firm recently moved its longtime headquarters from san francisco to reston virginia a hub for federal contractors just outside the beltway a spokesperson for bechtel corporation didn t respond to questions about the company s lobbying the spokesperson as well as a representative of the family s investment office didn t respond to requests to accept questions about the family s tax records brendan bechtel has emerged this year as a vocal critic of president joe biden s proposal to pay for new infrastructure with tax hikes it s unfair to ask business to shoulder or cover all the additional costs of this public infrastructure investment he said on a recent cnbc appearance as the landmark tax overhaul sped through the legislative process other prosperous groups of business owners worried they would be left out with the help of lobbyists and sometimes after direct contact with lawmakers they too were invited into what trump dubbed his big beautiful tax cut among the biggest winners during the final push were real estate developers the senate bill included a formula that restricted the size of the new deduction based on how much a pass through business paid in wages congressional republicans framed the provision as rewarding businesses that create jobs in effect it meant a highly profitable business with few employees like a real estate developer wouldn t be able to benefit much from the break developers weren t happy several marshaled lobbyists and prodded friendly lawmakers to turn things around at least two of them turned to johnson dear ron ted kellner a wisconsin developer and a colleague wrote in a letter to johnson i m concerned that the goal of a fair efficient and growth oriented tax overhaul will not be achieved especially for private real estate pass through entities johnson forwarded the letter from kellner a political donor of his to top republicans in the house and senate all yesterday i received this letter from very smart and successful businessmen in milwaukee adding that the legislation as it stood gave pass throughs widely disparate grossly unfair treatment house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady r texas responded with a promise to do more senator i strongly agree we should continue to improve the pass through provisions at every step you are a great champion for this congress is not subject to the freedom of information act but treasury officials were copied on the email exchange propublica obtained the exchange after suing the treasury department kellner got his wish in the final days of the legislative process real estate investors were given a side door to access the full deduction language was added to the final legislation that allowed them to qualify if they had a large portfolio of buildings even if they had small payrolls with that some of the richest real estate developers in the country were welcomed into the fold the tax records obtained by propublica show that one of the top real estate industry winners was donald bren sole owner of the southern california based irvine company and one of the wealthiest developers in the united states in 2018 alone bren personally enjoyed a deduction of 22 million because of the tax break bren s representatives did not respond to emails and calls from propublica his company had hired wes coulam a prominent washington lobbyist with ernst young to advocate for its interests as the bill was being hammered out before coulam became a lobbyist he worked on capitol hill as a tax policy adviser for utah sen orrin hatch hatch then the republican chair of the senate finance committee publicly took credit for the final draft of the new deduction amid questions about the real estate carveout hatch s representatives did not respond to questions from propublica about how the carveout was added propublica s records show that other big real estate winners include adam portnoy head of commercial real estate giant the rmr group who got a 14 million deduction in 2018 donald sterling the real estate developer and disgraced former owner of the los angeles clippers won an 11 million deduction representatives for portnoy and sterling did not respond to questions from propublica another gift to the real estate industry in the bill was a tax deduction of up to 20 on dividends from real estate investment trusts more commonly known as reits these companies are essentially bundles of various real estate assets which investors can buy chunks of reits make money by collecting rent from tenants and interest from loans used to finance real estate deals the tax cut for these investment vehicles was pushed by both the real estate roundtable a trade group for the entire industry and the national association of real estate investment trusts the latter a trade group specifically for reits spent more than 5 million lobbying in washington the year the tax bill was drafted more than it had in any year in its history steven roth the founder of vornado realty trust a prominent reit is a regular donor to both groups political committees roth had close ties to the trump administration including advising on infrastructure and doing business with jared kushner s family he became one of the biggest winners from the reit provision in the trump tax law roth earned more than 27 million in reit dividends in the two years after the bill passed potentially allowing him a tax deduction of about 5 million tax records show roth did not respond to requests for comment and his representatives did not accept questions from propublica on his behalf another carveout benefited investors of publicly traded pipeline businesses sen john cornyn a texas republican added an amendment for them to the senate version of the bill just before it was voted on without his amendment investors who made under a certain income would have received the deduction anyway experts told propublica but for higher income investors a slate of restrictions kicked in in order to qualify they would have needed the businesses they re invested in to pay out significant wages and these oil and gas businesses like real estate developers typically do not cornyn s amendment cleared the way the trade group for these companies and one of its top members enterprise products partners a houston based natural gas and crude oil pipeline company had both lobbied on the bill enterprise was founded by dan duncan who died in 2010 the trump tax bill delivered a win to duncan s heirs propublica s data shows his four children who own stakes in the company together claimed more than 150 million in deductions in 2018 alone the tax provision for small businesses had delivered a windfall to the family forbes ranked as the 11th richest in the country in a statement an enterprise spokesperson wrote the duncan family abides by all applicable tax laws and will not comment on individual tax returns which are a private matter cornyn s office did not respond to questions about the senator s amendment the tax break is due to expire after 2025 and a gulf has opened in congress about the future of the provision in july senate finance chair ron wyden d ore proposed legislation that would end the tax cut early for the ultrawealthy in fact anyone making over 500 000 per year would no longer get the deduction but it would be extended to the business owners below that threshold who are currently excluded because of their industry the bill would make the policy more fair and less complex for middle class business owners while also raising billions for priorities like child care education and health care wyden said in a statement meanwhile dozens of trade groups including the chamber of commerce are pushing to make the pass through tax cut permanent this year a bipartisan bill called the main street tax certainty act was introduced in both houses of congress to do just that one of the bill s sponsors rep henry cuellar d texas pitched the legislation this way i am committed to delivering critical relief for our nation s small businesses and the communities they serve

total combined net capacity of 551 mw the transaction included the acquisition of minority interests not included in the initial announced transaction the spanish portfolio includes 33 operating assets comprised of onshore wind 435 mw solar photovoltaic 66 mw and a concentrated solar 50 mw located throughout spain total cash consideration was 348 million 522 million with the assumption of debt totaling 716 million 1 075 million the acquisition was funded using proceeds from northland s common equity offering completed on april 14 2021 the spanish portfolio immediately places northland as a top ten renewable power operator in spain and creates a platform for growth in an attractive market for renewables northland intends to leverage the acquisition of the spanish portfolio to build a platform with asset management development and operations and maintenance capabilities that can competitively pursue onshore renewables acquisition and development opportunities across europe over the next decade green financings executed northland introduced its green financing framework in february of this year to allow the company and its subsidiaries to issue green bonds loans corporate and project level and other financing instruments for eligible green projects the focus of the green financing initiatives is to support climate change mitigation efforts by developing and investing in renewable energy infrastructure assets that increase green energy production northland has successfully executed its first two green financings with its onshore wind projects in new york and helios solar project in colombia the latter being one of the first renewable project financings in the country both projects secured construction financings which have been designated as green loans by their respective lenders new york 320 mw onshore wind project update northland s ball hill and bluestone onshore wind projects located in broome county and chautauqua county respectively of new york state comprising more than 220 mw of new wind capacity achieved financial close in the second quarter and secured green financing in the form of a non recourse project loan tax equity bridge loan and letters of credit with a consortium of lenders totaling us 381 million approximately c 476 million at a 1 45 interest rate during construction northland will fund investment in the two projects from the equity offering in april 2021 and also expects to secure permanent tax equity investments for the two projects ahead of commercial operations in 2022 construction activities commenced in the second quarter of 2021 for ball hill and bluestone northland s third new york onshore wind project high bridge 100 mw is under active development the total capital cost for the first two projects is expected to be approximately 0 6 billion earlier in the year all three projects were awarded 20 year indexed rec agreements with the new york state energy research and development authority as part of renewable energy solicitations the new york projects form part of northland s broader strategy for onshore renewable development in the united states where the company is targeting a total portfolio of 1 gw and has hired a dedicated local team of people to execute on this strategy the projects will offer social economic and environmental benefits to new york state and once complete are expected to contribute to the state s green energy production helping fulfill new york s clean energy transformation the electricity generated at full capacity is expected to be capable of powering over 125 000 new york homes this is equivalent to avoiding over 450 000 metric tons of carbon co‚ÇÇ emissions annually which represents the greenhouse gas emissions from nearly 100 000 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year helios 16 mw solar project update subsequent to the quarter northland s 16 mw helios solar project in colombia also achieved financial close the project secured a green loan and with construction already underway commercial operations is expected in the first quarter of 2022 helios represents northland s first development project in colombia which capitalizes on ebsa s grandfathered rights allowing it to expand into the energy generation market in colombia to service the power needs of non regulated municipal commercial and industrial c i customers helios has secured a 12 year power purchase agreement with ebsa which in turn will secure offtake agreements with non regulated customers the total capital cost for helios is expected to be under 20 million la lucha 130 mw solar project update at la lucha the 130 mw solar project in the state of durango mexico activities relating to the physical construction of the solar facility are complete however certain activities relating to the energization of the project continue to be delayed in order to achieve commercial operations the facility requires energization followed by testing which is conducted by cenace independent system operator and cfe federal electricity commission due to ongoing administrative delays resulting from the covid 19 pandemic and other issues that have resulted in a backlog of approvals for renewable projects in mexico the energization and testing have been delayed and northland does not anticipate these activities will be complete prior to the end of 2021 northland continues to work with mexican authorities and other private power producers experiencing similar issues to achieve energization of the la lucha project while timelines remain uncertain northland expects commercial operations at la lucha to commence in early 2022 efforts to secure commercial offtake and project financing are expected to be finalized only after commercial operations as a result of the aforementioned delays total capital costs for the project are expected to be around 200 million up from 190 million originally baltic power polish offshore wind project update in june 2021 the baltic power project with a potential for up to 1 200 mw of operating capacity and in which northland has 49 interest secured a 25 year contract for differences cfd from poland s energy regulatory office under the polish offshore wind act under the 25 year contract the project is guaranteed a price of pln 319 60 per mwh which is adjusted to annual indexation by poland s annual average consumer price index the cfd is subject to review and final approval from polish authorities and the european commission upon successful achievement of all necessary approvals construction of baltic power is expected to commence in 2023 following financial close with commercial operations anticipated in 2026 hai long 1 044 mw offshore wind project update in july 2021 hai long received an amendment to the project s environmental impact assessment eia from taiwan s environmental protection agency to accommodate a larger 14 mw turbine with longer blade lengths receipt of the eia amendment allows hai long to complete further fieldwork to improve wind generation yields in april 2021 hai long received confirmation from the taiwan bureau of energy that hai long 2a has secured approval for the industrial relevance proposal which sets out northland s commitments to local supply chain and procurement marking the achievement of a significant milestone the project continues to progress well with financial close expected in 2022 nordsee 2 and nordsee 3 offshore wind projects in 2014 when northland acquired its interest in nordsee one it also acquired an 85 interest in two early stage offshore wind development projects nordsee two n2 and nordsee three n3 as part of the agreement to relinquish these sites to the german government the relevant project companies both subsidiaries of northland were allocated step in rights for upcoming offshore wind site auctions northland is preparing to exercise these step in rights with the first auction for n2 expected later this year these two potential offshore wind projects are expected to have a combined grid capacity of approximately 850 mw second quarter results summary the decrease in the second quarter financial performance relative to the prior year primarily resulted from lower production in the offshore wind segment and a planned outage at one of northland s larger efficient natural gas facilities offshore wind facilities are subject to seasonality and accordingly tend to produce more electricity during winter due to denser air and higher winds compared to summer the effect of which is reflected in the respective fiscal quarter s results while the second quarter is typically a weaker quarter for offshore wind the results for this quarter across all three facilities was below those in the second quarter in 2020 and well below the long term average resulting in lower adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow in addition the second quarter results were also affected by the scheduled outage at north battleford for approximately five weeks to perform scheduled major maintenance work such work is typically performed every eight years to ensure ongoing optimal performance and safety of a facility and was reflected in 2021 financial guidance offshore wind facilities a key performance indicator for the offshore wind facilities is historical long term average lta where

electricity production was 4 or 28 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to an unusually low wind resource at all three offshore facilities partially offset by relatively higher production at the german facilities due to the improved grid availability and fewer periods of negative prices compared to 2020 sales of 205 million decreased 5 or 10 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with lower production at gemini and nordsee one partially offset by fewer periods of uncompensated outages and of negative prices in germany as shown below operating income and adjusted ebitda of 312 million and 355 million respectively decreased 23 or 95 million and 17 or 75 million primarily due to low wind resource in the north sea compared to the same quarter last year the following table summarizes northland s share of lost revenues from factors other than the low wind resource three months ended june 30 six months ended

in sales but do affect adjusted ebitda and free cash flow lost revenue in 2020 was a result of the apx of 28 mwh below the sde floor of 44 mwh for additional details on the sde floor refer to disclosures within md a gemini s revenue arrangement includes a mechanism that tops up the average dutch wholesale market price for the year the apx to a fixed contractual rate per megawatt hour mwh though subject to a floor price sde floor of approximately 44 mwh the sde floor exposes gemini to some market price risk if the apx falls below the sde floor the apx averaged below the sde floor for four of the facility s five years of operation gemini apx hedges as previously reported in the first quarter a covid 19 induced 3 year hedging program implemented in the second quarter of 2020 to mitigate against potential revenue losses from further sustained apx price erosion was cancelled in the second quarter of 2021 following significant recovery of the apx price as economic activity rebounded with the earlier than anticipated success of covid 19 vaccines among other factors as a result in may 2021 northland entered into offsetting financial derivatives to limit the potential lost revenue for 2021 to 2023 under the original financial derivatives while limiting revenue losses in the future the offsetting derivatives crystallized financial losses for northland amounting to 25 million 19 million and 9 million for the second half of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively for the six months ended june 30 2021 gemini recognized 12 million of financial losses subsequent to second quarter northland purchased financial put contracts for the majority of expected production in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for 2022 with a strike price close to the sde floor effectively maximizing apx revenue for the hedged production volume in the period management intends to enter into further put contracts as appropriate for future years in accordance with northland s risk management policy refer to northland s 2021 second quarter md a for additional information nordsee one rotor shaft bearing replacement as disclosed in the first quarter northland identified a component issue on a number of wind turbines at the nordsee one facility affecting the main rotor shaft bearing upon further assessment in the second quarter management concluded the component issue could affect all of the wind turbines leading to premature failure and commenced a replacement campaign of the rotor shaft assemblies rsa the replacement rsa are a tested design expected to last the remaining life of the facility in addition the replacement parts will include warranty coverage from the vendor to date in 2021 nordsee one has replaced four rsa and expects to replace another four this year in 2022 and 2023 management expects to replace all remaining rsa as parts become available and weather conditions allow in some cases nordsee one may need to curtail the performance of some turbines in order to extend their life which would affect overall production turbine availability and may lead to lost revenues in 2022 and 2023 this issue is not expected at northland s other offshore wind facilities which utilize different turbines management will expedite the campaign in 2021 in order to minimize downtime of the wind turbines however it is estimated that nordsee one will incur lost revenue due to turbine curtailments and shutdowns of approximately 8 million 11 million at northland s share in 2021 including 4 million in the first half of the year the anticipated total cost for the 2021 campaign to replace eight bearings is approximately 13 million 16 million at northland s share and the estimated total cost to replace all 54 bearings is 65 million 83 million at northland s share which is expected to be substantially covered by the warranty bond settlement received in 2020 relating to outstanding warranty obligations of nordsee one s turbine manufacturer upon its insolvency northland continues to assess the potential impacts for 2022 and 2023 efficient natural gas facilities electricity production decreased 28 or 204 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to a planned major maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2021 at north battleford and timing of the annual shutdown at another facility sales for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 10 or 9 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower production as described above partially offset by rate escalations at multiple facilities adjusted ebitda of 51 million decreased 15 or 9 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to the same factors affecting sales onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 11 or 38 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 due to overall lower solar and wind resources sales of 58 million were 4 or 3 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to the variances in electricity production adjusted ebitda of 39 million was also lower than the same quarter of 2020 utilities sales of 53 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 5 or 3 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to last year adjusted ebitda of 21 million decreased 8 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 mainly due to unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to last year statement of income loss g a costs of 15 million were largely in line with the same quarter of 2020 development costs of 14 million decreased 28 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to effects of the commencement of capitalization at hai long in 2020 combined with the timing of development activities at other projects net finance costs of 76 million decreased 14 or 12 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of scheduled repayments on facility level loans and repayment of borrowings on the corporate revolving facility as a result of the equity offering in april 2021 fair value loss on derivative contracts was 25 million compared to a 30 million gain in the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to losses realized on settlement of apx hedges and net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to the apx interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 46 million is primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rate other income was 35 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 due to proceeds received from the sale of turbines in the second quarter of 2020 originally intended for use with mono bucket foundations at deutsche bucht as well as accrued insurance proceeds in the prior year period related to construction of deutsche bucht net loss of 6 million decreased 109 or 81 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the factors described above as well as accelerated amortization expense on iroquois falls property plant and equipment due to the expiry of its ppa in december 2021 partially offset by 25 million lower tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 203 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 10 or 24 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted ebitda include 17 million decrease in operating results at gemini primarily due to the lower wind resource and apx hedge losses realized and 12 million decrease in operating results from the efficient natural gas and onshore facilities largely due to the planned major outage at north battleford and a lower wind and solar resource the factor partially offsetting these decreases in adjusted ebitda was a 4 million increase in operating results from deutsche bucht largely due to increased production commensurate with better grid availability compared to last year free cash flow free cash flow of 6 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 68 or 12 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing free cash flow include 14 million decrease in overall earnings primarily due to lower wind resource at the offshore wind facilities and a planned maintenance outage at north battleford and 4 million increase in non expansionary capital expenditures primarily at north battleford and nordsee one the factor partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 6 million decrease in net financing costs primarily as a result of scheduled repayments on facility level loans and repayment of borrowings on the corporate revolving facility in april 2021 adjusted free cash flow of 22 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 41 or 15 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted free cash flow were as described above for free cash flow but exclude the 4 million decrease in growth expenditures as at june 30 2021 the rolling four quarter free cash flow and the adjusted net payout ratio were 70 and 56 respectively calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid compared to 62 and 54 for same period ending june 30 2020 the increase in both net payout ratios was primarily due to lower free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow and the effect new common shares issued in the quarter partially offset by the reinstatement of the drip in 2020 refer to northland s md a for the second quarter of 2021 for additional information on sources of liquidity in addition to adjusted free cash flow outlook the offshore wind performance experienced in the first half of the year is trending well below the long term average across the three offshore wind facilities combined with the expectation for reduced turbine availability at nordsee one due to component replacement of the wind turbines leading to an expected loss in revenue of 11 million northland is providing an update on its expectations for full year 2021 financial guidance originally issued in february 2021 for adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share management expects full year results to be at the low end of the guidance range released in february 2021 of 1 1 to 1 2 billion and 1 30 to 1 50 respectively the refined guidance ranges assume offshore wind generation in the second half of 2021 to be close to historical long term averages and also reflects a higher level of development costs being capitalized on projects that have met our capitalization criteria including baltic power new york wind and helios consequently the capitalization of these development costs has resulted in lower expensed growth expenditures this year compared to original expectations for adjusted free cash flow per share management is revising the range to 1 60 to 1 70 formerly 1 80 to 2 00 management believes the company continues to have sufficient liquidity available to address the impact of covid 19 while executing on its growth objectives at june 30 2021 northland had access to 1 445 million of cash and liquidity comprising 838 million of liquidity available under a syndicated revolving facility and 607 million of corporate cash on hand on august 11 2021 522 million of cash was used to fund purchase price consideration for the spanish portfolio second quarter earnings conference call northland

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank disinformation to scare people according to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers there has not been a single case of ade the question is it true vaccines do not stop infection stock made this claim about 18 minutes into the school board meeting when he said no vaccine ever stops infection the sources the answer stock s claim that no vaccine ever stops infection needs context there isn t a single vaccine that is 100 efficacious meaning they stop infection some of the time but not all of the time what we found according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc all covid 19 vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid 19 as seen in clinical trial settings and research shows growing evidence mrna covid 19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions but the vaccines aren t quite 100 effective in a release from pfizer biontech the vaccine was 95 4 effective against covid 19 moderna announced the vaccine was greater than 90 efficacy against cases of covid 19 and more than 95 against severe cases the cdc reported the johnson johnson vaccine was 66 3 effective in clinical trials what s interesting about vaccine efficacy is that it doesn t function in a bubble so vaccine efficacy is highly dependent upon how much infection you have in your community kohli said so when you have high rates of infection in the community the vaccines don t work as well and then when the infection rates are lower the vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection goes up it s also obviously dependent on our behaviors she said the question is the vaccine responsible for the current spike in covid 19 cases at about 19 minutes into the meeting stock said with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of covid 19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin d levels are at their highest the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus centers for disease control and prevention the answer no the vaccine has not caused a recent spike in covid 19 cases what we found dr payal kohli told verify that vitamin d does support immune function but that has nothing to do with the recent rise in cases the rise in cases is because the delta variant is more contagious than the alpha strain the question is ivermectin vitamin d and or zinc an approved treatment for covid 19 stock mentions about 20 minutes into the video that he had successfully treated 15 patients with this antibiotic cocktail the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer no that treatment plan has not been approved by the food drug administration fda or the centers for disease control prevention cdc what we found ivermectin is not approved for use in treating or preventing covid 19 in humans the fda warned ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms and there are topical on the skin formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses according to the fda kohli said zinc and vitamin d can be used to bulk up immune function but there isn t scientific evidence that exists to date that supports the use of those two drugs along with ivermectin to treat covid 19 the question is it true that people who have recovered from covid 19 get no benefit from vaccinations at all stock made the claim at about 21 minutes into the video the sources the answer no a study in the united states shows individuals who had covid 19 and are unvaccinated are more at risk of contracting the virus again what we found dr beau m ances with washington university and a member of the american neurological association told verify the chance for a vaccinated individual to catch covid 19 or variants is significantly reduced at washington university in st louis we are having a large uptick in the number of individuals with covid coming into our hospital and it is primarily those individuals who have not been vaccinated versus those that have been vaccinated ances said that doesn t mean that everybody who gets vaccinated is not going to still not have it he said and we know there have been outbreaks that have been present but the overall morbidity and mortality of those individuals is significantly reduced dr gabriel t bosslet with the indiana university school of medicine told tv station wthr the claim stock made holds no merit all the studies are that people who previously had covid 19 when you measure antibody levels before and after the vaccine it goes up said bosslet so i have no clue where data comes from and frankly that defies all logic what i would tell people is if you hear stuff like this that runs completely counter to everything that the scientists and physicians have been telling you for the last 18 months you need to talk to your doctor and bounce this off of other sources you need to go and talk to other physicians not just people who are going to confirm your prior beliefs he told wthr

that the house will not take up the senate passed bipartisan infrastructure package this month rejecting calls from moderates in her caucus who are seeking a quick vote the announcement in her first call with house democrats since the measure passed the senate on tuesday was largely expected pelosi has insisted for months that the house will not turn to the 1 trillion infrastructure package until the senate passes a much larger 3 5 trillion package chock full of democratic social benefits programs and climate initiatives progressive lawmakers in the house who don t quite trust some of the centrist democrats in the senate want to use the bipartisan infrastructure bill as leverage to ensure the larger 3 5 trillion package clears the upper chamber while pelosi praised both the senate and president biden for reaching a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure she s also been clear that it s insufficient to tackle the challenges facing the country when it comes to economic inequality health care disparities workers rights and the warming planet the hill s mike lillis has more on the fallout of her announcement here senate democrats approve budget resolution teeing up 3 5t spending plan the house got marginally closer to a vote on the larger democratic bill after the senate approved early thursday morning a budget resolution that will carry the eventual spending bill the senate voted 50 49 to adopt the resolution capping off a chaotic hours long debate on the floor during which senators voted on dozens of largely nonbinding amendments that offer a preview of the fight to come on the spending bill what comes next though the budget resolution doesn t get signed into law it s the first step toward bypassing the 60 vote threshold required to pass most legislation in the senate democrats will try to unify their entire 50 member caucus to pass the spending bill on their own as soon as late september the package is expected to include top democratic priorities such as immigration reform combating climate change and universal pre k the hill s jordain carney tells us what s ahead here but the spending plan like pretty much anything big these days depends on what sen joe manchin d w v thinks about it and he s got some concerns given the current state of the economic recovery it is simply irresponsible to continue spending at levels more suited to respond to a great depression or great recession not an economy that is on the verge of overheating manchin said in a statement leading the day consumer prices rise 5 4 percent from last july consumer prices rose 0 5 percent in july and 5 4 percent over the past 12 months according to data released wednesday by the labor department but the monthly pace of price increases fell sharply the consumer price index cpi a closely watched gauge of inflation rose at a much slower monthly pace than june s torrid 0 9 percent increase even so the 12 month increase in the cpi in july was even with june s rise of 5 4 percent the highest annual inflation rate since august 2008 as the reopening of u s economy ramped up demand for a wide range of products what s driving the price increases a sharp jump in travel leisure and hospitality spending dining out and other consumer activities recently made safer by covid 19 vaccines drove another month of price growth largely in line with economists expectations energy prices also rose 1 6 percent in july with gasoline prices rising 0 6 percent after a sharp 2 9 percent spike in june and are now 39 1 percent higher than the same point a year ago gas prices typically increase over the summer because of a sharp increase in travel for leisure but are also rebounding from deep lows reached in 2020 i break it down here toomey launches long shot bid to repeal

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank disinformation to scare people according to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers there has not been a single case of ade the question is it true vaccines do not stop infection stock made this claim about 18 minutes into the school board meeting when he said no vaccine ever stops infection the sources the answer stock s claim that no vaccine ever stops infection needs context there isn t a single vaccine that is 100 efficacious meaning they stop infection some of the time but not all of the time what we found according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc all covid 19 vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid 19 as seen in clinical trial settings and research shows growing evidence mrna covid 19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions but the vaccines aren t quite 100 effective in a release from pfizer biontech the vaccine was 95 4 effective against covid 19 moderna announced the vaccine was greater than 90 efficacy against cases of covid 19 and more than 95 against severe cases the cdc reported the johnson johnson vaccine was 66 3 effective in clinical trials what s interesting about vaccine efficacy is that it doesn t function in a bubble so vaccine efficacy is highly dependent upon how much infection you have in your community kohli said so when you have high rates of infection in the community the vaccines don t work as well and then when the infection rates are lower the vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection goes up it s also obviously dependent on our behaviors she said the question is the vaccine responsible for the current spike in covid 19 cases at about 19 minutes into the meeting stock said with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of covid 19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin d levels are at their highest the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus centers for disease control and prevention the answer no the vaccine has not caused a recent spike in covid 19 cases what we found dr payal kohli told verify that vitamin d does support immune function but that has nothing to do with the recent rise in cases the rise in cases is because the delta variant is more contagious than the alpha strain the question is ivermectin vitamin d and or zinc an approved treatment for covid 19 stock mentions about 20 minutes into the video that he had successfully treated 15 patients with this antibiotic cocktail the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer no that treatment plan has not been approved by the food drug administration fda or the centers for disease control prevention cdc what we found ivermectin is not approved for use in treating or preventing covid 19 in humans the fda warned ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms and there are topical on the skin formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses according to the fda kohli said zinc and vitamin d can be used to bulk up immune function but there isn t scientific evidence that exists to date that supports the use of those two drugs along with ivermectin to treat covid 19 the question is it true that people who have recovered from covid 19 get no benefit from vaccinations at all stock made the claim at about 21 minutes into the video the sources the answer no a study in the united states shows individuals who had covid 19 and are unvaccinated are more at risk of contracting the virus again what we found dr beau m ances with washington university and a member of the american neurological association told verify the chance for a vaccinated individual to catch covid 19 or variants is significantly reduced at washington university in st louis we are having a large uptick in the number of individuals with covid coming into our hospital and it is primarily those individuals who have not been vaccinated versus those that have been vaccinated ances said that doesn t mean that everybody who gets vaccinated is not going to still not have it he said and we know there have been outbreaks that have been present but the overall morbidity and mortality of those individuals is significantly reduced dr gabriel t bosslet with the indiana university school of medicine told tv station wthr the claim stock made holds no merit all the studies are that people who previously had covid 19 when you measure antibody levels before and after the vaccine it goes up said bosslet so i have no clue where data comes from and frankly that defies all logic what i would tell people is if you hear stuff like this that runs completely counter to everything that the scientists and physicians have been telling you for the last 18 months you need to talk to your doctor and bounce this off of other sources you need to go and talk to other physicians not just people

aug 11 2021 globe newswire northland power inc northland or the company tsx npi today reported financial results for three and six months ended june 30 2021 all dollar amounts set out herein are in thousands of canadian dollars unless otherwise stated our second quarter financial performance was impacted by a lower wind resource in the north sea which was trending below the long term average said mike crawley northland s president and chief executive officer however these near term financial impacts do not affect our long term objectives nor our long term performance in the quarter we continued to execute on the key priorities to further enhance our development portfolio and position ourselves to achieve our long term growth and diversification targets we advanced the baltic power offshore wind project in poland which was awarded a 25 year contract for difference offtake agreement further increased our presence in europe with the acquisition of an operating portfolio of onshore wind and solar assets in spain and achieved financial close at two of the new york onshore wind projects as well as our helios solar project in colombia these milestones bolster our development pipeline and enhance our competitive positioning to enable us to participate in the accelerating build out of renewables globally second quarter highlights financial results sales decreased 5 to 408

demand within the renewable energy sector each of northland s operating facilities are deemed to be essential infrastructure and as such operations have continued uninterrupted to date management believes northland continues to have sufficient liquidity available to limit the impact of covid 19 while executing on its growth objectives growth updates to achieve its long term growth objectives northland established regional development offices to secure certain growth opportunities across the globe the activity from these offices has generated an active portfolio of projects at various stages of development and construction the successful achievement of commercial operations of these projects is expected to deliver long term sustainable growth in the company s adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow the following provides updates on the progress being made on northland s active development portfolio spanish renewables acquisition on august 11 2021 northland completed its previously announced acquisition of a spanish operating portfolio of onshore renewable projects the spanish portfolio with a total combined net capacity of 551 mw the transaction included the acquisition of minority interests not included in the initial announced transaction the spanish portfolio includes 33 operating assets comprised of onshore wind 435 mw solar photovoltaic 66 mw and a concentrated solar 50 mw located throughout spain total cash consideration was 348 million 522 million with the assumption of debt totaling 716 million 1 075 million the acquisition was funded using proceeds from northland s common equity offering completed on april 14 2021 the spanish portfolio immediately places northland as a top ten renewable power operator in spain and creates a platform for growth in an attractive market for renewables northland intends to leverage the acquisition of the spanish portfolio to build a platform with asset management development and operations and maintenance capabilities that can competitively pursue onshore renewables acquisition and development opportunities across europe over the next decade green financings executed northland introduced its green financing framework in february of this year to allow the company and its subsidiaries to issue green bonds loans corporate and project level and other financing instruments for eligible green projects the focus of the green financing initiatives is to support climate change mitigation efforts by developing and investing in renewable energy infrastructure assets that increase green energy production northland has successfully executed its first two green financings with its onshore wind projects in new york and helios solar project in colombia the latter being one of the first renewable project financings in the country both projects secured construction financings which have been designated as green loans by their respective lenders northland introduced its green

update northland s ball hill and bluestone onshore wind projects located in broome county and chautauqua county respectively of new york state comprising more than 220 mw of new wind capacity achieved financial close in the second quarter and secured green financing in the form of a non recourse project loan tax equity bridge loan and letters of credit with a consortium of lenders totaling us 381 million approximately c 476 million at a 1 45 interest rate during construction northland will fund investment in the two projects from the equity offering in april 2021 and also expects to secure permanent tax equity investments for the two projects ahead of commercial operations in 2022 construction activities commenced in the second quarter of 2021 for ball hill and bluestone northland s third new york onshore wind project high bridge 100 mw is under active development the total capital cost for the first two projects is expected to be approximately 0 6 billion earlier in the year all three projects were awarded 20 year indexed rec agreements with the new york state energy research and development authority as part of renewable energy solicitations the new york projects form part of northland s broader strategy for onshore renewable development in the united states where the company is targeting a total portfolio of 1 gw and has hired a dedicated local team of people to execute on this strategy the projects will offer social economic and environmental benefits to new york state and once complete are expected to contribute to the state s green energy production helping fulfill new york s clean energy transformation the electricity generated at full capacity is expected to be capable of powering over 125 000 new york homes this is equivalent to avoiding over 450 000 metric tons of carbon co2 emissions annually which represents the greenhouse gas emissions from nearly 100 000 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year helios 16 mw solar project update subsequent to the quarter northland s 16 mw helios solar project in colombia also achieved financial close the project secured a green loan and with construction already underway commercial operations is expected in the first quarter of 2022 helios represents northland s first development project in colombia which capitalizes on ebsa s grandfathered rights allowing it to expand into the energy generation market in colombia to service the power needs of non regulated municipal commercial and industrial c i customers helios has secured a 12 year power purchase agreement with ebsa which in turn will secure offtake agreements with non regulated customers the total capital cost for helios is expected to be under 20 million subsequent to the quarter northland s 16 mw helios solar

relating to the physical construction of the solar facility are complete however certain activities relating to the energization of the project continue to be delayed in order to achieve commercial operations the facility requires energization followed by testing which is conducted by cenace independent system operator and cfe federal electricity commission due to ongoing administrative delays resulting from the covid 19 pandemic and other issues that have resulted in a backlog of approvals for renewable projects in mexico the energization and testing have been delayed and northland does not anticipate these activities will be complete prior to the end of 2021 northland continues to work with mexican authorities and other private power producers experiencing similar issues to achieve energization of the la lucha project while timelines remain uncertain northland expects commercial operations at la lucha to commence in early 2022 efforts to secure commercial offtake and project financing are expected to be finalized only after commercial operations as a result of the aforementioned delays total capital costs for the project are expected to be around 200 million up from 190

close expected in 2022 nordsee 2 and nordsee 3 offshore wind projects in 2014 when northland acquired its interest in nordsee one it also acquired an 85 interest in two early stage offshore wind development projects nordsee two n2 and nordsee three n3 as part of the agreement to relinquish these sites to the german government the relevant project companies both subsidiaries of northland were allocated step in rights for upcoming offshore wind site auctions northland is preparing to exercise these step in rights with the first auction for n2 expected later this year these two potential offshore wind projects are expected to have a combined grid capacity of approximately 850 mw second quarter results summary the decrease in the second quarter financial performance relative to the prior year primarily resulted from lower production in the offshore wind segment and a planned outage at one of northland s larger efficient natural gas facilities offshore wind facilities are subject to seasonality and accordingly tend to produce more electricity during winter due to denser air and higher winds compared to summer the effect of which is reflected in the respective fiscal quarter s results while the second quarter is typically a weaker quarter for offshore wind the results for this quarter across all three facilities was below those in the second quarter in 2020 and well below the long term average resulting in lower adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow in addition the second quarter results were also affected by the scheduled outage at north battleford for approximately five weeks to perform scheduled major maintenance work such work is typically performed every eight years to ensure ongoing optimal performance and safety of a facility and was reflected in 2021 financial guidance offshore wind facilities a key performance indicator for the offshore wind facilities is historical long term average lta where available of the power production of each offshore wind facility the following table summarizes actual electricity production and the lta three months ended june 30 six months ended june 30 2021 1 2020 1 lta 2 2021 1 2020 1

since the commencement of commercial operation of the respective facility 2017 for gemini and nordsee one and 2020 for deutsche bucht and excludes unpaid curtailments electricity production was 4 or 28 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to an unusually low wind resource at all three offshore facilities partially offset by relatively higher production at the german facilities due to the improved grid availability and fewer periods of negative prices compared to 2020 sales of 205 million decreased 5 or 10 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with lower production at gemini and nordsee one partially offset by fewer periods of uncompensated outages and of negative prices in germany as shown below operating income and adjusted ebitda of 312 million and 355 million respectively decreased 23 or 95 million and 17 or 75 million primarily due to low wind resource in the north sea compared to the same quarter last

free cash flow lost revenue in 2020 was a result of the apx of 28 mwh below the sde floor of 44 mwh for additional details on the sde floor refer to disclosures within md a gemini s revenue arrangement includes a mechanism that tops up the average dutch wholesale market price for the year the apx to a fixed contractual rate per megawatt hour mwh though subject to a floor price sde floor of approximately 44 mwh the sde floor exposes gemini to some market price risk if the apx falls below the sde floor the apx averaged below the sde floor for four of the facility s five years of operation gemini apx hedges as previously reported in the first quarter a covid 19 induced 3 year hedging program implemented in the second quarter of 2020 to mitigate against potential revenue losses from further sustained apx price erosion was cancelled in the second quarter of 2021 following significant recovery of the apx price as economic activity rebounded with the earlier than anticipated success of covid 19 vaccines among other factors as a result in may 2021 northland entered into offsetting financial derivatives to limit the potential lost revenue for 2021 to 2023 under the original financial derivatives while limiting revenue losses in the future the offsetting derivatives crystallized financial losses for northland amounting to 25 million 19 million and 9 million for the second half of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively for the six months ended june 30 2021 gemini recognized 12 million of financial losses subsequent to second quarter northland purchased financial put contracts for the majority of expected production in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for 2022 with a strike price close to the sde floor effectively maximizing apx revenue for the hedged production volume in the period management intends to enter into further put contracts as appropriate for future years in accordance with northland s risk management policy refer to northland s 2021 second quarter md a for additional information nordsee one rotor shaft bearing replacement as disclosed in the first quarter northland identified a component issue on a number of wind turbines at the nordsee one facility affecting the main rotor shaft bearing upon further assessment in the second quarter management concluded the component issue could affect all of the wind turbines leading to premature failure and commenced a replacement campaign of the rotor shaft assemblies rsa the replacement rsa are a tested design expected to last the remaining life of the facility in addition the replacement parts will include warranty coverage from the vendor to date in 2021 nordsee one has replaced four rsa and expects to replace another four this year in 2022 and 2023 management expects to replace all remaining rsa as parts become available and weather conditions allow in some cases nordsee one may need to curtail the performance of some turbines in order to extend their life which would affect overall production turbine availability and may lead to lost revenues in 2022 and 2023 this issue is not expected at northland s other offshore wind facilities which utilize different turbines management will expedite the campaign in 2021 in order to minimize downtime of the wind turbines however it is estimated that nordsee one will incur lost revenue due to turbine curtailments and shutdowns of approximately 8 million 11 million at northland s share in 2021 including 4 million in the first half of the year the anticipated total cost for the 2021 campaign to replace eight bearings is approximately 13 million 16 million at northland s share and the estimated total cost to replace all 54 bearings is 65 million 83 million at northland s share which is expected to be substantially covered by the warranty bond settlement received in 2020 relating to outstanding warranty obligations of nordsee one s turbine manufacturer upon its insolvency northland continues to assess the potential impacts for 2022 and 2023 efficient natural gas facilities electricity production decreased 28 or 204 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to a planned major maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2021 at north battleford and timing of the annual shutdown at another facility sales for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 10 or 9 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower production as described above partially offset by rate escalations at multiple facilities adjusted ebitda of 51 million decreased 15 or 9 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to the same factors affecting sales onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 11 or 38 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 due to overall lower solar and wind resources sales of 58 million were 4 or 3 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to the variances in electricity production adjusted ebitda of 39 million was also lower than the same quarter of 2020 utilities sales of 53 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 5 or 3 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to last year adjusted ebitda of 21 million decreased 8 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 mainly due to unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to last year statement of income loss g a costs of 15 million were largely in line with the same quarter of 2020 development costs of 14 million decreased 28 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to effects of the commencement of capitalization at hai long in 2020 combined with the timing of development activities at other projects net finance costs of 76 million decreased 14 or 12 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of scheduled repayments on facility level loans and repayment of borrowings on the corporate revolving facility as a result of the equity offering in april 2021 fair value loss on derivative contracts was 25 million compared to a 30 million gain in the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to losses realized on settlement of apx hedges and net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to the apx interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 46 million is primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rate other income was 35 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 due to proceeds received from the sale of turbines in the second quarter of 2020 originally intended for use with mono bucket foundations at deutsche bucht as well as accrued insurance proceeds in the prior year period related to construction of deutsche bucht net loss of 6 million decreased 109 or 81 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the factors described above as well as accelerated amortization expense on iroquois falls property plant and equipment due to the expiry of its ppa in december 2021 partially offset by 25 million lower tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 203 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 decreased 10 or 24 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted ebitda include 17 million decrease in operating results at gemini primarily due to the lower wind resource and apx hedge losses realized and 12 million decrease in operating results from the efficient natural gas and onshore facilities largely due to the planned major outage at north battleford and a lower wind and solar resource the factor partially offsetting these decreases in adjusted ebitda was a 4 million increase in operating results from deutsche bucht largely due to increased production commensurate with better grid availability compared to last year free cash flow free cash flow of 6 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 68 or 12 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing free cash flow include 14 million decrease in overall earnings primarily due to lower wind resource at the offshore wind facilities and a planned maintenance outage at north battleford and 4 million increase in non expansionary capital expenditures primarily at north battleford and nordsee one the factor partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 6 million decrease in net financing costs primarily as a result of scheduled repayments on facility level loans and repayment of borrowings on the corporate revolving facility in april 2021 adjusted free cash flow of 22 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 41 or 15 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted free cash flow were as described above for free cash flow but exclude the 4 million decrease in growth expenditures as at june 30 2021 the rolling four quarter free cash flow and the adjusted net payout ratio were 70 and 56 respectively calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid compared to 62 and 54 for same period ending june 30 2020 the increase in both net payout ratios was primarily due to lower free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow and the effect new common shares issued in the quarter partially offset by the reinstatement of the drip in 2020 refer to northland s md a for the second quarter of 2021 for additional information on sources of liquidity in addition to adjusted free cash flow outlook the offshore wind performance experienced in the first half of the year is trending well below the long term average across the three offshore wind facilities combined with the expectation for reduced turbine availability at nordsee one due to component replacement of the wind turbines leading to an expected loss in revenue of 11 million northland is providing an update on its expectations for full year 2021 financial guidance originally issued in february 2021 for adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share management expects full year results to be at the low end of the guidance range released in february 2021 of 1 1 to 1 2 billion and 1 30 to 1 50 respectively the refined guidance ranges assume offshore wind generation in the second half of 2021 to be close to historical long term averages and also reflects a higher level of development costs being capitalized on projects that have met our capitalization criteria including baltic power new york wind and helios consequently the capitalization of these development costs has resulted in lower expensed growth expenditures this year compared to original expectations for adjusted free cash flow per share management is revising the range to 1 60 to 1 70 formerly 1 80 to 2 00 management believes the company continues to have sufficient liquidity available to address the impact of covid 19 while executing on its growth

execute on its commercial and operational strategies as evidenced by the strong second quarter financial results and regulatory successes the totality of the year to date accomplishments across business segments has the company well positioned to sustain quarter over quarter revenue growth with improving margins for the foreseeable future said adam grossman president and chief executive officer of adma less than two years into adma s commercial launch of its intravenous immune globulin ivig product portfolio the company generated record quarterly revenues of 17 8 million representing an increase of 129 year over year this top line growth is particularly impressive in light of the pandemic related headwinds that continue to persist throughout the product launch period which impacted industry supply chains and limited engagement with physicians and providers additionally these results do not reflect the substantial benefits anticipated from the recently approved bivigam expanded production scale increasing our facility s total annual peak production capacity from 400 000 liters to 600 000 liters as well as the expected approval of the vanrx sa25 workcell aseptic fill

uninterrupted raw material plasma supply the enhanced yield anticipated from the recent implementation of haemonetics persona technology the extension of the company s primary third party plasma supply contract to the end of 2022 and the continued expansion of the biocenters plasma collection network establishes a solid foundation for adma to ensure continuity of product supply into an increasingly supply constrained immune globulin market with the current industry wide pressures on plasma collection operations adma s strategic emphasis on building an internal collection network and solidifying third party supplemental supply should yield significant returns in the periods ahead and largely insulate the company from supply and pricing fluctuations over the past 4 years adma has also been diligently building a vertically integrated commercial biologics manufacturing organization since acquiring its manufacturing facility and assets in june 2017 and is now successfully emerging from its multi year investment regulatory and remediation phase the majority of substantive investments are now in the rearview the wholly owned manufacturing plant is now fully remediated and collectively positions the company to meet or exceed all longer term financial targets these accomplishments could not have been realized without the dedication and focus of adma s staff

attractive as an asset class and could potentially outperform treasuries as the summer comes to an end depending on changing market technicals buy side analysts said this week in the near term summer technicals have generated very visible net negative supply conditions according to jeff lipton managing director and head of municipal credit and market strategy and municipal capital markets at oppenheimer co while municipals continued to show positive performance in july they underperformed u s treasuries with the year to date performance gap through july revealing further tightening from the prior month lipton said in a weekly report on tuesday if we see enduring treasury market softness over the coming weeks we believe that summer municipal technicals have the potential to push munis to outperform treasuries over the near term lipton wrote even with the elevation to higher yields municipals remain historically rich to treasuries he added municipal to ust ratios sat at 66 in 10 years and 74 in 30 according to refinitiv mmd while ice data services had the 10 year at 67 and the 30 at 73 if the outlook for the future tax bite stays muted for a while longer and we continue to receive heavier doses of hawkish fed speak and higher inflation data points yields may experience continued upward pressure he added however lipton said that scenario would likely be distilled given the summer technicals that are generating visible net negative supply conditions we believe that munis still have the ability to generate positive performance although admittedly such performance could be compromised should technicals become much less constructive and prospects for higher taxes fade considerably even from currently elevated levels of doubt he said while summer technicals should support muni performance just how munis perform relative to u s treasuries will be largely determined by the treasury market s response to fed speak and future inflationary data he said even without a rise in federal tax rates municipals should continue to offer very desirable credit quality and diversification attributes which are expected to further entice foreign investment into the asset class according to lipton against this backdrop we do not foresee a material loosening up in credit spreads or even a substantive reversal in the currently rich muni valuations that have characterized the market for some time now he said adding that when technicals drivers alter course he will be on the lookout for advantageous investment opportunities ahead in a weekly report bill

the consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0 5 in july after rising an unrevised 0 9 in june while the core rate also jumped 0 3 after a unrevised 0 9 gain in june economists polled by ifr markets had estimated cpi to rise 0 5 and the core to climb 0 4 on a year over year basis the cpi was up 5 4 its biggest 12 month increase since a 5 4 rise in august 2008 the core grew 4 3 on a year over year basis economists anticipated an annual increase of 5 3 in cpi and 4 3 in core for the year the cpi report adds credence to the argument that while inflation is high it likely is at or near its peak said scott ruesterholz portfolio manager at insight investment in particular we are seeing signs that volatile categories that have driven much of the recent surge in prices like rental cars and used cars are moderating in keeping with high frequency data like used car auctions which point to normalizing prices core inflation is starting to show signs of cooling from the pandemic induced surge during the spring months as some of that is due to the emergence of the delta variant which could dampen inflation in august said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton it is notable that the delta variant is disrupting both supply and demand which will leave the federal reserve uneasy as we move into the turn of the year the fed is still expected to taper its asset purchases timing on

terminations and restructuring of acquired companies as well as certain legal fees or provisions related to acquired companies from time to time it may also include adjustments in the fair value of contingent consideration and other such non recurring costs related to restructuring financing and acquisitions the company uses adjusted ebitda to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its operating performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs financial measures the company believes that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of issuers management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons

gaap financial measures to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of us gaap we use adjusted ebitda which is a non u s gaap financial measure to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance we further believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business we use certain financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors we utilize adjusted ebitda as the primary measure of our performance we calculate adjusted ebitda as net loss adjusted to exclude i interest income and other income net ii tax benefit and expense iii depreciation and amortization iv stock based compensation expense v public offering expenses vi acquisition related income and expenses vii litigation expenses related to the defense of our patents in the patent infringement claim filed by teladoc and viii other items affecting our results that we do not view as representative of our ongoing operations including direct and incremental expenses associated with the covid 19 pandemic we believe adjusted ebitda is a commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors however our use of the term adjusted ebitda may vary from that of others in our industry adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net loss before taxes net loss loss per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with u s gaap as measures of performance adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of the limitations of adjusted ebitda include i adjusted ebitda does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future and ii although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the underlying assets may need to be replaced and adjusted ebitda does not reflect these capital expenditures our ipo and acquisition related expenses including legal accounting and other professional expenses reflect cash expenditures and we expect such expenditures for acquisitions to recur from time to time our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner as we calculate the measure limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to loss before benefit from income taxes net loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with u s gaap when evaluating our performance you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including our net loss and other gaap results other than with respect to gaap revenue the company only provides guidance on a non gaap basis the company does not provide a reconciliation of forward looking adjusted ebitda non gaap to gaap net income loss due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation because other deductions such as covid expenses and acquisition related expenses used to calculate projected net income loss vary dramatically based on actual events the company is not able to forecast on a gaap basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a gaap calculation of projected net income loss at this time the amount of these deductions may be material and therefore could result in projected gaap net income loss being materially less than projected adjusted ebitda non gaap the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda from the most comparable gaap measure net

cyber security protecting firms and citizens is both necessary and controversial barely a day passes without grim tales of digital extortion poly network which links digital ledgers across the globe says hackers looted some 432million of cryptocurrency israel s nso group provided cyber security software to autocratic clients who promptly used it to snoop on opponents and world leaders cyber spree poly network which links digital ledgers across the globe has just revealed that hackers looted some 432bn of cryptocurrency the boom in cyber abuse explains why london quoted prague based avast has fallen into the hands of arizona competitor norton for up to 6 2billion as one of the few cyber firms quoted in london avast has attracted a big institutional following unlike britain s undervalued aerospace and defence companies meggitt and ultra the cyber firm sells at a premium to its counterparts on nasdaq when cyber software group darktrace did an initial public offering this year there was scepticism because it was backed by mike lynch currently fighting extradition to the us over fraudulent accounting allegations investors who backed darktrace have been rewarded with the shares spurting from 330p to 617p in latest trading placing a market value of 4 3billion on the enterprise at its core avast is a czech rather than a uk enterprise so it is hard to criticise the merger with norton on security grounds uk funds which enthusiastically embraced avast might have a beef there is almost no premium involved in the transaction contrast this with the bidding war for aerospace group meggitt where the premium is above 70 per cent the industrial case for the deal is stronger than the financial justification together the two companies will have 500m plus users focused on cyber safety microsoft is a big customer for avast software but the silicon valley giants increasingly are building their own cyber defences into products as time marches on they are as likely to be competitors rather than customers so scale provided by a norton avast combination would be useful the deal is described as a merger but in effect it is a takeover with avast shareholders being offered norton cash and paper avast chief executive ondrej vlcek will be president working alongside his opposite number vincent pilette at norton such doubling up of roles rarely works for long in an age when big battalion investors have become used to ftse premiums the weak takeout price could well trigger a revolt raw deal nigel rudd is among the great city dealmakers in his early years at williams holdings it was all about buying companies at the best price latterly he has earned the sobriquet sir sell off for his skill in disposing of solid british enterprises such as pilkington boots and invensys at fancy prices it looked as if he was onto a sure fire winner when he agreed to take the american shilling and sell meggitt to parker hannifin the shares 70 per cent premium appeared hard to better and parker which already has similar sized operations in britain is a respected rolls royce supplier broader implications of loss of uk intellectual property skills and r d the impact on national security and the potential for vanishing corporation tax are skimmed over rudd and the other independent directors at meggitt have been too clever for their own good they jumped in parker s direction without even considering whether there might be a better deal along comes transdigm which proclaims a private equity business model to interfere offering a 900p a share an extra pound meggitt s board says the parker offer remains an attractive proposition the reality is that a different chairman to rudd might have kept parker at a distance and gone it alone now the board risks being hoist on its own fiduciary petard all s wells mike wells has done a good job in breaking up the prudential but it is not done just yet the latest earnings are more than wiped out by a chunky 5 4billion goodwill writedown at us offshoot jackson life which is being spun out the pru also plans a capital raising of up to 2 2billion as it continues its exciting asian expansion canadian born he may be but chief executive wells appreciates the virtue of a trusted british brand at a time of geopolitical uncertainty in hong kong and china he also recognises the value of a city hq and quote
on august 6 2021 the us securities and exchange commission sec approved nasdaq s board diversity rule 1 nasdaq originally proposed its rule in december 2020 and subsequently amended the proposal to reflect feedback submitted by commenters nasdaq board diversity standards the new rules require nasdaq listed companies to have or to explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors including 1 at least one director who self identifies as female regardless of gender designation at birth and 2 at least one director who self identifies as either an underrepresented minority as defined in the nasdaq rule or as lgbtq foreign issuers including foreign private issuers and smaller reporting companies may satisfy the board composition requirement by having two directors who self identify as female companies with five or fewer directors may satisfy the diversity objective by having one diverse director nasdaq s board diversity representation provisions are set forth in new clause f of rule 5605 of nasdaq s corporate governance requirements nasdaq board diversity disclosure requirements the new rules also require nasdaq listed companies to annually disclose directors self identified gender race and ethnicity i e african american or black alaskan native or native american asian hispanic or latinx native hawaiian or pacific islander white or two or more races or ethnicities and lgbtq status in a standardized board diversity matrix 2 a foreign issuer may elect to use an alternative board diversity matrix format which among other things requires disclosing the number of directors who self identify as underrepresented individuals in the foreign issuer s home country jurisdiction as well as indicating whether diversity disclosure is prohibited under its home country law nasdaq s board diversity disclosure provisions are set forth in new rule 5606 of nasdaq s corporate governance requirements nasdaq board recruiting services as part of its order the sec also approved the provision by nasdaq of a board diversity recruiting service through nasdaq s partnership with equilar the service will be available to certain nasdaq listed companies with one year of complimentary access for two users per company this service is intended to provide access to a network of board ready diverse candidates for companies to identify and evaluate transition and phase in periods the timeframe for compliance with nasdaq s board diversity rule depends on the company s listing tier and board size nasdaq global select market and nasdaq global market companies must have or explain why they do not have one diverse director by august 7 2023 and two diverse directors by august 6 2025 nasdaq capital market companies must have or explain why they do not have one diverse director by august 7 2023 and two diverse directors by august 6 2026 companies with boards of five or less directors regardless of listing tier must have or explain why they do not have one diverse director by august 7 2023 in each of these cases the deadline would be extended to the date if later that the company files its proxy or information statement or if the company does not file a proxy its form 10 k or 20 f for the company s annual shareholder meeting in the applicable year the nasdaq rule provides a one year grace period for a listed company that no longer meets the diversity objectives as a result of a vacancy on the board of directors and provides companies that list on nasdaq after the phase in period additional time to add diverse directors cure period if a nasdaq listed company does not comply with the rule s diversity objectives and does not provide the explanatory disclosure nasdaq s listing qualifications department would promptly notify the company that it has until the later of its next annual shareholders meeting or 180 days from the event that caused the deficiency to cure the deficiency if a company fails to disclose the required board diversity metrics nasdaq would notify the company that it is not in compliance with a listing requirement and that the company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan sufficient to satisfy nasdaq staff that the company has adopted processes and procedures designed to identify and disclose such information in the future if the company does not comply within the applicable cure period the listing qualifications department would issue a staff delisting determination letter and the company could appeal the determination to the hearings panel through the process set forth in nasdaq rules exemptions listed spacs are not required to have or disclose that they do not have any minimum number of diverse directors until their business combination after which they must meet or explain why they do not meet the applicable diversity objectives by the later of two years from the date of listing or the date the company files its proxy statement or its information statement or if the company does not file a proxy its form 10 k or 20 f for the company s second annual meeting of shareholders subsequent to the company s listing there are also exemptions applicable to certain types of issuers as further specified in nasdaq s rules including asset backed issuers cooperatives limited partnerships management investment companies and issuers of non voting preferred securities debt securities and derivative securities that do not have equity securities listed on nasdaq sec approval the sec s approval of nasdaq s board diversity proposal was not unanimous while chair gensler and commissioners lee and crenshaw approved the proposal in its entirety commissioner peirce voted against it commissioner peirce released a statement explaining that while she supports the goal of board diversity she believes the nasdaq proposal was inconsistent with and outside the scope of the securities exchange act of 1934 as well as contrary to fundamental constitutional principles commissioner roisman supported only the portion of nasdaq s proposal offering listed companies recruiting services to potentially identify new candidates outside these companies go to networks however he did not support the portion of the sec s order that approved nasdaq s proposed disclosure requirements for listed companies commissioner roisman stated that he does not believe the sec fulfilled its obligation to find that the proposal which has delisting implications for companies meets the legal standards that the sec is required to apply while evaluating rules proposed by self regulatory organizations practical considerations disclosures under the nasdaq board diversity rule are based on voluntary self identification of characteristics therefore nasdaq companies should consider adding diversity questions based on the nasdaq diversity categories to their annual director and officer questionnaires or otherwise developing a mechanism for gathering that information which should include the director s or nominee s consent to disclosure even companies that are not listed on nasdaq should pay attention to nasdaq s new board diversity policy because additional board diversity initiatives may be forthcoming while the nasdaq rule is the most recent board diversity development there are already other drivers of board diversity such as california s statutory mandates for companies with principal executive offices in the state voting policies established by proxy advisory firms voting policies and engagement priorities of large institutional investors and public perception at least one major underwriter has established minimum board diversity requirements for the clients it assists with initial public offerings the sec s spring 2021 regulatory agenda targets the fall of 2021 for proposed rule amendments to enhance company disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees and a number of states are considering board diversity legislation taken together all of these actions may prompt additional board diversity requirements for a growing number of companies with the nasdaq rule being the latest catalyst although nasdaq has not styled its rule as a mandate requiring a specified number of diverse directors as a listing condition allowing companies instead to explain why they do not have the targeted level of board diversity it is likely that many nasdaq listed companies would find such explanatory disclosures unpalatable in the current environment the new rule will likely prompt nasdaq listed companies to strengthen their recruitment of diverse board candidates companies have the flexibility to meet the nasdaq diversity objectives in the manner they feel is appropriate which might include increasing board size or encouraging shorter tenure to create more board vacancies nasdaq companies that do not yet meet the diversity standards specified by the new rule should consider availing themselves of the free board recruiting services offered by nasdaq companies subject to the nasdaq board diversity rule including foreign issuers should also consider whether there are any privacy considerations that need to be addressed a reporting requirement pursuant to item 3 01 of form 8 k is triggered if a company receives a notice from the securities exchange that maintains the principal listing for any class of its common equity that the company does not satisfy a rule or standard for continued listing on the exchange accordingly failure to comply with the nasdaq diversity rule could give rise to an sec filing obligation the nasdaq rule allows a company to make the required disclosures either 1 in its proxy statement or its information statement or if the company does not file a proxy its form 10 k or 20 f or 2 on the company s website if the company chooses website disclosure it must publish this disclosure concurrently with such sec filing and submit the url link through the nasdaq listing center within one business day after such posting in addition to nasdaq board diversity disclosure requirements companies should remember that changes to their nominating committee s process for identifying and evaluating nominees for director may require revised disclosure in a form 10 k or proxy statement in response to item 407 c vi of regulation s k additionally according to sec staff compliance and disclosure interpretations 116 11 and 133 13 if a board or nominating committee has considered self identified diversity characteristics such as the race gender ethnicity religion nationality disability sexual orientation or cultural background of an individual in determining whether to recommend a person for board membership and the individual has consented to the company s disclosure of those characteristics the sec staff expects the company s proxy statement will include but not necessarily be limited to identification of those characteristics and how they were considered similarly in such a circumstance the staff expects the proxy statement s description of company diversity policies to discuss how the company considers the self identified diversity attributes of nominees as well as any other qualifications its diversity policy takes into account such as diverse work experiences military service or socio economic or demographic characteristics for more information see our legal update disclosure of board self identified diversity characteristics dated february 11 2019 3 in working through the details of nasdaq s board diversity rule companies may find it useful to consult the series of frequently asked questions that nasdaq has made available on its listing center 4 footnotes 1 see 2 companies are required to use the matrix format available at or a substantially similar format nasdaq provides examples of formats that it accepts as substantially similar as well as examples that it finds unacceptable as substantially different at 3 available at 4

claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank disinformation to scare people according to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers there has not been a single case of ade the question is it true vaccines do not stop infection stock made this claim about 18 minutes into the school board meeting when he said no vaccine ever stops infection the sources the answer stock s claim that no vaccine ever stops infection needs context there isn t a single vaccine that is 100 efficacious meaning they stop infection some of the time but not all of the time what we found according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc all covid 19 vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid 19 as seen in clinical trial settings and research shows growing evidence mrna covid 19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions but the vaccines aren t quite 100 effective in a release from pfizer biontech the vaccine was 95 4 effective against covid 19 moderna announced the vaccine was greater than 90 efficacy against cases of covid 19 and more than 95 against severe cases the cdc reported the johnson johnson vaccine was 66 3 effective in clinical trials what s interesting about vaccine efficacy is that it doesn t function in a bubble so vaccine efficacy is highly dependent upon how much infection you have in your community kohli said so when you have high rates of infection in the community the vaccines don t work as well and then when the infection rates are lower the vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection goes up it s also obviously dependent on our behaviors she said the question is the vaccine responsible for the current spike in covid 19 cases at about 19 minutes into the meeting stock said with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of covid 19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin d levels are at their highest the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus centers for disease control and prevention the answer no the vaccine has not caused a recent spike in covid 19 cases what we found dr payal kohli told verify that vitamin d does support immune function but that has nothing to do with the recent rise in cases the rise in cases is because the delta variant is more contagious than the alpha strain the question is ivermectin vitamin d and or zinc an approved treatment for covid 19 stock mentions about 20 minutes into the video that he had successfully treated 15 patients with this antibiotic cocktail the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer no that treatment plan has not been approved by the food drug administration fda or the centers for disease control prevention cdc what we found ivermectin is not approved for use in treating or preventing covid 19 in humans the fda warned ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms and there are topical on the skin formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses according to the fda kohli said zinc and vitamin d can be used to bulk up immune function but there isn t scientific evidence that exists to date that supports the use of those two drugs along with ivermectin to treat covid 19 the question is it true that people who have recovered from covid 19 get no benefit from vaccinations at all stock made the claim at about 21 minutes into the video the sources the answer no a study in the united states shows individuals who had covid 19 and are unvaccinated are more at risk of contracting the virus again what we found dr beau m ances with washington university and a member of the american neurological association told verify the chance for a vaccinated individual to catch covid 19 or variants is significantly reduced at washington university in st louis we are having a large uptick in the number of individuals with covid coming into our hospital and it is primarily those individuals who have not been vaccinated versus those that have been vaccinated ances said that doesn t mean that everybody who gets vaccinated is not going to still not have it he said and we know there have been outbreaks that have been present but the overall morbidity and mortality of those individuals is significantly reduced dr gabriel t bosslet with the indiana university school of medicine told tv station wthr the claim stock made holds no merit all the studies are that people who previously had covid 19 when you measure antibody levels before and after the vaccine it goes up said bosslet so i have no clue where data comes from and frankly that defies all logic what i would tell people is if you hear stuff like this that runs completely counter to everything that the scientists and physicians have been telling you for the last 18 months you need to talk to your doctor and bounce this off of other sources you need to go and talk to other physicians not just people who are going to confirm your prior beliefs he told wthr

april 16 2021 we completed the acquisition of doctor s choice holdings llc doctor s choice a home health business with sixteen branches throughout the state of florida expanding our presence in the adult home health business and creating further density for us in the state of florida our pipeline continues to be active with numerous hhh and pds opportunities full year 2021 guidance we are reaffirming our expectation that revenue is anticipated to be at least 1 745 million we are not providing guidance on net income at this time due to the volatility of certain required inputs that are not available without unreasonable efforts including future fair value adjustments associated with our interest rate swaps we are reaffirming our expectation that adjusted ebitda is anticipated to be at least 185 million non gaap financial measures in addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also evaluate our financial performance using ebitda adjusted ebitda field contribution field contribution margin adjusted corporate expense adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations these non gaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to net income or loss revenue operating income or loss cash flows from operating activities total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap such as net income loss rather we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplemental measures of our performance we define ebitda as net income loss before interest expense net income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by us to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations including impairments of goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets non cash share based compensation sponsor fees loss on extinguishment of debt fees related to debt modifications the effect of interest rate derivatives acquisition related and integration costs legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters the discontinuation of our aba therapy services non acquisition related legal settlements and other system transition costs professional fees and other costs as non gaap financial measures our computations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable we believe our computations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance in determining which adjustments are made to arrive at ebitda and adjusted ebitda we consider both 1 certain non recurring infrequent non cash or unusual items which can vary significantly from year to year as well as 2 certain other items that may be recurring frequent or settled in cash but which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance and make business decisions we incurred substantial acquisition related costs and integration costs in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 the underlying acquisition activities took place over a defined timeframe had distinct project timelines and were incremental to activities and costs that arose in the ordinary course of our business therefore we believe it is important to exclude these costs from our adjusted ebitda because it provides us a normalized view of our core ongoing operations after integrating our acquired companies which we believe is an important measure in assessing our performance field contribution and field contribution margin field contribution and field contribution margin are non gaap financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap such as operating income loss rather we present field contribution and field contribution margin as supplemental measures of our performance we define field contribution as operating income loss prior to corporate expenses and other non field related costs including depreciation and amortization acquisition related costs and other operating expenses field contribution margin is field contribution as a percentage of revenue as non gaap financial measures our computations of field contribution and field contribution margin may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of these measures impracticable we believe field contribution and field contribution margin are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance and evaluating trends in our branch and regional results which can vary from year to year we use field contribution and field contribution margin to make business decisions and assess the operating performance and results delivered by our core field operations prior to corporate and other costs not directly related to our field operations these metrics are also important because they guide us in determining whether our branch and regional administrative expenses are appropriately sized to support our caregivers and direct patient care operations additionally field contribution and field contribution margin determine how effective we are in managing our field supervisory and administrative costs associated with supporting our provision of services and sale of products adjusted corporate expenses adjusted corporate expenses is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap such as corporate expenses rather we present adjusted corporate expenses as a supplemental measure of our performance we define adjusted corporate expenses as corporate expenses adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by us to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations including non cash share based compensation sponsor fees acquisition related and integration costs legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters covid related costs net of reimbursement and other system transition costs professional fees and other costs as non gaap financial measures our computations of adjusted corporate expenses may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable we believe adjusted corporate expenses is helpful in highlighting trends in our corporate support function which can vary from year to year we use adjusted corporate expenses to make business decisions in determining whether or not our corporate expenses is appropriately sized to support our caregivers and direct patient care operations excluding the aforementioned items from corporate expenses that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by us to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations allows us to evaluate adjusted corporate expenses in relation to the support necessary for our caregivers and direct patient care operations adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share adjusted net income represents net income as adjusted for the impact of gaap income tax goodwill intangible and other long lived asset impairment charges non cash share based compensation expense sponsor fees loss on extinguishment of debt interest rate derivatives acquisition related costs integration costs legal costs covid related costs net of reimbursement aba exited operations other system transition costs professional fees and certain other miscellaneous items on a pre tax basis adjusted net income includes a provision for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory tax rate the combined statutory tax rate is our estimate of our long term tax rate the most comparable gaap measure is net income adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income on a per diluted share basis using the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period the most comparable gaap measure is net income per share diluted adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important to us because they allow us to assess financial results exclusive of the items mentioned above that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors conference call aveanna will host a conference call on thursday august 12 2021 at 10 00 a m eastern time to discuss our second quarter results the

wilmington employers taking part in meetings of the new clinton county workforce roundtable which is looking at workforce challenges and gaps locally are willing to consider being involved in pilot projects a local official said monday clinton county port authority executive director daniel g evers and clinton county economic development director jennifer klus ekey met with the county commissioners for a monthly update on economic development matters evers said as the local business community and others look for long term solutions they can simultaneously look at short term opportunities such as a pilot program for transportation or child care two of the bigger issues it may be that we can take active steps in the short term that may very well be able to unfold into long term solutions rather than say well we re going to wait and see if the grant comes along said evers after the meeting evers elaborated on the exploration of potential pilot projects focused around transportation and child care while very conceptual at this point the premise is that the task force would work with the local business community to identify employers that might be interested in participating in a pilot program one element of such programs could be employers or their employees indicating a willingness in advance of a program being initiated to participate in such a program that is reserving spots on a transit route or in a child care facility and so forth stated evers in an email this is still very conceptual and only one of several options the task force is likely to explore with area employers he said regarding transportation evers said there s been a lot of discussion about expanding wilmington s existing transit service he said that the expansion would need to occur in two respects the geographic area served and the time available this business s second shift is not the same as this one over here and third shift starts at a different time he noted in a general observation klus ekey said one employer is thinking about buying a company vehicle to pick people up because a locale s housing stock can be an obstacle to recruiting or attracting workers clinton county commissioner kerry r steed asked whether anyone knew of employers that have developed housing exclusively for their workforce and near their facility commissioner mike mccarty said there is an employer in fayette county that has done something along those lines klus ekey said she has seen employers come up with housing incentives to attract a workforce evers said there is probably a model that s less out of pocket than for an employer to develop housing on its own that could include getting two or three employers bringing in a developer and one employer taking 20 units and another 15 and so on and the developer would have that many units pre leased and might start eyeing a project of additional units the clinton county workforce roundtable initiative was launched in late june during the update to commissioners klus ekey reported there are a couple of developers considering projects in the area one of whom is a developer who does both commercial and residential projects they are looking at some opportunities both in the residential market and in the commercial market that is very preliminary i do expect at least one project to come out of those efforts she said local economic development officials are still working with a couple of employer prospects that the officials have spoken about in the past with commissioners said klus ekey one of them seems to be gaining some traction rapidly and will have an aggressive timeline once they make a decision klus ekey added if it were to happen here it would be of great interest to the region she said reach gary huffenberger at 937 556 5768 from left are clinton county port authority executive director dan evers and clinton county economic development director jennifer klus ekey they re happy about the port authority being named by ohio business magazine as a best workplace in ohio for the second straight year from left are clinton county port authority executive director dan evers and clinton county economic development director jennifer klus ekey they re happy about the port authority being named by ohio business magazine as a best workplace in ohio for the second straight year gary huffenberger news journal

content in july of 2020 the average residential sale in the city was valued at 218 057 in july of 2021 that number rose to an average of 238 484 which represents an increase of nearly 8 3 per cent the numbers are somewhat similar for the other markets matheson iroquois falls cochrane kapuskasing said cowie while the covid 19 pandemic impacted the way meetings and home viewings took place over the past two years sales in the timmins area remained steady advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content last winter we started seeing an increase said cowie it essentially went from a buyers market to a sellers market he points to factors such as historically low interest rates and people re evaluating their lifestyles over the last few years we re seeing people wanting bigger homes more bedrooms another bathroom with a major increase in the amount of people working from their homes throughout the pandemic space for a home office has also become a premium feature cowie added that it has been a big challenge for property owners to source certain building materials for renovation projects which impacts the overall housing stock but right now there is a bigger issue we have low inventory levels there s not a lot of inventory on the market right now he said advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content when a home comes on the market that hits a lot of the check boxes people are looking for a lot of times that house has an accepted offer on it even before it hits mls mls short for multiple listing service is a cooperative marketing system which has become the real estate industry benchmark for quality and accuracy of information it hosts listings for nearly every company across north america cowie said timmins is currently a great market for anyone looking to sell there have been bidding wars some homes are going over the asking price there have been some into the 20 000 to 30 000 dollar range if not more that s not the norm but what we re seeing is that people are getting a lot closer to their asking price advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content on the flip side it is a stressful time for prospective homeowners it s certainly a challenge for buyers especially for first time buyers people who are trying to get into this market and you re up against bidding wars or find yourself in one i ve been involved with a few people and it s tough it s really tough for a first time home buyer cowie said the stark realities of the state of the local housing inventory have really become apparent over the last year and a half for example in july of 2020 there were 90 new listings in timmins in july of this year there were only 60 which is a seven per cent decrease the other challenge that we have in this market is that for the most part the housing stock is of an older nature there are no new subdivisions being built he said advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there are a few little pockets here and there where there are newer homes but for the most part they are 25 plus years older and a lot of the inventory is much much older than that of course affordability is also a major factor you can buy just about anything but it depends what you want to do with it some homes need a lot of work and some don t said cowie sometimes first time home buyers have a lot of wants and needs but that might not always fit with the actual inventory that is in the marketplace he added that he and his tctdar colleagues have taken note of some other recent trends one thing we ve noticed over the last couple of months june and july is that the actual number of sales of the properties listed are less than they were at the same time last year advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there may be a simple explanation for that it was a very active spring a lot more activity than there typically is in that time cowie also remarked on the reality that an influx of home buyers from much pricier areas of southern ontario have been heading to the timmins area they re making an impact the same reasons people are re assessing their lives up here people are re assessing their lives down there they re moving up here for a quieter lifestyle i guess to some degree he said adding that it will be a driving impact on the local market in the coming years there is a potential economic boom coming to the area with major projects such as kirkland lake gold s new operations centre being built in timmins along with canada nickel company s crawford project the potential of extension of life at the glencore kidd mine iamgold s c√¥t√© project and solid prospects with moneta porcupine and galleon gold to name a few there are valid questions to be asked surrounding the readiness of the local real estate market to handle an influx of new residents these are all things that are happening in our area right now and that could impact the real estate market because there s no new inventory coming forward said cowie people want open concept two bathrooms large lot a garage that s the kind of main wish list stuff and those homes while they re out there they re not aplenty especially given the age of the inventory

the washingtons end up staying and things move on from there leave the world behind is a witty atmospheric and compelling drama revolving around these strangers marooned in the woods and issues of race class and climate change it seems to change tack as you read it seduces you into thinking it s one thing then shifts gears and seduces you to think it may be this other thing and then it shifts again and becomes this entirely different thing alam says you think it s a middle class novel of manners a race parody and it becomes this third thing this third thing is disaster but what sort is never spelled out just what is going on in the outside world the picture of people negotiating a crisis they cannot comprehend makes the novel appear somehow prescient although alam wrote it before our pandemic the internet goes down planes don t seem to fly and bird song is stilled there is a mysterious sonic blast horror in some distilled way in a single very brief moment animals and birds a sizeable herd of deer and a surprise flamboyance of pink flamingoes behave oddly and then there are archie s teeth you ll have to read it to find out about them but race remains a subtext even as it seems to disappear as an immediate concern which is hardly surprising given the history of the us the binary of black and white alam says permeates the country s cultural imagination it s on the very land you inhabit there s no evading it and the perspective held by many white americans probably many white australians that it is of no interest to them that it does not implicate them is the very thing that points out the extent that it does credit his experience of racism has been minimal he was born to bangladeshi immigrants rational people i couldn t say i had difficulty in washington dc but hopes he has given a more nuanced idea of the ramifications of racism in his country than simple suffering on one hand and liberty on the other as a father of two boys he can relate to amanda s wary response as natural protectiveness but points out that every cultural product in this country is calculated to teach white women white men everybody to fear black masculinity above all else so it s like a natural response when we discuss her character we move on to the question of how one views fictional characters how important is likeability what really does that have to do with anything there is a kind of conversation that has crept into reading in this culture a desire to rank fictionalised people by their likeability he says i don t know anyone who is likeable i am really hard pressed to think of someone who is just likeable and that s the sum total of their existence people are complicated and strange terrible people may hold the same opinions as you people you love may hold terrible political opinions we should have a fiction that reflects that he clearly worries about fiction and how it is perceived he has described his earlier novels that kind of mother and rich and pretty both narrated from the point of white women as autobiographical it s because you re always hostage to your perspective your sense of the world and no way to verify that anyone else shares that as writer patricia lockwood put it in the london review of books no force on earth will keep a writer s preoccupations out of their fiction you are not necessarily looking for them but you find them every time alam laments what he calls a kind of shallow contemporary morality that prompts fiction writers to write more explicity about themselves because it feels unimpeachable it s a politically charged moment in which turning the gaze inwards allows you to escape the kind of boneheaded censure that seems increasingly prevalent in the culture on a holiday a few years ago alam and family stayed in a house not dissimilar to the one in leave the world behind he decided to use it in fiction he was struggling with another novel but on his way to work as an editor at the new york times he created a new twitter account he loves twitter and forged the ideas sentence by sentence for leave the world behind he eventually left the job and at the end of 2018 took himself off to a hotel for six days to start writing properly in that time he produced 120 pages and went on to finish the complete first draft in three weeks but he points out the relationship between draft and book is like seed and watermelon he had the ending in mind when he settled into that hotel partly it came from his worries as a parent and observing his two sons and their friends it was a hell of a thing he has clay think to not be able to keep your kid safe was this how everyone felt was this finally what it was to be a human and partly it reflected his political frustrations as he completed the book looking at trump and boris johnson and greta thunberg it was very clear to me where the imagination lies and the potential lies it s not really a political allegory but certainly i have much more optimism for the generation of 15 18 year old women than i do about the 80 year olds who actually run this planet he is horrified by what he sees as the contemporary dissonance between information and knowledge between fact and belief so much of our political conversation seems to be designed to be inclusive of a perspective that has utterly disdained objective truth for so long what kind of conversation can you have with someone who says oh vaccines cause autism or bill gates is controlling our minds whatever outlandish things people say becomes acceptable political perspective loading it comes as no surprise that the book has been snapped up by netflix alam loves that denzel washington is to star alongside julia roberts because in the novel amanda tells george washington that he looks like denzel washington what could be more absurd or crazy to think that something i hatched as a joke to myself would take on this other dimension a few months on he s an incredible performer someone i ve been looking at my entire life it s mind boggling there s a delicious moment early on in the novel before the washingtons arrive when amanda nips out to the shop to stock up on essential groceries the way alam lists what she buys and her commentary on those goods serve to skewer the type of people she and clay are it reminded me of the lists of must have labels that run through bret easton ellis savage satire of yuppie culture american pyscho when i put that to him alam pauses for a moment that s so funny i hadn t thought about that that is such a terribly misunderstood book in the contemporary moment so much of that stuff is so funny in american psycho that makes me happy i don t know if we valourise fiction that attempts to function as an anthropology of the current moment i think we like it to sit a little bit which is why i am not sure we have seen a great book a great novel about 9 11 so alam wouldn t admit to having written an anthropology of the covid 19 moment but the unease engendered by leave the world behind certainly reflects what we are all going through rumaan alam appears in melbourne writers festival s digital program which starts on september 6 mwf com au leave the world behind is published by bloomsbury at 19 99

ve done and continue to do biden said whitmer whose name had appeared on the screen where biden had been looking had just thanked biden for his leadership leading to the passage of the bill in the senate the detroit free press reported she is one of the united states most recognizable democrat governors after clashing with donald trump and anti lockdown protesters in her home state last year amid claims the fbi foiled a plot to kidnap her president joe biden had yet another senior moment after confusing michigan gov gretchen whitmer with energy secretary jennifer granholm granholm who was michigan s first female governor now serves as the secretary of energy in the biden administration whitmer had previously bristled at former michigan attorney general bill schuette when he also incorrectly called her jennifer when campaigning against her for the governor role in 2018 the outlet noted biden s names mix up came after another bizarre gaffe on tuesday that saw him filmed returning to the white house after spending time in wilmington delaware when the agent points for him to follow the sidewalk path into the white house instead biden is seen following the agent up the lawn and through the garden into the presidential estate the video has left shocked critics of the 78 year old president once again surmising whether biden is suffering the effects of cognitive

president ever elected he looks old there kawahine koa tweeted biden 78 surpassed donald trump as the oldest president ever elected beating out his predecessor the second oldest president ever elected by eight years at the times they took office he also worked in the white house for eight years previously as barack obama s vice president sean spicer who served as press secretary under trump tweeted watch this video closely frank fleming a senior writer for the satirical conservative website the babylon bee claimed that he had written the same events described in the video earlier in the day for a fictional satirical article a near premonition of the gaffe oh man i wrote this in a the babylon bee article this morning before seeing this video fleming tweeted he had written in the article president biden also spoke about the program s success yelling what s tiktok to reporters before getting lost on the way back to the front door of the white house josh barnett an arizona republican running for congress in 2022 tweeted that biden was lost and clueless they literally pointed the walkway out to him and he still went the wrong way tweeted human events editor jack posobiec people react on twitter to news of president joe biden s latest gaffe some joked that biden seems to be a robot that has not been correctly programmed who can t even follow a sidewalk others pointed to signs of dementia and alzheimer s i like the reaction of the secret service agent following behind where the f k is this guy going one person tweeted still a few biden loyalists defended the president from the apparent gaffe it looks like the agent was informing that that route was locked off and to take the different route you think secret service is going to point at a walkway like that to the president one person tweeted biden has been known to make a number of errors since before he became president his apparent cognitive decline has reached the point that even some house republicans urged him to take cognitive tests in june ronny jackson a former white house doctor who claimed trump had aced a cognitive test has also called on biden to do the same president joe biden gets up after tripping while boarding air force one at joint base andrews in maryland in march democratic donors have called the series of biden gaffes a little bit cringeworthy besides his infamous tumble up the steps of air force one the commander in chief has been ad libbing remarks that have left white house staffers scrambling to clean up his messes the hill reported last month that report came after biden had seemingly accused facebook of killing people then walked back his comments three days later claiming facebook isn t killing people my hope is that facebook instead of taking it personally that somehow i m saying facebook is killing people that they would do something about the misinformation the outrageous information about the vaccine biden said when walking back his previous comments that s what i meant democratic donors have called the series of biden gaffes a little bit cringeworthy biden even became a laughing stock at the g 7 summit in june when he tried to correct boris johnson for not introducing the president of south africa though the prime minister already had introduced him the president has long had a list of errors when speaking publicly such as suggesting that hillary clinton would have been a better vice president pick than him when campaigning during then sen barack obama s first run for president tobe berkovitz an associate professor of advertising and communication emeritus at boston university told the hill that as president the stakes for biden s gaffes are higher advertisement he s always ad libbed he s never been particularly good at it he said now as president it s just higher stakes
claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank disinformation to scare people according to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers there has not been a single case of ade the question is it true vaccines do not stop infection stock made this claim about 18 minutes into the school board meeting when he said no vaccine ever stops infection the sources the answer stock s claim that no vaccine ever stops infection needs context there isn t a single vaccine that is 100 efficacious meaning they stop infection some of the time but not all of the time what we found according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc all covid 19 vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid 19 as seen in clinical trial settings and research shows growing evidence mrna covid 19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions but the vaccines aren t quite 100 effective in a release from pfizer biontech the vaccine was 95 4 effective against covid 19 moderna announced the vaccine was greater than 90 efficacy against cases of covid 19 and more than 95 against severe cases the cdc reported the johnson johnson vaccine was 66 3 effective in clinical trials what s interesting about vaccine efficacy is that it doesn t function in a bubble so vaccine efficacy is highly dependent upon how much infection you have in your community kohli said so when you have high rates of infection in the community the vaccines don t work as well and then when the infection rates are lower the vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection goes up it s also obviously dependent on our behaviors she said the question is the vaccine responsible for the current spike in covid 19 cases at about 19 minutes into the meeting stock said with this vaccine that supposedly was going to make all of this go away but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of covid 19 develop in the middle of the summer when vitamin d levels are at their highest the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus centers for disease control and prevention the answer no the vaccine has not caused a recent spike in covid 19 cases what we found dr payal kohli told verify that vitamin d does support immune function but that has nothing to do with the recent rise in cases the rise in cases is because the delta variant is more contagious than the alpha strain the question is ivermectin vitamin d and or zinc an approved treatment for covid 19 stock mentions about 20 minutes into the video that he had successfully treated 15 patients with this antibiotic cocktail the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer no that treatment plan has not been approved by the food drug administration fda or the centers for disease control prevention cdc what we found ivermectin is not approved for use in treating or preventing covid 19 in humans the fda warned ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms and there are topical on the skin formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses according to the fda kohli said zinc and vitamin d can be used to bulk up immune function but there isn t scientific evidence that exists to date that supports the use of those two drugs along with ivermectin to treat covid 19 the question is it true that people who have recovered from covid 19 get no benefit from vaccinations at all stock made the claim at about 21 minutes into the video the sources the answer no a study in the united states shows individuals who had covid 19 and are unvaccinated are more at risk of contracting the virus again what we found dr beau m ances with washington university and a member of the american neurological association told verify the chance for a vaccinated individual to catch covid 19 or variants is significantly reduced at washington university in st louis we are having a large uptick in the number of individuals with covid coming into our hospital and it is primarily those individuals who have not been vaccinated versus those that have been vaccinated ances said that doesn t mean that everybody who gets vaccinated is not going to still not have it he said and we know there have been outbreaks that have been present but the overall morbidity and mortality of those individuals is significantly reduced dr gabriel t bosslet with the indiana university school of medicine told tv station wthr the claim stock made holds no merit all the studies are that people who previously had covid 19 when you measure antibody levels before and after the vaccine it goes up said bosslet so i have no clue where data comes from and frankly that defies all logic what i would tell people is if you hear stuff like this that runs completely counter to everything that the scientists and physicians have been telling you for the last 18 months you need to talk to your doctor and bounce this off of other sources you need to go and talk to other physicians not just people who are going to confirm your prior beliefs he told wthr
claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus made by an indiana doctor before a school board have gone viral not all are accurate example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video at an august 6 school board meeting in hancock county indiana dr dan stock spoke before the mt vernon community school corporation board and made several claims about the covid 19 vaccine and virus to dispute mandatory vaccination and mask policies clips from the board meeting have gone viral posted across mainstream and non mainstream channels on youtube the video from the entire school board meeting had more than 580 000 views as of aug 11 a seven minute clip of stock speaking at the meeting had more than 720 000 views on youtube clips from the meeting were posted dozens of times across bitchute an alternative to youtube and have thousands of engagements across facebook including from indiana rep john jacob ohio congressman jim jordan also shared a youtube link on facebook verify broke down some claims stock used as evidence against mandatory vaccinations and mask mandates the question is the coronavirus spread by aerosol particles which are small enough to go through every mask stock made this claim about 15 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus the new england journal of medicine the answer this is partly true but needs context covid 19 can be transmitted through larger droplets or they can dehydrate and linger as droplet nuclei in the air where they behave like an aerosol according to the new england journal of medicine the aerosols could still pass through a mask but masks slow the spread of the coronavirus what we found dr payal kohli with the university of colorado anschutz medical campus told verify the claims stock made were partly true there s two ways in which the virus spreads through the air one is through large droplets these are large droplets when we talk or laugh or sing that small little bits of saliva come out those usually tend to fall kind of closer to the ground the other is the smaller aerosols kohli said think of it like a suspended virus particle in the air almost like smoke and it just kind of floats around so the simple cloth masks are actually quite effective at preventing droplet transmission because they catch those droplets number one so they prevent you from emitting them out to somebody else and then number two they serve as a barrier of protection from somebody else receiving those droplets kohli said now just like with cigarette smoke you could be wearing a mask and still smell the cigarette smoke because those aerosols which can suspend in the air can get through the simple surgical mask but the n 95 respirators do offer superior protection against both aerosols as well as those droplets she continued the question can covid 19 vaccines cause the immune system to become deranged stock made this claim about 16 minutes into the school board meeting the sources dr payal kohli assistant clinical professor of medicine at university of colorado anschutz medical campus u s food drug administration the answer immune derangement is the small risk of your immune system misbehaving after getting a vaccine kohli told verify there is a very small chance of this happening and can happen with any vaccine what we found kohli said in a very small percentage of people the immune system can overreact or misbehave slightly after receiving a vaccination for example she said a very small percentage of people who received a vaccination suffered from auto immune conditions or myocarditis but the likelihood of that happening particularly with this vaccine which has now been given to 2 3 billion people and we ve only seen a very very very tiny signal occurring and select populations is very very low kohli said according to a july 13 release from the u s food drug administration after 12 5 million doses of the johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines were administered there were 100 cases of guillain barr√© syndrome gbs reported each year in the united states an estimated 3 000 to 6 000 people develop gbs most people fully recover from the disorder gbs has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles the release said no similar signal has been identified with the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines fda continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance the cdc to monitor reports of gbs following vaccination with the janssen covid 19 vaccine importantly the fda has evaluated the available information for the janssen covid 19 vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks the fda said the question can covid 19 cause antibody dependent enhancement ade or vaccine enhanced disease ved which would cause a vaccinated person to have a more severe disease if caught stock made this claim about 17 minutes into the school board meeting the sources the answer there is no evidence to support claims a vaccinated person catches a more severe case of the coronavirus what we found antibody dependent enhancement ade is extremely rare and occurs when certain antibodies make it easier for viruses to get into cells according to university of nebraska physician nada a fadul fadul addressed claims ade is associated with the covid 19 vaccine in a july article published on the university s website fadul said if the covid 19 vaccine caused ade people who are vaccinated would have more severe disease this is not happening on the contrary people who are vaccinated typically have very mild disease or none at all fadul said dr gabriel t bosslet said if stock made these claims he doesn t understand ade or is purposely trying to mislead people it happens it doesn t happen with this vaccine how do we know it s quite simple it doesn t happen with this vaccine because if it happened with this vaccine people who were previously vaccinated when they got covid 19 would get far sicker than if they d never been vaccinated the hospital through that wall would be filled with vaccinated people with severe disease bosslet told tv station wthr that is not what we re seeing the hospitals are not filled with vaccinated people the hospitals are filled almost exclusively with people who have not had the vaccine and so this notion of antibody dependent enhancement sounds super smart because it does exist but to say that it happens with this vaccine is either a gross misunderstanding of the term in general or just frank

over the years members of the black community have been described by varying racial terms including negro colored and african american however a recent gallup poll showed that black people are now more inclined to be labeled as simply black according to the moxie exchange a training and mentoring group aimed at helping businesses develop talent and create inclusive workplaces the reason behind why a black person may choose one label over the other may stems from their cultural backgrounds for example an article published in november 2020 stated that the term african american was usually used when referring to a descendant of people from an african country who was enslaved stock photo pexels com in contrast some tended to use the word black when they neither identified as african nor american or couldn t trace their lineage back to their native land the organization also noted that the two were not always interchangeable although some chose to use it in that manner depending on the situation however gallup said that while black people accepted both terms equally some believed despite their differences in meanings they should be interchangeable in a poll done from june 1 2021 to july 5 2021 when asked which term do you think should generally be used 17 percent of people said black and the same percentage chose african american while 58 percent said it didn t matter the poll also revealed that six percent of people favored another term and two percent said they didn t have an opinion either way although african american was already in use and later popularized in the early 80s more people began to drift to just being called black or one of the two as the 90s approached still the difference in numbers remained relatively the same when subjects were asked the preferred term for their racial subgroup if they had to choose once again 52 percent of people leaned more toward black while 44 percent selected african american four percent had no opinions yet the same couldn t be said about the hispanic community which appears not so open to the term latinx the word made its debut online roughly around 2004 and has since been popularized by social media users activists and those looking for representation for a group of people who didn t necessarily fit into one box according to merriam webster latinx was used generally as a gender neutral term for latin american however it also noted that the term had been embraced more by the lgbtqia community as a way not only to identify themselves as people of latin descent but as one who classifies as a gender outside male or female when posed with a similar question gallup said 23 percent of people believed they should be called hispanic 15 percent said latino the male term for latin and only 4 percent said latinx elsewhere another 57 percent said it didn t matter regarding the black community the data seemingly shows the argument around racial labels hasn t done much to sway members either way many critics including rev jesse l jackson have argued that black is a color and that the african american terms better highlight cultural heritage in a quote captured by the new york times the civil rights leader once said we built the country through the african slave trade african american acknowledges that he added any term that emphasizes the color and not the heritage separates us from our heritage

content in july of 2020 the average residential sale in the city was valued at 218 057 in july of 2021 that number rose to an average of 238 484 which represents an increase of nearly 8 3 per cent the numbers are somewhat similar for the other markets matheson iroquois falls cochrane kapuskasing said cowie while the covid 19 pandemic impacted the way meetings and home viewings took place over the past two years sales in the timmins area remained steady advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content last winter we started seeing an increase said cowie it essentially went from a buyers market to a sellers market he points to factors such as historically low interest rates and people re evaluating their lifestyles over the last few years we re seeing people wanting bigger homes more bedrooms another bathroom with a major increase in the amount of people working from their homes throughout the pandemic space for a home office has also become a premium feature cowie added that it has been a big challenge for property owners to source certain building materials for renovation projects which impacts the overall housing stock but right now there is a bigger issue we have low inventory levels there s not a lot of inventory on the market right now he said advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content when a home comes on the market that hits a lot of the check boxes people are looking for a lot of times that house has an accepted offer on it even before it hits mls mls short for multiple listing service is a cooperative marketing system which has become the real estate industry benchmark for quality and accuracy of information it hosts listings for nearly every company across north america cowie said timmins is currently a great market for anyone looking to sell there have been bidding wars some homes are going over the asking price there have been some into the 20 000 to 30 000 dollar range if not more that s not the norm but what we re seeing is that people are getting a lot closer to their asking price advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content on the flip side it is a stressful time for prospective homeowners it s certainly a challenge for buyers especially for first time buyers people who are trying to get into this market and you re up against bidding wars or find yourself in one i ve been involved with a few people and it s tough it s really tough for a first time home buyer cowie said the stark realities of the state of the local housing inventory have really become apparent over the last year and a half for example in july of 2020 there were 90 new listings in timmins in july of this year there were only 60 which is a seven per cent decrease the other challenge that we have in this market is that for the most part the housing stock is of an older nature there are no new subdivisions being built he said advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there are a few little pockets here and there where there are newer homes but for the most part they are 25 plus years older and a lot of the inventory is much much older than that of course affordability is also a major factor you can buy just about anything but it depends what you want to do with it some homes need a lot of work and some don t said cowie sometimes first time home buyers have a lot of wants and needs but that might not always fit with the actual inventory that is in the marketplace he added that he and his tctdar colleagues have taken note of some other recent trends one thing we ve noticed over the last couple of months june and july is that the actual number of sales of the properties listed are less than they were at the same time last year advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there may be a simple explanation for that it was a very active spring a lot more activity than there typically is in that time cowie also remarked on the reality that an influx of home buyers from much pricier areas of southern ontario have been heading to the timmins area they re making an impact the same reasons people are re assessing their lives up here people are re assessing their lives down there they re moving up here for a quieter lifestyle i guess to some degree he said adding that it will be a driving impact on the local market in the coming years there is a potential economic boom coming to the area with major projects such as kirkland lake gold s new operations centre being built in timmins along with canada nickel company s crawford project the potential of extension of life at the glencore kidd mine iamgold s c√¥t√© project and solid prospects with moneta porcupine and galleon gold to name a few there are valid questions to be asked surrounding the readiness of the local real estate market to handle an influx of new residents these are all things that are happening in our area right now and that could impact the real estate market because there s no new inventory coming forward said cowie people want open concept two bathrooms large lot a garage that s the kind of main wish list stuff and those homes while they re out there they re not aplenty especially given the age of the inventory

by stefan gleason the gold market has no shortage of issues following sunday evening s flash crash that saw prices drop sharply at the open a mysterious 4 billion sell order suspiciously placed during the most illiquid time of the day caused a waterfall 100 decline in gold prices while silver dropped in tandem by over 1 30 per ounce among the major issues investors are eyeing this month is the debate over the federal debt ceiling and federal budget treasury secretary janet yellen has just asked congress to jack up the debt ceiling again just as the u s senate passed biden s 1 trillion green new infrastructure deal a raise or suspension of the debt limit would not itself increase government spending or authorize additional spending the move would simply allow the treasury department to borrow money to pay for congressionally authorized expenditures and avoid the risk of default with the national debt already over 28 4 trillion the treasury department would otherwise run out of its extraordinary measures deployed to remain under the current debt ceiling sometime next month of course a debt default by the united states would have significant effects on the lives of all americans a default would raise borrowing costs substantially and put the economy into recession while setting the stage for more defaults across the globe if the u s government has trouble finding buyers for its bonds the federal reserve always stands ready to create new currency and mop up the excess bonds that process undermines the dollar s value we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us devaluation of the federal reserve note is a less honest and less obvious form of default but it is a default nonetheless it s a default on the dollar s purchasing power at the same time a massive decline in the value of the dollar could not only erode disposable incomes in the u s but could also eat away at real investment returns in financial assets meanwhile senate democrats passed biden s 3 5 trillion budget plan early this morning although the proposed spending is a staggering amount its proponents suggest that it will be paid for through increased tax revenues long term economic growth and health care savings yeah right the reality is that pay for provisions are largely accounting gimmicks that will fail to avert the need for additional borrowing both the budget and debt ceiling battles are likely to become drivers for market action in gold in the weeks and months ahead despite gold s recent weakness these topics should help put a floor under the market any increase in partisan rhetoric concerning the debt ceiling or budget could set the stage for a longer term appreciation in gold and other hard assets the mere threat of a u s default could not only sink the dollar and stock markets but it could also send the price of gold sharply higher as investors seek out alternative asset classes no matter how this plays out gold and silver appear to have good upside potential with little downside price risk from current levels this could make right now a great time to make an investment in the precious metals

have opportunities to participate in development and exploration activities in equatorial guinea west africa as discussed further in note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report we have discontinued operations associated with our activities in angola west africa a significant component of our results of operations is dependent upon the difference between prices received for our offshore gabon crude oil production and the costs to find and produce such crude oil historically crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond our control in 2020 crude oil and natural gas prices experienced an unprecedented decline due to a combination of factors including a substantial decline in global demand for crude oil caused by the covid 19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts in the second quarter of 2021 crude oil and natural gas prices have improved although the recent surge in mutated strains of covid 19 may impact prices in the future despite these challenges we remain committed to generating long term value for our stockholders by focusing on exploration and development of existing properties adding value with accretive acquisitions controlling costs and optimizing production recent developments impact on operations of covid 19 pandemic and the current crude oil pricing environment on march 11 2020 the world health organization classified the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus covid 19 as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure the covid 19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry the adverse economic effects of the covid 19 outbreak materially decreased demand for crude oil based on the restrictions in place by governments trying to curb the outbreak and changes in consumer behavior this led to a significant global oversupply of oil and consequently a substantial decrease in crude oil prices in 2020 in april 2020 countries within opec which includes gabon reached an agreement to cut crude oil production to reduce the gap between excess supply and demand in an effort to stabilize the international oil market gabon has undertaken measures to comply with such opec production quota agreement and as a result the minister of hydrocarbons in gabon requested that we reduce our production in response to such request from the minister of hydrocarbons beginning in july 2020 and continuing through april 2021 we temporarily reduced production from the etame marin block currently our production is not impacted by opec curtailments reductions in production have significantly improved the demand supply imbalance and crude oil prices have improved 29 table of contents from the lows seen in march and april of 2020 as a result in july 2021 opec agreed to increase production beginning in august 2021 to phase out a portion of the prior production cuts we currently have crude oil commodity swap agreements for a total of 351 254 barrels at a dated brent weighted average price of 53 10 per barrel for the period from and including july 2021 through january 2022 as well as 377 869 barrels at a dated brent weighted average price of 66 13 per barrel for the period from july 2021 through october 2021 to mitigate the effects of potential future price declines see note 8 for further discussion on august 6 2021 the company entered into additional commodity swaps at a dated brent weighted average price of 67 70 per barrel for the period from and including november 2021 through february 2022 for a quantity of 314 420 barrels we will consider entering into additional commodity derivative instruments from time to time however there can be no assurance when or upon what terms we may enter into any future commodity derivative instruments the continued spread of covid 19 including vaccine resistant strains or repeated deterioration in crude oil and natural gas prices could result in additional adverse impacts on our results of operations cash flows and financial position including further asset impairments the health of our employees contractors and vendors and our ability to meet staffing needs in our operations and certain critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations we are unable to predict the extent of the impact that the continuing spread of covid 19 throughout gabon may have on our ability to continue to conduct our operations further the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown in addition we cannot predict the impact that covid 19 will have on our customers vendors and contractors however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact our business the situation surrounding covid 19 remains fluid and unpredictable and we are actively managing our response and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as any adverse developments that could impact our business in response to the covid 19 outbreak and the current pricing environment we took the following measures put in place social distancing measures at our work sites actively screened and monitored employees and contractors that come on to our facilities including testing and quarantines with onsite medical supervision engaged in regular company wide covid 19 updates to keep employees informed of key developments implemented sharing certain costs such as supply vessels helicopter and personnel with other operators in the region we expect to continue to take proactive steps to manage any disruption in our business caused by covid 19 and to protect the health and safety of our employees however the health and safety measures we and our vendors have taken have resulted in us incurring higher costs as a result of these factors and the conditions described above 2020 was one of the most uncertain and disruptive years that the industry has ever seen and while the business environment in 2021 appears to be improving the situation remains fluid accordingly the results presented herein are not necessarily indicative of future operating results recent operational updates in december 2020 we completed the acquisition of approximately 1 000 square kilometers of new dual azimuth proprietary 3 d seismic data over the entire etame marin block we expect the seismic data to enhance sub surface imaging by merging legacy data with newly acquired seismic allowing for the first continuous 3 d seismic over the entire block the processing of the seismic data began in january 2021 and we expect all the data to be fully processed and analyzed by the first quarter of 2022 the seismic data will be used to optimize and de risk future drilling locations and potentially identify new drilling locations we plan to commence the next drilling campaign at etame in late 2021 or early 2022 with two development wells and two appraisal wells at an estimated cost of 115 0 million to 125 0 million gross or 73 0 million to 79 0 million net to vaalco s 63 6 participating interest the locations of these wells will be determined in conjunction with the new seismic processing and interpretation in june 2021 in conjunction with our 2021 2022 drilling program we entered into a contract with an affiliate of borr drilling limited to drill a minimum of three wells with options to drill additional wells the contract provides among other things that the drilling rig can be on location as early as december 2021 with the exact timing dependent on other commitments related to the rig we are currently a party to an fpso charter for the storage of all of the crude oil that we produce this contract will expire in september 2022 our options include securing a new storage vessel either under a charter agreement or a purchase purchasing the vessel under the current fpso charter pursuant to an option in the charter contract or extending the charter agreement for the current fpso execution of any of these options requires significant lead time and may require a capital investment due to the specialized nature of such vessels we are currently evaluating our alternatives so that we will be in position to have an alternative in place when the current charter expires acquisition of additional working interest at etame marin block in november 2020 we signed a sale and purchase agreement spa to acquire sasol gabon s a s sasol s 27 8 working interest in the etame marin block offshore gabon the sasol acquisition on february 25 2021 we completed the acquisition of sasol s 27 8 working interest in the etame marin block offshore gabon pursuant to the spa the effective date of the transaction was july 1 2020 prior to the sasol acquisition we owned and operated a 31 1 working interest in etame the sasol acquisition increased our working interest to 58 8 almost doubling our total production and reserves as a result of the sasol acquisition the 30 table of contents net portion of production and costs relating to our etame operations increased from 31 1 to 58 8 reserves production and financial results for the interests acquired have been included in our results for periods after february 25 2021 all assets and liabilities associated with sasol s interest in etame marin block including crude oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations and working capital items were recorded at their fair value as a result of comparing the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed a 7 7 million bargain purchase gain was recognized a bargain purchase gain of 5 5 million is included in other net under other income expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations an income tax benefit of 2 2 million related to the bargain purchase gain is also included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations the reason for the bargain purchase gain is mainly due to the lower crude oil price outlook used when the spa was signed november 17 2020 and the higher oil price outlook on february 25 2021 when the fair value of the reserves associated with the sasol acquisition were determined the actual impact of the sasol acquisition was an increase to total revenues in the condensed consolidated statement of operations of 9 4 million for six months ended june 30 2021 and a 1 2 million increase to net income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended june 30 2021 respectively under the terms of the spa a contingent payment of 5 0 million was payable to sasol should the average dated brent price over a consecutive 90 day period from july 1 2020 to june 30 2022 exceed 60 00 per barrel included in the purchase consideration was the fair value at closing of the contingent payment due to sasol the conditions related to the contingent payment were met and on april 29 2021 we paid the 5 0 million contingent amount to sasol in accordance with the terms of the spa activities by asset gabon offshore etame marin block development and production we operate the etame avouma south tchibala ebouri southeast etame and the north tchibala fields on behalf of a consortium of companies as of june 30 2021 production operations in the etame marin block included eleven platform wells plus three subsea wells across all fields tied back by pipelines to deliver crude oil and associated natural gas through a riser system to allow for delivery processing storage and ultimately offloading the crude oil from a leased fpso anchored to the seabed on the block we currently have fourteen producing wells the fpso has production limitations of approximately 25 000 barrels of oil per day and 30 000 barrels of total fluids per day during the three months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 production from the block was 1 426 mbbls 730 mbbls net and 1 822 mbbls 492 mbbls net respectively as discussed below in

of the venus discovery on block p vaalco is now proceeding to a field development concept and will work closely with the other joint venture owners to complete this over the coming months the block p

for the six months ended june 30 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was mainly due to higher crude oil prices in 2021 partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses as discussed below in results of operations the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 16 6 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and accounts with joint venture owners partially offset by increases in foreign income taxes payable net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended june 30 2021 included 22 5 million paid for the completion of the sasol acquisition as discussed in note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in addition we incurred on a cash basis 4 3 million for property and equipment primarily related to equipment and enhancements as well as expenditures related the next drilling program as discussed in recent operational updates above during the six months ended june 30 2020 we incurred on a cash basis 20 1 million for expenditures related to the 2019 2020 drilling campaign and equipment purchases see capital expenditures below for further discussion net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended june 30 2021 included 1 2 million for treasury stock as a result of tax withholding on options exercised and vested restricted stock as discussed in note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements partially offset by 1 1 million in proceeds from options exercised net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended june 30 2020 included 1 0 million for treasury stock purchases primarily made under the company s stock repurchase plan capital expenditures during the six months ended june 30 2021 we incurred accrual basis capital expenditures of 4 3 million these expenditures were primarily related to equipment and enhancements as well as expenditures related to the next drilling program the difference between capital expenditures and the property and equipment expenditures reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows is attributable to changes in accruals for costs incurred but not yet invoiced or paid on the report dates capital expenditures in 2020 were attributable to expenditures related to the 2019 2020 drilling program and equipment and enhancements as discussed above we anticipate beginning a drilling program late in 2021 that will continue into 2022 at an estimated cost of 115 0 million to 125 0 million gross or 73 0 million to 79 0 million net to vaalco s 63 6 participating interest in april 2021 we purchased a workover unit to have on site for approximately 1 9 million for future maintenance work we are currently evaluating our alternatives to the current fpso charter that will expire in september 2022 we expect that any of these alternatives will involve significant capital expenditures contractual obligations see notes 10 and 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report as well as notes 12 and 13 to our 2020 form 10 k for discussion of our contractual obligations regulatory and joint interest audits we are subject to periodic routine audits by various government agencies in gabon including audits of our petroleum cost account customs taxes and other operational matters as well as audits by other members of the contractor group under our joint operating agreements see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion capital resources cash on hand at june 30 2021 we had unrestricted cash of 22 9 million the unrestricted cash balance includes 2 0 million of cash attributable to non operating joint venture owner advances as operator of the etame marin block in gabon we enter into project related activities on behalf of our working interest joint venture owners we generally obtain advances from the joint venture owners prior to significant funding commitments we currently sell our crude oil production from gabon under a term contract that began in february 2020 and after contract extensions ends in january 2022 pricing under the contract is based upon an average of dated brent in the month of lifting adjusted for location and market factors 32 table of contents liquidity historically our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations and our primary use of cash has been to fund capital expenditures for development activities in the etame marin block as a result of completing the sasol acquisition on february 25 2021 our obligations with respect to development activities in the etame have increased based on the increase in our working interest in the etame from 31 1 at december 31 2020 to 58 8 we expect that part of this increase will be offset by an increase in our operating cash flows based on our increased portion of the etame production we continually monitor the availability of capital resources including equity and debt financings that could be utilized to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements including those to fund opportunistic acquisitions our future success in growing proved reserves production and balancing the long term development of our assets with a focus on generating attractive corporate level returns will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us in 2020 crude oil prices experienced a significant decline as a result of the substantial decline in the global demand for crude oil caused by the covid 19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts reductions in production have significantly improved the demand supply imbalance and crude oil prices have improved from the lows seen in march and april of 2020 between july 2020 and april 2021 we temporarily reduced production from the etame marin block currently our production is not impacted by opec curtailments in july 2021 opec agreed to increase production beginning in august 2021 to phase out a portion of the prior production cuts brent crude prices were approximately 77 per barrel as of june 30 2021 on january 22 2021 we entered into commodity swaps at a dated brent weighted average price of 53 10 per barrel for the period from and including february 2021 through january 2022 for 709 262 barrels on may 6 2021 we entered into commodity swaps at a dated brent weighted average price of 66 51 per barrel for the period from and including may 2021 through october 2021 for a quantity of 672 533 barrels on august 6 2021 the company entered into additional commodity swaps at a dated brent weighted average price of 67 70 per barrel for the period from and including november 2021 through february 2022 for a quantity of 314 420 barrels based on current expectations we believe we have sufficient liquidity through our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to support our cash requirements including those related to our 2021 2022 drilling program and our efforts to secure an alternative to the fpso charter through september 2022 we are continuing to evaluate all uses of cash including opportunistic acquisitions and whether to pursue growth opportunities at december 31 2020 we had 3 2 mmbbls of estimated net proved reserves all of which are related to the etame marin block offshore gabon in february 2021 we increased our working interest in the etame marin block from 31 1 to 58 8 the current term for exploitation of the reserves in the etame marin block ends in september 2028 with rights for two five year extension periods except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced while both short term and long term liquidity are impacted by crude oil prices our long term liquidity also depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional crude oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable off balance sheet arrangements none critical accounting policies there have been no material

to the same period in 2020 the increase in expense was primarily related to higher fpso charter transportation and personnel costs partially offset by lower crude oil inventory costs on a per barrel basis production expense excluding workover expense for the three months ended june 30 2021 increased to 25 02 per barrel from 19 31 per barrel for the three months ended june 30 2020 primarily as a

net income loss 0 5 1 1 3 3 adjusted ebitda 3 4 1 2 0 3 total revenue in the second quarter of 2021 increased 58 on a quarter over quarter basis driven by continued improvements across both marketing

the covid 19 related impacts in the prior year quarter gross profit in the second quarter of 2021 improved 37 compared to the first quarter of 2021 and increased 76 compared to the prior year quarter the sequential and year over year increases were driven by the company s aforementioned marketing promotional and baseline improvements as well as continued recovery from pandemic related impacts operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 increased both sequentially and year over year due to an expected decrease in the amount of wage subsidy funding received under the canada emergency wage subsidy program the gradual easing of some spending restrictions implemented at the outset of the pandemic as financial performance continues to improve and to a lesser extent the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds on the canadian dollar the company recognized wage subsidies of approximately 0 6 million as an offset to operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 and does not anticipate participating in further subsidies for the remainder of the year total funds available which is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents cash held in trust and funds receivable from

expected at the kawa 1 location on august 15 2021 the joint venture expects the kawa 1 well will reach total depth in approximately 85 days as part of its contract with maersk the joint venture also holds an option to drill an additional well the kawa 1 well is located in the northeast quadrant of the corentyne block approximately 200 kilometers offshore from georgetown the water depth is approximately 355 meters 1174 ft and the expected total depth of the kawa 1 well is 6 685 meters 21 932 ft the primary target of the kawa 1 well is a light oil large santonian slope fan complex with an overlying campanian fan in a combination structural and stratigraphic trap trapping of hydrocarbons within campanian to santonian aged sandstone reservoirs is expected to be provided by a pinchout of the reservoir section updip the kawa 1 well will also penetrate secondary objectives in a shallower campanian sand and a deeper santonian sand which the joint venture believes has additional hydrocarbon potential the stacked primary and secondary kawa 1 targets are considered analogous to the discoveries immediately adjacent to the corentyne block in block 58 in suriname proximity of the corentyne block to the cretaceous berbice canyon sediment source is interpreted to have concentrated sandstone reservoirs in the north corentyne area channelized stacked internal fan geometries evident on 3d seismic are indicative of thick stacked coarser grained sand reservoirs the joint venture has assembled a highly qualified and experienced team for the drilling campaign with extensive deep water drilling expertise from operations around the globe including the guyana basin colombia production in the second quarter averaged 35 682 boe d down approximately 12 compared with 40 599 boe d in the prior quarter the reduction in production quarter over quarter was mainly due to temporarily reduced water disposal volumes and community concerns which delayed drilling a new injector well at quifa and slower than anticipated recovery of full production levels at cpe 6 following the lifting of road blockades these community concerns have now been resolved currently the company has three drilling rigs and two workover rigs active at its quifa cpe 6 and coralillo operations in the second quarter of 2021 the company drilled 12 wells and completed well services on 23 others at quifa reserves have been unaffected by the temporary reduction in water disposal volumes the company is developing other water disposal options for the benefit of long term production including drilling a new injector well on the block the company expects that once the new injector well is operational quifa production will increase frontera expects to drill 10 development wells at quifa in the second half of 2021 at cpe 6 production has returned to pre shut in levels of approximately 3 600 boe d the company continues to expect increased production at cpe 6 by approximately 40 by the end of the year compared to 2020 through continued drilling and construction of additional water handling facilities during the quarter the agencia nacional de hidrocarburos agreed to extend the cpe 6 boundary area by 115 869 net acres to the north of the current cpe 6 boundary area bringing the company s total acreage position to 645 626 net acres the boundary extension provides the company with additional

cash position was 128 3 million a decrease of approximately 33 million compared to 161 2 million in the first quarter of 2021 the decrease in restricted cash quarter over quarter is primarily due to

that are not considered in the international financial reporting standards ifrs operating ebitda operating netback net sales oil gas sales net of purchases consolidated total indebtedness and net debt these financial measures together with measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide useful information to investors and shareholders as management uses them to evaluate the operating performance of the company the company s determination of these non ifrs measures may differ from other reporting issuers and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies further these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flows prepared in accordance with ifrs these financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating performance and liquidity prior period figures are different compared with those previously reported as a result of the change in the treatment of purchased volumes and cost of purchases according to the new operating netback approach refer to the non ifrs measures section on page 13 of the md a for further details operating ebitda management believes that ebitda is a common measure used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods income taxes depreciation and impairment of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets ebitda is a commonly used measure that adjusts net income loss as reported under ifrs to exclude the effects of income taxes finance income and depletion depreciation and amortization expense operating ebitda represents the operating results of the company s primary business excluding the items noted above restructuring severance and other costs certain non cash items such as impairments foreign exchange unrealized risk management contracts costs under terminated pipeline contracts and share based compensation and gains or losses arising from the disposal of capital assets in addition other unusual or non recurring items are excluded from operating ebitda as they are not indicative of the underlying core operating performance of the company a reconciliation of operating ebitda to net loss is as follows three months ended m june 30 2021 march 31 2021 june 30 2020 net loss 25 648 14 126 67 760 finance income 3 675 840 6 167 finance

84 771 69 158 37 608 netbacks management believes that netback is a useful measure to assess the net profit after all the costs associated with bringing one barrel of oil to the market it is also commonly used by the oil and gas industry to analyze financial and operating performance expressed as profit per barrel operating netback represents realized price per barrel plus realized gain or loss on financial derivatives less production costs transportation costs royalties and diluent costs and shows how efficient the company is at extracting and selling its product for netback purposes the company removes the effects of trading activities and midstream segment from its per barrel metrics refer to the operating netback section on page 6 of the md a net sales net sales are a non ifrs subtotal that adjusts revenue to include realized gains and losses from risk management contracts while removing the cost of dilution activities this is a useful indicator for management as the company hedges a portion of its oil production using derivative instruments to manage exposure to oil price volatility this metric allows the company to report its realized net sales after factoring in these risk management activities the deduction of diluent cost is helpful to understand the company s sales performance based on the net realized proceeds from production net of dilution the cost of which is partially recovered when the blended product is sold net sales exclude sales from port services as it is not considered part of the oil gas segment and sales and purchases of oil and gas for trading as the gross margins from these activities are not considered significant or material to the company s operations refer to the reconciliation in the sales section on page 7 of the md a consolidated total indebtedness and net debt consolidated total indebtedness and net debt are used by the company to monitor its capital structure financial leverage and as a measure of overall financial strength consolidated total indebtedness is defined as long term debt plus liabilities for leases and net position of risk management contracts excluding unrestricted subsidiaries this metric is consistent with the definition under the company s unsecured notes as defined in the md a for the calculation of certain conditions and covenants net debt is defined as consolidated total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents both measures are exclusive of non recourse subsidiary debt 2025 puerto bahia debt and cash attributable to the unrestricted subsidiaries please see the md

zdoggmd discusses and debunks controversial statements made by dan stock md to indiana s mt vernon school board that went viral following is a rough transcript note that errors are possible zdoggmd all right guys i m making a video i just don t even wanna make but so many people have sent me this video about this mt vernon school board meeting and a doctor who goes up there and bravely tells them what s true about vaccines and cdc and starting school and all that all right let s just go through some of the claims and who this guy is quickly so that we can be done with this and no one needs to send me this video again all right this guy dr dan stock he s a family medicine doc indianapolis indiana somewhere runs a concierge direct primary care practice which i think is awesome lifestyle medicine which can be really awesome but also is a space full of kind of weird unproven stuff and quackery but it can also be awesome right so this is kinda where this guy s coming from goes to the school board meeting and basically tells them what s up and let s just go through his claims and look at each one all right so viral particles these viral particles for the sars cov 2 are so small they go through all masks well that s just simply not quite right cause there is a mask called an n95 that does block the vast majority of viral particles so that i guess he s talking about masks and kids i m also quite ambivalent about masks and kids so i get it but let s not start with like a blatant untruth that the particles go through the masks all right the masks probably lower overall viral inoculum they probably prevent a kid from blowing snot on another kid but we don t really know how they work in kids because kids are weird right when the thing gets soaked with mucus all day it s full of boogers we don t know how effective it is in practice and the data have not been that compelling to me but whatever it s probably not a high risk intervention unless you worry about language development and socialization and things like that and also just stigmatizing children and making them feel like they re a pestilence but okay fine that s his first claim the second one is no one can make this virus go away because it has animal reservoirs it s a respiratory virus it s not so pathogenic that it kills its host right away i agree with that you are going to be living with sars cov 2 forever anybody who thinks we can eradicate this virus bret weinstein who says we can drive it to extinction you can t you can t it s gonna be with us forever but it s gonna evolve into a less pathogenic form meaning probably like a common cold which is also a lot of coronaviruses right so this is probably the natural course of it you re not gonna stamp it out and anybody who thinks you can is not right so i agree with him there so then he says vaccination changes none of this basically and he says it s clear that he s against coronavirus vaccination and this is where i really take issue with him because he s just wrong and there s a lot of misinformation here so he says why are we having a breakout outbreak of coronavirus in the middle of the summer when it s a respiratory virus it shouldn t be doing that and then he says it s because of the vaccinations let s unpack all of this he is citing something called antibody mediated enhancement or antibody dependent viral enhancement which i ve done shows on what it means is and we ve seen it with attempts at an rsv respiratory syncytial virus vaccine back in the day where what you do is you end up making antibodies that are triggered by the vaccine to parts of the virus that don t neutralize the virus but instead cause the immune system to take up the virus into its own cells kind of like a trojan horse thing without destroying or inactivating the virus and that actually makes the infection worse hence the antibody dependent enhancement of infection and we ve seen it with rsv now he goes on to say well you know with the sars cov 2 in animal trials that s what we saw it s like nope nope we didn t next the point with antibody dependent enhancement is that vaccinated people would then get more sick than unvaccinated people they would have enhanced disease well what we see in this outbreak in the summer is the opposite it is a pandemic of the unvaccinated so unvaccinated people are the ones filling up hospitals right vaccinated a very tiny proportion of that and he says well this shouldn t be happening in the summer except it did last summer too particularly in the warmer southern states and southwestern states where the summer is like the winter in that you go indoors because of air conditioning because it s so hot outside and that promotes the spread of the virus so it happened last year before vaccinations so that whole argument is nonsense there s no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement with our current vaccines in fact the opposite there is less disease less severe disease less symptomatic disease and actually probably less infection as well which we should talk about so this is just complete nonsense then he says vaccines never prevent infection ever which is a pretty strong phrase but you don t get symptomatic so you may not get symptomatic so they ll prevent severe disease yeah that s what you want so i agree with him there yeah oh you want to prevent symptomatic and severe disease except with these vaccines it s clear that you actually have about at least in santa clara data about a four fold reduction in test positivity so it seems to actually prevent infection okay so that s a big deal especially when he s saying the opposite and then he says you re gonna be chasing yourself your tail if you expect your infection positivity testing to be zero in schools i agree don t even test them that s what i think these kids are generally low risk generally not always but generally low risk why would you be testing them every week or whatever certain policy crazy policies are and then mandating vaccinations for kids assuming they could even be vaccinated if they re 12 and below they can t be yet also seems unnecessary to me so in that sense i agree with him absolutely and i like the fact that he stands up in front of the board and he s like i will testify for you i mean i like his passion i like this guy s passion he s just wrong about some things here so this is where the twist happens okay so he says why would we even want to vaccinate when we have treatments for sars cov 2 this is where it gets ugly ivermectin vitamin d zinc okay then he goes on to say i ve treated 15 one five patients and guess what none of them got hospitalized cause i did this stuff for them come on dude come on really that s your trial an uncontrolled trial of 15 people all of whom were probably gonna get better anyways who you gave placebo to come on dude so ivermectin trials are still ongoing i ve done videos on this we re waiting on randomized trials on ivermectin i m not holding my breath for reasons i ve mentioned with dr prasad on the show so already he s got a bias against the vaccines right with all this misinformation he s already spread and then he says people with prior infection get no benefit from vaccines all right so this is a gray area i agree if you ve been infected before you re probably immune against severe disease right but there is data that says that if you get another dose your neutralizing antibodies are higher and that may be correlated with protection against infection and severe disease so it s still a little gray area doesn t mean you should go run out and get vaccinated if you ve already had the disease i agree with him on that but i don t think we can speak in absolutes about this and then he goes on to say the school policies and cdc is totally counterfactual don t listen to them if you get sued i ll be your expert witness etc all right so here s how we can think about everything he said he s wrong about the vaccines he s right that we should question schools policies if it comes to preventing our children from being in person in class for school that we are paying for with a teacher class that should be protected with vaccines and masks and let the kids go back to school i agree with him on that he s absolutely right right and i admire the fact that he would stand up and do that but everything he s saying about vaccines is wrong the other stuff he talks about the viral dynamics is just crazy talk but that s my take on it all right so you guys wanted to know please don t send me this video again please don t ask me to comment on it and please don t go watching school board videos that aren t in your own district because it just doesn t matter crazy all right guys i love you we out show the video whatever i don t care this post appeared on zdoggmd please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus

you like bad treatment when is the last time you heard that whether it was directed to you or someone else you likely got the feeling the person saying it does not want to offer their support how does it feel when someone tells you your situation is due to your failure to remove yourself from it perhaps they are trying to motivate you to take action maybe they are tired of seeing you suffer no longer want to come to the rescue or do not want to hear the complaints they may even suggest things are not as bad as you say they are because they think you would extricate yourself from such terrible circumstances little consideration is given to the difficulty of intentional ending or significantly changing relationships and giving up benefits even if they do not seem to others to come close to making up for the negative impact over the past few days there have been numerous comments about the bahamian olympic gold medalists and their decisions to represent the bahamas it is assumed they both have the opportunity to represent other countries and suggested by a very small group of people that they should do so because the bahamas does not treat them well enough do they get the support they deserve are their human rights respected is the bahamas a place they could comfortably live and reach their potential if they are more at home and access better somewhere else why represent the bahamas some of the same people would probably lambaste them for representing another country because this is where they are from as we know some people never satisfy some have the strange belief that bahamians who make it belong to the rest of us and owe us something like the glory of their wins and maybe even their firstborn it is mentioned over and over again that because miller uibo is married to an estonian she is constitutionally prevented from conferring bahamian citizenship on children should she choose to have any as you may expect people generally assume she will have children and do not consider that she can make a different choice her hypothetical children are framed as a loss to the bahamas because miller uibo and her husband are both athletes the assumption is that their children would also be impressive athletes every time miller uibo makes a great athletic achievement there are people who remind everyone else that her children ain even ga be bahamian it is unsettling that people are thinking about a woman as a source of new athletes to potentially represent a country and build national pride at the same time it is telling people value her based on her wins and her being the vehicle for other wins she is not an ordinary bahamian woman in the conversations that people try to make about women s rights she is exceptional and that makes her worthy of the right to confer citizenship on her children that right could then enable bahamians to enjoy the feeling of superiority pride and gratification there are two interesting things to consider here the first is that we are selective in our support for various causes and groups of people there is often a benefit we need to access in order to be on the side of a person or group of people who are disadvantaged by systems and practices we otherwise support women s rights may not be particularly important to a person but being able to claim an athlete and celebrate their wins is important if giving that woman access to a particular right would enable us to benefit from subsequent wins so be it this should not be confused with genuine support for women s rights this is a part of a long time trend in which women are encouraged and supported in a particular activity that benefits men women could stay at home and do unpaid domestic work to support men working outside of the home when there was a labour shortage white women could work outside of the home for pay black woman had been working before that when a single income was no longer enough women could work outside of the home for pay when there was a need for more labour women were encouraged to have more children the condition of the economy has long affected women s lives and the involvement of others in their decision making in the case of women s conferral of citizenship on their children some of are supportive as long as the children accessing citizenship are expected to be productive useful in economics politics and international optics exceptionalism is not the way to change minds we do not set a good precedent when we treat citizenship like a bet granting it with the expectation of a particular return the second is that miller uibo is exceptional and can enjoy the privilege of being an olympic medalist a household name and valued by the government should she choose to have a child do we really believe she would be given access to bahamian citizenship for that child chances are she would not even have to ask she would likely be approached by a government official to ensure everything is in order for the process to go smoothly there are others that have been able to secure citizenship for their children born under similar circumstances but instead of celebrity status they had connections with the right people or enough money to ensure the law did not get in the way these people did not even have to wait for their children to turn 18 to apply the law simply does not apply to people who are the exception whether they are exceptional like miller uibo or have the right resources to access what others cannot we should not have to be exceptional to have access to human rights women should have the same rights to confer citizenship that men have it should not be necessary to point to an exceptional figure to get people to care about rights in addition we have no right to people s children and to treat people s children like stocks and bonds speculating on value and performance over time is strange and unnecessary we don t like bad treatment so we have to do better a substantial part of that is valuing each other as human beings and demanding equal rights in law policy and practice with attention to making rights accessible to all including women lgbtq

a slew of regulatory actions by beijing caught investors in chinese companies by surprise as authorities increasingly focus on promoting common prosperity analysts said resentment toward tech companies is growing in china especially from small businesses that feel squeezed by digital behemoths two store owners share their experience beijing investors in chinese companies were caught off guard this summer by beijing s actions against homegrown tech giants including comments about overseas listed shares one of the surprises was a mandate in late july that chinese education businesses should restructure and remove investment from foreigners a separate order earlier last month called for app stores to remove chinese ride hailing app didi just days after its massive ipo in new york didi shares have dropped more than 30 since the listing the kraneshares csi china internet etf kweb whose top holdings include u s listed stocks alibaba and jd com has fallen 29 over the last 60 trading days get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters it s probably important especially for international investors to note there is a big and deep change of philosophical thinking on the economic policy what s more important in china s economy said zhu ning professor of finance and deputy dean at the shanghai advanced institute of finance foreign investors need to understand and brace for that in a very big shift zhu pointed to the chinese communist party s political pledge to deliver common prosperity moderate wealth for all in contrast to the country s growing income inequality that contrasts with ensuring that at least some get rich first zhu said anger at big tech firms efforts to achieve this pledge have accelerated in the last 12 months the chinese government shielded alibaba from foreign competition for years until the company grew so large under its founder jack ma that authorities abruptly suspended its affiliate ant group s massive ipo in november and fined alibaba 18 23 billion yuan in april resentment toward tech companies is also growing in china especially from small businesses that feel squeezed by the digital behemoths it may sound like internet platforms provide us with more opportunities but it also puts more financial burdens on us said a restaurant owner in beijing who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation by the online food delivery services cnbc translated her mandarin language remarks she initially listed her restaurant on meituan china s dominant food delivery platform in early 2019 and paid a commission fee of 18 she said meituan staff told her that since it was the lowest fee available on the site she could not list on other food delivery sites when the pandemic cut off revenue from in store diners she listed her restaurant on alibaba s ele me food delivery platform that prompted angry calls from meituan staff who said she would have to pay a higher 25 commission fee if she didn t delist from ele me she decided to quit meituan meituan declined to comment on the individual business case the tech giant came under fire last year for allegedly underpaying its 9 5 million delivery riders who reportedly face high risk of injury or death from rushing for deliveries to make algorithmically calculated delivery times growing criticism in late july china s anti trust regulator ordered food delivery platforms to pay workers the local minimum wage earlier that month the state council china s the top executive body decided to remove restrictions on the country s 200 million gig economy workers ability to access local health insurance and pension plans the policy changes come as chinese news media organizations which are themselves strongly influenced by the government have become more critical of chinese tech companies and their culture of overwork earlier this year two employees at e commerce giant pinduoduo allegedly died due to excessive work the company confirmed one death in an online statement while a representative was not immediately available for comment on the other death as of publication this summer short video companies kuaishou and subsequently tiktok parent bytedance reportedly halted a policy of asking employees to regularly work on weekends china s anti monopoly regulation is a good thing said yang guang who operates a convenience store in a beijing apartment complex with his wife if all these daily life needs are all controlled by one or two companies how can we have bargaining power yang asked in mandarin according to a cnbc translation he said he doesn t want to list his store on delivery platforms such as meituan or ele me because they would want about 15 to 25 in commission fees instead he and his wife deliver purchases themselves to nearby customers communicating with them through the wechat messaging app struggling small businesses there are roughly 139 million small businesses in china according to one official tally small businesses are often talked about at government meetings that discuss their operating difficulties and beijing s efforts to help them but small businesses surveyed for the official purchasing managers index in july revealed worsening conditions for a second straight month while large businesses said they saw slight growth the latest regulatory crackdown has focused on limiting monopolistic practices increasing data protection and even encouraging more births authorities are trying to address the income inequality issue in a year when they have a rare opportunity to tackle long term problems without needing to worry much about growth said zhiwei zhang chief economist at pinpoint asset management officials set a gdp growth target of over 6 for this year which is relatively low compared with the 8 or 8 5 growth that many economists predict for china this window sometime down the road probably will not always be open so the intensity of these policies came in surprisingly high zhang said while he said it would be helpful for authorities to communicate more support for foreign investment and private entrepreneurs overall zhang noted the latest crackdown has targeted sectors such as education which the general public complained about in the past new direction for start ups u s listed chinese education stocks plunged double digits on a single day last month after new policy forced after school tutoring companies to become non profits and banned investment from foreign capital hongye wang china based partner at venture capital firm antler said tutoring companies often took advantage of chinese parents willingness to pay whatever necessary to give their children a good education that meant for two years investors like himself could get a 5 fold return on education companies regardless of the economic environment wang said the purpose of the new government policy is to lower education costs especially for poorer people living in rural areas wang said he added that the state would likely want to improve people s access to medical care as well beijing s scrutiny on big chinese tech companies comes as u s investors and financial regulators are increasingly worried about the regulatory risk for investing in china in late july u s securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler announced that chinese companies need to disclose whether beijing denied them from listing on u s exchanges for chinese start ups perceived uncertainty about their ability to go public could restrict their ability to raise capital said nick xiao vice president at hong kong based asset manager hywin in this context chinese start ups will probably want to sharpen their pitch on why their business model is resiliently scalable and how it creates genuine value both commercial and societal

operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 increased both sequentially and year over year due to an expected decrease in the amount of wage subsidy funding received under the canada emergency wage subsidy program the gradual easing of some spending restrictions implemented at the outset of the pandemic as financial performance continues to improve and to a lesser extent the impacts of

expected at the kawa 1 location on august 15 2021 the joint venture expects the kawa 1 well will reach total depth in approximately 85 days as part of its contract with maersk the joint venture also holds an option to drill an additional well the kawa 1 well is located in the northeast quadrant of the corentyne block approximately 200 kilometers offshore from georgetown the water depth is approximately 355 meters 1174 ft and the expected total depth of the kawa 1 well is 6 685 meters 21 932 ft the primary target of the kawa 1 well is a light oil large santonian slope fan complex with an overlying campanian fan in a combination structural and stratigraphic trap trapping of hydrocarbons within campanian to santonian aged sandstone reservoirs is expected to be provided by a pinchout of the reservoir section updip the kawa 1 well will also penetrate secondary objectives in a shallower campanian sand and a deeper santonian sand which the joint venture believes has additional hydrocarbon potential the stacked primary and secondary kawa 1 targets are considered analogous to the discoveries immediately adjacent to the corentyne block in block 58 in suriname proximity of the corentyne block to the cretaceous berbice canyon sediment source is interpreted to have concentrated sandstone reservoirs in the north corentyne area channelized stacked internal fan geometries evident on 3d seismic are indicative of thick stacked coarser grained sand reservoirs the joint venture has assembled a highly qualified and experienced team for the drilling campaign with extensive deep water drilling expertise from operations around the globe including the guyana basin colombia production in the second quarter averaged 35 682 boe d down approximately 12 compared with 40 599 boe d in the prior quarter the reduction in production quarter over quarter was mainly due to temporarily reduced water disposal volumes and community concerns which delayed drilling a new injector well at quifa and slower than anticipated recovery of full production levels at cpe 6 following the lifting of road blockades these community concerns have now been resolved currently the company has three drilling rigs and two workover rigs active at its quifa cpe 6 and coralillo operations in the second quarter of 2021 the company drilled 12 wells and completed well services on 23 others at quifa reserves have been unaffected by the temporary reduction in water disposal volumes the company is developing other water disposal options for the benefit of long term production including drilling a new injector well on the block the company expects that once the new injector well is operational quifa production will increase frontera expects to drill 10 development wells at quifa in the second half of 2021 at cpe 6 production has returned to pre shut in levels of approximately 3 600 boe d the company continues to expect increased production at cpe 6 by approximately 40 by the end of the year compared to 2020 through continued drilling and construction of additional water handling facilities during the quarter the agencia nacional de hidrocarburos agreed to extend the cpe 6 boundary area by 115 869 net acres to the north of the current cpe 6 boundary area bringing the company s total acreage position to 645 626 net acres the boundary extension provides the company with additional

cash position was 128 3 million a decrease of approximately 33 million compared to 161 2 million in the first quarter of 2021 the decrease in restricted cash quarter over quarter is primarily due to the release of 10 0 million of abandonment funds that were replaced with letters of credit the release of 12 5 million in exploration commitments due to the reduction in cash collateral requirements under new letter of credit lines the release of 11 million due to a new agreement with citibank regarding cash collateral of letter of credits and foreign exchange fluctuations in the third quarter of

that are not considered in the international financial reporting standards ifrs operating ebitda operating netback net sales oil gas sales net of purchases consolidated total indebtedness and net debt these financial measures together with measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide useful information to investors and shareholders as management uses them to evaluate the operating performance of the company the company s determination of these non ifrs measures may differ from other reporting issuers and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies further these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flows prepared in accordance with ifrs these financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating performance and liquidity prior period figures are different compared with those previously reported as a result of the change in the treatment of purchased volumes and cost of purchases according to the new operating netback approach refer to the non ifrs measures section on page 13 of the md a for further details operating ebitda management believes that ebitda is a common measure used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods income taxes depreciation and impairment of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets ebitda is a commonly used measure that adjusts net income loss as reported under ifrs to exclude the effects of income taxes finance income and depletion depreciation and amortization expense operating ebitda represents the operating results of the company s primary business excluding the items noted above restructuring severance and other costs certain non cash items such as impairments foreign exchange unrealized risk management contracts costs under terminated pipeline contracts and share based compensation and gains or losses arising from the disposal of capital assets in addition other unusual or non recurring items are excluded from operating ebitda as they are not indicative of the underlying core operating performance of the

84 771 69 158 37 608 netbacks management believes that netback is a useful measure to assess the net profit after all the costs associated with bringing one barrel of oil to the market it is also commonly used by the oil and gas industry to analyze financial and operating performance expressed as profit per barrel operating netback represents realized price per barrel plus realized gain or loss on financial derivatives less production costs transportation costs royalties and diluent costs and shows how efficient the company is at extracting and selling its product for netback purposes the company removes the effects of trading activities and midstream segment from its per barrel metrics refer to the operating netback section on page 6 of the md a net sales net sales are a non ifrs subtotal that adjusts revenue to include realized gains and losses from risk management contracts while removing the cost of dilution activities this is a useful indicator for management as the company hedges a portion of its oil production using derivative instruments to manage exposure to oil price volatility this metric allows the company to report its realized net sales after factoring in these risk management activities the deduction of diluent cost is helpful to understand the company s sales performance based on the net realized proceeds from production net of dilution the cost of which is partially recovered when the blended product is sold net sales exclude sales from port services as it is not considered part of the oil gas segment and sales and purchases of oil and gas for trading as the gross margins from these activities are not considered significant or material to the company s operations refer to the reconciliation in the sales section on page 7 of the md a consolidated total indebtedness and net debt consolidated total indebtedness and net debt are used by the company to monitor its capital structure financial leverage and as a measure of overall financial strength consolidated total indebtedness is defined as long term debt plus liabilities for leases and net position of risk management contracts excluding unrestricted subsidiaries this metric is consistent with the definition under the company s unsecured notes as defined in the md a for the calculation of certain conditions and covenants net debt is defined as consolidated total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents both measures are exclusive of non recourse subsidiary debt 2025 puerto bahia debt and cash attributable to the unrestricted subsidiaries please see the md

reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure to the nearest applicable gaap measure in addition we will discuss our executed contracts and awarded orders and our definition for this metric is also included in our press release with that let me hand it over to tony tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thanks bill and good morning everyone i ll start with a few highlights from the quarter first i m pleased to report that in spite of continued and worsening pressure on the global logistics costs and material lead times our second quarter results came in within or above our guidance range on all metrics this includes revenue of 50 1 million which was above the high end of the range we continue to see strong growth in our executed contracts and award orders which have grown by 385 on a year to date basis through august 1 with an additional 203 million added since our last update from june 1 this includes adding a new top five epc vendor to our customer base of contracted projects we re subtracting the amount of revenue included in reported first half revenue that brings our new balance to 478 million to be delivered between the remainder of 2021 and 2022 based on average lead times we have the opportunity to continue to add to our contract and awarded revenue for expected delivery in 2021 into the fourth quarter of this year this backlog growth is important evidence of the growing appeal of our products in the marketplace supported by our approach to limiting the impact to customers during this period of cost and supply uncertainty we recognized our first revenue on the sale of our sunpath performance software this was the third contract for our new software and the first for which we have recognized revenue we continue to be excited about the long term potential of this offering as a revenue and profitability driver for the company sunpath can essentially provide additional risk free revenue to our customers with a high margin profile for us as well during the quarter we sold our position in a minority investment dimension energy for a net payout of approximately 22 million with the opportunity to receive an additional earnout of up to approximately 14 million based on that company achieving certain performance milestones and finally based on our backlog growth and other progress this year we see significant growth in the second half of the year driven by q4 with volume deliveries above 1 gigawatt in that quarter with improvement in our profitability i ll now discuss the current environment in more detail we discussed last quarter the impacts of the global increases in the cost of logistics and commodities including key inputs to trackers and solar arrays we re having on the industry specifically we discussed these factors are causing developers to take a closer look at uncontracted projects to reevaluate their construction time lines and at certain developers we re pushing out time lines by a quarter or two since our last update in early june steel pricing has continued to remain elevated solar module pricing has remained elevated and the global logistics environment has continued to deteriorate with freight increasing another 40 into july and spiking further into august we believe solar developers remain in a similar posture of reevaluation on those uncontracted pipeline projects we ve seen reports estimating that about 15 or more of projects are being delayed which seems consistent with what we have observed in the market in spite of these project delays as i mentioned earlier ftc solar continues to see continued strong long term demand growth in orders which will show up much more meaningfully in revenue for us starting in q4 and into 2022 to update our positioning and the actions we ve taken in this environment first we continue to have a strong balance sheet which allows us to withstand the short term market dislocations while working with our customers to minimize impact to project economics and develop innovative logistics solutions to provide them with price certainty in addition to having a debt free business we added 181 million in cash as part of the ipo as well as another 22 million in liquidity from the sale of our stake in dimension energy in q2 second we shared some logistics cost increases with our customers while largely absorbing impacts in an unprecedented market the additional impact to us in q2 was approximately 10 million with another 12 million to 15 million expected in q3 our transition to alternate logistics methods for international shipment will begin to be realized in q4 providing our customers with price certainty reducing our overall cost structure and eliminating unexpected price escalations during project execution third regarding steel given the tightness of supply in the market we mentioned last quarter that we had contracted for the majority of our anticipated second half steel needs at this point our current contracted and awarded projects for 2021 delivery can more than utilize this capacity and while steel lead time is extended the relationships we have with our expanded supplier base has enabled us to secure the entirety of our new project requirements at the time of project contract as we ve done in the past without the need for additional forward steel contracts fourth we see opportunity for revenue acceleration of our sunpath software product as increased site production is even more important to project economics in today s environment the software can significantly increase overall project profitability and mitigate upfront cost increases helping us and our customers improve margin and finally we continue to remain on track on our cost reduction road map that is expected to yield results in the second half of this year this road map in addition to procurement and volume manufacturing initiatives includes our design to value initiative that identifies opportunities to either reduce materials needed to produce our tracker systems or optimize the design to reduce manufacturing costs we believe this initiative can help to further mitigate unfavorable logistics impacts while commodities and logistics are in the midst of a near term dislocation we believe the long term demand for solar energy and trackers continues to increase supported by many powerful growth drivers including government policy in summary i believe the underlying fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong we re in a growth market with a differentiated offering and seeing rapid customer adoption of our solutions our contracted and awarded orders are increasing at triple digit rates and we are gaining new customers and we have an asset light model with a strong balance sheet we are really executing as a business with one primary negative driver the current logistics environment masking some of that performance we ve developed a solution for that which has been implemented during the fourth quarter and as patrick will discuss we believe we are well positioned to significantly outpace overall market growth again in 2021 with that i ll turn it over to patrick patrick cook chief financial officer thank you tony and good morning everyone i ll provide some additional detail on our second quarter performance and outlook as a reminder our year over year comparisons reflect a significant amount of growth in our personnel and corporate infrastructure ahead of becoming a public company which occurred in the second quarter these items make for year over year comparison a bit less meaningful beginning with results for the second quarter total revenue was 50 1 million which as tony mentioned was better than our target range largely due to production timing between quarters as well as additional logistics recovery costs from customers this represents a decline of approximately 2 compared with the second quarter of 2020 on slightly lower product volume gaap gross loss was 16 1 million up from 1 4 million in the prior year driven primarily by approximately 10 million in increased logistics expense that was not passed along to our customers a strong ramp up in employee count and other overhead expenses to support the company s strong growth trajectory and a 7 2 million increase in stock based compensation associated with the transition to being a public company gaap operating expenses were 59 9 million including 49 million in stock based compensation as a result of the company s ipo the size of the stock expense in the quarter was driven primarily by the accelerated nature of how certain performance based share grants are recognized including a onetime gift of shares from one of our directors to employees on a non gaap basis excluding stock based compensation and certain other expenses operating expenses were 8 3 million better than our guidance range due to timing between quarters this compares to 4 2 million in the year ago quarter with the increase driven primarily by necessary growth in staffing and other public company preparations gaap net loss was 55 8 million or 0 70 per share compared to a net loss of 6 8 million or 0 09 per share in the year ago quarter non gaap net loss which excludes 20 6 million gain from the sale of a minority investment in dimension energy and a 56 2 million impact on stock based compensation ipo related expenses and consulting fees and other noncash items was 17 million or 0 21 per share this was also within our guidance range despite absorbing an additional 10 million in logistics expense in the quarter as a global logistics environment worsened and not all of the costs were shared with our customers as this result compares to non gaap net loss of 5 6 million or 0 08 per share in the year ago quarter during the second quarter we completed our initial public offering proceeds to the company net of fees and expenses and after completion of the stock repurchase described in our s 1 were approximately 181 million also during the quarter we sold our minority investment position in dimension energy and received an additional 22 million or so in cash we believe our strong liquidity position continues to differentiate us in the marketplace gives customers and other stakeholders incremental confidence in our ability to invest in our growth and positions us to weather any short term uncertainties with that let s turn to our outlook as we look ahead we expect to see sequential revenue growth for the remainder of the year the third quarter should see improved revenue however as tony described a continued worsening of the logistics cost will result in incremental impact of between 12 million and 15 million in q3 which will delay improvement in our profitability until the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter due to the timing of contracted project deliveries we are expecting a significant sequential increase in revenue since we have implemented alternative shipping in q4 for the bulk of our deliveries we also expect corresponding improvement in our profitability as we put together our outlook we took several additional factors into consideration including the strong demand for our tracker solutions even in the face of elevated steel logistics and other solar project input costs that are causing solar developers to reevaluate construction time lines or uncontracted projects the additional logistics charge not passed through to our customers i mentioned our use of innovative ways to reduce project logistics costs using alternative shipping methods which we believe will help mitigate some of the margin impacts from increased steel logistics expense with the benefit beginning during the fourth quarter and continuing into 2022 continued implementation of our cost reduction road map that is expected to yield results in the second half of this year further mitigating unfavorable commodity and logistics impacts and the potential for revenue shifts between periods associated with the current size of our company fast paced growth and large size of several projects in the pipeline based on these and other factors including our current backlog and forecast and accounting for direct cost uncertainty for the third quarter we expect revenue of 56 million to 62 million non gaap operating expenses between 8 7 million and 9 7 million and adjusted ebitda loss between 19 7 million and 14 7 million assuming approximately 12 million to 15 million in incremental logistics impact for the fourth quarter we expect to see significant increase in revenue related to the third quarter with the partial implementation of our new logistics method beginning to take effect in the quarter as well as our cost road map reduction initiatives we expect to make significant progress toward profitability on an adjusted ebitda basis for the full year we expect revenue to exceed 310 million this outlook which result in full year revenue growth in excess of 65 which is anticipated to be substantially faster than overall market growth expectations with that i ll turn the call over to the operator and we can take any questions you may have operator questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of pavel molchanov with raymond james your line is now open pavel molchanov raymond james associates analyst thank you for taking the question a lot of your supply chain is in east asia which is currently experiencing the worst covid metrics in that part of the world that we ve seen throughout the pandemic or places like malaysia thailand vietnam and even china can you talk about any manufacturing or supply disruptions beyond the logistics constraints that any of your asia pacific suppliers are currently experiencing tony etnyre president and chief executive officer hi paul thanks for the question i appreciate that this is tony the our logistic our supply chain is global we do in fact have operations in asia and in east asia we also have supply chain locations in india as well as in europe and in the united states and so what we always look to do is to consider the manufacturing capacity implications the timing of projects and then associate our supply chain requirements to those we certainly throughout all of 2021 had to deal with short term factory disruptions in our factories in our contract manufacturing partners and we ve been able to mitigate those and continue to deliver to customers because of the flexibility of that supply chain and our ability to move material from location to location so certainly that is something we have to plan and prepare for and something that we ve demonstrated the ability throughout the last two quarters to deliver to expectations in spite of those short term disruptions to factories pavel molchanov raymond james associates analyst that s helpful let me follow up on steel specifically when we look at benchmark shanghai for example steel futures pricing it looks like you peaked sometime and then perhaps may june time frame and came off about 10 since then are those benchmark prices indicative of your field of materials in terms of steel sourcing tony etnyre president and chief executive officer those are good high level guidance for the trends for overall steel cost and the input cost to the system there are of course always going to be market dynamics that will drive that as well capacity limitations in factories that can drive specific market dynamics but i think however those are good high level guides for us and they are the same metrics that we use in order to prepare our forward looking view pavel molchanov raymond james associates analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of philip shen with roth capital partners your line is now open philip shen roth capital partners analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question first one is you guys referenced innovative logistics solutions that you re embracing and implementing coming up can you talk through what they are and what kind of financial benefit do you see do you think can you quantify that benefit in any way tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thanks for the question phil sure so what we re doing on the logistics front and as we mentioned during the comments at the start of the call we will begin to see those take meaningful effect in the fourth quarter and then more fully into 2022 fundamentally containerized freight is where the tightness in the market exists and where the escalations of pricing exists and so what we have done is using alternate shipping methods like breakbulk shipping methods we ve taken full ship contracts and our team is managing the execution of those in concert with our contract manufacturing suppliers to align deliveries to projects in our forward looking forecast and so what that does is allow us to take greater control over the logistics timing and greater control and certainty of logistics costs based on our higher control of that ship s capacity with respect to the impact to the financials and the impact to costs relative to today we see that to be a significant improvement but still in the long term as you compare it to more historical logistics cost rates we would see it still to be a higher cost structure than what we have expected as a baseline in 2019 and early 2020 philip shen roth capital partners analyst ok thanks tony and then as a follow up here with your q3 guidance i was wondering if you might be able to split out the ratio between service and product revenue we saw i think in q2 that ratio is close to kind of service to the product revenue and i was wondering if you expect to see a similar ratio there and then for that to as you were just mentioning improved in q4 and then in addition to that ratio how much of that do you think you can pass along can you pass along the full amount of logistics impact in q3 or and if not do you think you might be able to pass the full math along by q4 thanks patrick cook chief financial officer yeah in terms of the product and services revenue phil this is patrick i think we would expect to see the same ratio at least in the near term on a go forward basis based on how we recognize revenue and in terms of kind of passing off the overall logistics cost we continue to work with our customers in q3 in order to maintain and pass those costs off to the extent possible but again as tony mentioned the breakbulk shipping allows us for a lot more certainty in those pricing and takes it out a lot of the degrees of degrees of variability out of the process philip shen roth capital partners analyst great ok thanks patrickk and one more if i may here i was wondering if you might be able to give up an update on the samsung project samsung project specifically has the next tranche of opportunity been put out to bid or do you think that might have been delayed as a result of the elevated costs and what s the potential for that project to be delayed as well thanks tony etnyre president and chief executive officer i don t think we should speak to the timing of our customers projects philip we ll continue to execute on the orders we have relative to that particular project and look forward to more opportunities with that particular customer philip shen roth capital partners analyst great tony and as it relates to the next tranche of megawatts there was that ever put out to bid or has that or is that can you not comment on that thanks tony etnyre president and chief executive officer yes i don t think we can comment at this time on that phil philip shen roth capital partners analyst got it thanks for the questions and i ll pass it on thanks tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of maheep mandloi with credit suisse your line is now open maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the questions maybe just one high level on that 15 remark of on projects being dated could you just talk about if you re seeing those delays in your orders and for the u s customers or is this international just want to understand the geographic mix here and also are you seeing any cancellations or hearing about them either for this year or next year tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thanks for the question maheep what i d say is and the comments we made were really around those projects that had not been contracted so projects we see in our pipeline that are uncontracted both in the u s and internationally where developers are making decisions to delay those projects by a quarter or two within our contracted and awarded pipeline we re not seeing a very material movement in those project timing it s more in the projects where a decision has not been made to execute and those projects are seeing some movement as the those developers optimize the timing of the cost structure maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst right and how should we think about the first half of 2022 or second half assuming your current backlog or current awarded backlog extends for the next 12 to 18 months right does that imply like you could see a slowdown in the second half of next year or it s maybe too worthy just given all the moving pieces with the supply chain tony etnyre president and chief executive officer so we re not providing specific guidance in those periods to be clear what we have communicated is a continued increase in our contract and award revenue added over 200 million in contract and award revenue just in the last two months and the figures that we quoted were for deliveries both in the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 so at this point not providing any further guidance on 2022 just beyond what we ve done for full year 2021 maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst i appreciate that and just one last one and i ll just sum back in the q3 the adjusted ebitda guidance for q4 could you just probably talk about does this imply like a breakeven ebitda basis with that margin recovery in q4 or how should we think about that patrick cook chief financial officer thanks for the question maheep from our perspective we re not providing q4 guidance as it relates to ebitda but based on obviously the increased volume the improvement in the cost road map and the design to value initiatives that are on plan as well as implementing partially the breakbulk shipping container logistics methodology we expect to make substantial improvement toward profitability and moving in that direction but we have not given specific guidance maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst all right thanks for taking the questions operator our next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america securities your line is now open julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning team thanks for the opportunity to connect tony etnyre president and chief executive officer good morning julien how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst quite well thank you so much team if you don t mind how much risk do you see to full year 21 that really when you think about what s implied on 4q that gives you 130 million to 135 million against the 310 million full year target if you subtract out your third quarter guidance here how do you think about the certainty there because on the one hand obviously there s a fairly large uptick implied in the 4q but frankly on the other you seem to imply that you ve got pretty good line of sight vis a vis backlog slipping into 4q right so you ve probably got a pretty good confidence level around that can you speak to that a little bit tony etnyre president and chief executive officer sure julien yeah i think the way i think about that is as we stated just in the last two months we ve added over 200 million in contract and awarded revenue that s for both the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 that s alone double the contract and awarded revenue that we entered 2021 with so the sequential growth of the business is very strong where the guidance we provided of 310 million for full year we are very comfortable with the guidance that we provided and very pleased with the work the team has done to continue to grow that contract and awarded basis and look forward to executing you that as we communicate julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right fair enough then can you speak a little bit more to the new customers you talked about a moment ago i mean how is penetration into novel customers rather than just repeat business expanding here if you will right if you think about the sources of that incremental the recent backlog as well prospectively your customer conversations where they stand today tony etnyre president and chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question clearly a strategic objective for us to the business is to continue to grow with the leaders in the market and we communicated on the call today a new customer who is a top five epc we re continuing to get grow strength with the top developers in the country and internationally as our pipeline grows we re continuing to make progress in building that opportunity pipeline with leaders internationally so that s a focus for us we re very pleased to have won an award with a top another top five epc in the u s and that s a strategic business objective for us that we continue to pursue very aggressively julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then lastly if you can can you speak a little bit more to how you re thinking about the ability to pass on some of these higher costs whether it s obviously steel or frankly more importantly logistics in incremental bids here how should we think about your asp trends here i mean it seems like that too implies a fairly nice trend here 4q but more importantly do you think be thereafter tony etnyre president and chief executive officer it s always our objective julien to be transparent with our customers on the input cost increases and the implications of those input cost increases on asps and so as steel price increases as logistics costs increase and as we prepare those proposals for our customers we are transparent about the impacts of those and are communicating those increases as we win those projects as we procure steel again we are procuring steel concurrently with winning the purchase order to narrow that variability in steel cost increases throughout the life of the project logistics environment much more difficult because the containerized logistics and the premium rate and and general rate increases are continuing to increase over time those are more difficult for us to forecast and we ve communicated both in q2 and in q3 what the impacts of those were that s why the transition for us to the breakbulk shipping methodology taking place in q4 and then further into q1 is so important because it provides that cost certainty and limits that cost escalation for us and that s where we re focused as a business we believe that s the best thing we can do to service our customers is to provide certainty and then protect ourselves through driving solutions that guarantee that certainty going forward and that s the approach we ve taken julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it if i can sneak one more in here really quickly here one of your european peers has pivoted to offering multiple solutions here 1p and 2p just in recent months any thoughts perspective as you look at the your customer needs any thoughts on providing a wider array of products akin to the akin to your peer tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thanks julien our r d team our strategic objectives are always to look at what the right solutions are and so we ll continue to pursue those opportunities whether those are organically developed or not we ll continue to look to see what we think we need to provide that are high value racking solutions to the marketplace that s where we think we shine is in the value addition benefit of our products and as we can continue to do that and what the right structure is that we ll continue to deliver on to our customers so we keep an open mind to what the right product set to be and pursue that in both our r d activities nothing to speak to specifically today julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right well best of luck tony etnyre president and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moses sutton with barclays your line is now open moses sutton barclays investment bank analyst hi thanks for the question the 12 million to 15 million incremental impact in 3q for logistics is that incremental to 2q s 10 million or is that an incremental or excess freight impact versus a normal environment such as 3q 20 patrick cook chief financial officer that is the and let me know if i m not answering your question the 12 million to 15 million that we laid out is the incremental logistics impact that s going to be taken in that quarter based on the increased logistics rates moses sutton barclays investment bank analyst sorry off of what base off of the 2q base or off of the prior year patrick cook chief financial officer off of i would say off of the q1 base would be most accurate moses sutton barclays investment bank analyst got it got it and then given the acute impacts from logistics and steel etc any expectation you d need to draw at all on the 100 million line of credit any point in the sort of near term and are you actually able yet or based on covenants do you first need to reach a certain minimum adjusted ebitda patrick cook chief financial officer so based on our forward looking liquidity forecast we have no anticipation of utilizing or drawing down on that that corporate credit facility that s not in our plan to utilize that facility in any capacity we do have the ability today to utilize it it is not sitting there static but we do have the ability to utilize it moses sutton barclays investment bank analyst great great and then from the 478 million contracted and awarded can you give the amount specific to 2022 i know as of last quarter you had noted 167 million in the press release was specific to 22 tony etnyre president and chief executive officer so as we look at the breakout and the guidance we provided for full year 2021 that number in 2022 would be in excess of 280 million moses sutton barclays investment bank analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff osborne with cowen and company your line is now open jeff osborne cowen and company analyst hey good morning i just had two quick ones here you made reference to logistics recovery costs can you just explain accounting wise how that works and then what periods are you making the recoveries from is that 2q flowing through to 3q or is it within the same period patrick cook chief financial officer so in terms of the recovery thanks jeff for the question in terms of the logistics cost recovery and the revenue recognition associated with those we did recoup some of the costs in q2 of 2021 and part of that it would be a modification of the contract which would affect increase revenue slightly for that increased logistics cost jeff osborne cowen and company analyst and do you anticipate any other contract adjustments or as the new shipping methodology takes hold in q4 that any such adjustments and uncertainty with your customers wouldn t be needed that s my understanding but i just want to be clear patrick cook chief financial officer jeff that s accurate i mean i think the contract modifications that we ve put in place are the ones that we re currently expecting to put in place and then with the breakbulk breakbulk shippers we expect that to be more fixed on a go forward basis jeff osborne cowen and company analyst got it my last question is just you mentioned at the top of lengthening lead times i believe on your supplier side can you just remind us what normal lead times are for your raw materials and what they are today tony etnyre president and chief executive officer sure this is tony so our stated lead times from order to delivery in 2019 and early 2020 were in the 8 to 12 week range based on where we would source material and where the project was we re seeing those total lead times closer to 20 to 24 weeks when you add in the incremental lead time for sourcing steel the incremental lead times for are securing the breakbulk vessels and the sailing times for those and so that s been a significant change we ve had to work with our customers to forecast those and make sure that we re aligning with their delivery schedules jeff osborne cowen and company analyst got it that s all i have thank you operator thank you there are no further questions i will now turn the call back to bill michalek for closing remarks tony etnyre president and chief executive officer yes thank you this is tony as i think about the business just to summarize our call we believe the underlying fundamentals are very strong q2 came in from a revenue standpoint above our guidance and in a very difficult environment we re able to manage the rest within the guidance that we provided and we ve added 200 million in contract and order revenue just in the last two months we re guiding to a 65 revenue growth in this year and our orders are growing at a triple digit rate we re adding new customers and we re adding leaders in those new customers we have a strong balance sheet and the cost road map which is fundamental to the profitability improvement of our business is on track the global logistics environment has been very difficult and really pushed our plan for profitability out by quarter the good news is we have solutions in place and those solutions begin in q4 and into 2022 and we re excited about where the business is going so i want to thank you all for joining us today and your interest in ftc look forward to speaking with each of you again next quarter if we don t get a chance to do that before that thank you very much operator duration 43 minutes call participants bill michalek vice president investor relations tony

the washingtons end up staying and things move on from there leave the world behind is a witty atmospheric and compelling drama revolving around these strangers marooned in the woods and issues of race class and climate change it seems to change tack as you read it seduces you into thinking it s one thing then shifts gears and seduces you to think it may be this other thing and then it shifts again and becomes this entirely different thing alam says you think it s a middle class novel of manners a race parody and it becomes this third thing this third thing is disaster but what sort is never spelled out just what is going on in the outside world the picture of people negotiating a crisis they cannot comprehend makes the novel appear somehow prescient although alam wrote it before our pandemic the internet goes down planes don t seem to fly and bird song is stilled there is a mysterious sonic blast horror in some distilled way in a single very brief moment animals and birds a sizeable herd of deer and a surprise flamboyance of pink flamingoes behave oddly and then there are archie s teeth you ll have to read it to find out about them but race remains a subtext even as it seems to disappear as an immediate concern which is hardly surprising given the history of the us the binary of black and white alam says permeates the country s cultural imagination it s on the very land you inhabit there s no evading it and the perspective held by many white americans probably many white australians that it is of no interest to them that it does not implicate them is the very thing that points out the extent that it does credit his experience of racism has been minimal he was born to bangladeshi immigrants rational people i couldn t say i had difficulty in washington dc but hopes he has given a more nuanced idea of the ramifications of racism in his country than simple suffering on one hand and liberty on the other as a father of two boys he can relate to amanda s wary response as natural protectiveness but points out that every cultural product in this country is calculated to teach white women white men everybody to fear black masculinity above all else so it s like a natural response when we discuss her character we move on to the question of how one views fictional characters how important is likeability what really does that have to do with anything there is a kind of conversation that has crept into reading in this culture a desire to rank fictionalised people by their likeability he says i don t know anyone who is likeable i am really hard pressed to think of someone who is just likeable and that s the sum total of their existence people are complicated and strange terrible people may hold the same opinions as you people you love may hold terrible political opinions we should have a fiction that reflects that he clearly worries about fiction and how it is perceived he has described his earlier novels that kind of mother and rich and pretty both narrated from the point of white women as autobiographical it s because you re always hostage to your perspective your sense of the world and no way to verify that anyone else shares that as writer patricia lockwood put it in the london review of books no force on earth will keep a writer s preoccupations out of their fiction you are not necessarily looking for them but you find them every time alam laments what he calls a kind of shallow contemporary morality that prompts fiction writers to write more explicity about themselves because it feels unimpeachable it s a politically charged moment in which turning the gaze inwards allows you to escape the kind of boneheaded censure that seems increasingly prevalent in the culture on a holiday a few years ago alam and family stayed in a house not dissimilar to the one in leave the world behind he decided to use it in fiction he was struggling with another novel but on his way to work as an editor at the new york times he created a new twitter account he loves twitter and forged the ideas sentence by sentence for leave the world behind he eventually left the job and at the end of 2018 took himself off to a hotel for six days to start writing properly in that time he produced 120 pages and went on to finish the complete first draft in three weeks but he points out the relationship between draft and book is like seed and watermelon he had the ending in mind when he settled into that hotel partly it came from his worries as a parent and observing his two sons and their friends it was a hell of a thing he has clay think to not be able to keep your kid safe was this how everyone felt was this finally what it was to be a human and partly it reflected his political frustrations as he completed the book looking at trump and boris johnson and greta thunberg it was very clear to me where the imagination lies and the potential lies it s not really a political allegory but certainly i have much more optimism for the generation of 15 18 year old women than i do about the 80 year olds who actually run this planet he is horrified by what he sees as the contemporary dissonance between information and knowledge between fact and belief so much of our political conversation seems to be designed to be inclusive of a perspective that has utterly disdained objective truth for so long what kind of conversation can you have with someone who says oh vaccines cause autism or bill gates is controlling our minds whatever outlandish things people say becomes acceptable political perspective loading it comes as no surprise that the book has been snapped up by netflix alam loves that denzel washington is to star alongside julia roberts because in the novel amanda tells george washington that he looks like denzel washington what could be more absurd or crazy to think that something i hatched as a joke to myself would take on this other dimension a few months on he s an incredible performer someone i ve been looking at my entire life it s mind boggling there s a delicious moment early on in the novel before the washingtons arrive when amanda nips out to the shop to stock up on essential groceries the way alam lists what she buys and her commentary on those goods serve to skewer the type of people she and clay are it reminded me of the lists of must have labels that run through bret easton ellis savage satire of yuppie culture american pyscho when i put that to him alam pauses for a moment that s so funny i hadn t thought about that that is such a terribly misunderstood book in the contemporary moment so much of that stuff is so funny in american psycho that makes me happy i don t know if we valourise fiction that attempts to function as an anthropology of the current moment i think we like it to sit a little bit which is why i am not sure we have seen a great book a great novel about 9 11 so alam wouldn t admit to having written an anthropology of the covid 19 moment but the unease engendered by leave the world behind certainly reflects what we are all going through rumaan alam appears in melbourne writers festival s digital program which starts on september 6 mwf com

a slew of regulatory actions by beijing caught investors in chinese companies by surprise as authorities increasingly focus on promoting common prosperity analysts said resentment toward tech companies is growing in china especially from small businesses that feel squeezed by digital behemoths two store owners share their experience beijing investors in chinese companies were caught off guard this summer by beijing s actions against homegrown tech giants including comments about overseas listed shares one of the surprises was a mandate in late july that chinese education businesses should restructure and remove investment from foreigners a separate order earlier last month called for app stores to remove chinese ride hailing app didi just days after its massive ipo in new york

is a big and deep change of philosophical thinking on the economic policy what s more important in china s economy said zhu ning professor of finance and deputy dean at the shanghai advanced institute of finance foreign investors need to understand and brace for that in a very big shift zhu pointed to the chinese communist party s political pledge to deliver common prosperity moderate wealth for all in contrast to the country s growing income inequality that contrasts with ensuring that at least some get rich first zhu said anger at big tech firms efforts to achieve this pledge have accelerated in the last 12 months the chinese government shielded alibaba from foreign competition for years until the company grew so large under its founder jack ma that authorities abruptly suspended its affiliate ant group s massive ipo in november and fined alibaba 18 23 billion yuan in april resentment toward tech companies is also growing in china especially from small businesses

requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation by the online food delivery services cnbc translated her mandarin language remarks she initially listed her restaurant on meituan china s dominant food delivery platform in early 2019 and paid a commission fee of 18 she said meituan staff told her that since it was the lowest fee available on the site she could not list on other food delivery sites when the pandemic cut off revenue from in store diners she listed her restaurant on alibaba s ele me food delivery platform that prompted angry calls from meituan staff who said she would have to pay a higher 25 commission fee if she didn t delist from ele me she decided to quit meituan meituan declined to comment on the individual business case the tech giant came under fire last year for

growth target of over 6 for this year which is relatively low compared with the 8 or 8 5 growth that many economists predict for china this window sometime down the road probably will not always be open so the intensity of these policies came in surprisingly high zhang said while he said it would be helpful for authorities to communicate more support for foreign investment and private entrepreneurs overall zhang noted the latest crackdown has targeted sectors such as education which the general public complained about in the past new direction for start ups u s listed chinese education stocks plunged double digits on a single day last month after new policy forced after school tutoring companies to become non profits and banned investment from foreign capital hongye wang china based partner at venture capital firm antler said tutoring companies often took advantage of chinese parents willingness to pay whatever necessary to give their children a good education that meant for two years investors like himself could get a 5 fold return on education companies regardless of the economic environment wang said the purpose of the new government policy is to lower education costs especially for poorer people living in rural areas wang said he added that the state would likely want to improve people s access to medical care as well beijing s scrutiny on big chinese tech companies comes as u s investors and financial regulators are increasingly worried about the regulatory risk for investing in china in late july u s securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler announced that chinese companies need to disclose whether beijing denied them from listing on u s exchanges for chinese start ups perceived uncertainty about their ability to go public could restrict their ability to raise capital said nick xiao vice president at hong kong based asset manager hywin in this context chinese start ups will probably want to sharpen their pitch on why their business model is resiliently scalable and how it creates genuine value both commercial and societal

i probably won t be getting many new electric cars to test drive and the reasons for that may be of interest if you re thinking of buying an electric car or think it s a fine idea that the car industry just promised joe biden to abandon the not electric car so as to make sure you ll have to buy an electric car the last electric car i was sent to test drive arrived on a flatbed truck it returned the same way this being a function of the fact that i live roughly 220 highway miles away from the press pool for my region southeast which is located in the dc area i am located not far from the north carolina border about 30 miles away from roanoke va this distance is easily traversed by any not electric car even a car like the dodge charger hellcat redeye i recently test drove and reviewed it doesn t need to be trailered because even though it only gets 21 miles per gallon on the highway pretty spectacular mileage for a 797 horsepower air conditioned nextel cup stock car it can still travel more than 300 miles before it runs out of range and more relevant the driver who delivers it can fill it up in a few minutes at the gas station just down the road before he drops it off at my place leaving it ready for me to drive an electric car even one that can make the 220 mile trip on a single charge and not many can will be close to discharged when it arrives at my place there are as yet no joe biden fast charging stations within 30 miles of me and aren t likely to be either given the logistics and the expense even though uncle joe and the republicans have committed to making us pay for as many of them as can be built but this will take time as well as money electric fast chargers are not like gas stations which can be built anywhere economically and easily because all you have to do is bury some tanks and then fill them up occasionally via tanker trucks which easily and economically traverse the distance between the refinery fuel depot and the station with fast chargers you need wiring lots of very heavy cabling to physically connect the fast charger to the source of the electricity which must be transmitted directly and continuously unless you have a way to generate the enormous current needed on site solar panels don t cut it for that not unless you have a lot of them as in fields of them this is hard to fit on a lot the size of a typical gas station so absent mr fusion and you cannot store electricity in underground tanks and then pump it into batteries so the fast chargers promised by joe and the democrats some of whom identify as republicans will have to be located close enough to the heavy cabling that delivers the power necessary to fast charge 400 800 volt electric car battery packs as in plural as in urban as in where the infrastructure as joe and the republicans like to say exists it doesn t out in the sticks as for plural it is one thing to fast charge one electric car battery pack it is another thing to fast charge several of them at once as multiple not electric cars are refueled much faster at gas stations it is no great technological challenge to pump fuel into a half dozen vehicles at the same time pumping electricity into a half dozen evs at once is read the whole article the best of eric peters

the last thing america needs is a 1 2 trillion washington infrastructure boondoggle festooned with pork waste and the usurpation of virtually every other institution s proper function that is capital expenditures that properly are the business of the private sector utilities train passengers airport users motorists state and local taxpayers and everyone else except the federal government for instance the bill contains 77 billion for renewing the electric power grid including thousands of miles of new high efficiency transmission lines but why can t utilities and their rate payers handle those investments rather than future taxpayers who will have to service the federal debt as it happens annual constant dollar spending by major u s electric utilities on the power transmission system has increased from 9 1 billion 2019 dollars in 2000 to 40 0 billion in 2019 that s a not too shabby 8 1 annual growth rate or approximately 4x the actual growth of real gdp during the period of course the above is only for the high voltage long distance transmission connecting power plants to the local distribution grid the latter in turn carries the electricity to homes and businesses and includes station equipment that lowers the voltage neighborhood power lines poles and towers line transformers meters that measure customer electricity use etc constant dollar spending for the capital and o m costs of the distribution system was 57 4 billion in 2019 which again was no starvation budget as it represented a 2 5 real growth rate since the year 2000 all told major us utilities are now spending 100 billion per year on transmission and distribution systems since the 4 2 real growth rate for these purposes over the past two decades represents more than twice the growth rate of real gdp it might be wondered what s not to like why do the taxpayers need to top up what the ratepayers are already properly absorbing as the actual users of these systems indeed when you look at total capital spending by us electric utilities including for power plants annual spending now stands at about 132 billion up from just 60 billion in 2006 so what s at issue is not investment neglect by the utilities and their customers or claims of dilapidated power lines and plants but the wrong kind of investment in the eyes of the green new deal socialists who rule the roost in the washington dem party that is to say these folks insist the current co2 concentrations in the atmosphere of 0 040 are too high and demand that they be rolled back to what they claim to be the pre industrial level of 0 027 never mind of course that scientist estimate that co2 levels were 10 times higher than today during the cambrian era 500 million years ago when today s fossil fuels were being grown above ground only to be buried and transformed into hydrocarbons by time pressure and heat nor apparently should any weight be given to the views of scientist who are not on government grants or payrolls who believe that atmospheric carbon dioxide level fluctuations over long stretches of time are a consequence of underlying natural cycles of earth temperature change and ice pack levels not their cause in any event the reason there is 73 billion for the electric grid is because owing to ohm s law and other physical properties of electrical power about 69 trillion btus are lost each year in power transmission and distribution and this loss can be reduced marginally if you throw enough capital and technology at the problem in the form of super conducting transmission lines and more efficient switching and distribution equipment another word for such capital substitution of course is far higher consumer power bills and that s essentially the reason why state utility rate commissions have not gone full retard green it not for lack of financial resources but because when you put a monthly surcharge on consumer electricity bills for the purposes of obtaining infinitesimal and unnecessary reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations the american public overwhelming says no dice likewise the bill would invest 17 billion in port infrastructure and 25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports and promote electrification and other low carbon technologies yet again why are federal taxpayers footing the bill not airport users in the form of the ticket tax and port users in the form of charges by port authorities for services rendered the answer is that they already are between 2013 and 2017 for example airport infrastructure spending averaged about 14 billion per year of which 3 1 billion came from federal ticket taxes 3 2 billion from the airport improvement grant program funded by fuel taxes and another 7 7 billion from airport imposed landing fees concessions and other passenger levies to be sure airlines local politicians civic boosters and chambers of commerce always want more such infrastructure investment but what s the sweat the industry says it needs an average of 22 billion per year over 2019 2023 so let them raise the ticket tax fuel levies lending fees and concession off takes at the end of the day passengers would pay these user fees as they should nor would it be an undue burden compared to the alternative of free money from washington which will someday be paid with compound interest by unknowing taxpayers born and unborn indeed during the last full year of normal airline traffic in 2019 the us air traffic system generated 763 billion passenger miles so even if the whole 22 billion industry asked is actually required it would amount to just 2 9 cents per passenger mile accordingly a 100 user paid airport infrastructure policy would levy a 21 charge on tickets between new york and chicago and 71 on ticket between new york and la that s not the end of the world and is far far superior to federal pork then again what is lurking in this extra 5 billion per year for five years airport infrastructure subvention is a not very hidden dollop of green new deal cash to promote de carbonization that neither the airlines the airport authorities the city fathers or passengers wish to pay even though bernie and aoc are demanding it in the case of the 17 billion for ports the green new deal backdoor is blatantly obvious us ports are booming with business like never before and can charge customers damn well whatever they please to defray both operating costs and any capital spending projects needed nice to have or just plain trophy features to boost local pride as is well known shippers are already paying more than 5x the rates of just one year ago on china to la routes with similar escalations at other ports accordingly the idea that shippers can t pay for needed local port infrastructure is preposterous on its face what they are not keen about paying undoubtedly is for greening the ports in a manner that satisfies the washington alternative energy lobby the bill would also invest 66 billion in passenger and freight rail and a further 39 billion to modernize public transit the funds would purportedly eliminate amtrak s maintenance backlog modernize the northeast corridor line and bring rail service to areas outside the northeast and mid atlantic regions included in the package is 12 billion in partnership grants for intercity rail service including high speed rail needless to say there are no greater economic white elephants in america today than the godforsaken amtrak rail system and the perennially loss making urban transit systems they shouldn t be given one additional dime on top of the 20 billion already being appropriated each year for amtrak and mass transit that is to say over the 5 year horizon of the bill existing appropriations would total about 100 billion so what the bipartisan infrastructure bill would do is more than double the waste to 205 billion over the next half decade why you guessed it these utterly inefficient modes of moving people within cities and between cities are purportedly greener than automobiles and airplanes so notch up another taxpayer contribution to the green new deal this is getting monotonous of course but it does beg the question what in god s name are 19 republicans doing shilling for a green new deal that even sleepy joe never endorsed during the campaign and which is the handiwork of the hard core socialist left that these dudes speechify against every time they find its necessary to go back home to show their faces to the voters the short answer is that by and large these 19 mostly rino republican in name only senators have been on the public teat for so long they have long ago lost any principles of federalism small government fiscal rectitude and the lead role of private free enterprise they may have once upon a time possessed for instance there is actually 65 billion in the bill for improving the nation s broadband infrastructure which surely warrants a wtf response the cable and telecom industries are rolling in so much excess cash flow that they can afford to spend tens of billions every quarter on dividends and stock buybacks yet these republican geniuses apparently now agree that its copacetic for the taxpayers to top up the massive capex budgets already being implemented by these quasi utilities for want of doubt it turns out that the 19 gop senators have spent a combined 628 years on the public teat and the very most senior among them is senator charles grassley who your editor first saw shuffling around the us house floor when he worked on capitol hill 45 years ago at which point chuck grassley had already been on the public payroll for 26 years thus we have the distilled wisdom of senator grassley who spent 16 years in the iowa house of reps 1959 1975 six years in the us house 1975 1981 and 40 year in the us senate 1981 2021 there is no mileage tax or amnesty in the bipartisan senate infrastructure bill it doesn t raise taxes we kept those things out my focus is investing in infrastructure for iowa s future roads bridges locks dams airports rural broadband etc there you have it grassley represents a form of degenerate republicanism evolved over 62 years on the public payroll which is about as lame as it gets never support a tax never cut a spending program and never miss an an opportunity to bring the pork back home in this case his iowa voters should be paying local taxes not looking to washington to fix the hundreds of one horse bridges of madison county that dot the state and if they want faster internet they should pay for it on their cable bills but even principles that basic are too much for washington lifers like grassley to grasp accordingly the nation s rotten fiscal estate is essentially beyond redemption the democrats are now and always have been aggressive statists whether employing the explicit rhetoric of socialism or not and now they have a republican opposition that is so politically and intellectually bankrupt that it can t get out of its own way then again perhaps one day voters will understand that when you are on the public teat for decades your sell by date has already long passed years on the public payroll among the 19 gop senators who gave sleepy joe his green new deal boondoggle grassley 62 years mcconnell 54 years

reading about the un s climate change report and looking at some of photos of newly homeless families from wildfires and flooding in greece turkey albania germany and california in recent days could be enough to lead many people to think that our planet is beyond hope but as much as the report from the un intergovernmental panel on climate change is bleak and depressing there is also a call to arms for if urgent and large scale changes are made then some of the most severe impacts can be avoided and many will be reversible when climate change greta thunberg said two years ago i don t want you to be hopeful i want you to panic maybe now the time has come investors certainly have seemed more hopeful that they can do their bit in the past year and a half with a surge in interest in sustainability focused and environmental social and governance funds inflows into ethical funds surged to a record 10bn in 2020 from 3bn the year before according to investment association data while this week data from calastone showed esg funds accounted for 90 of inflows in the past month but even among investors who were already giving over a large part of their savings and investments to esg there must have been a sizeable number for whom the report came as a depressingly crushing reminder that not enough is being done and governments are not moving fast enough for those people who aren t ready to go and join extinction rebellion quite yet is there more they as private investors can do in short yes plenty 1 if you were to do just one thing probably the single biggest impact any investors could make is switching their pension savings to more green investments what s more thanks to the proliferation of green funds in recent years in 2021 it is quite possible to have most or all of your portfolio in sustainable and positive impact funds with enough variety to provide tilts towards growth and income as well as portfolio diversification it s easy to forget that your workplace pension is invested in the market mainly because a default fund is selected for you and often people forget to revisit this selection says laura suter head of personal finance at aj bell most pensions will have at least one ethical option and if that s not up to scratch you can always consider transferring your pension somewhere else when you move jobs myron jobson personal finance campaigner at interactive investor agrees adding that while the challenge of climate change may be daunting how you invest is one of the easier steps you can take to contribute to the fight several fund managers offer a range of sustainable quick start funds for beginner investors for example rathbone greenbank offers a range of multi asset sustainable portfolios ranked by four levels of risk the bmo sustainable universal map range offers three for different risk appetites while others doing similar include royal london asset management but for those that are already past this point there is still more you can do 2 rethink how you invest if step one was to move your savings to more sustainability focused funds the un climate report might have also triggered many people to fundamentally rethink what it is they want across their savings and investments for example is growth still your priority or are other issues more important to you now thanks to the deepening and widening of esg funds in the past few years investing in green funds no longer means you are necessarily accepting second best in terms of fund performance or returns if anything the market is still underappreciating the long term risks and opportunities of climate change says ben mcewan climate active analyst at sarasin partners the market is really only starting to price this stuff and it will be forced to price it further and therefore you will generate in our view better returns if you think about these dimensions now with a green tinged fund available across most asset classes the ardent ethical investor could turn their whole portfolio green but suter cautions about ending up with too much of your portfolio overlapping or focused on a handful of themes such as green energy or wind power this may require more research than an investor might normally be used to but it becomes more important when not only do you want your fund manager to make you money but also that they are trying to do the right thing as you see it your broker or investment platform is likely to provide a long list of ethical funds some of them break these down into sections to help match ethical investors with solutions that align to their morals part of the challenge here is the subjective concept of what constitutes green and you may have higher priorities for the different elements be they e s or g while avoiding traditional sin stocks like oil tobacco and arms firms has been enough for the ethical investor in the past couple of decades for many people that is no longer enough but as jobson warns research is important and investors should not take all investments labelled green or sustainable for investors looking to green their portfolio there is no substitute for doing the legwork themselves this means looking under the bonnet of every product purporting green credentials to ensure compatibility to make sure they re not greenwashing and are walking the walk all esg related funds will have factsheets explaining their investment policies the breakdown of the portfolio between different subsectors you can also check a fund s voting record and if they ve not been made public you can ask for them asset managers should be proud of their records with some becoming increasingly energetic and vocal critics of slovenly sustainability practices such is legal general which in the latest agm season voted against 130 companies over their climate change policies but an example of why research is necessary is because you may feel that a company with a terrible 10 year record for polluting rivers like pennon should not be in the portfolio of a supposedly environmental fund like those run by impax asset management aim ipx fra lw4 or you might think as the firm says that pollution events are one of the factors considered in the assessment of their environmental performance 3 vote green this brings us to another relatively easy step but one that most investors sadly have let slide especially for those who feel driven to do more voting at agms is a must for every company where you invest voting is probably the most powerful tool in an investor s armoury to catalyse change says mcewen one investor on their own may not feel powerful but there are plenty more people out there like you putting your money in the right investment fund also creates a strong collective vote there s definitely a benefit in sort of the collectivism of investing with an asset manager that has a voice adds mcewen but you have to be wary that that manager is serious about using its voice not only unilaterally engaging with the company but also bilaterally engaging with other investor groups and voting on an annual general meeting on the investor s behalf asset managers that are serious about expediting the transition to net zero have to do all three 4 get active voting is just the first step towards becoming a more active investor as an investor it is possible to have a powerful impact says katarina hammar head of active ownership at nordea asset management as the urgency of the climate issue is mounting it is vital for all investors to take action to ensure future generations will not see their prospects for a good life ruined by the actions of today one way of doing this is through corporate engagement which she says is an incredibly powerful tool to bring about a real world impact investors can either do this individually or work with other asset managers to potentially have more of an influence huw davies a finance adviser at the make my money matter campaign says we encourage people who care about the impact of their pension to contact their scheme and ask what their pension invests in and ask for them to commit to robust net zero targets if you think your pension fund or investment funds are not doing enough then let them know too and if you want to step it up a level you might take inspiration from the recent court victory for seven activist groups to challenge royal dutch shell nyse rds a s climate strategy 5 investing for impact over and above avoiding the bad guys and backing the good guys investors wanting to make a positive difference with their money might consider what s called an impact fund which aim to have a positive measurable impact on society and the environment as james penny uk chief investment officer at tam asset management notes funds focusing on impact investing have been blazing a trail into measuring and delivering the real impact on the investors they invest into right down to specific numbers of school books being delivered trees being planted green infrastructure installed even the tonnage of carbon being taken out of the atmosphere clients can receive detailed reports about exactly how their investments are making a difference to industries and livelihoods the green revolution continues to deepen and with it investors are given more and more tools to empower them to deliver real change with each pound they invest penny says one such impact specialist is uk based wheb asset management which focused on sustainability via their one and only fund the wheb sustainability fund the team invest based on nine sustainable investment themes ranging from resource efficiency and sustainable transport to education and wellbeing every investment into the fund makes a positive difference says dominic rowles investment analyst at hargreaves lansdown with 10 000 invested into the fund in 2020 helping generate 2 mwh of renewable energy avoid 3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions treat 27 000 litres of waste water for reuse recycle or recover a ton of waste material plus other investments in tertiary education and healthcare treatment this is the only fund managed by the wheb team meaning they re totally dedicated to it and focused on its success however the portfolio looks very different to the broader global stock market so we expect it to perform differently too adds rowles other funds take great pains to ensure their portfolio companies walk the walk including the rathbone greenbank global sustainability fund where a dedicated research team filters out those that are not as green as they might wish to seem before a meeting with the company to drill down further into their sustainability credentials m g investments has also launched a range of impact funds in the past year where the target is for a measurable positive impact for people and the planet as well as long term financial returns the range includes the m g climate solutions fund that invests entirely in green technology clean energy and the circular economy though it s not been going for a year yet investment trusts also offer asset specialisation and income from the greencoat uk wind plc lse ukw fra 3gc and its wind powered peers to the sun charged subsector where nextenergy solar fund lse nesf ltd and bluefield solar income fund lse bsif ltd ply their trade and in the last couple of years trusts have been launched to focus on other technologies such as gresham house energy storage fund plc lse grid as well as more diverse environment focused investment trusts such as impax environmental markets lse iem 6 passive aggressive while many investors see esg investing as something just for the active portion of their portfolio this means that could be passively backing companies that are climate negative with the market for ethical trackers and exchange traded funds etfs having ballooned in recent years there s many ethical options now available more specialised tracker funds can provide purer exposure to specific themes investors may want to get behind says suter she highlights the ishares global clean energy etf while clearly the more specialised the theme the less diversified the portfolio and the more risk investors must be willing to accept she adds the passive sector also has impact funds including the iclima global decarbonisation enablers ucits etf which claims to be the world s first exchange traded fund etf to focus specifically on companies that enable co2 avoidance it tracks the iclima global decarbonisation enablers index which at the latest rebalancing had over 160 companies gabriela herculano ceo of iclima earth which developed the index says the best way to reduce co2e in the atmosphere is to find lower emission alternatives to products and services thereby avoiding emission and in order for the world to reach net zero by 2050 and have a chance of limiting global warming the etf provides exposure to companies across subsectors including green energy green transportation water and waste improvements decarbonisation enabling solutions and sustainable products that will reduce and avoid carbon emissions 7 passive activist as mentioned above one effect of investing in the right fund is that you can get other people to do your activism for you and in a confluence of the various esg angles there is also a theme that might almost be called passive activist impact investing environmental activist fund engine no 1 has only been going a short while but has already achieved big things including getting three directors appointed to the board of exxon mobil leading to the largest us oil company to focus more of its future investment on alternative energy sources than fossil fuel exploration engine no1 s founders believes esg engagement on a corporate level benefits a company s bottom line as well as impacting positively on its environment the hedge fund also launched an etf engine no 1 transform 500 etf bats vote in june create value by driving positive impact at the largest 500 companies in the us activist investment platform tulipshare also launched last month with a mission to unify individuals investing power with other investors shares to make their voices heard from as little as 1 founder antoine argouges says the platform s goal is to give a voice to the everyday individual to encourage retail investors to rethink their investment strategies based in the uk the platform s initial causes are focused on big us names including fighting for workers rights at amazon plastic pollution at coca cola and right to repair issues at apple but the plan is to broaden the approach over time 8 even cash all investors have a portion of their portfolio in cash to varying degrees there will soon be a new way for uk investors to use that cash for positive environmental impact with the government s proposed launch of green bonds later this year with a product launched via the national savings investments brand savers money will be used to fund green government projects what s for green funds has soared in recent years as demand from investors has increased this means that you could feasibly ensure all of your portfolio has a green tilt rather than just a portion of it
part one part two part three part four part five they would like us to go away but you cannot wipe almost 12 000 people off the map bob kenney striking air traffic controller to the bulletin october 26 1981 reagan has not only won the battle he s won the whole goddamned war uaw president douglass fraser the patco workers were thrown into the ranks of the unemployed in the midst of the worst social crisis since the great depression the first two years of the reagan administration marked a period of carnage for the working class fed chairman paul volcker s interest rate shock therapy created a vortex in the industrial economy which by 1982 sucked down factories and farms cities and towns and entire regions by december 1981 there were 10 7 million officially unemployed or 8 9 percent of the workforce in 1982 the unemployment rate rose to 10 7 percent there were 2 696 mass layoffs or plant closings resulting in the loss of more than 1 287 000 jobs what became of the hundreds of thousands of workers who were laid off a flood of human misery to which the patco workers contributed only one tiny stream very few systematic studies have ever been done in one rare exception a 1982 cornell university study analyzed the status of 4 700 workers laid off at the mahwah new jersey ford plant in 1980 half of the hourly workers were still unemployed two years later among those over the age of 40 61 percent were without work among women 72 percent were jobless prior to the shutdown median income was 21 600 two years later it was less than half that 10 400 the misery of mass layoffs was augmented by the most savage class war budgets in modern history reagan s 1981 and 1982 budgets took a torch to programs that aided the most vulnerable sections of the working class the unemployed the poor the elderly children the handicapped vietnam veterans even retired miners suffering from black lung disease at the same time the budgets provided shamelessly massive tax cuts to the rich and the corporations and drastically increased military spending these naked class war policies were aided and abetted by the democratic party which in both years provided the dozens of votes necessary to ensure their passage the stated aim of creating mass unemployment was to drive down the cost of labor one by one the trade unions fell into line the united auto workers uaw the united steelworkers usw the teamsters the united rubber workers the american federation of teachers aft and the national education association nea and many others reopening contracts and imposing concessions on rank and file workers the spirited patco contingent at labor day in detroit 1981 the concessions contracts were justified by claiming they would maintain the competitiveness of american business or the solvency of the various levels of government accept these cuts the unions told workers or you will lose your jobs but the workers lost their jobs anyway between 1981 and 1982 the afl cio hemorrhaged 739 000 members overwhelmingly due to layoffs the catastrophic outcome for workers resulting from the patco defeat is perhaps most graphically illustrated by the fate of the workers in the air transportation industry whose unions crossed patco picket lines to suffocate the militant struggle in early august 1981 with the patco strike already on airline industry executives met with transportation secretary drew lewis and urged the reagan administration to adopt a long term flight schedule even if that means continuing limits for several months when asked by a reporter if the airlines would not actually profit from the strike and reduced flights there were broad grins in the room and lewis smirked as one historian concluded he strike permitted many carriers to take initiatives that would have been impossible without the strike the carriers took advantage to consolidate and downsize eliminating routes mothballing airplanes and reducing staffing on flights and in terminals the kennedy carter airline deregulation of 1978 initiated a vast reorganization of the industry old airlines were wiped out absorbed by rivals or thrust into bankruptcy including eastern twa braniff pan american continental republic and western the immediate period of the patco strike was the worst ever for the airline industry which racked up 137 million in red ink in 1980 and 201 million more in the first quarter of 1981 airlines beginning with eastern and braniff imposed massive wage cuts on union workers with the threat of layoffs if they resisted on july 30 just four days before the patco strike began the air line pilots association accepted 75 million in cuts these included a reduction to two man crews in boeing 737s and an increase in cockpit hours from 62 to between 81 and 85 per month meanwhile the president of the air line employees association victor herbert took home 98 585 in 1982 the president of the air line pilots association alpa henry duffy pocketed 246 557 in 1983 and another 74 737 in expenses making him the highest paid union bureaucrat in america his first vice president g a pryde took home 130 818 the failure of the airline industry unions to defend patco cost their own workers dearly but this was not the result of a mistaken policy the airline unions like all unions in the 1980s were busy decoupling themselves from the workers they nominally represented securing new sources of wealth and revenue in every instance the air industry unions traded away wage and benefit cuts in return for new streams of revenue controlled by the union bureaucracy pan american airlines in 1981 sold 11 million shares of stock amounting to 13 percent ownership in a union run esop employee stock ownership program it developed a whole series of joint labor management entities but in 1985 management reneged on promised wage increases in 1983 the threat of bankruptcy induced crisis negotiations with the five unions at western airlines the unions gave massive concessions and agreed to the scrapping of work rules in return they received four seats on the board of the doomed airline as well as profit sharing and stock ownership the latter was based on a formula according to which wage cuts were paid back at half their value in the form of company stock in this way western employees gained 32 percent of the moribund airline s stock the growing role of unions in out and out ownership took a major step forward in 1985 when alpa the international association of machinists iam and the transport workers union twu paved the way for the takeover of twa by corporate raider carl icahn the unions traded wage concessions of 200 million per year for 20 percent of twa common stock and theoretically a 20 percent share of profits for three years as well as other stock options and a share of icahn s profits in the event of a sale of the airline the unions success was its ability to barter wages and working condition concessions required to attract outside capital as one analysis put it and on it went in 1993 northwest airlines negotiated 365 million in pay cuts for pilots over three years in exchange for company stock and three seats on the corporate board in 1994 united airlines traded 55 percent ownership to employees in return for a 16 percent wage cut for pilots a 10 percent cut for machinists and a no strike pledge for six years the unions also got three members on the company s board of directors perhaps the most devastating defeat of all was that suffered by the workers at eastern airlines in december 1983 three unions representing 37 500 employees mechanics flight attendants and pilots agreed to 367 million in wage cuts ranging from 18 to 22 percent in exchange for 25 percent of company stock and seats for four union officials on the corporate board financial difficulties nonetheless mounted and in 1985 alpa agreed to a 20 percent wage cut as well as a two tier pay system eastern was still sold off to the asset stripper frank lorenzo and texas air which had already absorbed continental imposing massive wage concessions of 50 percent there lorenzo immediately began to hive off parts of eastern to his low cost continental and texas air operations the iam pleaded with lorenzo in negotiations for months before authorizing a strike in 1989 and for the first time in the 1980s alpa refused to cross picket lines but the afl cio sabotaged this strike too mustering only a demoralizing pr campaign called fairness at eastern to deal with the strike lorenzo simply declared bankruptcy the courts and the bush administration backed the corporation and the union workers lost not only their jobs but also their pensions and benefits one desperate eastern employee wrote her georgia congressman in 1991 our unemployment checks will stop in july many of us are left without health or life insurance and by now are very close to losing our homes many of us are in the 50s age group and are helplessly watching everything we have worked so long and hard for slowly disintegrate before our eyes patco controllers and supporters picket at the oakland california airport as for the patco air traffic controllers the american ruling class never forgave them for the determined stand they took against the attacks of the reagan administration on december 23 1982 just two days before christmas and one year after the strike s total defeat a federal judge seized 4 million in charitable donations supporting the needy families of the blackballed controllers these were donations mailed and wired to the strikers from workers in the us and internationally the judge admitted that the charity fund was not the property of the bankrupt and decertified patco union and instead belonged to individual former members of the union he nonetheless declared that this small amount of money had to be turned over to the airlines to permit the return of the trust monies to members of the union that have acted in clear defiance of established law would be to reward patco members for their illegal action judge roger m whelan ruled by 1986 one third of patco members earned so little that their families qualified for food stamps that year republican congressman guy molinari introduced a modest measure that would have allowed 1 000 of the 12 000 blackballed patco workers to apply for jobs as faa air traffic controllers the measure was defeated by the democratic party controlled house of representatives by a margin of 226 193 the ban on the rehiring of patco strikers was officially lifted by the clinton administration only in 1993 this turned out to be a final act of humiliation within one year about 40 percent of the blackballed controllers reapplied for work with the faa however they found that their applications were processed without preference and the very next year 1994 saw the faa impose a systematic hiring freeze only 37 of the patco controllers were rehired the union that replaced patco in the airline industry the national air traffic controllers association natca could never claim the fiction of being a free trade union it was an organization created and controlled by the state and populated with strikebreakers from its inception it promised that it would never carry out an illegal strike as patco had in other words it would never authorize a strike at all the working conditions of air traffic controllers only worsened from 1981 until 1985 the volume of air traffic increased from 66 7 million flights to 71 4 million flights in the same period the number of full performance level fpl air traffic controllers fell from 13 205 to 8 315 by 1988 in spite of increasing flight volumes there were still far fewer fpl controllers than in 1981 only 8 904 in all the consequences of this severe understaffing were tragically revealed in 2006 in lexington kentucky when a comair flight crashed after attempting to take off from the wrong runway killing all 47 passengers and two of the three member crew after correctly giving the plane its runway assignment the lone air traffic controller on duty had proceeded to other tasks as required by faa protocol around the time of the 30th anniversary of the patco strike in april of 2011 a scandal was whipped up by the media over incidents of air traffic controllers falling asleep on the job president obama who seemed oblivious of the patco strike s anniversary was quick to join in the hypocritical scapegoating of the controllers the individuals who are falling asleep on the job that s unacceptable obama said in his trademark finger wagging style the fact is when you re responsible for the lives and safety of people up in the air you better do your job so there s an element of individual responsibility that has to be dealt with the most significant case occurred on march 23 2011 when american airlines flight 1012 from miami and united airlines flight 628 from chicago each requested permission to land at ronald reagan washington national airport after repeated attempts to signal the control tower the flights were forced to land unassisted no one was hurt among the some 165 passengers and crew on the two flights after this incident came to public attention it was revealed that there had been a number of other cases of controllers dozing off over the previous year obama did not consider the fact that the controllers might have been overworked but a contemporary study by the national transportation safety board ntsb found that 61 percent of air traffic controllers had work schedules that opposed normal sleep wake patterns one media account at the time summarized a typical week in the life of an air traffic controller a schedule may look like this the first day a 3 pm shift start the second day a 2 pm start the third day 7 am the fourth day 6 am the worker may return to work a fifth shift at 10 pm on the fourth day to get a longer weekend the board said the understaffing has continued to the present the natca which functions primarily as a lobbying organization reports severe staff shortages in american air control towers in 2019 it said that the professional category of certified professional controller cpc was at a thirty year low the faa for its part says that 14 000 air traffic controllers are at work in the us still less than in 1981 the difficulty of learning the profession means that many students never complete faa academy training or quit after a short period on the job the natca reports that controllers at the most critically understaffed facilities are forced to work mandatory overtime in order to maintain current capacity conclusion the patco strike announced the definitive end of the period of relative class compromise and social reform that had prevailed in the us and other advanced industrial countries since the end of world war ii from that moment on the capitalist class has carried out a relentless offensive to roll back the gains the working class realized over decades of struggle as the workers league political committee explained just 10 days into the patco strike in a statement published in the bulletin titled the patco strike a warning to the working class the strike by 13 000 members of the professional air traffic controllers organization is a historical turning point for the struggle of the working class in the united states and internationally it is the first major political confrontation between the american working class and the government after decades in which the class struggle in america was either denied entirely or minimized in which the american worker was depicted as having become the middle class in which america was held up as the great exception in a world in revolutionary ferment the patco strike has exploded all these myths the air controllers strike has demonstrated that underneath the appearance of political stability and conservatism the most insoluble social and economic contradictions of any capitalist country have been building up at the same time the mask of democracy and government of the people by the people and for the people is being stripped off and the capitalist state is revealing itself for what it is an instrument of oppression of the masses in the interests of a tiny handful of billionaires workers are thrown in jail bound hand and foot with chains their union is decertified for doing what 95 percent of the members voted to do punitive fines have been levied aimed at confiscating all the assets of the union and handing them over to the government or the airlines fbi agents and federal marshals monitor picket lines and visit workers in their homes to intimidate them and their families one political conclusion above all must be drawn from the patco strike far from being an aberration or exception it reveals the real essence of class relations in the united states the ruling class is attacking all the basic rights of workers social services jobs safety regulations living standards and now the right to union organization and calling upon the repressive powers and violence of the capitalist state to enforce these attacks the ruling class relies on the trade union bureaucrats to sabotage the fight of the working class against the government this sabotage takes the form not only of open strikebreaking as in the air traffic controllers struggle but most of all keeping the working class politically disenfranchised by supporting the capitalist two party system the unions and all the old nationally based organizations of the working class have played the critical role in this social retrogression the afl cio s complicity with the reagan administration and its rejection of popular rank and file demands for broadening the patco struggle set the pattern for all the us labor struggles in the 1980s and 1990s in case after case the unions isolated betrayed and helped defeat strikes in spite of bitter working class resistance the same process unfolded all over the world perhaps most similarly in the united kingdom where in 1985 the trades union congress tuc looked on as prime minister margaret thatcher crushed the coalminers setting the stage for the destruction of industries and working class living standards everywhere the old labor and social democratic parties completely embraced the demands of the financiers and helped line the pockets of the rich by impoverishing workers in africa latin america and asia the old national liberation movements followed the same path scrapping import substitution plans and nationalized industry and competing with each other over who could provide imperialism with the cheapest labor and the most lucrative natural resources of their people the most far reaching example of this sea change took place in the soviet union as leon trotsky had warned more than 50 years earlier the stalinist bureaucracy in the end dismantled the property relations established by the october 1917 revolution converting itself into a new capitalist ruling class the tie that binds these processes is the transformation of nationally based labor bureaucracies and political parties from formations that within narrow and historically defined limits defended the interests of workers into open instruments of class oppression underlying this in turn was the unprecedented global integration of production which intensified the contradiction between the global economy and the nation state and rendered all nationalist programs impotent and reactionary in the us the official unions consciously responded to the decline in the world economic position of american capitalism by offering their services to the corporate financial elite collaborating in the drive to make american corporations globally competitive at the direct expense of the jobs wages and working conditions of us workers by the beginning of the 1990s the unions could no longer be considered in any genuine way to be workers organizations even in a limited defensive sense drawing out the implications of the collapse of the trade unions and the final counterrevolutionary betrayal by the soviet bureaucracy the workers league and its co thinkers in the international committee of the fourth international icfi made the decision in the 1990s to transform their organizations from leagues to parties it was the turn of the world trotskyist movement the international committee of the fourth international to fight directly for the leadership of the working class drawing on the lessons of history and an objective analysis of the actual position of the unions in global political economy the icfi was able to foresee that a new movement of the working class would emerge and that it would of necessity come into conflict with the union apparatuses wherever they still existed the initial form this would take the icfi also predicted would be a rank and file rebellion in april of 2021 the international committee of the fourth international launched the initiative for the international workers alliance of rank and file committees the iwa rfc it wrote will work to develop the framework for new forms of independent democratic and militant rank and file organizations of workers in factories schools and workplaces on an international scale the working class is ready to fight but it is shackled by reactionary bureaucratic organizations that suppress every expression of resistance the formation of the iwa rfc has already been vindicated in the course of struggle most notably by the new river valley strike of volvo trucks workers 40 years after patco workers in dublin virginia formed a rank and file committee that defeated three contracts and carried forward two strikes the workers turned to the socialist equality party and the world socialist web site for support they won backing from auto workers throughout the us and internationally including powerful expressions of solidarity from belgian volvo workers the uaw and volvo found a reprieve through the expedient of some combination of ballot fraud and blackmail in a second vote on the already rejected third contract but this is a reprieve only the crisis of capitalism is much more powerful than the dirty tricks of the union bureaucracy and its corporate bedfellows the strike against volvo has shown a way forward along the path of independent working class struggle and international solidarity as the icfi wrote in its statement forward to the international workers alliance of rank and file committees the fight against the pandemic and against war inequality exploitation and dictatorship is a fight against the entire capitalist social and economic order workers of all countries must be united in a common political offensive to take power expropriate the oligarchs and establish a socialist society based on the rational scientific and

the collapse of us backed afghan security forces in the face of a nationwide offensive by the taliban insurgency has led us military and intelligence officials to warn that the fall of kabul could come within one month to 90 days the washington post reported wednesday the new estimate represents a change in the already grim projection that the us backed puppet regime of president ashraf ghani could be brought down in six to 12 months after the withdrawal of us and nato troops which is to be formally concluded within less than three weeks everything is moving in the wrong direction a person familiar with the military s new intelligence assessment told the post the report of the new assessment came as the taliban increased to nine the number of provincial capitals under its control according to western estimates in addition to now holding more than one quarter of the country s capitals the insurgency controls 65 percent of its land mass taliban forces are already besieging and occupying areas of major cities including kandahar and lashkar gah in the south ghazni in the east and herat in the west on wednesday the insurgency captured faizabad the capital of badakhshan province in the far northeast of the country the province which shares afghanistan s 57 mile border with china was the only one that the taliban failed to conquer when the islamist movement ruled the country from 1996 to 2001 the fall of faizabad brings seven of afghanistan s nine northern provinces under taliban control in the most important of these capitals kunduz with a population of nearly 375 000 remaining afghan government forces which were still holding a fortified base near the airport outside the city surrendered en masse wednesday the surrender deal had been brokered with afghan army commanders by local elders who asked them not to resist the taliban at least 2 000 afghan government troops were at the base the headquarters of the 217th pamir army corps one of seven army corps in the country which was responsible for security in the country s north the taliban captured large stocks of us supplied weapons and humvee armored vehicles as well as a helicopter in the surrender the continuing rout of the afghan national security forces came as us backed president ghani made an emergency trip to mazar i sharif a city of half a million that is one of the last areas still under government control in the north ghani used the trip to promote his government s desperate policy of banking on the arming of so called uprising forces comprised of militias loyal to local and regional warlords in mazar i sharif ghani held meetings with infamous uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostum and tajik warlord atta muhammed noor while the two men fought each other in the bloody civil war that followed the cia orchestrated war in the 1980s against the moscow backed government and soviet forces in afghanistan they united in the so called northern alliance that opposed the taliban after it took power in 1997 dostum who carried out some of the worst war crimes during the civil war was a key us ally following the october 2001 invasion of afghanistan together with us special forces he organized the massacre of some 2 000 taliban prisoners who were suffocated or shot to death after being stuffed into metal shipping containers near kunduz ghani had previously attempted to sideline figures like dostum and noor both because of their bloody history and the challenge they posed to his government s authority now that he is appealing to them to mobilize forces to defend his regime against the taliban it is by no means clear that they can do so both dostum and noor have become immensely wealthy off the corruption that is the lifeblood of the afghan regime while they had based their authority on their records as mujaheddin leaders in the us backed war against the soviet backed government and soviet troops in the 1980s they are now seen as collaborators with the us occupation the taliban s ability to consolidate control over much of the country s north which was the center of opposition to their rule in the late 1990s is a measure of the overwhelming popular hostility to the puppet regime in kabul and its masters in washington among the defections to the islamist insurgency over the past week was that of asif azimi a former senator from samangan and a major warlord in jamiat e islami a predominantly tajik party that was the backbone of the northern alliance led by ahmad shah massoud who was assassinated in 2001 explaining his decision to support the taliban azimi told the wall street journal we want an islamic government this government is a puppet of america anyone who stands against it we will support it the terminal crisis of the puppet government headed by ghani has found expression in a wholesale reshuffling of the command of its security forces and the sudden resignation wednesday and flight from the country of its acting finance minister khalid payenda he deserted his post as the regime faced the cutoff of fully 50 percent of its revenues as a result of the taliban seizing control of the majority of the country s border crossings taking over the collection of taxes and customs duties payenda has also been charged with unreported foreign income emblematic of the pervasive corruption of the us backed regime nearly 390 000 afghans have been internally displaced by the fighting since the beginning of the year with many of them fleeing to the already seriously overcrowded capital of kabul encampments of these internal refugees have proliferated in parks and city streets while kabul s mosques have been converted into shelters refugees have charged that the government has failed to provide them with food and other vital assistance the growing crisis in kabul could lead to social unrest qais mohammadi a lecturer in economics at kardan university told foreign policy pointing to the breakdown of essential services including electricity and an inflation rate of between 10 and 20 percent with gasoline prices doubling since may speaking to reporters in washington on tuesday us president joe biden said he did not regret his order to withdraw all us troops from afghanistan by the end of the month we spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years we trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300 000 afghan forces and afghan leaders have to come together we lost thousands of american personnel biden said why the trillion dollars the training and equipping of 300 000 afghan troops a vastly inflated number given wholesale desertions and commanders listing of ghost soldiers whose salaries could be pocketed and the blood spilt by us forces not to mention the killing of hundreds of thousands of afghans have yielded the worst debacle for us imperialism since the fall of saigon 46 years ago biden made no attempt to explain
