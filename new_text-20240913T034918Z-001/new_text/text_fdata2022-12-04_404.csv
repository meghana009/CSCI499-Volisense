past few decades according to a list of richest men in the us maintained by forbes magazine the present net worth of cuban is close to 5 billion mark cuban first rose to fame in the finance world after selling his video portal broadcast com to yahoo for 5 7 billion in 1999 cuban had founded the company just two years prior to selling it a feat that earned him legendary status on wall street since his first big score cuban has continued to invest in successful businesses mostly funding startups with mission statements and also bought nba team dallas mavericks cuban has also become a finance guru during the time accurately predicting the ebb and flow of the markets earlier this year cuban explained that he was selling stocks in his portfolio due to concerns about overvaluation in several asset classes in march 2022 interest rates hit 4 for the first time in three years just three months later in june the wall street journal declared an official bear market just as cuban had predicted cuban has built an ardent fan following over the past few years because of his television persona and an active presence on social media especially on social networking platform twitter that was recently bought by elon musk our methodology it is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public comments that cuban has made on these firms he has explicitly mentioned some of his private holdings during these public appearances while only alluding to others however based on a careful assessment of the comments the stocks listed below largely align with his investment philosophy 10 gamestop corp nyse gme number of hedge fund holders 17 gamestop corp nyse gme is a specialty retailer that provides games and entertainment products through its e commerce

corp nyse gme was one of them here is what the fund said amazingly gamestop corp nyse gme is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022 the stock trades at an 11 5b market cap exceeding its pre pandemic peak by billions of dollars this is even though revenue is down 30 from the peak gross margins are down 1500 bps and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of 700m in the last four quarters we had to double check that number because it is so high wall street has consistently revised downward their estimates of gamestop s profitability making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing analysts currently estimate an ebitda loss of around 400m markedly worse than their estimates as of 2 3 22 of a loss of 60m their recently launched nft marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the nft space instead we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business we are not optimistic and think the 11 5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of gamestop to pivot into something more profitable we find it unlikely that gamestop books a gaap profit ever again 9 blackberry limited nyse bb number of hedge fund holders 17 blackberry limited nyse bb provides

hudson wis ap a word hope is stitched onto a throw pillow in the little hilltop farmhouse photographs of children and grandchildren speckle the walls in the kitchen an envelope is decorated with a hand drawn heart happy birthday my love it reads out front past a pair of century old cottonwoods the neighbors cornfields reach into the distance john kraft loves this place he loves the quiet and the space he loves that you can drive for miles without passing another car but out there out beyond the cornfields to the little western wisconsin towns turning into commuter suburbs and to the cities growing ever larger out there he says is a country that many americans wouldn t recognize it s a dark place dangerous where freedom is under attack by a tyrannical government few officials can be trusted and clans of neighbors might someday have to band together to protect one another it s a country where the most basic beliefs in faith family liberty are threatened and it s not just about politics anymore it s no longer left versus right democrat versus republican says kraft a software architect and data analyst it s straight up good versus evil he knows how he sounds he s felt the contempt of people who see him as a fanatic a conspiracy theorist but he s a hero in a growing right wing conservative movement that has rocketed to prominence here in st croix county just a couple years ago their talk of marxism government crackdowns and secret plans to destroy family values would have put them at the far fringes of the republican party but not anymore today despite midterm elections that failed to see the sweeping republican victories that many had predicted they remain a cornerstone of the conservative electoral base across the country victories went to candidates who believe in qanon and candidates who believe the separation of church and state is a fallacy in wisconsin a u s senator who dabbles in conspiracy theories and pseudoscience was reelected crushing his opponent in st croix county they are farmers and business analysts they are stay at home mothers graphic designers and insurance salesmen they live in communities where crime is almost nonexistent and cub scouts hold 5 spaghetti lunch fundraisers at american legion halls and they live with something else sometimes it s anger sometimes sadness every once in a while it s fear all of this can be hard to see hidden behind the throw pillows and the gently rolling hills but spend some time in this corner of wisconsin have a drink or two in the small town bars sit with parents cheering kids at the county rodeo attend sunday services try to see america through their eyes there s a joke people sometimes tell around here democrats take exit 1 off i 94 republicans go at least three exits farther the first exit off the freeway leads to hudson a onetime ragged at the edges riverside town that has become a place of carefully tended 19th century homes and tourists wandering main street boutiques with 14 000 people it s the largest town in st croix county it s also replete with democrats the republicans start at exit 4 the joke says beyond a neutral zone of generic sprawl a target a home depot a thicket of chain restaurants for some people out here hudson might be as far away as south dakota or california says mark carlson who lives off exit 16 in an old log cabin now covered in light blue siding he doesn t go into hudson often i don t meet many liberals carlson is a friendly man who exudes gentleness loves to cook rarely leaves home without a pistol and believes despotism looms over america there s a plan to lead us from within toward socialism marxism communism type of government says carlson a st croix county supervisor who recently retired after 20 years working at a juvenile detention facility and is now a part time uber driver he was swept into office earlier this year when insurgent right wing conservatives created a powerful local voting bloc energized by fury over covid lockdowns vaccination mandates and the unrest that shook the country after george floyd was murdered by a policeman in minneapolis just 45 minutes away in early 2020 they took control of the county republican party driving away leaders they deride as pawns of a weak kneed establishment and helped put well over a dozen people in elected positions across the county in their america the u s government orchestrated covid fears to cement its power the irs is buying up huge stocks of ammunition and former president barack obama may be the country s most powerful person but they are not caricatures not even carlson a bearded gun owning white guy who voted for former president donald trump i m just a normal person he says sitting on a sofa next to a picture window overlooking the large garden that he and his wife tend they don t realize that we mean well he s a complicated man while even he admits he might accurately be called a right wing extremist he calls peaceful black protesters righteous for taking to the streets after floyd s murder he doubts there was fraud in the midterm elections he drives a tesla he loves ac dc and makes his own organic yogurt in an area where islam is sometimes viewed with open hostility he s a conservative christian who says he d back the area s small muslim community if they wanted to open a mosque here build your mosque of course that s the american way he believes deeply that america doesn t need to be bitterly divided liberalism and conservatism aren t that far apart you can be pro american pro constitutional you just want bigger government programs i want less we can work together he says we don t have to like hate each other repeatedly he and the county s other right wing conservatives insist they don t want violence but violence often seems to be looming as they talk hazy images of government thugs or antifa rioters or health officers seizing children from parents and weapons are a big part of their self proclaimed patriot movement the second amendment and the belief that americans have a right to overthrow tyrannical governments are foundational principles i m not a big gun guy says carlson whose weapons include pistols a shotgun an ar 15 rifle 10 loaded magazines and about 1 000 additional rounds for a lot of people that s just a start that cocktail of weaponry and politics concerns plenty of people outside of their circles liberal voters along with many establishment republicans worry that men in tactical clothing can now occasionally be seen at public gatherings they worry that some people are now too afraid to be campaign volunteers they worry that many locals think twice about wearing democratic t shirts in public even in hudson paul hambleton who lives in hudson and works with the county democratic party found comfort in the midterm election results which even some republicans say could signal a repudiation of trump and his most extreme supporters i don t feel the menace like i was feeling it before the vote hambleton says i think this election showed that people can be brave that they can stick their necks out he spent years teaching in small town st croix county where the population has grown from 43 000 in 1980 to about 95 000 today he watched over the years as the student body shifted farmers children gave way to the children of people who commute to work in the twin cities racial minorities became a small but growing presence he understands why the changes might make some people nervous there is a rural way of life that people feel is being threatened here a small town way of life he says but he s also a hunter who saw how hard it was to buy ammunition after the 2020 protests when firearm sales soared across america for nearly two years the shelves were almost bare i found that menacing says hambleton because no way is that deer hunters buying up so much ammunition when the newly empowered conservatives get together it s often at an irish bar in a freeway strip mall next door is the little county gop office where you can pick up republican yard signs and 15 travel mugs that proclaim normal is not coming back jesus is paddy ryan s is the closest thing they have to a clubhouse one afternoon in late summer matt rust was there talking about the media i think they re an arm of a much larger global effort by very rich powerful people to control as much of the world as possible says rust a designer and product developer who can quote large parts of the u s constitution from memory and i don t think that s anything new it s always been that way from ancient persian rulers to adolf hitler is that a conspiracy or is that just human nature he asks i think it s just human nature today polls indicate that well over 60 of republicans don t believe president joe biden was legitimately elected around a third refuse to get the covid vaccine rep marjorie taylor greene the georgia republican known for her conspiratorial accusations and violent rhetoric is a political star trump has embraced qanon and its universe of conspiracies in wisconsin sen ron johnson a fierce denier of the 2020 election who has suggested the dangers of covid are overblown won his third term on nov 8 this seems impossible to many americans how can you dismiss the avalanche of evidence that voter fraud was nearly non existent in 2020 how do you ignore thousands of scientists insisting vaccines are safe how do you believe qanon a movement born from anonymous internet posts but news in this world doesn t come from the associated press or cnn it only rarely comes from major conservative media like fox news where does it come from the internet said scott miller a 40 year old sales analyst and a prominent local gun rights activist that s where everybody gets their news these days very often that means right wing podcasts and videos that bounce around in social media feeds or on the encrypted messaging service telegram it s a media microcosm with its own vocabulary event 201 the regime democide the parallel economy that invites blank stares from outsiders while many reports are little more than angry recitations of right wing talking points some are sophisticated and believable take selection code a highly produced hour long attack on the 2020 election underwritten by trump ally mike lindell the mypillow ceo it has the look of a 60 minutes piece tells a complex story and uses unexpected sources to make some of its main points like hillary clinton as we look at our election system i think it s fair to say there are many legitimate questions about its accuracy about its integrity the then senator is shown saying in a 2005 senate speech questioning the reelection of former president george w bush miller laughs i ll give the democrats credit at least they had the courage to stand up and point it out cornfields come right up to the country church deep in rural st croix county and just down the road from a truck stop denny s the closest town wilson is little more than a half dozen streets a post office and the wingin it bar and grill from the pulpit of calvary assembly of god pastor rick mannon preaches a christianity that resonates deeply among this type of conservatives with strict lines of good and evil and little hesitation to wade into cultural and political issues he pushed back hard against covid restrictions it s an outpost in the culture wars tearing at america and a haven for people who feel shoved aside by a changing nation if christians don t get involved in politics then we shouldn t have a say mannon says in an interview we can t just let evil win religion once one of america s tightest social bonds has changed dramatically over the past few decades with the overall number of people who identify as christian plunging from the early 1970s even as membership in conservative christian denominations surged from churches like calvary assembly they ve watched as gay marriage was legalized as trans rights became a national issue as christianity at least in their eyes came under attack by pronoun proclaiming liberals it s hard to overstate how much cultural changes have shaped the right wing of american conservatism beliefs about family and sexuality that were commonplace when kraft was growing up in a milwaukee suburb in the late 1970s and early 1980s tinkering with electronics with his father now can mark people like him as outcasts in the wider world if you say anything negative about trans people or if you say i feel sorry for you this is a clinical diagnosis well you are a bigot says kraft 58 a member of mannon s congregation people with normal mainstream family values churchgoing believing in god suddenly it s something they should be ostracized for but in today s world words like normal don t mean what they once did that infuriates kraft who energized the republican party of st croix county as its leader but stepped down last year after a quote on the party s website if you want peace prepare for war set off a public firestorm he moved to a neighboring county earlier this year he ticks off the accusations leveled at people like him sexist homophobic racist but such talk he says has lost its power now it s just noise it s lost all its meaning the plans if they are mentioned at all are spoken of quietly but sit in enough small town bars drive enough small town roads and you ll occasionally hear people talk about what they intend to do if things go really bad for america there are the solar panels if the electricity grid fails there s extra gasoline for cars and diesel for generators there are shelves of non perishable food sometimes enough to last for months there are the guns though that is almost never discussed with outsiders i ve got enough says one man sitting in a hudson coffee shop i would rather not get into that with a reporter says kraft the fears here are mostly about crime and civil unrest people still talk about the 2020 protests when they say you could stand in hudson and see the distant glow of fires in minneapolis that frightened many people and not just conservative republicans but there are other fears too about government crackdowns about firearm seizures about the possibility that people might have to take up arms against their own government those prospects seem distant murky including to the self declared patriots the most dire possibilities are spoken about only theoretically still they are spoken about i pray it will always be that the overthrow is at the ballot box says carlson who seems genuinely pained at the idea of violence we don t want to use guns he continues that would be just horrible follow tim sullivan on twitter at bytimsullivan success an email has been sent to with

investors have been pelted by bad news this year with investments of all types and geographies in the doldrums but there is one group that has been less mired in gloom those who invest to achieve an income on their nest eggs are seeing some blue skies especially those who know the best places to look for it global dividend payouts rose by seven per cent to 347billion in the third quarter of this year according to the latest janus henderson global dividend index as many as 90 per cent of companies around the world that the investment house monitors increased their dividends or held them steady investors who want their portfolio to produce an income can choose to put their money into a range of companies that regularly pay out a portion of their revenues in dividends to shareholders all around the world global dividend payouts rose by seven per cent to 347billion in the third quarter of this year but an easier way to earn dividend income is to invest in an equity income fund or investment trust these contain anything from a handful to hundreds of stocks chosen for their potential to pay out an income that way you are not relying on just a few companies so your risk is more evenly spread why a global approach to dividends can pay off global equity income funds are overlooked by many investors who choose to focus on the uk stock market this is not a terrible mistake the uk market is good at paying dividends and its 100 biggest stocks are currently offering an average annual income of 4 5 per cent yet by considering global income funds the number of possible high yielding companies to choose from leaps there are three times more companies with a dividend yield higher than five per cent among global companies than just uk ones figures from fund manager vanguard reveal the global income sector has seen total returns fall by 0 6 per cent on average since the start of the year this isn t earth shattering but remember that most markets have taken a hit this year so a modest fall compares favourably global funds as a whole have lost nine per cent in value importantly some of the best performing global equity income funds have seen close to double digit growth this year almost enough to counter the harmful effects of inflation jason hollands managing director of investment platform bestinvest says the uk is the standout market when it comes to dividends so income investors should not ignore the opportunities on their own doorstep that said it is wise to embrace diversification when it comes to building and managing an investment portfolio so investors looking to generate income should cast their net more widely how to choose an overseas income fund if you have a strong conviction about which parts of the world are likely to produce the best dividend income you can invest in income funds with a specific geographical focus such as europe asia or the us but opting for a global equity income fund allows you to invest in companies worldwide remember though that such funds vary wildly in their investment approach so you will have to do some research to work out which one is right for you when investing in global income funds the aim should not be to find the ones with the highest yields but rather those that offer a consistent and sustainable income so look at the dividends paid this year and in past years if possible see how the income funds you are looking at have performed in different economic environments from booms to recessions this won t tell you how the fund will perform in the future but it will give a sense of its investment mettle by far the biggest income contributors this year have been oil and energy companies which have profited from soaring energy prices but some of the biggest global income funds steer well away from them this is because they believe the dividends are not sustainable in the long term as the fortunes of such firms tend to be cyclical james norton head of financial planners at vanguard uk europe says investors should avoid yield traps companies that offer a high income not because they are healthy but because their share price is depressed

image by pressfoto from peter reagan at birch gold group a classic sign of late stage speculative bubbles is sentiment based market action instead of an approach based on fundamentals market sentiment is a fairly simple concept the feeling or tone of a market or its crowd psychology as revealed through the activity and price movement of the securities traded in that market in broad terms rising prices indicate bullish market sentiment while falling prices indicate bearish market sentiment the problem is the current sentiment portrayed by the mainstream media isn t supported by technical fundamentals at all instead media talking heads are grasping for so called good news which inspires risky investor behavior the idea that the bad news has ended is a dangerous illusion to support with your savings the fed will pivot rates will drop stocks will surge and inflation will go away better buy now here are two recent examples of how the illusion manifests itself and how the market reacts to it starting with fed chairman powell s remarks on december s rate hikes the fed s minor adjustment launched a misguided market boom thursday powell hinted that december s rake hike will amount to only 50 basis points basis points is jargon for one percent of one percent so 50 basis points means a 0 5 increase in rates cnbc further confirmed and clarified those suspicions federal reserve chairman jerome powell confirmed wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in december but he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation we will stay the course until the job is done he said during a speech in washington d c at the brookings institution a smaller than expected rate hike was enough to send the dow jones up 700 points let s be clear powell announced a smaller than expected rate hike for now and told us that rates would continue to go up what did the markets hear great news interest rates aren t going up as fast as we worried meanwhile slower rate hikes mean inflation will stay higher for longer do we hear about that from the reporters at cnn nope all we hear is good news from chair powell today here s how markets are reacting the next example of deliberately misleading commentary is even worse how inflation created the best black friday ever black friday the biggest retail day of the year is a bellwether for both consumer sentiment and spending reports of a new best ever year with sales up 12 year over year sent the stock market into overdrive mainstream media headlines everywhere couldn t help but celebrate these record sales numbers remember though prices nationwide are up significantly compared to last year see these reports simply ignore inflation they measure number of dollars spent rather than value gained per dollar spent what happens when we adjust for inflation we see those all time high records are an illusion real inflation adjusted sales were down 5 who s talking about that no one because it doesn t fit the mainstream media s everything is hunky dory run right out and spend narrative it seems like today s good news falls into one of two categories we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us not as bad as we feared bad but deliberately misinterpreted as good and this is what s moving markets astonishing isn t it when we brush aside the not so bad news and take a look at reality the already broken good news narrative is shattered beyond repair bad news that s too bad for even cnn to sugar coat when we survey the macroeconomic landscape what do we see the latest producer price index ppi came in at 8 virtually guaranteeing that prices on store shelves are going to keep rising the consumer price index cpi is currently 7 7 and has been over 5 every single month for over a year remember if the fed follows through by shrinking the size of rate hikes inflation will likely stay this high for quite a while what about stocks well the shiller pe ratio price to earnings ratio is about 50 overvalued when compared to the 140 year historical median 29 9 vs 15 89 it s also higher than it was during the 2008 financial crisis that means that right now investors are paying about 2 for every equity that s historically been worth 1 so what does that mean fund manager john hussman says investors are insane to pay the price for stocks right now presently we expect negative average annual inflation adjusted total returns for the s p 500 over the coming 10 12 years as we also projected in 2000 investors may be insane to pay that price but the math is just math hussman was right in 2000 note his article is very good and well worth a read once again to summarize inflation is still far too high prices will likely continue to rise stocks are currently set to offer negative after inflation returns for the next decade sanity may not return to the markets for quite some time i can pound my keyboard all day long and it doesn t make much of a difference at times like these it s a good idea to focus on what we can control basing your financial future on something more stable than hope it sure looks like most of the media and some investors are so desperate for good news that they re fooling themselves by looking at an illusion that means you should take a different approach and ignore the media s illusion instead like most americans you probably want a properly diversified portfolio so you can grow your savings for example if you re wondering what to do until inflation eases one suggestion to consider is parking some of your assets in a safe haven unfortunately a truly safe haven for your hard earned retirement dollars is getting harder to find as you just read above stocks are overvalued and once you adjust for inflation aren t very safe at all even typically safe bonds aren t always the best choice when adjusted for inflation south korean bonds are the highest yielding for developed foreign nations but still don t account for more than about half the rate of inflation a paltry 3 67 apy looks like a guaranteed loss when set against 7 7 inflation doesn t it junk bonds are risky investments that might account for inflation but are far from a sure bet they re called junk bonds for a reason so maybe now it s time for you to consider physical precious metals like gold and silver to preserve your purchasing power both have been relied on for centuries as safe haven investments even during the worst times of economic turmoil here are the answers to the question why consider precious metals and if you re interested in learning how to diversify your savings in this time tested manner request free info kit to learn

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

hey folks if you ve found amul butter missing from grocery store shelves you may not be the only one there s a real shortage of butter in india and the reason is diwali weird well here s the thing we had a close to normal festive season this year after two long years of pandemic driven curbs families and friends were gathering around and this meant that mithai was in unusually high demand now amul normally uses 60 of the fat it derives from its initial milk procurement to produce liquid milk the rest goes into making stuff like butter ghee and cheese but this time the demand for sweets was so high during diwali that amul had to tweak things it used up more milk fats to produce more liquid milk the main ingredient in milk cakes and malai pedas and well butter and ghee took a back seat then we had the lumpy skin disease remember that from a couple months ago well india s cattle suffered and 60 000 cows succumbed to the illness this year also dairy exports increased by a staggering 95 compared to the last year it left little for local consumption and was quite a double whammy and amul s not the only one even mother dairy also seems to be in a similar spot but fret not the folks in the dairy business are confident that this butter stock problem is only short lived until then you might have to simply have unbuttered toast for breakfast here s a soundtrack to get you in the mood courtyards by shourya malhotra come now let s slide like butter into the weekend what caught our eye this week tough to kill the maharajah after spending nearly 1 billion to create the vistara brand in the past 8 years its owners have decided to dump it that s right the airline jointly owned by singapore airlines and the tata group has decided that it s best to simply merge vistara with air india and well call it air india okay why on earth would they do that air india s staid and boring and doesn t really appeal to the young demographic vistara s the cool one so why for starters it could be the global ambitions you see although vistara made it to skytrax s a uk based airline and airport review and ranking site top 20 carriers list of 2022 it just flies 15 international routes air india on the other hand flies over 70 with an international market share of about 12 air india already has an international brand name something vistara doesn t or maybe it s simply because tata does not want to give up on its legacy a legacy that began on 15th october 1932 a 28 year old jehangir ratanji dadabhoy jrd tata climbed aboard a single engine plane and took to the skies his destination was chennai then madras and he intended to reach his destination after a brief stop at mumbai then bombay with him he also carried a small pouch of airmail it read first flight madras karachi airmail service and thus tata air mail had arrived before you knew it the airlines went from ferrying mail to ferrying passengers within six years the company owned 15 planes and it was renamed tata airlines by 1946 it carried one in every three passengers in india and owned 50 of the country s fleet the same year it became a public company and adopted the name we re all familiar with air india also that s the year in which the famous air india mascot of a moustachioed turbaned man known as the maharajah was created tata had created the king of the indian skies but well the story goes that the government took over the airline in the 1960s tata exited and it all went downhill from there now after taking it back from the government you can see why tata would want to keep air india s storied history and dump the young vistara no it might simply want to bring the brand back to its former glory it has roped in london based futurebrands which has worked on rebranding american airlines and bentley in the past for its makeover and who knows air india may even have a new mascot replacing the aged maharajah infographic quirkonomics brushing teeth could earn you more money what what if we told you that there s a relationship between how much you earn and how frequently you brush your teeth don t believe us well in 1974 economist alan blinder published a paper titled the economics of brushing teeth in the journal of political economy which observed that people who earned less brushed more the logic was simple and the assumption based on the human capital theory which asserts that people do whatever they do to maximize their income in this case brushing teeth think chefs and waiters working in a restaurant chefs are often working behind the scenes while waiters have to be presentable to customers now if you have a person with bad breath or yellow teeth waiting to take your order at a restaurant there s a higher chance of the chap losing their tips on the contrary chefs have none of this to worry about and if you look at it chefs bag a higher pay than waiters so if waiters had to pocket more money they had to well take care of their teeth another observation blinder noted was of professors at a leading university he found that assistant professors brushed 2 14 times daily on average while associate professors brushed only 1 89 times and full professors only 1 47 times daily notice the pattern higher the rank lower the frequency of brushing teeth which meant that assistant and associate professors brushed more often than their seniors so that they could get promoted and earn more interacting with people with a bad breath can sure dampen your chances of going up the career ladder eh so even if you argued that your brushing habit came from how much your mum pushed you into doing it she still had an outlook of maximising your income when she told you so money tips we re giving money tips a fresh coat of paint what do we mean well instead of doing bits

archived document may contain errors 320 january 3 1984 agriculture s revealing and painful lesson for industrial policy introduction it has been argued that the experience of u s a griculture demonstrates the potential success of industrial policy mit economist lester thurow for example recently concluded that ifin agriculture what started as a desperate effort to prop up a very large sick industry in the 193 0s ended as an ind u stry that is the world s most efficient there is no reason that feat cannot be duplicated elsewhere for proponents of a national industrial policy some governmental activity in agriculture has been productive but much more of it has been wasteful the p roductive activity has involved the development and dissemination of knowledge that helped u s agri culture become a successful high tech industry and methods of these activities do not transfer to the industrial sector the wasteful governmental activ i ties in agriculture have involved intervention in the commodity markets in response to the political pressures of producer groups attempts at industrial policy would inevitably be subject to analogous pressures in short the unproductive aspects of agri c ultural policy would likely carry over to industrial policy while the productive aspects would not the trouble is that agricultural policy makes a poor model but the rationale the state of u s agriculture it may be questioned whether u s agriculture n otable success in the past two years there have today is a been assertions lester c thurow farms a policy success newsweek may 16 1983 2 that farmers are in the worst financial crisis that they have experienced since the great depression u s feder a l spending for farm commodity programs in fiscal 1983 was 21 billion ap proximately equal to the value of net farm income in total one could be forgiven for rephrasing the earlier quotation from thurow to say what started as a desperate effort to pro p up a very large sick industry in the 1930s ended as a desperate effort to prop up a somewhat smaller but almost as sick industry in the 1980s i despite current problems u s agriculture is an economic success for a number of reasons first u s agricu l ture has experienced rates of productivity growth surpassing those in most industries whether measured in terms of labor productivity or in terms of total factor productivity output divided by an index of labor land and capital inputs the united state s has a sub stantial cost advantage in world commodity trade for most agri cultural products american grain producers receive about half the prices obtained for their products by european community farmers and u s rice producers receive about one fourth the prices of japanese rice producers u s production continues to expand and to dominate world trade in the grains and rice a sedond and resultant indicator of success in american agriculture is the low food prices paid by u s consumers com pared t o food prices abroad a third indicator is that despite the problems of some financially strained farmers u s agriculture yields incomes and a return on investment that are fully comparable to returns earned in nonagricultural industries a situation th a t did not exist in the 1930s or 1950s 1982 had a net worth of 350 000 about 8 times the real net worth of the average farm in 1940 the average u s farm in in short u s agriculture has been a success in that it is competitive in world markets provide s low priced food to u s consumers and generates reasonable rewards to progressive com mercial farmers on the other hand the incidence of poverty is higher among rural families than among urban dwellers although differences in cost of living nonpecuniary income and family size make compari sons difficult these poor farmers should not be confused with the commercial farmers who account for the high productivity of the agricultural sector and the high mean net worth of u s farms income in agriculture is significantly less evenly distributed and more skewed more concentrated at the upper income level for farm as compared to nonfarm households farming moreover has been no creator of jobs employment in farming accounted for 20 percent of the labor force in 1930 but only 3 percent in 1 9 82 in this sense u s agriculture is a 3 declining industr y profitability of u s commercial farming are all the more striking against this background the productivity and federal agriculture programs the list of federal policies to assist u s agriculture is impressive they include 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ag ricultural research thro ugh the land grant universities and experiment stations the agricultural extension service for disseminating research findings educational programs at land grant universities and vocational agricultural programs in high schools a federal farm credit system federally subsidized irrigation drainage and other water projects subsidized crop insurance programs price support programs through the commodity credit corpora tion for grains cotton rice milk peanuts and several minor commodities land control and retirement programs export promotion programs restrictions on imports of sugar beef dairy products and other agricultural commodities grain and cotton storage subsidies exemption of cooperatives for marketing farm products from most antitrust legislation tax advantages for expensing many capital investments capital gains tax treatment of certain livestock returns and other provisions resulting in substantially lower effective tax rates for agriculture compared to other businesses on returns to investmen t in farming see e melicar capital gains versus current income in the farming sector american journal of agricultural economics december 1979 pp 1085 1092 for an overall review see l tweeten et al the emerging economics of agriculture council for agricultural science and technology report no 98 september 1983 4 how are these federal policies linked to the successes and research failures of american agriculture numerous studies have identified cost reducing consequences of technical change in agriculture for instance and the high rate of return of federally funded research and extension fed eral policies in this area undeniably have been important in the promotion of cost reducing technical change as an element of what could be called a suc c essful industrial policy on the other hand much of the research in agricultural production has been conducted by agribusiness corporations and some that has been done under governmental auspices would have been done privately were there no government in v olvement that u s agriculture would have become technologically backward without government research so it would be incorrect to infer farm credit the farm credit programs and other subsidies toward farm production expenses and income tax burdens have r educed the costs of farmers it could be argued that u s households have received benefits from these policies in the form of cheaper food and that these benefits largely offset the subsidy costs there is no evi dence however that the rate of return to the taxpayers providing financial support for these activities justifies the cost it is mainly a transfer from taxpayers to owners of rent earning agri cultural assets if these production oriented policies were the sum total of governmental involvemen t in u s agriculture they might be rele vant as a policy model for other industries but the full set of agricultural policies must be considered since they are inex tricably intertwined politically governmental policies have increased production and t h erefore reduced prices and in some cases have made traditional farming practices obsolete therefore has the responsibility to insure farmers of returns sufficient to cover costs even for enterprises that cannot take full advantage of advances in product i on techniques these latter policies put forth under the slogan of i1supportingl1 or more often i savingll the family farm require consideration farmers have argued that they go on to maintain that the government stabilization policies in addition to t he difficulties of some in adapting to tech nological change farmers are said to need aid to cope with the market power of middlemen the uncertainties of international markets and weather and the dynamics of biological production processes these probl e ms reasonably may justify the exploration of antitrust remedies risk management institutions such as futures markets or the provision of market information and educational services by government instead the main policy results have 5 been a half centu ry long series of experiments in commodity price and output control programs these have been marketed under the label llstabilization ll and as such have been claimed good medi cine for consumers and producers alike mit economist lester thurow believes that these stabilization policies are an integral part of the u s agricultural success story he states that they had important effects not just on the welfare of farm families but on farm productivity with more certainty about their incomes farmers w ere willing to make heavy investments in new equipment banks were willing to finance that new equipment knowing that income to repay the loans would be there makers could gear up for massive production runs reducing unit costs and make larger investment s in developing new machinery for what was a stable market 3 despite this plausible scenario there is little evidence farm machinery that stabilization efforts per se have been a cause of agricul tural productivity growth one can obtain some evidence on t his question by comparing periods of greater and less stability and by comparing various agricultural enterprises in which different policies were followed for example the yield of corn per acre and its output per unit of total input have increased dra matically in recent years at the same time a substantial price stabilization program was in effect productivity gains in other crops on the other hand have been equally impressive without significant governmental stabili zation programs some of the mos t dynamic farm products such as broiler chickens have had no government programs to stabilize their markets the real price of chicken has declined by about one half since 19 60 moreover some of the commodities that have been slowest to adopt new prod uctive techniques such as milk and tobacco are among the most heavily protected and some unpro tected commodities for example soybeans have not experienced yield increases as great as for corn while in other respects the two crops are grown in quite similar farm operations studies based on policy experiments have also been inconclu sive in the 1940s a price stabilization program was introduced for potatoes after which output increased dramatically agri cultural economists who studied this program attributed the gains to itproduction adjustments induced by the greater price certainty lr4 ibid r gray v sorenson and w cochrane impact of government programs in the potato industry as quoted in w cochrane and m ryan american farm policy 194 8 1973 minneapolis minnesota university of minnesota press 19761 p 375 6 however this program was essentially a price support program the government bought potatoes to keep prices up in low price periods but it did not store and resell them to keep prices down in high price periods it seems more plausible in other words to attribute the expansion of output to higher prices than to stable prices similarly tobacco and peanut yields per acre in the 1950s and 1960s accelerated rapidly in response to usda programs but it is not clear that any real productivity or efficiency gains were involved the main cause was a production control program that guaranteed high prices but limited the number of acres that a farmer could plant responding to this inc e ntive farmers used fertilization and other intensive practices to double their yield per acre of tobacco and peanuts in only a few years but it is not apparent that a corresponding increase in total factor pro ductivity was induced suggests that product i vity gains have been due not to stabilization policies but primarily to successful investment in research leading to new varieties new harvesting techniques or new methods of controlling natural enemies when profitable technical break throughs are made in any commodity the productivity advances but these technical advances do not seem to be linked significantly to the existence of stabilization policies why then has the u s embarked on this voyage of interven tion has not in fact been desire f or productivity growth stability or any other public good but rather the redistribution of wealth to commodity groups with the greatest political clout the irony is that the ostensible gainers from these policies are not re ceiving nearly as much as t a xpayers and consumers are giving up so the programs do not enhance efficiency or productivity they reduce it further examination of these and other commodity comparisons the main motivating force behind such agricultural policies lessons for industrial po l icy declining firms some industrial policy proposals aim to help marginal or technologically obsolete firms and protect their workers there are lessons from the agricultural policy experience for such initiatives but they are not supportive of industria l policy agricultural policies despite rhetoric favoring traditional family farms have not been geared to saving economically obsolete enterprises indeed in the past 50 years the number of farms in the united states has been reduced by about two third s from ap proximately 6 million to about 2 1 3 million and a common criti cism of agricultural policy is that it has fostered large scale risk taking enterprises at the expense of small traditional operations 7 some federal programs do seem to have e n abled small scale farming to survive longer than otherwise would have been the case notably the quantitative restrictions in tobacco growing and a few other commodities as well as earlier acreage control policies in the grains and cotton overall the lo n g run structural conse quences of policy generally have been to let the most economic enterprises survive and to permit the poorly managed financially weak or unlucky enterprises to fail in the past five years however there has been a shift toward prov i ding credit on easy terms for farmers in financial difficulty because of adverse weather or low market prices cultural movement s disorderly but effective lobbying the emergency agricultural act of 1978 supplemented longstanding emergency loan programs o f the usda with a new 6 billion program of economic emergency loans these loans kept in business some farms whose credit standing was too poor to qualify for loans from commercial banks but the emergency loans simply postponed the failure of some farm enterprises until the next round of depressed prices in 1981 19 82 now there is great pressure in congress to prohibit the u s department of agriculture usda from foreclosing on past loans this episode gives evidence to support the critics of the bail out strategies that are connected with industrial policy i in response to the american agei wnf air trade industrial policy also aims at dealing with unfair trade practices of other countries u s agricultural policy in this area has been active but inc o nsistent and its consequences dubious farthest in the grains with quite mixed results periods of vigorous subsidy and export promotion have alternated with periods of export restriction most notably during the mid 1970s and again in president carter s e mbargo on grain sales to the soviet union it seems likely that a general regime of liberalized trade would have produced a better environment for u s agricultural exports than did the arbitrary shifts resulting from attempts to manage the grain trade fro m washington d c attempts to manage international markets have proceeded the most workable and beneficial policy regarding trade is the general multinational negotiation of reductions in barriers apart from such efforts together with the promotion of efficiency in agricultural production the other policies designed to promote and manage u s exports have been either counterproductive or more costly to consumers and taxpayers than their gains to american pro ducers would warrant interest groups the most obvious and important lesson that 50 years of ex perience with agricultural policy offers is the inevitable dominance of interest group politics in debates and legislation although a public intere st rationale can be given for a u s agricultural policy the real reason for the programs stems from 8 the firm belief of farmers that governmental intervention would serve to increase their economic returns plus the politica1 rami fications of that belie f thus in the area of stabilization policy the only approaches to receive serious consideration are programs to stabilize prices by increasing low prices policies that would bring stability by reducing high prices are practically never enacted admitted l y the beef price ceilings of the mid 1970s and the soybean and grain embargos of that time were exceptions to the rule but they earned their proponents such political odium that both political parties now compete to give the strongest promise never to repeat the policy political reality explains why policies that stabilize prices by means of commodity storage such as those favored by the carter administration cannot be successful politically when prices remain low for several consecutive years since rising stocks mean farmers cannot realistically expect substantial price in creases for many more years it is for such plain political reasons that the united states has resorted throughout the past to acreage restrictions rather than a policy of buildin g up stocks to support prices this same approach is the central theme of the current payment in kind pik program fens ible transfers from politically weak to politically strong groups but more important in the context of an industrial policy it result s inevitably in economic inefficiency this means that the cumulative costs to consumers and taxpayers are substantially larger than the gains to producers for instance is making u s farmers in 1983 better off by perhaps 10 billion but it is costing con sumers and taxpayers about 15 billion 5 the most visible segment of this loss is the rental value of productive land that instead of being used to grow commodities is sitting idle in order to meet the requirements of the program at a rental value of 50 per acre the 80 million idle acres in the pik program mean a net loss of 4 billion in addition to the cost of idled land corresponding reduc tions in the demand for seeds harvesting labor fertilizer and other farm inputs disrupt the agribusiness com m unity and impose burdens another important element of the deadweight loss is the cost of political action by farmers such as the hiring of lobbyists and counterlobbyists to put forward economic and legal arguments on both sides of legislative debates the same such political dominance by interest groups leads to inde the pik program the difference is the policy s deadweight loss these numbers are soft but plausible out in rural reagonornics resources for the future washington d c june 1983 derivation of them here is spelled an analysis and critique prepared for 9 executing policies another lesson for advocates of industrial policy that stems from u s experience with agricultural policy is the difficulty implicit in carrying out management tasks associat e d with strate gies to stabilize markets and resolve market failures the u s has had a long experience with stabilization policy based on com modity storage programs in the case of the commodity credit corporation ccc during the carter administration cc c storage was supplemented by a farmer owned reserve for program one of the most sophisticated attempts to stabilize the grain markets this program retained by the reagan administration in a modified form involves a complex system of incentives and subsidies to encourage farmers to store grain when prices are low and to encourage them to release it from storage when prices are high the management issue is whether the government is better able to discover the optimal quantity to hold in storage at each price than is the private trade through the speculative storage of grain manage stocks is mixed at best when wheat and corn stocks were drawn down in the early 1970s american consumers were left vul nerable to large price increases when there was a corn crop short fall in 19 74 the management mistake was made not by farmers or other private owners of grain stocks but primarily by the ccc which sold off its long held inventories when prices first began to rise during the soviet grain imports of 1972 and 1973 while the farmer owned reserve management policies were more complex during the 1977 1981 period subsequent study of the price patterns of that time compared to the pre for period showed no significant improvement in stability thanks to the program 6 over when for stocks expanded considerably in the late 1970s and again in the 1980s the government reacted not by reducing its additions to stocks or cutting its purchase price for grain but instead by production control measures this policy proved ill advised in 1980 when the warmest summer in 25 years reduced grain yields appreciably combined with short soviet crops this resulted in a scarcity only aggravated by acreage controls was a repeat performance during the hot dry summer of 19 8 3 the 1983 situation was intensified by the pik program which reacted to the large stocks that had accumulated by 1982 with the largest acreage cutback program ever the evidence to date on the government s ability to more there none of these episodes in s pires confidence in the government s ability to manage the grain markets and most agricultural econo mists appear to accept such an assessment the main disagreement see general accounting office farmer owned grain reserve program needs modification to improve effectiveness report to the congress by the comptroller general ced 81 70 june 26 1981 i 10 among them is whether past failures call for more intelligent governmental policy or the abandonment of governmental attempts to manage these markets lo ss of cropland the pitfalls of governmental management are also apparent in another aspect of agriculture where market failures are widely accepted as important namely the loss of prime cropland to erosion and urbanization governmental efforts to promot e conservation over the past 50 years have been well intentioned but it is not clear that the complete array of agricultural policies has been effective it is even arguable that the trice support programs have tended to accelerate soil depletion incenti ves to drain and irrigate cropland have worked at cross purposes with simultaneous attempts to control produ tion and recent judgments regarding federal conservation programs have ranged from the conclusion that tlsoil conservation spending is not being a l located very effectively1ii0 to the opinion that these programs are tfmodels of inefficiency if1l once again the central message is clear bureaucratic confusion and an inability to carry out even a straightforward mandate to improve upon perceived marke t failures have meant that governmental efforts to guide economic events have created as many perhaps more problems than they have solved a final consideration that gives pause is the role of the general public even if congress could start again with a clean slate and even if interest group politics and poor managerial capabilities could be surmounted the ultimate directions to policymakers would still come from voters most of whom have only the vaguest understanding of the technical issues and trade offs involved in agricultural or industrial policy voters would be in no position nor find it in their interest to take the time and effort necessary to respond intelligently to the self interested requests for support directed at them the problem i s that the 7 8 9 10 11 see j schnittker a framework

policy interventions are complex matters that do not lend them selves to solutions that can be worked out by interested amateurs or properly ex plained by the popular media agricultural policy or any other form of industrial policy for that matter is not likely to lead to intelligent public choice conclusion the u s government has undertaken some policies that appear the case for extending the se policies to have been successful in increasing the productivity of u s agriculture namely promotion of research and the dissemination of information to farmers to industrial enterprises is very weak however since these industries are better structu r ed than farming enterprises to main tain private property rights over invention and information in any case even the successful agriculture policies have not been aimed at saving nor have they saved the high cost marginal producers of farm products th e number of farms has declined by two thirds over the last 50 years efforts in the late 1970s to provide llemergencyll credit and other help to the weakest enterprises have produced distortions and other damaging consequences very familiar to critics of chrysler style industrial bail outs there is nothing in the agricultural experience to support any of the llrescuell elements of industrial policy if industrial policy proponents are to learn a lesson from agriculture in this area the lesson is laissez faire the more dominant agricultural policies have involved governmental manage ment of farm production prices marketing and trade but the overall conclusion to be drawn from this set of activities is do not try them the complexity of public choice the difficulty of managerial decision making and above all the inevitable dominance of interest group politics suggest that the situat ion must be dire indeed for there to be any likelihood of improvement through governmental policy in short agricultural policy has been successful only in areas where it is not transferable to industrial policy and it has been a failure in those areas that could and would be trans ferred as a model for a national industrial policy it would be a grave mistake to adopt agricultural policy prepared for

the sale of a portion of td s investment in schwab to provide the capital required for the cowen acquisition increased cet1 by 49 basis points relating to the first horizon acquisition the net gain from the mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital increased cet1 by 35 basis points and an fx hedge increased cet1 by 12 basis points rwa increased 4 3 quarter over quarter reflecting higher credit risk rwa credit risk rwa increased 22 billion or 5 mainly reflecting the impact of fx higher volumes and risk migration market risk rwa decreased 1 7 billion or 7 reflecting lower exposures partially offset by market volatility the leverage ratio was 4 9 this quarter and the lcr ratio was 128 both well above published regulatory minimums i will now turn the call over to ajai ajai bambawale thank you kelvin and good afternoon everyone please turn to slide 19 gross impaired loan formations increased by 2 basis points to 14 basis points this quarter reflecting some normalization of credit performance please turn to slide 20 gross impaired loans was stable quarter over quarter and remained at cyclically low levels please turn to slide 21 recall that our presentation reports pcl ratios both gross and net of the partner share of the u s strategic card pcls we remind you that u s card pcls recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the bank s net income the bank s provision for credit losses increased 266 million quarter over quarter to 617 million or 29 basis points the increase was largely recorded in the canadian and u s consumer lending portfolios please turn to slide 22 the bank s impaired pcl was 454 million an increase of 114 million quarter over quarter largely related to some normalization of credit performance in our canadian and u s consumer lending portfolios the bank s impaired provisions remained well below pre pandemic levels performing pcl increased by 152 million to 163 million as reflected across the u s retail corporate and canadian personal and commercial banking segments for 2022 the bank s full year pcl rate was 14 basis points compared to a recovery of 3 basis points in 2021 the higher full year pcl rate was due to a smaller current year performing release and moderately higher impaired provisions please turn to slide 23 the allowance for credit losses increased by 445 million quarter over quarter to 7 4 billion reflecting the impact of foreign exchange deterioration in our economic forecast some normalization of credit performance and volume growth partially offset by release of overlays previously set aside for economic uncertainty the bank s allowance coverage remains elevated to account for ongoing uncertainty relating to the economic trajectory and credit performance now let me briefly summarize the year the bank exhibited strong credit performance this year as evidenced by cyclically low gross impaired loan formations gross impaired loans and impaired pcls while credit performance remained strong we saw some normalization in certain portfolios this quarter as credit metrics have come off their recent lows in addition economic risks remain elevated reflecting persistent inflation and rising interest rates and the increasing risk of a recession while results may vary by quarter i expect pcls to be higher in 2023 in the range of 35 to 45 basis points as credit performance continues to normalize and the economic trajectory unfolds to conclude td remains well positioned given we are adequately provisioned we have a strong capital position and we have a business that is broadly diversified across products and geographies with that operator we are now ready to begin the q a session follow toronto dominion bank ont nyse td follow toronto dominion bank ont nyse td or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator thank you the first question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead your line is open gabriel dechaine i have a couple of questions here one actually just the all bank nim based on your calculation of 7 basis points if you had a little bit smaller if i adjust for the trading stuff but if i compare that to the segments where canada is up 11 and the u s up 50 pretty huge can you give me a bit of a technical explanation as to why they might do some diversions there is that a wholesale funding issue at the top of the house or what kelvin tran it s kelvin tran here i ll take that question so as you said what we need to do we need to adjust it out for trading nii so the trading nii number is actually disclosed in our md a in the wholesale bank section there is a footnote underneath the table if you adjust for that and also for the trading loans for the volume you get to a core or non trading nim of 12 basis points quarter over quarter gabriel dechaine perfect we calculated ourselves it might be to compare methodology there my real question i guess is on the first horizon a subtle shift in timing expectations i guess last quarter you were guiding to close or expecting to close in fiscal q1 now first half what s prompting the delayed expectation of closing bharat masrani hi gabe this is bharat we re already in december gabe so we thought it was appropriate can you hear me gabe gabriel dechaine yes i can bharat masrani alright we re already in december and so we don t control the timing of all the regulatory approvals but we are confident that we will get closing within the time line that we ve put out gabriel dechaine is there i mean are they taking a closer look at anything are you anticipating having to make any adjustments to your product going up or your schedule in advance of the close bharat masrani no i m not aware of anything of the sort you re mentioning gabriel dechaine alright well thanks and enjoy the rest of the year and have a good holiday season bharat masrani thank you happy holidays to you as well gabe operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open meny grauman hi good afternoon i wanted to stick to a discussion of the margin up 11 basis points in canada 51 in the u s and just wondering if you think we ve hit peak margin expansion at td or could we see coming quarters with bigger sequential increases in the margin kelvin tran hi it s kelvin here so i would say first of all at the top of the house when you look at the total bank if forward rates are realized we expect that to be favorable to margins both because of rising short rates and also for tractors repricing on rates are higher than off rates a big part of the margin expansion story is that we ve seen significant rise in short rates so that provided a i would say a turbocharge to the margin expansion and so it really depends on the rise in the short rates going forward and i don t know whether michael or leo do you have anything to add on the customer dynamics front or balance sheet mix michael rhodes just this is michael and just for the canadian personal bank and i guess p c overall we expect nim to improve in the near term assuming that the forward curves that we see hold i think the dynamics are lining up well for us and so we would expect to see some further expansion

call over to jerome griffith jerome griffith thank you bernie good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter results our consumer is showing resiliency in the face of the uncertain macro environment stemming from the multi decade high inflation which is impacting buying decisions for discretionary purchases such as apparel despite these challenges our sales were only 1 below our outlook and our year ago results like others in our industry we saw consumer activity fluctuate during the quarter and we experienced particular softness at the end of the quarter we believe the sales softness at the end of october which continued into the early days of november also reflects a return to historical shopping patterns as compared with last year when demand was pulled forward due to consumer concern about inventory shortages our profitability this quarter was lower than we expected as gross margins for the quarter were pressured by increased raw material costs freight and the incremental promotional activity required by consumers as we experienced in the third quarter we expect that the industry will be very promotional during the holiday season due to the macroeconomic challenges and inventory challenges faced by our competitors while our inventory balance at the end of the quarter is 18 higher than a year ago and something we focus on daily given the inventory issues we see across our industry we believe in the value of our inventory and view it as a source of strength as we move forward we are very pleased that our in stock level is solid and we can fulfill anticipated consumer demand during the fall holiday season in order to be ready for the season we built an extra lead time on this year s receipts and the shipping delays have abated inventory came in early those early receipts account for two thirds of the year over year inventory increases we are showing the next largest driver of the inventory increases carryover basics and seasonal basics products which accounted for approximately 90 of our total inventory at the end of the third quarter as jim will discuss we see inventory returning to normalized levels by the end of the spring summer 2023 season we continue to be optimistic about the future and our brand is strong we continue to focus on controlling what we can despite the volatile environment by delivering a compelling assortment of products that meet our customers evolving needs despite the near term impact of higher costs we have seen some stabilization in our supply chain with freight rates declining from peak levels which should benefit cost of goods sold in 2023 i continue to be proud of our dedicated team that is working hard for our customers heading into the holiday season while online traffic was challenged during the quarter we were pleased that the u s e commerce conversion improved high single digit year over year which demonstrates that the customer continues to respond favorably to our product offerings our outfitters business continues to show strength led by national accounts driven by the broad based recovery in the travel and hospitality industry we had a solid back to school season where purchase habits returned to normalized patterns we are also pleased to see continued growth from our third party business in addition to double digit comparable sales at our retail stores next i will highlight our progress across our strategic growth pillars including product digital unit channel distribution and infrastructure beginning with product our customers continue to favor hybrid styles that can be dressed up or down and worn in a variety of settings our one closet focus and versatile assortment and fit is a critical component of our product offering the demand for versatile styles that are equally appropriate at work social events or home was particularly evident in women s with a strong response to our sweater blazer polished dresses and recover denim which uses recycled fibers in men s we saw strength in our supima tees and our no iron woven shirts denim as well as our no iron chino also performed well with men additionally we are seeing a favorable response to our wear now lighter transitional outerwear including fleece and rainwear which performed well given the warm start to the fall season we had a warm warmer warmest strategy with outerwear and our marketing focus adapts as our customer faces the worsening elements throughout the fall in winter season these positives were offset by the challenges in our kids business sleepwear and home furnishing offerings with a latter two category showing marked slowness from one year ago where demand was fueled by the pandemic we believe the trends in casualization and demand for hybrid life are here to stay our assortment is perfectly aligned with the consumer demand for made to move fabrics and styles that can be dressed up or down turning to marketing we are very pleased with the response we ve seen to the blake shelton collaboration which was introduced in september and offers men s women s kids and home product while still early this branded marketing campaign is performing well and expanding our to blake s broad audience we plan to build on this early success with spring summer and fall holiday 2023 collections blake has proven to be a great partner anywhere s lands end for the best reason he really likes it we also continue to deepen customer engagement through refining search and proving the effectiveness of our catalog and increasing our social media presence i m pleased that our customer engagement continues to generate healthy lifetime value over a long term duration as our customer has been shopping with us for an average of 18 years with this tenure we have very actionable data driven insights combined with our commitment to fit and quality which supports our buy now wear now focus midway into the holiday season we are capitalizing on the early success of our branded marketing efforts and shifting our focus from brand marketing towards a more targeted approach leveraging our buyer file of nearly 7 million to drive customer conversion and retention we anticipate a highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter and will continue to leverage our data driven strategies to optimize margin and remain competitive next on our unit channel distribution strategy while recognizing the challenging retail environment we remain encouraged with the progress we ve made we are pleased with our performance at kohl s both in 500 plus stores where we saw strength in our seasonal assortment and online where our full assortment is available to the kohl s shopper our business on amazon also continues to build momentum and continues to introduce new customers to the brand and while a small part of the business we are pleased with the exposure we are receiving on qvc and have recently launched on target com and walmart com we plan to seek additional distribution partners going forward as we see it as a way to reach more customers in our large addressable market finally our outfitters business benefited with a solid back to school season you will recall that we saw a pull forward in demand to the second quarter from the third quarter this year and overall school uniforms for the second and third quarters were up 12 compared to the same period last year our national accounts performed well given the return to travel and strength and hospitality while our small and mid sized accounts continue to experience macroeconomic headwinds we remain confident our investments in digital capabilities and personalization will drive improvement for this business over the long term turning to infrastructure we continue to focus on productive investments to improve the customer experience and drive operational efficiency during the quarter we implemented our transportation management system which was the first piece of our multi year warehouse management system installation to come online our implementation which is designed to support our business model through optimized transportation management and product visibility labor productivity improvements improved customer service levels and system modernization remains on track with that i will turn it over to jim jim gooch thank you and good morning we delivered adjusted ebitda that fell below our expectations due to the challenging macro headwinds impacted our topline and created incremental cost pressures while we expect these challenges to continue in the near term we will continue to focus on our operating model and execute against our strategic initiatives for the third quarter as compared to last year total revenue decreased 1 to 371 million the slowdown across the industry and consumer demand at the end of the quarter led to the slight revenue miss to guidance despite lower traffic as jerome mentioned we are pleased with our strong conversion rates demonstrating the consumer s positive response to our product our global e commerce sales decreased 5 from 2021 within that our u s e commerce business was fairly flat decreasing 1 from 2021 and our international business which was negatively impacted by inflation and geopolitical turmoil in europe decreased 20 in the quarter revenue for our third party business continues to be very strong increasing 60 as compared to the third quarter last year this increase was largely driven by kohl s particularly within women s seasonal apparel as well as growth in our other marketplaces in our outfitters business sales decreased 6 driven by the normalization of some of our travel related national accounts after accelerated purchases last year within school uniforms we are pleased with our overall performance for the season as parents return to regular purchasing patterns we also remain encouraged with the rollout of our improved personalization and customization capabilities we will continue to build out that model throughout 2023 moving to our retail business during the quarter we delivered revenue of 10 million with u s same store sales increasing approximately 13 from the third quarter of 2021 gross margin in the third quarter decreased to 40 approximately a 440 basis point decline from 2021 the margin pressure was driven by an incremental 7 million in shipping expenses increased industry wide promotional activity and margin mix from our growth in our third party business as a percentage of sales sg a was 36 a decrease of approximately 80 basis points to 2021 the basis point decrease was driven by continued expense controls across our entire business our performance led to a net loss for the quarter of 4 7 million or 0 14 per share compared to a net income of 7 4 million or 0 22 per share in 2021 in addition to these gaap measures adjusted ebitda is an important profitability measure that we used to manage our business internally for the quarter adjusted ebitda was 16 7 million below our expectations of 20 million to 24 million and compared to 29 8 million in 2021 the adjusted ebitda shortfall was primarily driven by gross margin pressure slightly offset by sg a reductions looking at the balance sheet inventories at the end of the quarter were 565 million compared to 480 million a year ago the 18 increase in inventory was primarily driven by early receipts for the upcoming fall and holiday selling seasons as well as carryover of basics inventory from prior seasons we ve taken appropriate actions to reduce purchases for the upcoming seasons and this combined with reduced lead times will allow us to normalize our inventory level by the end of spring summer 2023 regarding our debt at the end of the third quarter our term loan balance was 248 million and our 275 million abl had 160 million of borrowings outstanding turning to our guidance our fourth quarter and full year revised outlook reflects the headwinds presented by the macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures on the consumer we expect to see a significantly heightened promotional environment across the industry in the fourth quarter margin will also be pressured by the higher freight and supply chain costs that are reflected in our fall holiday inventory with this all in mind for the fourth quarter we expect net revenue to be between 510 million and 530 million we expect net income of zero to 3 million and diluted earnings per share to be between 0 00 and 0 09 we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million for the full year we now expect net revenue of 1 54 billion to 1 56 billion we expect a net loss of 9 million to 6 million and diluted loss per share to be between 0 27 and 0 18 we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 66 5 million to 71 5 million our guidance for the full year incorporates approximately 33 million in incremental shipping expenses with that i ll turn the call back over to jerome see also 25 wealthiest counties in america jerome griffith we are focused on making progress against our strategic initiatives however the current environment is very uncertain and volatile we are very pleased with our conversion rates showing the strength of our product offering and appeal to our customer in addition as stated earlier the consumer is responding more to promotions this season and we will be disciplined through our dynamic promotion and marketing initiatives to remain competitive and drive traffic where we can capitalize on those strong conversion rates our brand metrics remain very solid as we continue to see strength in our active buyers which reflects the long term resilience of our brands we have a highly loyal customer base with an average tenure of 18 years and we are confident that our performance will improve when the macro environment recovers as a result of the uncertainties in the marketplace we have revised our full year guidance as jim just reviewed before opening the call up to questions i would like to introduce andrew mclean who joined us last month as chief executive officer designate andrew is an accomplished retail executive with a proven track record of driving growth and will succeed me when i retire as ceo at the end of the fiscal year i am confident that under his leadership combined with our digitally driven business model and highly loyal customer base lands end has positioned for long term success i will continue to work with andrew over the next few months before he transitions into his new role and we expect a very smooth transition as we announced in september i will remain on the board following my retirement i also want to call out two additional appointments with the supply chain challenges that we and others in our industry have faced we are very excited to announce that jamin dick most recently head of supply chain for the north america b2b business at alibaba joined us in september as our chief supply chain officer secondly as we have been focused on driving growth in our third party business we have hired molly yearick who has had a long successful career in wholesale at pvh as well as other leading brands to help us further our expansion i believe we have the right people in place to leverage our strong brand unique business model and strategic initiatives to drive sustainable returns for our customers team and shareholders before i close i d like to give more detail on our holiday sales trends after initial softness we began to experience a pickup in traffic as we progressed through november and headed into cyber week although traffic trends remain volatile we ve seen that customers are positively responding to our product which resulted in strong conversion throughout november we expect the environment will remain very promotional and we plan to remain competitive with our pricings to drive traffic through the holiday season with that we will now take your questions follow lands end inc nasdaq le follow lands end inc nasdaq le or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator our first question comes from dana telsey with telsey advisory group your line is open dana telsey hello good morning everyone i wanted to touch on jerome can you expand at all on the customer environment what you re seeing both digitally and also in your third party business and you mentioned that sleepwear and home were the weaker categories is a level of promotions higher on those categories than it is others and just with black friday what did you see in terms of the promotional level versus 2019 and how you re planning the remainder and then i have a follow up thank you jerome griffith hey dana how are you doing thanks for the questions let s start with customer environment between digital and then also third party when we look at what s happening with our third party generally we still continue to see a build as you know we really didn t have a lot of third party business until 2018 when we started with amazon and then a couple years ago when we started up with kohl s and what we see is both of those businesses plus really our target business which we just started recently and walmart both continuing to grow and it takes a few years to really maximize what your potential is there and we see longer term continuing to grow with our third party on digital the customers looking really looking for promotions what we ve seen is that she ll buy key items and she ll buy the products that she s used to buying but she s looking for a deal i think customers are getting squeezed with food costs and with energy costs and also relooking at how they re spending their dollars for the holiday season but the other thing that we re seeing is if you remember last year there was the hue and cry with the supply chain and you better order early and you better get your order in because things are moving slowly and it s going to take a while to get your product i don t see that this year we definitely saw a shift in how the customer was shopping the end of october and beginning of november with traffic numbers because last year everybody shopped early before veteran s day but not this year in fact we re actually thinking that you re going to get more traffic as you get closer to christmas and really be back to what the 2019 trends look like because that s really kind of what we re seeing is the traffic pattern looks a bit like 2019 meaning getting back to what people are used to concerning sleep and home home has been a trend home is a huge trend up over the pandemic and we were recipients of that but as well as i do the home business is mostly sheets and towels and most of that is basics business for us so i m not concerned about any softness there because overall we ve really picked up in one of our home penetration is sleepwear we just over planned it sleepwear has been a big trend it s our second largest category in women s apparel it s done very well but people are responding to that when we get it at a price and that s really what the i think the overall message is that you ll move through inventory and you ll be fine but it s going to be at a price dana telsey got it and then jim can you expand on inventory levels and supply chain costs and how you would just qualitatively frame 2023 what tailwinds and headwinds maybe on the margin profile and then welcome andrew to lands end can you just talk a little bit about it s certainly early days what your vision is and how you see enhancing the lands end business and where focus will be thank you jim gooch yes thanks dana as we said even though our inventory is about 18 over last year overall we re pretty happy with the quality of the inventory that increase as jerome i think mentioned it s about two thirds of that is just because we brought in our receipts earlier than last year and that s a combination of this year s receipts as the supply chain normalizes with our lead times are coming in earlier and then compared to last year where many of our receipts were late the remainder of that 18 is mainly just our basics mostly from spring and summer where we had a little bit of softness and instead of marking those basics down we just decided to carry those over so we ll be normalizing those through as we repurchase the basics and most of that overage year over year will be normalized at the end of the year but i expect by next spring summer will be fully normalized back to appropriate levels when you look at the year over year balances dana telsey got it andrew mclean and i think dana it s nice to meet you i m really delighted to be here i think as we look forward it s really about picking up where jerome leaves off and i think for the beginning of the year that s really what jim s just been saying it s focusing on the inventory levels making sure that we get those back to the levels where we want them to be driving the product categories that really work and then generating gross margin from that and being able to drive profitability in the business i think as we get past that it s really early days for me but i look at all the channels we re in and there is opportunity in all of them and it s about picking the priorities as we move forward within those they re all great tremendous opportunity dana telsey thank you operator our next question comes from alex fuhrman with craig hallum your line is open alex fuhrman hey guys thanks for taking my question jerome congratulations on your retirement we ll certainly be sorry to see you go a couple things i wanted to ask one on the promotional environment that you re expecting for the fourth quarter i mean is that something you d say you re fully seeing already or is there more than expectation that there is going to be pretty pretty heavy kind of post christmas clearing in january as well and curious if there s any particular categories where you re seeing that promotional pressure and if you could comment on what you re seeing in jackets and outerwear jerome griffith sure no problem thanks alex let s first talk about the promotional environment what we re seeing is very highly promotional over the cyber week period i ll just throw out a couple of things you had competition old navy at 5 flannel pants and then the next day you saw target up with 5 flannel pants and it s all sleepwear related so we re not the only ones that have sleepwear but i think what you ll probably find over the course of the next couple of weeks is that people will back off promos a little bit i mean not much but a little bit because everybody is going to be in pretty decent stock shape but we end up with inventory gluts post christmas i think january is going to be a pretty clearance time and most of the people that have are over inventoried and listen i ve heard numbers out there some people are up 30 40 and some up to almost 50 from a year ago i think we re actually sitting in a pretty good position with plus 18 at the end of the third quarter we brought stuff in early so we d have the ability to fulfill as we went in through december and january and we re up against low fulfillment rates from a year ago so i think there s still some opportunity in there but i think people are going to be taking their categories that are things that over performed during the pandemic period and now are underperforming because what we re seeing is people are buying items like dresses to go out or sweater jackets denim has been a big seller in both men s and women s or chino pants in men s and men s jackets have also been working additionally transitional outerwear has been pretty positive our fleece our rainwear lighter weight down vests have all been performing relatively well for us it hasn t been cold enough out yet for our heavy outerwear to perform but we ve shifted that as we talked i think in the last quarter into the sorry during my comments today are the warm warmer warmest strategies and then we want to have more buy now wear now so we re expecting heavier outerwear turn on in december than into january alex fuhrman okay that s really helpful thanks and then i think you had mentioned on the conference call obviously everyone is seeing this as well that container costs from asia are down very significantly getting closer to pre pandemic levels when are you going to start to see that benefit in your reported gross margin next year jerome griffith go ahead jim jim gooch oh sorry yes you re absolutely right alex we are seeing those at times some of the spot market rates are getting close to pre pandemic levels those values get capitalized into inventory so as those receipts come in and then as you sell the inventory you ll start to realize that so we ll start to see some of it towards the end of spring and summer but most of that s going to hit next fall and holiday alex fuhrman okay that s really helpful and then lastly just jerome your commentary about sales being stronger the week of thanksgiving and cyber week i mean is that just kind of within the normal kind of cadence of that being an increasingly important week over the years or as you know was that actually a pleasant surprise given the trends you ve seen earlier in november was that a real pickup in demand and curious if you expect that to last for another maybe week or two into the holidays or to maybe resume at some point as we get closer to the end of the holiday season jerome griffith alex while cyber week is important from a volume standpoint the week we re in now is really the important week and we still are doing a lot of volume going into next week and the week after as well so what we see again is going back to trends from 2019 as far as traffic goes and what i think you re going to find is that and i think this will continue people are not seeing these huge big blockbuster kind of events like what used to have around it was thanksgiving back in the day but we call it cyber week now people binding up to get into stores to get great deals on tvs and things like that you don t see it it s a lot more of a friendly shopping environment out there and i think that demand gets spread over the course of time as time goes on i mean this is we ve talked about this before this is my 44th christmas and you ve seen shopping patterns really change over the course of the last several years and what we re seeing right now i think it s going to be a lot more egalitarian and a lot more thoughtful and you re going to see people buying up to the last shipping days in e commerce and up to christmas eve in stores so i still think that people are going to be cautious though about how much money they re spending that s why we re expecting to still see a pretty promotional environment out there through the holiday season and then into january alex fuhrman okay that s really helpful thank you guys very much jerome griffith sure alex operator thank you there

all other financial measures we disclose here are non ifrs and growth rates are compared to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise stated we also note that year over year comparisons are affected by acquisitions that were not included in our 2021 financials let me now turn the call over to ari arco s ceo ari de sa cavalcante neto thank you carina otero and i would like to present three main topics today first the conclusion of the 2022 cycle with 100 of acv recognition to a top line of brl1 561 billion representing a 48 year over year growth profitability improved in 2022 cycle with a 2 3 percentage point increase in adjusted ebitda margin second the significant improvement in the free cash flow to firm in the first nine months of 2022 mainly driven by a more efficient operation healthier working capital dynamic lower effective tax rate and lower capex as a percentage of revenues we are reaffirming the adjusted ebitda margin guidance for 2022 and expect to be closer to the bottom of the range and third the outlook for 2023 with commercial cycle for our pedagogical solutions indicating a strong 24 organic growth for the 2023 cycle and integration and efficiency initiatives leading to a better cash generation profile we are maintaining the adjusted ebitda margin guidance for fiscal year 2023 at 36 5 to 38 5 and reducing the capex guidance to 8 to 10 of net revenue this implies an ebitda minus capex margin above pre ipo levels finally the conclusion of isaac acquisition is progressing well the brazilian antitrust agency approved the acquisition of november 7 16th and we expect the closing to take place on january 2 2023 in the meantime we have a multifunctional team working in the back stage to make sure we are ready to integrate isaac and start extracting synergies gained from day one moving to slide 5 after two years delivering net revenue below the acv as covid 19 led to students dropping out of the school due to the healthy and economic reasons we delivered 100 of the 2022 cycle acv for both core and supplemental segments this outcome translates into a 48 year over year top line growth or a 34 organic growth when excluding solutions acquired in the cycle on slide 6 we show that the strong year over year top line growth was followed by an increase in profitability as we integrate our operations and start to benefit from the scale we created over time as a result cash gross margin increased 70 basis points to 80 and adjusted ebitda margin increased 230 basis points to 33 7 for the 2022 cycle i will now turn the call to otero who will continue the presentation otero please go ahead roberto otero thank you ari and good evening everyone thank you for your time as we concluded our m a agenda this year resulting in a complete and high quality portfolio of pedagogical solutions the focus turned 100 to integration and efficiency so we can benefit from our scale and generate more value to our stakeholders several initiatives were put in place since 2021 and the results for the first nine months of 2022 reflect our strong commitment to delivering higher cash generation with important improvement in four main areas adjusted ebitda working capital taxes and capex moving to slide 9 we managed to deliver flat cash gross margin and flat adjusted ebitda margin in the first nine months of 2022 despite the non recurring impact in the second quarter from stronger than usual additional orders that was only possible as we already generated over brl90 million in savings among cost and g a initiatives in the period or 14 above the brl80 million in savings expected for the full year as we disclosed in our 2021 arco day last december those initiatives include integrated printing and unified supply chain and tag teams on the cost side and reassessment of corporate processes on the g a side leading to reduction in third party services optimization of it tools and resizing of corporate personnel on slide 10 working capital became an important driver of cash generation as payment terms returned to normality once schools resumed in person classes as we revisited our collection process implementing better practices that aligned commercial and collection efforts as we added collection metrics to the salesforce scorecards as a result we saw days of sales outstanding reducing to 98 days 6 below third quarter 2021 level and much closer to pre pandemic levels and we also saw delinquency down to 4 this quarter from 6 in third quarter 2021 and 10 in the worst period of the covid 19 pandemic moving to slide 11 arco has been incorporated in acquiring businesses since 2019 unlocking tax benefits and significantly reducing its effective tax rate over time our most recent incorporation was geekie concluded in october with expected future annual tax savings of at least brl16 million as a result the nine month 2022 effective tax rate was 8 7 and we expect to end 2022 fiscal year with effective tax rate around 10 versus almost 18 in 2021 finally on slide 12 we ended the first nine months of the year with capex amounting to brl121 million or 11 of net revenues versus 15 in the nine months of 2021 this almost 400 basis point reduction reflects a higher level of cooperation across business units and higher discipline in the content development process as well as it projects focused on a centralized backbone slide 13 showcases the result of an all initiatives combined 130 increase year over year in the free cash flow to firm in the first nine months of this year to conclude this section of the presentation on slide 14 we present our cash position and financial investments position and obligation to schedule as of september 30 we ended the period with brl1 15 billion in cash and brl1 2 billion in loans and financing and brl1 5 billion in accounts payable to selling shareholders translating into 3 4 times net debt to adjusted ebitda multiple down 50 basis points from the third quarter of 2021 we are confident our cash position combined with future cash generation from operations is enough to cover for our short term obligations i ll now turn the call back to ari ari please go ahead ari de sa cavalcante neto thank you otero as i mentioned in our second quarter in 2022 earnings call we have already seen the results from our initiatives on several fronts in addition to the achievements mentioned by otero the work we are conducting with the consulting firm is progressing well and we have already made real progress to make arco a leaner and more agile company metrics such as operating cash flow generation in collection from delinquent schools we were added to our leadership kpis and all of that with growth we had a successful commercial cycle for 2023 school year as schools had their operations normalized we resumed our in person interactions visiting the schools and hosting in person events key elements to create and sustain a trustworthy relationship with our clients moving to slide 16 we present our acv guidance for the 2023 cycle of approximately brl1 930 billion representing a 24 organic growth versus 2022 cycle we were able to achieve historical levels of retention of partner schools while increasing prices on average 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points above expected inflation new student intake and upsell for both core and supplemental solutions showed strong organic growth year over year and successful cross sell initiatives led to an increase in the number of schools in our core base that uses at least one supplemental solutions to a 17 penetration i would like to highlight the performance of coc a solution we acquired at the end of last year and already delivered results after its first commercial cycle called inside ph arco with relevant improvement on all fronts nps scores improved 17 points to 66 and retention rate increased 15 percentage points to 95 additionally the average price increase was approximately 4 percentage points above expected inflation and total year over year acv growth of coc was over 30 moving to slide 17 we expect arco to continue to improve profitability as we maintain the adjusted ebitda margin flat at 36 5 and 38 5 but we reduced the range for capex as a percentage of revenue to 8 to 10 we will potentially take our adjusted ebitda minus capex metric to the highest historical level with that we conclude our presentations we will turn over now to otero for final remarks thank you roberto otero thank you ari i would like to conclude this call presenting recent developments as set forth in last night s press release and sec filings arco s board of directors received last night a preliminary non binding proposal from general atlantic and dragoneer to acquire all of the outside standing class a common shares of the company that are not held by them or the selling ph shareholders the proposal states that the founder support the transaction and we will roll over 100 of their class a and class b common shares in the proposed transaction in the event a transaction is consummated that we will maintain the same economic and voting interest in the company as they currently have the purchase price for each class a income we share in the proposal is 11 in cash the purchase price was proposed by general atlantic and dragoneer with no involvement from the founders is the decision related to the purchase price being offered this price represents an approximately 22 premium over yesterday s closing price of 9 04 per class a common share please note that there can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made that any agreement will be executed or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated at this point we have no additional information other than that was disclosed in the filings and cannot comment on the transaction therefore we dedicate today s q a session to comments related to q3 earnings the company will keep investors and the markets informed as new information is available operator we can now open for questions thank you follow arco platform ltd nasdaq arce follow arco platform ltd nasdaq arce or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator thank you the floor is now open for questions our first question comes from vitor tomita with goldman sachs please go ahead vitor tomita good evening everyone and thank you for taking our questions two questions from our side the first one is that we it s on provisions we had another quarter of bad debt provision reversals due to good collections thinking about working capital dynamics going forward how much longer may we expect to see that effects and could we still see provision reversals in the fourth quarter or even into 2023 that would be our first question and our second question would be on isaac could you give us some color on how isaac has performance since the acquisition announcement in early october and on whether you reiterate the guidance for isaac that was provided at the acquisition announcement in october thank you very much roberto otero hi vitor otero here thank you so much for the questions so looking at working capital dynamics i mean if we decompose working capital i would say that on accounts receivable we are pretty much back to what we consider to be a more normalized level even if you compare to pre pandemic days of receivables we re very close to that level and we have to also factor in that a core versus supplemental as a different profile okay in terms of these are receivables supplemental a bit longer than core and as supplemental grew in terms of size versus what it was in the past it also changes a little bit of the let s say steady state level of days of receivables so there s still some room to improve and to normalize okay especially with this 2023 sales cycle where we saw let s say the duration of the new contracts pretty much in line with normal levels so let s say that in 2023 we fully normalize but the size or the room for improvement is more limited where we will focus and where we expect to extract a further improvement in cash cycle is in suppliers and inventory so those inventories suffered especially during the pandemic where we saw demand below what we had been producing and expecting to deliver to our clients and with the late orders in the beginning of this year we also saw an increase in inventory days so this is a line that we expect a more important contribution to cash cycle normalization over the next two years and suppliers as well and in the case of suppliers is mostly because of the centralization in our supply chain area and the negotiation with the trading companies as our consolidated right so those would be i would say if we think from a contribution to cash cycle i would say that suppliers and the inventory from now on will be more important than receivables in terms of isaac it s limited what we can comment but what we can say is that performance so far has been quite strong they have actually exceeded their internal goals for new school addition for this year okay so they have surpassed what they expected to achieve the team is super excited i think the more we know the more we learned about their operations the more the higher our conviction that value creation will be enormous with this combination right so again performance has been very strong they have bit their goals for this year already and we expect the closing to occur in the first week of january okay so we ll have a full year of consolidated results with isaac in 2023 and no impact to arco s result in the 2022 vitor tomita very clear thank you very much operator our next question comes from lucca marquezini with itau bba please go ahead lucca marquezini good evening everyone ari otero thanks for taking our questions i ve got two questions from our side the first one will be regarding the acv guidance so considering the price increase above inflation can you please provide more detail on what has enabled such increase was there an improvement in the sales mix or the company was able to increase prices above inflation on a same school basis and then the second one would be regarding the guidance from margin so the company expects the margin to be flattish next year even though the capture of cost and sg a savings was faster than expected so could you please comment on what would be the detractor for the margin in this scenario thank you roberto otero hi lucca otero here thanks for the question so on the acv guidance yes that s correct so this was a cycle where we re back to the real price increase to our base of clients back to a more normalized profile of cohort and net dollar retention rate in our base offline so it was an important contribution but also but when we look in the number of new schools being added to our base it was also quite relevant i would say that even though we re not breaking down the number core grew above 20 and supplemental pedagogical solutions grew above 30 which was let s say a profile of growth in terms of the difference between core and supplemental that we re used to seeing before the pandemic all right so more or less this was the profile of growth when we breakdown between core and supplemental i would say that the key highlight of this cycle was coc which is a brand that belongs to pearson it s our first sales cycle with this brand and the acv grew over 30 and it s a pretty much a core solution right so it s a core solution growing over 30 so it s remarkable i mean when we see when we decompose this growth i would say that we consider to be a very high quality way of growing the brand because we saw nps improving we saw retention increasing substantially to 95 price increase around 12 13 ended up generating this 30 acv growth for a brand that had been shrinking in size for the past two years so i think it shows the rationale it confirms the rationale of the acquisition the strength of the brand and how fast we can turn around an operation like that so we are super proud of coc s performance this year in terms of the margin guidance you re right i mean the range remains the same but the expected margin for the year of 2023 implied an expansion versus 2022 okay so we don t expect 2023 margin to be at the bottom of the range we re pretty safe here in terms of the range we re bringing we still i would say that ebitda margin expansion could be stronger than that okay we are seeing actually we saw in the industry pulp and paper prices increasing in the market so this partially offsets the expected cost efficiency gains that we initially expected to collect next year still next year we will see another round of g a dilution and for the first time a more efficient a go to market strategy okay so this is something that we expect to show in our p l next year is a go to market or the cac coming more efficient and as we showed on the guidance presentation we are reducing the capex range for next year to between 8 to 10 which i mean is getting a pretty closer to the levels before covid and when we look at the ebitda minus capex metric which we consider to be a very fair metric to analyze the basis given the profile of the investments that we make in content and technology we see a very important expansion getting above actually getting to our expected highest level historically okay lucca marquezini that s very clear thank you operator our next question comes from fred mendes with bank of america please go ahead fred mendes hello good evening everyone and thanks for the call i have two questions i know there is a lot of limitation from what you can say but it s just more towards the process itself about the binding offer the first question is i mean you are incorporating in the cayman islands so just wondering if there is some kind of specifics that we should know that will be different from when a company is incorporating the u s or brazil from this process from binding offer that will be my first one and then my second one just to make sure the controlling group will not be participating in either ga on this special committee so we have eight people on your board so we talk about four people that we ll be composing this committee if i m correct and do you need a consensus decision among the board how that work in order to close the deal thank you very much roberto otero hey fred otero here thanks for the questions so with regards to specifics about being a cayman company unfortunately i cannot comment i cannot provide any more details other than those that were disclosed in the letter and in the charge billing agreement so both documents were disclosed and they describe a little bit of the mechanics here so unfortunately i cannot comment on anything that is not there unfortunately with regards to the committee so as you said an independent committee will be formed by the independent board members with the exclusion of those representing general atlantic so basically the independent committee would be composed by independent board members accept martinez okay so that s pretty much it fred mendes okay thank you very much otero thank you operator our next question comes from javier martinez with morgan stanley please go ahead javier martinez hi yes thank you otero i know that you said that you don t want to comment about the offer so let me ask it in a different question not about the offer but about the controlling family ari what are the strategic reasons for the family to support the offer is there any transaction in the pipeline that you justify going that way that would be my first question please roberto otero hey javier otero here i am really sorry i mean it s really limited what we can comment or provide in terms of a opinion or disclosure here so we have to be really limited to what has been disclosed yesterday and the letter sent to and the content that was in the letter sent to the board is pretty much what we can discuss and comment and the strategic rationale was not disclosed in the letter reason why i cannot comment or discuss here i m sorry javier martinez okay my second question will be on bookings i wondered if you can give us some color quantitative or qualitative color on the evolution of supplemental versus core roberto otero yes absolutely javier thanks for the question so supplemental as i said when you look at the pedagogical solutions and i say pedagogical solutions because we have technology features that are also booked under supplemental right so just not to mess things up here so when you look at the pedagogical subscription supplemental products we saw above 30 mid 30 s growth for 2023 and when we exclude international school from this number the number was above 40 for 2023 in case so we saw very important growth i would say that in the beginning of the year we had been calling attention that this year would be a year where social emotional learning would see an important growth we saw that so it was confirmed and also in the other two bilingual products as well right so i ll say from a quality perspective we expect this to be to have been a very good quality cycle with supplemental again mid 30s and when we exclude a brand that we don t have fully control right it was above 40 for next year cross sell continued to be a very important source of growth we expanded a few basis points percentage points sorry in terms of supplemental penetration in the core base so it continued but the addition of schools in what we consider in what we name blue ocean right which are the schools that do not use core solutions yet was also quite strong so i think we saw probably a more normalized profile of new school addition with both non core schools and core schools contributing to the overall growth in q4 earnings we plan to disclose those in more detail but from more a broad perspective this is what we can share at this at this point javier javier martinez understood my final question will be on margins just to go a little deeper on the question that we had before so i was wondering you can give us some reference on once we have normalized pulp and paper and full integration of all the platforms and acquisitions how far are we from maturities so what level of margins do you see as reasonable once we are in that situation roberto otero sure yeah i ll say that we have a still we still have a few brands which we consider to be subscale and this is a business of scale of course it depends on how you operate the business and i think that this is something that we are changing in a way that we can better collect the gains of scale but we still have some brands which are subscale so as they grow they contribute to the overall margins of the company i mean it s easy to see the business in the medium term with margins above 40 i mean we have as you know we have several brands with margins above 40 and it s less above the average ticket it s much more above the scale and the way you operate the business i mean as we ve been centralizing what we consider to be centralizable without finishing ph the quality without adding risk to grow we can accelerate the collection of that scale right so we accelerate the curve of scalability of the brands and this is the idea as we mentioned in the q2 in this previous earnings call we have now pretty much two consulting firms working with us in those projects which we consider to be extremely important i think over the last years with the several m a that we did it becomes really important to accelerate this integration agenda right it s something that lagged and now becomes a very important focus for us right so this will accelerate the absorption of this profitability coming from scale so it s pretty realistic to imagine the business crossing 40 ebitda margin in a few years javier martinez thank you roberto if i may ask a final question i was wondering if isaac shareholders so once the deal gets approved obviously because they will be as part of the shareholders getting 11 or they will rollover like the family the controlling family how i don t think you have mentioned that one roberto otero again i mean i cannot speak for them if at that point in a theoretical transaction they are part of the shareholder base they will be treated as other minority shareholders right so but i mean i cannot comment on that it s all theoretical at this point javier martinez okay understood thank you very much operator at this time we have no further questions in the queue that concludes arco s third quarter 2022 earnings call thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day
zumiez inc nasdaq zumz q3 2022 earnings call transcript december 1 2022 zumiez inc beats earnings expectations reported eps is 0 36 expectations were 0 17 operator good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the zumiez inc third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode we will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference before we begin i d like to remind everyone of the company s safe harbor language today s conference call includes comments concerning zumiez inc s business outlook and contains forward looking statements these forward looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call are not based on historical facts and are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially additional information concerning a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information that will be discussed is available in zumiez s filings with the sec at this time i d like to turn the call over to rick brooks chief executive officer mr brooks richard brooks hello and thank you everyone for joining us on the call with me today is chris work our chief financial officer i ll begin today s call with a few remarks about the third quarter before handing the call to chris who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail after that we ll open the call to your questions the economic headwinds we discussed at the end of the second quarter continue to impact our business in the third quarter compared to the year ago period when consumers were flushed with record levels of savings to the us stimulus and child tax credit measures we ve seen a dramatic shift in consumer sediment across the retail landscape as inflation levels remain elevated we continue to see a pullback in our consumers discretionary spending this industry wide softness has led to an increasingly promotional domestic environment with consumers appearing to trade down to less expensive options in addition to these challenges our international concepts are also faced with a major headwind this quarter as they saw their very solid currency neutral growth completely offset by unfavorable foreign currency movement these demanded currency dynamics along with inflation driven cost and expense pressures made for a very difficult operating environment compared to the year ago period we spoke to you at the end of the second quarter we assume that these difficult trends impacting the broader retail sector would continue to intensify into the third quarter remain flexible and agile as a quarter progressed focusing on the areas of the business that we can control to help offset some of the ongoing pressure where our results were down significantly year over year we able to deliver sales and eps results that were better than our most recent outlook provided in early september some bright spots during the period included we exceeded our sales expectations this quarter as the back to school season played out slightly better than expected in the us we saw sales growth of 13 8 year over year in our european and australian markets on a currency neutral basis and while negative currency fluctuations mass this on reported basis we are pleased to see the continued efforts of our teams operating our international concepts product margins decreased only 40 basis points compared to the year ago period despite an increasingly promotional retail environment and increased mixed pressure as our international entities continue to grow in share overall expense management was strong with majority of our loss to prior year driven by the top line sales decline our model chooses to be highly sensitive to sales fluctuation with sales increases showing a large flow through to the bottom line and a reverse impact during a sales downturn inventory was managed well with an overall foreign exchange adjusted increase of only 6 3 driven primarily by our international entities with larger store growth while us inventory was up only 1 3 earnings per share of 0 36 in the third quarter was higher than our guidance driven primarily by flow through on incremental sales and substantial work was completed on our long term initiatives including the opening of 35 new stores since this same time last year with nearly half of those stores further in our international expansion looking ahead we expect continued top and bottom line pressure because a current economic environment and remain cautious in our near term outlook that chris will share shortly while our business trajectory is softened in the short term we remain very confident in the long term outlook for zumiez as manager team we remain focused on building and positioning the business for long term sustainable growth for over 40 years zumiez has endured multiple business and fashion cycles emerging each time a stronger and more profitable company for example in 2008 and 2009 we saw annual comparable sales down 6 5 and 10 respectively only to be followed by comparable sales increases of 11 9 8 7 and 5 over 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this outcome to run the most challenging economic periods in recent memory should inspire confidence in the resiliency of our flexible customer centric strategy and a strong brand and culture that ll position zumiez well for driving shorter value once the economic environment becomes more favorable as we like to say periods of significant change create opportunities and companies have the right people strategies and resources in place can take advantage of times like this to advance their brand and their business obviously the operating environment in 2022 has proven to be one of the more difficult periods in our industry but the original philosophies goals and ideals on which we built this business remain the same and will serve us as well today as they did during the last major economic downturn with that i ll turn the call to chris who ll discuss financials chris christopher work thanks rick and good afternoon everyone i m going to start with a review of our third quarter results i ll then provide an update on our fourth quarter to date sales trends before providing some perspective on how we re thinking about the remainder of the year third quarter net sales were 237 6 million down 17 9 from 289 5 million in the third quarter of 2021 the year over year decrease in sales was primarily driven by the benefits from domestic stimulus in the prior year as well as increased macroeconomic headwinds as inflation weighted on consumer discretionary spending during the current year quarter growth was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points related to unfavorable changes in foreign currency from a regional perspective north america net sales were 206 3 million a decrease in 19 9 from 2021 other international net sales which consists of europe and australia were 31 3 million down 2 3 from last year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in north america net sales decreased 19 6 and other international net sales increased 13 8 compared with 2021 from a category perspective all categories were down in comparable sales from the prior year during the quarter with men s being our most negative followed by hardgoods women s accessories and footwear third quarter gross profit with 82 million compared to 114 7 million in the third quarter of last year gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34 5 for the quarter compared to 39 6 in the third quarter of 2021 the 510 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales in the quarter driving deleverage in our fixed cost as well as rate increases in several areas store occupancy costs deleveraged by 250 basis points on lower sales volumes web shipping costs increased by a 100 basis points distribution center costs deleveraged by 70 basis points buying and private label costs deleveraged by 40 basis points product margins decreased by 40 basis points and shrink increased by 30 basis points in the quarter sg a expense was 71 5 million or 30 1 of net sales in the third quarter compared to 74 8 million or 25 8 of net sales a year ago the 430 basis point increase in sg a expenses as the percent of net sales resulted from the following 220 basis points in our store wages tied to both deleverage on lower sales as well as wage rate increases 120 basis points related to other store operating costs primarily impacted by lower sales levels 90 basis points in non store wages and 30 basis points in corporate costs these increases were partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in annual incentive compensation operating income in the third quarter of 2022 was 10 4 million or 4 4 of net sales compared with 39 8 million or 13 8 of net sales last year net income for the third quarter was 6 9 million or 0 36 per diluted share this compares to net income of 30 7 million or 1 25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2021 our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 is 27 9 compared with 25 5 a year ago period the tax rate in the quarter is inflated due primarily to the allocation of income across entities and the exclusion of net losses in certain jurisdictions turning to the balance sheet the business ended the quarter in a strong financial position see also 11 best micro cap dividend stocks to invest in and 25 wealthiest counties in the us we had cash and current remarkable securities of 141 1 million as of october 29th 2022 compared to 338 1 million as of october 30th 2021 the 197 million decrease in cash and current remarkable securities over the trailing 12 months was driven primarily by share repurchases of 183 1 million resulting in reduction of our shares outstanding over the last year of 17 5 we also had capital expenditures of 24 7 million partially offset by cash generated through operations of 26 6 million as of october 29th 2022 we had no debt on the balance sheet and continue to maintain our full unused credit facilities we ended the quarter with 177 2 million in inventory up 1 2 compared with 175 1 million last year on a constant currency basis our inventory levels were up 6 3 from last year overall while slightly more aged our north america inventory is healthy and continues to sell the favorable margin internationally our inventory is more current than the same time last year and we have seen margins improved during the quarter total sales for the 31 day no sorry now to our fourth quarter to date results total sales for the 31 day period ended november 29th 2022 decreased 23 9 compared to the same 31 day period in the prior year ended november 30th 2021 comparable sales for the 31 day period ended november 29th 2022 were down 24 8 from the comparable period in the prior year from a regional perspective net sales for our north america business for the 31 day period into november 29th 2022 decreased 27 7 over the comparable period last year meanwhile our international business decreased 4 versus last year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation north america net sales decreased 27 4 and under other international sales increased 7 7 compared with 2021 from a category perspective all categories were down in comparable sales for the fourth quarter to date men s with our largest negative category followed by hardgoods accessories women and footwear with respect to our outlook i want to remind everyone that formulating our guidance involves some inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating sales product margin and earnings growth given the variety of internal and external factors that impact our performance with that in mind we are currently expecting the total sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 will be between 258 million and 265 million consolidate operating profit as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter is expected to be between 3 4 and 4 7 and we anticipate diluted earnings per share will be roughly 0 36 to 0 51 now i want to give you a few updated thoughts on how fourth quarter guidance rolls into our fiscal 2022 results with the first three quarters of 2022 behind us we remain cautious in how we re looking at the full year given the operating environment and the current headwinds we are facing inclusive of the fourth quarter guidance we anticipate the total sales will be down in the 20 to 21 range in fiscal 2022 compared to 2021 in fiscal 2021 we achieve peak product margins once again representing our six year in a row product margin expansion as we have moved through the first three quarters of the year we have closely managed inventory and seen only a modest decline in product margin despite inflationary pressures a promotional environment and mixed pressures between categories and across countries we continue to believe we will see some product margin erosion in the fourth quarter and are planning the fourth quarter to be down approximately 50 basis points from the prior year at our current guidance we continue to manage costs across the business however with our current sales projections we are anticipating deleverage across the fixed cost of the business we currently anticipate the fiscal 2022 operating margin will be between 2 6 and 3 based upon the drop in sales inflationary cost pressures and the return to normal for items like mall hours travel and training and events diluted earnings per share for the full year is currently planned to decrease less than operating profit related to the share we purchased earlier in the year we currently anticipate 2022 diluted earnings per share to be between 0 85 and 1 we are currently planning our business assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 33 we are planning to open approximately 33 new stores during the year including approximately 16 stores in north america 13 stores in europe and four stores in australia and we expect capital expenditures for the full 2022 fiscal year to be between 27 million and 29 million compared to 16 million in 2021 with most of the increased tied to the additional stores in 2022 we expect that depreciation and amortization excluding non cash lease expense would be approximately 20 8 million down 3 from the prior year and we are currently projecting our share count for the full year to be approximately 19 4 million diluted shares with that operator we d like to open the call up for questions follow zumiez inc nasdaq zumz follow zumiez inc nasdaq zumz or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator thank you and today s first question will come from sharon zackfia with william blair please go ahead sharon zackfia hey good afternoon i guess two questions you ve obviously kind of kept the pedals of the metal here on development and i know historically it s definitely paid off to grow during times like now but i wonder just given the severity of the slowdown that we re seeing if you are kind of maybe rethinking what you might do in 2023 with the potential for rents to even get more favorable if the consumer continues to weaken and the retail environment stays shaky and then secondarily i just wanted to kind of ask about the fourth quarter outlook because i think it does imply kind of a 23 to 26 year over year decline but you do have easier comparisons in december and january than you had in november i think your sales were like up double digits november last year and then got weaker as the quarter went on as a lot did with omicron are you seeing something that makes you just even more nervous even against those easier comparisons as we go into december and in january and like kind of counterbalancing that as well with the early holiday sales we saw in october november last year i know that was like a 300 part question and i apologize richard brooks all right thank you sharon for those questions i ll take the first one and let chris take the second one so your first question are we rethinking around our growth initiatives for 2023 relative to where the business is at well of course we are i think that s a natural aspect of what we re going to do and of course 2023 we don t know where 2023 is going to end up we re not prepared to talk about that today but i think a natural expectation would be that yes we ll have these conversations with our board about what our plan is where the opportunities are and where the most crucial investments are now i think the good news here from my perspective sharon is we ve been through these cycles many times and we know how to manage through them i think we re pretty good at managing through them there s a i think we could talk about why they appear to be so severe for us particularly relative to sales on the bottom line we re all going to be pretty comparable we re just getting to the bottom line differently because nature of our business we don t have to discount as much on the top line because of the nature of our business relationship with our brand partners so yes we are we ll rethink those things but i will tell you that there are we are committed to pushing forward our long term initiatives our long term strategies that are about meeting consumer expectations over the long term and where we really believe we have to adapt and evolve our business significantly there are a number of critical areas we re going to do that and a lot of them aren t actually very capital intensive from that perspective as to how we allocate our resources and deploy some capital relative to technology but there are some critical things we ve got to do i think in that respect to make sure that when we emerge from this which we will emerge from this cycle as we always have from these tougher cycles we re going to emerge stronger better and be able to gain more market share so i think you ll see us potentially moderate some growth again we re not relative ready to talk about that today that is an ongoing discussion with our board but we re going to main prudent and prudently disciplined about investing the things we really believe are going to drive the business forward in terms of again what we have to do to meet future consumer expectations as we re defining them and as our long term strategies and initiatives address those expectations christopher work sure and to your second question just around q4 and the outlook and how we re thinking about the decline in sales and then matching that up against the comparisons to what we saw last year i think where we stand here is when we reported to you after back to school we were a little more optimistic about where q4 would come out and how the sales trends and clearly we believe as a full price full margin retailer we are seeing more pressure than others especially as we ve been able to generally hold price so i think when we look at our consumer and we look at kind of savings rates declining and credit card spending increasing and our real move to value not to mention the impact of inflation on them in other areas of their life as well as retail and then just that pressure we ve talked about throughout the year for that discretionary dollar whether it be restaurants travel or other areas of just cost of living so i think we put all that together in our thought process sharon and coming up with the sales plan of 258 million 265 million was really to say let s stay true to this run rate because this was a little below where we thought it would be for november so we kind of took this run rate forward especially pretty much across all of our entities we assumed a little bit better in europe as you may recall in europe last year there were some closures in one of our important markets in austria that happened right towards the end of november and into october right up to christmas pretty much so we assumed a little bit of run right there and then really tried to just kind of think that that s what our consumer might be feeling as we move through the quarter so that s how we plan the quarter on the sales side

lordhenrivoton thesis delaware enhanced global dividend and income fund dex is an equity cef from the delaware macquarie asset management family as per its literature the fund invests globally in dividend paying or income generating securities across multiple asset classes including but not limited to equity securities of large well established companies securities issued by real estate companies including real estate investment trusts and real estate industry operating companies debt securities such as government bonds investment grade and high risk high yield corporate bonds and convertible bonds and emerging market securities the fund also utilizes enhanced income strategies by engaging in dividend capture trading option overwriting and realization of gains on the sale of securities dividend growth and currency forwards the fund is down 13 this year on a total return basis in line with the s p 500 as of the writing of this article what is particular regarding this small cef from delaware macquarie is the fact that the vehicle is supposed to be merged into agd the way the process works is via an initial vote by agd s board of directors regarding the merger that step was successfully completed back in august the next items on the agenda here are shareholder votes of approval for the merger from both agd and dex it seems that this is where a snafu was hit with the dex shareholders unhappy with what was put forward dex shareholders one of the largest shareholders in dex is bulldog investors as per their own investor update from september 2022 bulldog currently owns over 5 of delaware enhanced global dividend and income fund â dexâ dex recently announced that it intended to merge into abrdn global dynamic dividend fund â agdâ however both cefs trade at wide discounts of about 11 so this merger presents no apparent benefit to shareholders in fact shareholders of dex will be worse off in our opinion because dex conducts a small self tender offer each year at 98 of nav which tends to keep the discount from blowing out agd has no similar policy to control its discount promptly after the announcement we submitted a shareholder proposal to dex and may actively oppose the proposed merger unless management agrees to provide for a liquidity event prior to consummating it bulldog is an active investor that demands accountability and a quid pro quo in terms of their vote for the merger delaware macquarie are pressed to ensure the merger succeeds because they are winding down their cef business they cannot have stragglers left behind therefore in order to appease bulldog the fund managers are putting forward a share repurchase program that will monetize the large discount to nav present for the fund philadelphia business wire today delaware enhanced global dividend and income fund the â fundâ a new york stock exchange listed closed end fund trading under the symbol â dexâ announced that its board of trustees the â boardâ has authorized an issuer tender offer to purchase for cash up to 30 or 3 186 291 of its issued and outstanding common shares without par value the â tender offerâ the tender offer is contingent on the shareholder approval of proposal 1 the reorganization of the fund into arbdn global dynamic dividend fund the â acquiring fundâ a new york stock exchange listed closed end fund trading under the symbol â agdâ the â reorganizationâ at the fundâ s upcoming adjourned special meeting of shareholders that will take place on december 12 2022 the â special shareholder meetingâ the commencement of the tender offer is pursuant to an agreement between the fund and bulldog investors llp â bulldogâ and certain associated parties pursuant to the agreement bulldog has agreed to be bound by certain standstill covenants the fund has been advised that bulldog will file copies of the relevant standstill agreement with the u s securities and exchange commission â secâ as exhibits to its schedule 13d the dex shares rallied substantially on the back of the announcement despite the wider equity markets being fairly flat or down total return seeking alpha ultimately the dex shareholders have a 3 to 4 net bump up from the announcement given a 30 tender offer amount that gives holders a 10 narrowing of the discount the discount to nav drove most of the move up in dex with the fund experiencing a 4 narrowing of the difference between market value and net asset value data by ycharts we can see the sudden narrowing in the discount once the announcement came through outcome for cef holders existing shareholders in the cef have gotten a bump up in price on friday driven by the share repurchase news we feel the corporate action and the vote to merge into agd will move forward this will result in a soft bottom for the discount to nav until the share repurchase is completed subsequently any substantial divergences in discounts to nav between dex and agd should be bought conclusion dex is an equity cef from the delaware macquarie asset management family delaware macquarie are winding down their cef business and trying to merge their funds into aberdeen cefs dex is set to merge with agd subject to shareholder approvals one of the largest investors in dex namely bulldog investors did not want to move forward with the approval unless the cef management created some value for shareholders through a corporate action we have now seen a share repurchase proposal put forward that is set to repurchase up to 30 of outstanding shares at par contingent on the merger being approved with the fund trading at a 12 discount to nav prior to the announcement there is a healthy 3 to 4 bump up that was realized yesterday in the market post the announcement it is interesting to note that the two cefs were trading at similar discounts after the august merger announcement hence there was no scope for a merger arbitrage trade here however through their large positioning in dex bulldog investors has managed to persuade the cef management team to create shareholder value via par share repurchases in exchange for a merger approval a true shareholder revolt with a constructive outcome
from left bishop w christopher waddell first counselor bishop l todd budge second counselor and presiding bishop gérald caussé chat with volunteers and missionaries at the bishops storehouse at welfare square in salt lake city on wednesday sept 7 2022 editor s note this is the next part of an inside church headquarters series on the presiding bishopric walking down aisles of food at the bishops storehouse at welfare square in salt lake city the presiding bishopric greeted missionaries and volunteers one by one praising them for keeping the facility clean and organized one of those missionaries was elder jordan coulam it was the 21 year old s first day serving at the bishops storehouse at welfare square having stocked many of the shelves elder coulam felt grateful the presiding bishopric noticed his efforts and he was quick to acknowledge it wasn t about him there s a very strong spirit here elder coulam told the church news from where he stood at the entrance of the storehouse he pointed out seven images he could see of the savior ministering to people whether stocking shelves or helping fill orders it s about ministering to the one elder coulam said presiding bishop gérald caussé said he and his counselors bishop w christopher waddell and bishop l todd budge are humbled by faithful members like elder coulam they meet throughout the world from left bishop w christopher waddell first counselor presiding bishop gérald caussé bishop l todd budge second counselor are interviewed at the bishops storehouse at welfare square in salt lake city on wednesday sept 7 2022 laura seitz deseret news the church is all about people bishop caussé said as part of the inside church headquarters series the presiding bishopric spoke to the church news from the bishops storehouse at welfare square providing a glimpse into the church s vast welfare and humanitarian efforts around the world welfare and humanitarian efforts are more than food the sights and smells of the bishops storehouse remind bishop caussé of his career working with supermarket chains and food distribution companies i m in many ways doing the same things bishop caussé said of his role as presiding bishop of the church i m still managing distribution systems but it s all different at the same time it s still very demanding challenging in many ways but it is easier because the lord helps it strengthens my testimony that this is the lord s work the bishops storehouse at welfare square is one of 124 bishops storehouses in operation worldwide at bishops storehouses individuals in need work with their local leaders to receive food and other items free of charge the church operates 32 farms ranches orchards and processing facilities which produced over 100 million pounds of food last year according to the church s 2021 annual report approximately 36 million pounds were distributed to bishops storehouses while 44 million pounds were donated through community initiatives corn is harvested on a church farm in layton utah on tuesday aug 18 2020 the corn is canned and sent to the bishops central storehouse in salt lake city for national distribution the church of jesus christ of latter day saints food production and distribution is only one part of the church s welfare and humanitarian efforts in 2021 as stated in its annual report the church expended 906 million to help those in need through fast offering assistance which provides temporary financial help to those in need which provides temporary financial help to those in need bishops orders for goods including giving food and commodities from bishops storehouses and deseret industries stores to those in need including giving food and commodities from bishops storehouses and deseret industries stores to those in need humanitarian projects including charitable relief in communities across the world including charitable relief in communities across the world donated commodities including church produced goods provided to communities through food banks and other agencies including church produced goods provided to communities through food banks and other agencies donated clothing including discounted or free apparel given to di including discounted or free apparel given to di church operations including family services counseling employment centers farms and food processing facilities and deseret industries stores none of this would happen without the generosity of the members who donate of their money resources and time bishop caussé said it humbles me to see their examples and this is happening all around the world helping others and reaching out to those in need is at the heart of the gospel of jesus christ he said we wouldn t be the church of jesus christ if we did not follow or strive to follow his example every day one of the things that he showed us to do is love our neighbor as ourselves he taught us about the two great commandments to love god and love our neighbor these are our brothers and sisters all around the world bishop waddell said from emergency response to food security to vision care we are there the savior did what he did to bless lives and to set an example for us he tells us do the things you ve seen me do and so as a church we re doing what we can to follow his example the church strives to bless lives and serve as an example for all of us to reach out and care for those in need what is the difference between church welfare services and humanitarian aid bishop caussé explained that the church s welfare services are generally intended to bless latter day saints in need while humanitarian aid is typically for all of god s children welfare includes fast offerings self reliance services and food production and distribution humanitarian aid includes disaster relief and initiatives for food security and clean water church welfare is designed to be short term assistance that builds long term self reliance bishop waddell said sometimes when people think welfare in society they think handout the church s view of welfare is very different it s not the hand out it s the hand up it s trying to lift by lifting people by giving them an opportunity to rise up and overcome the challenges of life and to gain self confidence and self respect it s a remarkable thing to see bishop w christopher waddell first counselor in the presiding bishopric visits with people in ecuador in may 2016 after a devastating earthquake on april 16 2016 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints though welfare and humanitarian efforts can be viewed separately bishop budge said there isn t a clear line dividing them for example some of the humanitarian work the church does helps members living within the areas where aid is provided fueled in part by humanitarian donations the welfare system and the humanitarian system bless everyone he said church members have the opportunity to fast for a 24 hour period each month and donate a generous fast offering which is the value of the meals missed or more the lord trusts bishops to administer these resources to bless people in need in their ward boundaries surplus is sent to the stake and then to the church to be used for needs wherever they exist the law of the fast bishop caussé said is really the core of every welfare system in the church this is something that is unifying members of the church throughout the world building self reliance a year after typhoon haiyan one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded devastated the philippines in 2013 bishop caussé visited the city of tacloban the church had provided materials after the storm to help filipinos rebuild their homes while rebuilding many learned skills such as carpentry plumbing and construction management a newly called counselor in the presiding bishopric at the time bishop caussé visited a vocational school in tacloban and saw firsthand the impact of the church s aid we had hundreds literally hundreds of our members receiving vocational training to acquire job skills to find a job or develop their own businesses this is what welfare is bishop caussé said the view on tacloban city philippines from calvary hill z jacobs stock adobe com in october 2021 general conference president russell m nelson announced a temple would be constructed in tacloban just think of everything that happened in the past few years and how the welfare system of the church and the principles of welfare have helped people get ready for a temple to be built bishop caussé said each humanitarian project the church is involved in has a goal of self reliance he said for us self reliance is a principle of salvation it s a spiritual principle every time we ask the question how are we helping people help themselves expansion of the church s humanitarian efforts in september the church made two multimillion dollar donations to humanitarian organizations to help care for those in need the 32 million donation to the united nations world food programme marked the church s largest one time contribution to a humanitarian organization to date the donation presented by bishop budge in rome italy on sept 14 will help provide food and critical assistance to 1 6 million people facing food crises in nine countries on sept 21 the church announced a 5 million donation to unicef to help fight global malnutrition among children under age 5 in up to 24 countries women and children at a malnutrition screening session in the village of ngolo in the northern region of burkina faso mothers learn how to measure their children and receive a demonstration of preparing enriched porridge the church of jesus christ of latter day saints president dallin h oaks first counselor in the first presidency said in his october 2022 general conference address the church of jesus christ is committed to serving those in need and it is also committed to cooperating with others in that effort related story recent 37 million in church donations come after a year of unprecedented giving and service since bishop caussé was first called to the presiding bishopric 10 years ago the church s humanitarian budget has increased tenfold bishop caussé listed two of many ways this dramatic increase was achieved collaboration with organizations and planning with church areas we want to reach out to the most vulnerable populations people that really are in need anywhere in the world regardless of their nationalities their race or their faith bishop caussé said it s important to be in every place where there is a great need there are countries where we don t have a lot of members yet we are there working in collaboration with humanitarian organizations to help the people we have developed relationships with a network of organizations good organizations that we can trust in every part of the world and so this enables us to reach a higher scale such relationships are being established by local areas this work is not directed from salt lake city bishop caussé continued we have in every area of the church teams that work under the direction of the area presidencies and have developed those local relationships bishop waddell noted that each of the church s 23 geographic areas has a five year humanitarian plan based on needs in that part of the world then we work together to meet the needs that are real everywhere in the world he said with 8 billion people on earth the church s membership of nearly 17 million is relatively small by working with others bishop waddell said we re able to expand our reach we re able to get to places that we wouldn t be able to get to otherwise it really multiplies in many ways what we can do a missionary donates blood in santa cruz bolivia as part of a blood drive with santa cruz regional blood bank and the church of jesus christ of latter day saints on oct 16 2021 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the church s humanitarian efforts in 2021 included 3 909 projects in 188 countries the most projects and the most countries to date in 2020 the church and its members participated in 3 611 projects in 160 countries and in 2019 3 221 projects in 142 counties the covid 19 pandemic provided an opportunity to build relationships with organizations the church hadn t worked with before particularly in africa and asia bishop caussé added this is creating foundations that we believe are going to help us expand our reach in the future across christianity and other faiths bishop budge said there s a common sense of love and desire to reach out and bless others by collaborating with other organizations we find common ground with others blessing the givers and receivers another way the church is expanding its reach is through the time talents and service that individual members provide throughout the world bishop budge said in 2021 latter day saints contributed 6 8 million hours of volunteer work more than 21 500 new community projects were facilitated using justserve a church sponsored program that matches volunteers with organizations in need a scripture in the doctrine and covenants teaches that men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will bishop budge said quoting doctrine and covenants 58 27 i believe our members live that principle they engage in good causes all over the world of their own free will and choice church volunteers including members and missionaries help those affected by the july 2021 floods in germany the church of jesus christ of latter day saints bishop caussé said the church wants to bless both the givers and the receivers by providing opportunities for members to participate in projects it s not about sending a check it s much more than this bishop caussé said it s about our members getting involved and supporting practicing our religion involves helping others i think a big part of what the church does is provide opportunities for its members to live the gospel this is one of the ways that we can involve members in following the example of the savior related story hurricane ian volunteer disaster

every month we ask our freelance writer investors to share their top ideas for dividend stocks to buy with you here s what they said for december british american tobacco what it does british american tobacco manufactures and sells cigarettes tobacco and other nicotine products by harshil patel british american tobacco lse bats currently offers a 6 5 dividend yield having consistently paid dividends every year for over 25 years i m comfortable that this cash generative business will be able to continue to do so over the coming years it s a cheap and profitable business that achieved almost 10bn of free cash flow last year much of that has benefited shareholders through dividends and share buybacks i d note that this industry is affected by tight regulation and high levels of taxations also cigarette sales are slowly falling that said much of this is more than offset by higher prices the end result for british american tobacco is higher profit looking forward bat is well placed to benefit from trends towards e cigarettes it expects this part of the business to reach 5bn in sales in the next three years overall these income shares still look attractive to me and warrant an increase in my current position harshil patel owns shares in british american tobacco tritax big box reit what it does tritax big box reit is a real estate company that invests in large scale logistics warehouses and lets these out to retailers by edward sheldon cfa i have chosen tritax big box reit lse bbox as my top income stock to buy this month it currently offers a prospective dividend yield of around 4 5 one reason i like bbox is that the company is well placed to benefit from the long term growth of online shopping looking ahead retailers are likely to need more access to strategically located distribution warehouses as online sales increase another reason is that the company s warehouses are let out to blue chip tenants such as tesco m s and amazon these kinds of tenants are quite defensive in nature it s unlikely that they would be unable to pay their rent it s worth noting that tritax sometimes needs to raise additional money from investors through share placings to expand its real estate portfolio these can push its share price down temporarily i m comfortable with this risk though that s because these share placings ultimately fuel long term growth edward sheldon owns shares in tritax big box reit and amazon airtel africa what it does airtel africa provides telecoms and mobile money services primarily across east and west africa by royston wild the airtel africa lse aaf share price remains in the doldrums following half year financials in late october as a value investor i think this stock represents a top dip buying opportunity for me firstly the telecoms firm s current forward dividend yield of 4 beats the ftse 100 average of 3 7 the yield gets markedly better over the next two years too as city analysts tip healthy dividend growth yields sit at 4 9 and 5 3 for the financial years to march 2024 and 2025 respectively secondly airtel africa trades on a rock bottom prospective p e ratio following recent share price weakness it trades on a multiple of just 7 7 times i think the business is a great way to profit from soaring wealth levels in its 14 african markets revenues at constant currencies shot 16 9 higher in the six months to september driven by strong growth across both its data and mobile money businesses i d buy airtel even though a strong us dollar is a threat to future profits royston wild does not own shares in airtel africa gsk what it does gsk is a healthcare business that offers medicines and vaccines that are used by patients worldwide by charlie keough gsk lse gsk shares have like many been a victim of falling investor confidence this year has seen the stock fall by over 14 however i think december could be the time to buy despite the drop in share price the business has posted some strong results in 2022 it raised its guidance in its half year results and when it updated investors with its q3 results in early november a continuation of this strong performance meant it raised it once again it now expects growth in sales to come in between 8 10 with sales rising 9 in q3 gsk looks like it s fully on its way to achieving this on top of this the stock also offers a substantial dividend yield of around 7 with inflation continuing to surge in the uk the passive income created from this offers me to some degree a hedge against inflation in the months ahead the business may see its cost rise as inflation continues to spike however i m still looking to potentially buy gsk stock in december charlie keough does not own shares in gsk smurfit kappa group what it does smurfit kappa group is a manufacturer of paper based packing products operating in the uk europe and america by gabriel mckeown in my opinion smurfit kappa group lse skg is a prime example of an unlikely income stock and this has led to the market neglecting the opportunity this year has been challenging for smurfit with the stock price falling almost 25 however the underlying fundamentals remain attractive with solid forecast earnings growth and reasonable profit margins yet it is the dividend potential that drew my attention to the company offering a current yield of 3 6 which has been paid consistently for the last 11 years and has grown for the previous 10 furthermore this yield is forecast to grow by 14 5 next year hitting 4 the recent sell off in stock price has meant that the company has a p e ratio of just 13 so when combining the strong fundamentals with the dividend potential i believe this could be a prime income opportunity gabriel mckeown does not own shares in smurfit kappa group xp power what it does xp power is a leading designer and manufacturer of specialist electronic components for numerous industries by zaven boyrazian xp power lse xpp is a specialist designer and manufacturer of electronic components critical to many devices the group primarily focuses on supplying the healthcare industrial and semiconductor manufacturing industries in recent years global supply chain disruptions have wreaked havoc on the group s manufacturing lead times meanwhile xp power recently lost a legal battle over a competitor s trade secrets which sent the share price down the drain however according to its latest quarterly results the underlying business remains financially robust with order intake and revenue growing at an impressive pace furthermore the collapse in valuation has pushed the dividend yield to reach an attractive 4 6 with order fulfilment slowly accelerating again and the damage of the legal dispute already priced into the market capitalisation xp power stock looks like a lucrative long term income buying opportunity for my portfolio zaven boyrazian owns shares in xp power polar capital holdings what it does polar capital holdings plc is a specialist fund management company listed on the alternative investment market aim by paul summers my dividend pick for december is polar capital management lse polr like other asset managers polar s shares have plummeted in value in 2022 as investors have become fearful over rising prices the russia ukraine conflict and just about everything else this leaves the shares trading at 13 times earnings and yielding over 9 in the current financial year there s clearly risk here if things go from bad to worse polar could be forced to cut its payouts as such it goes without saying that i d need to ensure that the rest of my portfolio is sufficiently diversified away from this industry before taking the plunge then again it s worth noting that the interim dividend was maintained in november s half year numbers that s despite the company seeing a significant but arguably expected reduction in pre tax profit this gives me confidence that polar s income stream will emerge from the storm unscathed paul summers has no position in polar capital management dunelm what it does dunelm is a homewares retailer serving the british market through a network of stores and online by christopher ruane in the past few months i have been buying dunelm lse dnlm stock even after rising lately the shares are 27 cheaper than they were a year ago i do see a risk that people having less spare cash could lead to falling sales at the chain but i see long term potential in the well run business which is highly cash generative last year dunelm generated 153m of free cash flow helping fund around 75m in ordinary dividends the company also paid a generous special dividend if business is tougher this year there may be no special dividend but the ordinary dividend yield is already 4 which i see as attractive it was covered twice over by earnings last year in the long term i am also optimistic there may be more special dividends to come dunelm is an income generating machine i d buy more of its shares this december if i had spare cash to invest christopher ruane owns shares in dunelm primary health properties what it does primary health properties is a leading investor in modern primary healthcare facilities in the uk and ireland with the majority of rental income underpinned by government bodies by g a chester primary health properties lse php has attractive qualities for dividend investors long leases with rental income backed by the nhs and the hse in ireland make for predictable cash flows to support growing dividends in fact php has just delivered a 26th consecutive annual increase historically investors have been willing to pay a premium to the company s net asset value nav and accept a sub 5 and at times sub 4 dividend yield however at a recent share price of 116p the stock is at a 4 discount to last reported nav of 120 8p and with quarterly dividends totalling 6 5p the running yield is 5 6 furthermore for buyers of the shares today the prospective yield is 5 9 on expectations if met of an increased payout to 6 8p in 2023 a radical change in government policy curtailing private sector involvement in the nhs would hurt php but i think this is a low risk g a chester does not own shares in primary health properties taylor wimpey what it does taylor wimpey is one of the uk s biggest housebuilders and has a rather big exposure to most regions of the country by john choong taylor wimpey lse tw shares have lost almost half their value this year due to fears of a house market crash with sky high mortgage rates as such the housebuilder has seen its order book shrink and cancellations tick up despite that its position as an income stock for my portfolio remains lucrative as management is yet to rebase its dividend the strength of its balance sheet allows it to cover its current dividend yield of 8 8 twice therefore i m only expecting a small cut to its dividend in the near term most importantly however i think its share price may have bottomed with the bank of england set to pause its rate hikes soon mortgage rates may have hit a peak this could ease the downward pressure on house prices and allow me to capitalise on a rebound in the medium term not to mention deutsche rates the stock a buy with a price target of 1 15 john choong has no position in taylor wimpey national grid what it does national grid owns and operates energy transmission and distribution networks in the uk and us and is the electricity system operator across the uk by james j mccombie national grid lse ng shares offer a dividend yield of 5 1 the company has consistently increased its payments to shareholders every year since at least 2000 making it a true dividend aristocrat as a utility company national grid is unavoidably asset heavy building and maintaining those assets is expensive and has resulted in relatively high debt levels for example connecting new renewable sources to the grid might cost 35bn over the next three years the business is also highly regulated there are profit caps and potential windfall taxes and the scrutiny makes deals and growth challenging however it is heavily regulated precisely because of its privileged position at the heart of the uk s energy industry it enjoys pretty steady and predictable cash flows and revenues that should closely track inflation making increasing dividend payments a more straightforward task than most other companies james j mccombie does own shares in national grid bp plc 8 cum 1st prf what it does bp is one of the major oil companies that finds extracts refines and supplies oil products by stephen wright my dividend stock of choice for december is bp plc 8 cum 1st prf shares i think that the stock offers a steady return that is attractive at today s prices i ve opted for the preferred shares over the common equity for two reasons first i think that the price of oil is uncertain at the moment second i think that the preferred stock trades at an attractive price unlike the common equity the preferred shares pay a fixed dividend that means that even if bp s profits drop an owner of the preferred stock will still receive the same dividend unless the company suspends its dividend entirely at today s prices that return amounts to an annual return of over 5 to me that looks attractive compared to the returns on offer elsewhere on the uk stock market that s why i d look to buy it as my dividend stock for december stephen wright owns shares in bp plc 8 cum 1st prf
bloomberg packaged goods giants like nestle sa and unilever plc have poured billions into acquisitions of vitamin brands in recent years seeking growth beyond traditional businesses like stock cubes ice cream and soap the bet appeared to pay off when covid hit turbocharging demand for supplements as worried consumers sought to boost their defenses against a new and mysterious virus over the past year however with the pandemic easing and a cost of living crisis squeezing household budgets the vitamin business has fallen on harder times in the us supplement sales fell 3 3 by units in the year through october following three consecutive years of growth according to data provider nielseniq nestle warned last week of a bumpy road ahead the company s supplement sales were flat in the first nine months of 2022 and a return to high single digit growth isn t expected until the second half of next year our vitamin minerals and supplement business has seen explosive demand as we have a lot of products focusing on immunity said greg behar chief executive officer of the health science unit speaking at an investor meeting in barcelona we see now a slight deceleration the swiss food company has spent more than 8 billion on acquisitions of brands such as solgar and puritan s pride that s made it the market leader in the fragmented field with a 4 share overtaking rivals like reckitt benckiser group plc and procter gamble co which also have vitamins businesses unilever bought seven businesses since 2018 now in a division with its burgeoning luxe skincare business which has consistently brought double digit growth new areas the dealmaking spree has come amid a broader push into new areas by the consumer giants as they face sluggish demand for traditional food and household staples while nestle pet food brands like purina have grown consistently the group s forays into health have been more fraught the swiss company last week put its palforzia peanut allergy treatment up for sale only two years after buying it in terms of top line growth vitamins minerals and supplements won t be the next pet care or skincare bernstein analyst bruno monteyne said despite the recent setbacks nestle and others say there s still plenty of potential in the business and they re looking beyond the current slowdown the us market highlights the bullish case some 83 of households there take vitamins minerals and supplements representing about half of the global market health conscious american shoppers are happy researching and self medicating to make themselves feel better regardless of whether there s a real benefit or simply a placebo effect if people elsewhere spent anything like the 155 each american shells out annually on these products sales growth for

global trend unilever has built up a 1 billion 1 billion health and wellbeing unit earlier this year unilever bought hair supplement brand nutrafol last year it acquired onnit which focuses on digestive health and memory there s a massive cultural shift from health being defined by the absence of disease to health really being a lifestyle jostein solheim ceo of the division said in an interview busy professionals like tom woudhuysen a 36 year old teacher in london reach for supplements for peace of mind he began taking multivitamins as a teen later adding korean ginseng to boost energy lysine amino acid against ulcers and other products touted as hair growth stimulants there s a certain comfort to the regularity and consistency of taking supplements a halfway house to something like a going to the doctor and getting a prescription although that makes for customer loyalty there are also plenty of factors weighing on the business at least in the near term store brands the surge in demand for vitamin d during the pandemic fueled by unproven speculation that it could help fight covid has eased the cost of living crisis is encouraging consumers to cut back and switch to store brands of other supplements some of the most popular products in the category such as calcium supplements aren t patentable which restricts profitability creating new remedies is risky because of limited science demonstrating the benefits as well as concern that the market is dependent on fads the direct to consumer e commerce model of supplement brands like onnit and nutrafol may not easily scale up within a massive conglomerate maintaining profitability is hard when consumers focus more on price particularly for basic additives like calcium or cod liver oil britain s

nearly nine months after a bipartisan group of u s house members sent a letter questioning the securities and exchange commission s investigation into cryptocurrencies including the failed ftx exchange the lawmakers are maintaining their position that the agency s approach to regulating crypto is deeply flawed in public comments since ftx s collapse last month the congressmen led by minnesota republican tom emmer have largely called ftx s demise a singular issue that deserves scrutiny they argue the episode only reinforces their point that the sec s regulation of cryptocurrencies is arbitrary and ineffective ftx co ceo ryan salame was a major campaign contributor to the congressional leadership fund the political action committee emmer controlled as the head of the house republican campaign arm in the 2022 election cycle u s rep ted budd a north carolina republican who also signed the letter also received substantial support from salame in his u s senate bid this year the members letter was dated march 16 and objected to the sec s enforcement division taking steps to collect information from crypto companies as the information collection wasn t publicly known to be related to any active investigation the role was better suited to other departments within the commission they wrote citing sources familiar with the situation the progressive news magazine the american prospect first reported that ftx was among those the sec was seeking information from the march letter was addressed to sec chairman gary gensler in addition to emmer and budd it was signed by florida democrat darren soto florida republican byron donalds ohio republican warren davidson new jersey democrat josh gottheimer massachusetts democrat jake auchincloss and new york democrat ritchie torres the members told gensler the sec may be overstepping its jurisdiction by tasking its enforcement division with seeking information from firms that so far are not regulated by the commission and that investigations could have violated the federal paperwork reduction act that requires federal agencies not overwhelm private entities according to the letter it appears there has been a recent trend towards employing the enforcement division s investigative functions to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants in a manner inconsistent with the commission s standards for initiating investigations the letter said after ftx which had been the third largest crypto exchange declared bankruptcy last month the letter s signers who made public statements condemned ftx ftx failed after founder sam bankman fried improperly used another business he founded the trading house alameda research to hold a large number of ftx s tokens ftx collapse only proves point members say but the central thesis of the march letter that the sec s scattershot enforcement of crypto firms was unpredictable and ineffective was bolstered by the ftx example members have said they denied that the letter sought to shield ftx from federal regulators soto said in a nov 26 series of tweets that he believed the sec should investigate ftx the march letter wasn t about ftx he said but the crypto industry writ large the letter sought clarity on sec positions regarding its document request authority for crypto firms in general he tweeted the letter was not specific to ftx didn t reference ftx nor did our office have any contact with ftx regarding the letter the letter did not stop or slow down any investigations into ftx rep soto also has not received any contributions for ftx a spokesperson for donalds said in a written statement he remains concerned with the sec s approach to regulating digital assets in the absence of congressional legislation and still questioned why the sec used its enforcement division for voluntary information requests the sec has openly engaged in regulation by enforcement with little guidance as to which assets are legally subject to the sec s jurisdiction the spokeperson added the congressman feels that this combination severely hampers the marketplace and is an unsustainable method of governance the spokesperson was adamant that donalds never attempted to influence any of the sec s ongoing investigations emmer said the ftx episode did not undermine the idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies but rather was a failure by bankman fried and federal enforcement ftx a centralized exchange ran counter to the idea of decentralization he said ftx s collapse is not a crypto failure emmer tweeted nov 22 it s a failure with garygensler and sam bankman fried decentralization is the point in a nov 13 tweet davidson also said the fallout showed the sec s enforcement approach was not working at this point it s hard to believe that secgov hasn t engaged in selective enforcement he posted on nov 13 they worked closely with the biggest entities like ftx for years while engaging in endless discovery requests clearly gensler perhaps the sec structure are not up to the task at hand aides to emmer davidson gottheimer and budd did not respond to messages seeking comment representatives for the sec did not respond to a message from states newsroom seeking comment a relatively new phenomenon there is little explicit in federal law about how cryptocurrencies should be monitored gensler has said that cryptocurrencies which can be traded like stocks should be regulated like securities of the nearly 10 000 tokens in the crypto market i believe the vast majority are securities he wrote to treasury secretary janet yellen in october offers and sales of these crypto security tokens are covered by the securities laws campaign cash four of the letter s signers received campaign contributions from people associated with ftx emmer raised 8 700 in his most recent reelection campaign from individuals who listed ftx or ftx us as their employer including 5 800 the maximum allowed by law from salame the co ceo according to federal election commission records emmer s reelection campaign raised a total of 1 9 million from individuals in the 2022 cycle emmer was also the head of house republicans campaign organization which was not subject to the same limits on campaign contributions as his own reelection and that group received 2 75 million from ftx employees according to data from open secrets a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending the bulk of that figure 2 million came from a single contribution salame made in september salame s political action committee american dream federal action also spent 517 000 on television advertising for budd s successful senate campaign salame was the sole funder of american dream federal action according to fec records bankman fried had his own political action committee protect our future which contributed to democratic candidates though it did not support anyone who signed the march letter bankman fried contributed 27 million of the 28 5 million the committee raised in the 2022 cycle according to fec records gottheimer received 11 600 from ftx employees in the 2022 cycle including the maximum 5 800 from bankman fried
this is a guest post by marc kramer a serial entrepreneur and executive director of the private investors forum who started and ran the eastern technology council where pete musser was cofounder with dr hubert schoemaker from 1990 to 1995 warren v musser who went by the name pete died early last week at 92 he was one of the global giants of venture capital it is no exaggeration to say that in the pantheon of investing in startup and early stage companies pete was as big although not as well known as his peers such john doerr bill draper don valentine and other luminaries from silicon valley pete s almost seven decade record puts him in the conversation as one of the greatest venture capitalists and successful investors in the history of the planet the case could be made that pete s track record was better than any one of those guys without the benefit of the stanford or cal berkley startup machine he didn t have a big time research university focused on turning out commercial companies yet the names of his unicorn companies are household names comcast franklin mint qvc and novell to name a few one of his greatest investments is the internet capital group whose founder walter buck buckley literally learned the venture investment world by carrying pete s briefcase icg which went public right in the middle of the dot com boom had boasted three executives whose paper stock was worth 2 5 billion or greater pete lived up to the reputation of the greatest generation as he served in the military went to lehigh university on the gi bill had four children and with his college roommate vincent buck bell bought a company called safeguard scientifics which created a flawless bookkeeping program called the one write system i would know because as an entrepreneur who had to do his own bookkeeping in the beginning i was a total disaster until i used that system i had always sought out mentors and when i first started working for pete i asked him if he would mentor me we were at breakfast at one of his favorite locations when he told me that no one had ever asked him to mentor them before i was as shocked at his response as he was apparently about my request although we didn t meet formally to discuss my thoughts and concerns pete managed to mentor me through his actions and my observations here are the 10 things i learned from pete 1 back up the big thinkers when the first of five technology leader venture funds was being launched in early 90s the region s venture capital community laughed at eastern technology council s etc launching of a 50 million seed fund at our monthly board meeting i relayed the sentiments of the community and pete bent over and quietly said maybe we should start with something like 25 million hubert schoemaker cofounder of the etc and a giant in the biotech field nodded and asked for the phone then called the managing director at jpmorgan clayton rose he asked me to repeat what i heard and asked clayton for his thoughts clayton thought that the climate for raising such a large amount of money was going to be difficult and on top of that it is only pete and his team who had venture experience hubert promptly told him he understood their concerns but surprised everyone by raising the amount to 100 million pete said hubert i know you went to notre dame and that you got your ph d from mit before you were 21 but maybe math isn t your strong suit because it turns out 100 million is more than 50 million everyone laughed and then hubert reminded pete that he was one of the greatest investors of the 20th century and that with the other ceos around the table they not only would make it happen but do it in 90 days pete tapped hubert on the shoulder and said he liked hubert s audacious goals 2 support your people when i was being interviewed for the etc job i told pete that one of my missions is to start the country s first formally organized angel investors group which turned out to be the pennsylvania private investors group now the private investors forum pete said he would be and was the first angel his name was magical and attracted other top tier investors to join 3 share the value with your investors under pete safeguard pioneered the rights offering where shareholders would get shares of companies safeguard invested in without tax consequences until they sold the shares pete looked at investors money as a sacred trust because he knew it was fueling college educations and retirements unlike many organizations where only the top executives benefit pete made sure everyone directly and indirectly got a slice of the pie 4 publicly admit when you are wrong we have all observed many leaders who will tell a room full of people when they think someone is wrong by embarrassing or humiliating them one of pete s best qualities was his ability to take responsibility and tell the same group he was wrong this experience happened to me on several occasions the first time this happened was when i invited the founder of data general ron skates to be one of our titans of technology speakers pete questioned in front of the etc board why i would choose an old school technology company whose best days in pete s view were behind it nevertheless he didn t override my decision and hence we hosted mr skates the night before mr skates spoke at our quarterly breakfast at the franklin institute we hosted a dinner for him in the safeguard board room at the end of the dinner as i was thanking everyone pete asked to say a few words he told the room which was comprised of our board and some other ceos how he was against inviting mr skates but after speaking to him about how he started the business and where it was going pete told the group how he was glad i stuck to my choice and that from now on he wouldn t question my judgement on speakers that didn t stop him from questioning other ideas but when those ideas bore fruit he was quick to tell the same audience how he was wrong i never abandon that principle and remind the leaders i work with how much goodwill admitting publicly you re wrong will buy and that it positively affects one s overall corporate culture 5 loyalty is above all else i was sitting in pete s office talking about a new venture when his secretary said that a close friend of pete s was on the line pete said i could stay and just not say a word he put the entrepreneur on speaker and the entrepreneur told pete that he never thought his stock would fall so far and now he was upside down to his bankers for a significant amount of money pete said he would have it wired right away he didn t dodge the call didn t chastise the entrepreneur s strategy nor negotiate the terms pete turned to me and told me that when your friend s house is on fire you offer unconditional support and you don t negotiate the cost of water because one day your house will be on fire pete s business house had a massive out of control fire and a great number of those he helped jumped in and rescued him 6 fortunes are meant to support society he was the most generous entrepreneur i have ever met i was on the board of my hometown library and when they needed money for books pete wrote a check for 5 000 i joined the board of an organization that focused on helping young african american men become leaders and entrepreneurs and asked i pete to hear their story pete listened and left the room which i assumed meant that the organization s mission didn t move him i shrugged and apologized to the executive director but two minutes later he handed them a check for 50 000 7 set high standards and goals one of the greatest learning experiences i had was the semi annual safeguard partners meetings that started on a thursday and ended friday afternoon each leader of a safeguard company would brief the executive team and board of safeguard along with outsiders like me and the legendary philadelphia eagles dick vermeil and ron jaworski at my very first partners meeting each of the partner company leaders was sharing why they weren t succeeding by the second day pete cut it short and put everyone on notice that their performance had to improve or we wouldn t be seeing them in six months the partner meetings were great because you learned about a lot of different industries and how leaders collaborated but what i learned most was about setting expectations and holding people accountable 8 provide people with second chances pete was a collector of talent he started what he called the orphans program where discarded leaders could rehabilitate their reputations and careers by finding a venture for safeguard to invest or running one of the safeguard companies numerous companies and shareholders benefited from this approach because he knew these guys were hungry and had plenty of gas left in the tank 9 cultivate diversity the very first safeguard board member i met at the semi annual partners meetings was delbert johnson an african american man who had worked his way up from the shop floor to owning the manufacturing company he worked for he later became the first african american to chair a regional federal reserve board later pete appointed del s brother jerry a former schoolteacher and coo of us west as safeguard s president and coo pete also appointed a jean smith as president until she left for a different opportunity there was no pressure for pete to add people of color and women to his board at a time when there was even less equitable representation than there is today and in any case pete wasn t the type of person you could force to do anything he would do something because it was the right thing to do and it made sense 10 live simply pete wasn t a mansion rolex kind of a guy he did drive old jaguars because he looked cool in them but he mostly drove american cars he didn t wear expensive clothes he was more like a midwest warren buffet than a sleek wall street guy the only reason you would need a written agreement with pete is to remember what everyone agreed to he was a man of high integrity and always shot straight no one who worked with as many companies as pete had a clean desk you wondered how this godfather of the venture world could oversee so many enterprises yet never had more than a few pieces of paper the answer was picking and supporting smart people and letting them worry about the details technically media

it s important for seniors to create legacies but how many are interested in creating a legacy for the next generation many seniors have worked hard have had rewarding careers and built up both tangible and intangible assets but what s the next step in their life s journey i am pleased to have elderly clients who are enjoying their retirement and building a legacy for the next generation some clients don t have significant physical assets such as houses and lands to pass on to their children or grandchildren but they have the wisdom to understand that they can still amass wealth in retirement or build a legacy for future generations more seniors are investing in stocks as a way of creating a legacy for their children and grandchildren instead of leaving cash in the bank or relying only on death benefits from insurance proceeds these clients are providing living benefits for their loved ones through various investment instruments primarily stocks their children and grandchildren are added to their investments and in some instances the seniors initiate the investment discussion with their children and volunteer the initial principal as gifts for their adult children just recently a retiree visited my office because he was interested in initiating long term investments for his three adult children he wanted separate long term investments for each child which he said is to give his children a better future because his children are young adults this senior believes that investing in stocks will create substantial returns in the future he understands that stocks are high risk investments but with time the rewards will compensate for the risks and provide above average returns for his children some seniors however spent their life being risk averse only to find out that avoiding risks only leads to retarded growth in their investments their monies have reduced purchasing power due to inflation and the longer they live the less their monies are able to purchase recently a medical doctor said he benefited significantly from investing in stocks but regretted not investing in stocks in his 20s he noted that young investors have more time to recover from stock market turmoil and a longer time for investments to compound and recover from losses and create wealth my recommendation to seniors who want to create a legacy is to invest in a managed or mutual fund you don t need a whole lot of money to get started one company that has done very well in managing pooled funds in jamaica is bpm financial limited the managed fund concept involves pooling investors funds and investing the monies in many different companies from different industries these are long term investments and the returns are not overnight magic but long term sustainable growth that allows investors to achieve financial freedom and create wealth these long term instruments grow exponentially after the first 10 years and the investments also become less risky building your legacy through pooled funds is less risky than investing in a single stock or a few stocks pooled funds or mutual funds allow for the diversification of investments which will maximise returns on investments the national study of millionaires conducted by ramsey solutions in the usa reported that not one millionaire achieved millionaire status by investing in just one stock the research also revealed that 79 per cent did not receive an inheritance the majority contributed to pension plans in their workplace during their working life and in addition to having a formal pension plan invested consistently on a long term basis it s not difficult to start building a legacy what are the financial lessons that you want to pass on to the next generation and what is the legacy that you want to create which charity or organisation needs your support understanding your life s purpose is the first step in building your legacy a habit of investing will encourage the next generation to build on the foundation established according to english writer charles dickens no one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of others the question is whose burden will you lighten grace g mclean is financial advisor at bpm financial limited contact her gmclean bpmfinancial or visit the website www bpmfinancial com she is also a podcaster for living above self e mail her at livingaboveself gmail com a habit of investing will encourage the next generation to build on the foundation established

bloomberg it may be hard to imagine that esg now a hotly debated topic in american politics traces its roots back to a former uk tabloid reporter and a 45 minute meeting in a fifth floor office in geneva there he and a small team of united nations staffers coined in 2004 what s now become one of the most controversial acronyms in finance their aim was to get investors and bankers to weigh key risks such as the earth s rising temperatures labor disputes and corporate malfeasance and determine their impact on profits using the language of the capital markets risks and opportunities esg was meant to pivot away from socially responsible investing and appeal to wall street but then esg morphed into a label that was everywhere and it came to mean different things to different people the three letters were added to stock funds bond issues corporate ratings and wall street derivatives worth trillions of dollars creating confusion and disagreement that left the acronym vulnerable to attack first industry insiders criticized environmental social and governance investing claims for being little more than a marketing gimmick regulators were next to crack down on money managers making hollow claims and then the republican onslaught began with us presidential hopefuls saying esg is something peddled by left wing radicals while states including florida pulled money from blackrock inc wall street s biggest esg proponent with the backlash reaching fever pitch sustainable investors called for a course correction others sounded the death knell for the acronym bemused by the assault is paul clements hunt who led the un team that created the esg label more than 18 years ago he said the attacks on their invention are in fact a good thing rather than being upset he said he s decided to relax and enjoy the warring parties attack and defend esg in equal measure it was giving the concept huge amounts of free airtime clements hunt 57 said in an interview clements hunt wants the world to understand that esg is a quintessentially capitalist concept capitalism has survived the past 250 years by adapting to the times and the next phase requires it to price in the risks that esg issues represent he said the more the debate plays out the more obvious it will be that extractive capitalism where growth relies on tapping limited resources can t compete with regenerative capitalism which pegs economic success to growth that can be sustained said clements hunt who s now a sustainability director at uk law firm mishcon de reya llp read more esg pioneer expects shakeout for funds hyped by fairy dust populist house republicans picking a fight with us business over woke capitalism gop politicians plan to ratchet up their esg attacks in the coming months with house republicans set to hold congressional hearings separately a number of anti esg bills will soon be introduced in states across the country after texas officials accused financial firms of boycotting oil and gas companies clements hunt said esg isn t about saving the world it s also the antithesis of divesting from industries such as fossil fuels he added instead of being shunned oil and gas companies need to be included in the debate because they understand how to deliver global energy at scale and have the balance sheets capable of enabling the transition to clean energy he said the intention of esg is to preserve profits make money from things like renewable energy and avoid losses from corporate governance lapses that led to the bankruptcy of crypto exchange ftx the current struggles at credit suisse group ag and the diesel emissions cheating scandal at volkswagen ag from several years ago he said stripping away the white noise and politics esg is simply a way to manage new and evolving risks as a result of policy changes and mitigate them where you can he said and while the gop accuses esg of being a socialist conspiracy clements hunt said it s the republicans who now seem to be embracing something akin to central planning that s the irony of all this he said once politicians tell business and markets that they can t consider risks that s undermining the very basics of how the capitalistic system works clements hunt has described himself as a card carrying capitalist while he s never managed large amounts of money for others he has advised large investment firms and allocated his own funds to startup companies according to his online bio he s also advised former uk prime minister gordon brown on sustainable development clements hunt started out as a reporter in the late 1980s and wrote for british newspapers including tabloids such as the sun earlier this year he criticized the finance industry for sprinkling esg fairy dust on products such as index funds and predicted an industry shakeout in the coming years and while skeptics have said it s time to retire the esg label because of the backlash clements hunt said doing so won t remove the risks that businesses face from things like climate change others have argued for the esg acronym to be broken apart so that environmental social and governance issues can be tackled separately but the strength of esg clements hunt said isn t the individual topics it s them working together they come as a package he said it s not e and s and g it s esg clements hunt said he doesn t see the cage fighting going away anytime soon at least before the 2024 us presidential election still there will be greater clarity surrounding the label thanks to efforts by industry groups that are setting new standards for esg claims he said if you thought esg was mainstream at the beginning of the year now it really is mainstream because people who had never even heard of it before are talking about it he said 2022 bloomberg l p

prices also remains highly contingent on energy market developments falling industrial price inflation the input cost index from the jpmorgan global manufacturing pmi survey compiled by s p global fell to a two year low in november signalling a further cooling of raw material price pressures from the 13 year peak seen in october of last year the reduced growth of input costs in turn fed through to lower selling prices inflation for goods leaving the factory gate the rate of increase of which moderated in november for a seventh successive month the lower factory gate price inflation bodes well for consumer goods prices inflation to likewise ease further in the coming months demand slumps the easing in price pressures can be traced first and foremost to a drop in demand for manufactured goods which has led to one of the sharpest downturns in input buying by manufacturers recorded by the pmi survey since the global financial crisis measured overall new orders placed for manufactured goods fell in november at a rate which has not been exceeded since 2009 excluding initial pandemic lockdown months manufacturers are also starting to deliberately run down warehouse inventories on inputs reflecting an increasingly gloomy demand outlook this reduction in demand for goods and their associated inputs has removed some pricing power from the suppliers of these goods and inputs supply constraints ease a commensurate consequence from the downturn in demand for goods and inputs has been a further marked reduction in the number of supplier delivery delays globally the global pmi suppliers delivery times index a key gauge of supply chain health and price developments signalled the fewest delays since january 2020 prior to the pandemic in november delivery times even improved in some important manufacturing economies including the us and germany hence both demand and supply side factors are serving to act as downward pressures on input cost inflation in the manufacturing sector which should help to further alleviate global inflationary pressures in the coming months uk sees largest cost increase of major economies looking across the 31 economies for which s p global pmi data are available the uk saw the second steepest increase in manufacturing input costs in november behind only kazakhstan followed by japan at the other end of the scale prices fell in brazil and taiwan and rose especially modestly in mainland china and india across the 29 economies in which prices rose only six reported higher rates of inflation colombia the philippines myanmar malaysia mainland china and vietnam input cost inflation has consequently slowed substantially since earlier in the year across most major economies notably sliding to the lowest since late 2020 in both the us and eurozone and hitting the second lowest since late 2020 in the uk in japan the rate of increase waned to the lowest since september 2021 the steepest easing in the rate of input cost inflation compared to october was registered in thailand but particularly sharp coolings in the rate of inflation were seen in many eurozone economies notably germany austria italy spain and france supply conditions show broad improving trend albeit with delivery times lengthening in china while measured globally suppliers delivery times lengthened to the smallest extent since january 2020 there were marked variations in supplier performance around the world delivery times even improved in five economies compared with october namely turkey germany brazil the us and india of the other 26 economies only mainland china vietnam australia and colombia reported a worsening supply chain situation in terms of lead times lengthening at an increased rate broadly speaking of the major regions of the world supply chain constraints have eased to the greatest extent in north america in recent months but are showing signs of worsening again in parts of asia notably reflecting heightened covid 19 restrictions in china outlook industrial prices are coming under downward pressure from a combination of falling demand and improving supply the november pmi surveys depicting a global manufacturing sector which is seeing a shift from a sellers market to one in which buyers are starting to regain some power in price negotiations the surveys are also registering a marked cooling of upward price pressures from shipping rates in recent months albeit with a small uplift evident in november as well as reduced upward price growth momentum from wages and salaries however while these weakening fundamentals point to the risk of further price softness to come in the months ahead there remain many uncertainties in particular energy prices remain volatile and look likely to continue to present both upside and downside risks to manufacturing costs and prices depending on ukraine war developments winter weather and china s covid response original post editor s note the

all questions recent cases there have been a number of significant cases in the english courts since the previous edition the covid 19 business interruption litigation has given rise to further judgments on issues not resolved by the supreme court s judgment in january 2021 and at least two further judgments are imminent at the time of writing insurance disputes have not troubled the supreme court in the past year to the same extent as in preceding years but the court of appeal has given two judgments on the meaning of commonly used forms of aggregation wording and the first reported case on the new law on damages for late payment of claims under section 13a of the insurance act 2015 is also covered below two recent decisions of the english courts also illustrate the importance of consistency in policies within a tower of insurance when it comes to dispute resolution clauses and brexit continues to drive the use of the insurance business transfer regime in part vii of the fsma these and other key recent cases are summarised below including important decisions in such areas as non disclosure and fair presentation of the risk notification subrogation and the third parties rights against insurers act 2010 i business interruption and covid 19 while business interruption cover is typically bought by policyholders as an extension to property damage policies and primarily responds in cases of property damage non damage extensions to cover also exist in the market providing cover for losses caused by disease or the response of public authorities to disease there has been a deluge of claims against such policies as a result of covid 19 and the national lockdowns in the uk and considerable uncertainty as to whether such policies respond the key coverage issues that arose on the most commonly used forms of policy were addressed by the supreme court in january 2021 in the first ever case using the financial markets test case scheme the test case under the civil procedure rules cprs the test case was brought by the regulator the financial conduct authority on behalf of policyholders and with the consent and cooperation of eight insurers seeking to promote greater clarity on the legal issues we covered the outcome of both the divisional court and the supreme court judgments in the test case in the third and fourth editions since the supreme court s judgment in the test case there have been two further significant decisions in this area the first is the arbitration award in various policyholders v china taiping insurance uk co ltd6 which the parties agreed be published notwithstanding the confidential nature of the arbitral process the relevant policy provided cover for interruption as a consequence of instructions issued by the police or other competent local authority lord mance sitting as a sole arbitrator held that the uk government s orders and advice issued during the covid 19 pandemic did not engage the relevant insuring clause as the uk government was not a competent local authority but rather a central or countrywide authority although an arbitral award does not have precedential value as a former supreme court justice lord mance s reasoning is likely to be highly persuasive in any case before the english courts considering the same question corbin and king limited ors v axa insurance uk plc7 concerned the interpretation of a non damage denial of access ndda clause similar but not identical to clauses considered by the divisional court in the test case in the test case the divisional court had held that those ndda clauses did not provide cover as their wording concerned specific local occurrences of disease only and not a national response to a pandemic those findings of the divisional court were not appealed to the supreme court in corbin and king the high court held that it was not bound to apply the divisional court s judgment regarding the relevant ndda clauses in the test case to the similar clauses in issue in corbin and king the high court considered that the ndda clauses at issue were not materially identical to those in the test case and that the supreme court s subsequent judgment on the correct approach to the causation analysis meant that the arguments before it were different from those made to the divisional court in the test case the high court held that the ndda clauses at issue in corbin and king insured specific local occurrences of disease but in light of the supreme court s approach to causation also encompassed national disease events provided that they encroached on the relevant locality the high court also held that the limits of liability in the policy applied individually to each restaurant premises and for each lockdown and not as an aggregate limit across all premises and lockdowns at the time of writing judgments in two further cases before the high court are expected imminently 8 those judgments are expected to address further important issues including the application of the policy limits provisions in the widely used marsh resilience wording to multiple premises and lockdowns and the issue whether payments received by policyholders under the uk government s furlough scheme should or should not be taken into account in quantifying claims ii part vii transfers and brexit part vii of the fsma provides a court sanctioned procedure for the legal transfer of insurance policies between insurers the court is required to consider a report on the viability of the transfer by an independent expert along with submissions from the fca and pra and any objections made by policyholders or any other person who alleges they are adversely affected by the proposed transfer a number of recent applications for sanction of a part vii transfer have also had to consider issues raised by brexit courts have frequently found themselves in the situation of having to balance the inevitable prejudice to a large body of eea policyholders of their policies not being able to be serviced or paid after the end of 2020 if the sche me were not to be sanctioned against any potential risk of prejudice to individual policyholders or reinsurers under the scheme s terms 9 while the courts have still been careful to consider the interests of policyholders they have shown that they are prepared to approve a scheme despite some elements of prejudice to policyholders where the transfer is in response to an external circumstance such as brexit 10 in re mercantile indemnity co ltd 11 the high court sanctioned three part vii transfers where uk insurance and reinsurance companies sought to transfer policies to another group company domiciled in belgium to allow their business to be conducted in the european economic area eea following brexit the court considered that it was appropriate to sanction the schemes because they were not intended to serve a commercial purpose but rather were intended to ensure that following brexit a proper level of service could be provided to policyholders in phoenix life ltd re12 the high court gave guidance on the legislation permitting the english courts to continue to make orders sanctioning insurance business transfer schemes that included business carried on in an eea state for two years after brexit 13 the high court held that the legislation only required the order sanctioning the scheme to be made by 31 december 2022 and not that the transfer itself be effected by that date iii non disclosure and fair presentation of the risk in ristorante ltd t a bar massimo v zurich insurance plc14 the high court held that a question in a proposal form that asked whether specific individuals within the business had been the subject of an insolvency process was limited to those individuals it did not require the policyholder to disclose information regarding any insolvency process in which any other connected person or company had been involved further by asking that question in the proposal form the insurer had waived its entitlement to disclosure of the requisite information regarding other connected persons or companies therefore the policyholder s failure to disclose that certain directors and shareholders had previously been directors of a company that entered liquidation did not entitle the insurer to avoid the policy for material non disclosure or for failure to make a fair presentation of the risk this case concerned a policy that was entered into prior to the insurance act 2015 coming into force but was then renewed after the act had come into force and materially changed english law on non disclosure however in this case the policyholder accepted that if its arguments as to the meaning of the question in the proposal form had failed there would have been both a material non disclosure and an unfair presentation of the risk such that the insurer would have been entitled to avoid the policy therefore the court was not required to consider whether the changes to the law following the insurance act 2015 affected the outcome iv notification in arch insurance uk ltd v mccullough 15 the insured s public liability policy made it a condition precedent to cover to provide notification of any circumstance that could give rise to a claim as soon as reasonably practicable the insured failed to notify the insurer of an incident at his outdoor motorbike track until 11 months after the accident in which a child fell from her bike and sustained serious injuries the high court held that the accident itself was a circumstance that a reasonable insured would have realised made a risk of a claim more than fanciful and therefore required notification as soon as reasonably practicable the 11 month period taken to notify was not as soon as reasonably practicable and therefore the condition precedent to the insurer s liability was not satisfied and the insurer had no obligation to indemnify the insured for the claim by the child s parents v aggregation the court of appeal has recently given two judgments that starkly illustrate the importance of the specific wording used in aggregation clauses both cases concern sustained misconduct by professionals impacting multiple clients over a long period linked by the professionals habitual malpractice or dishonesty however on the basis of one form of aggregation language the court of appeal held that the claims concerned aggregated and on another form it held that the claims concerned did not in spire healthcare ltd v royal and sun alliance insurance ltd16 the court of appeal considered the meaning of the phrase consequent on or attributable to one source or original cause that commonly appears in aggregation clauses in the context of a series of clinical negligence claims against the same surgeon those claims had been categorised by the insured healthcare provider into two groups the first where surgery had been performed and the second where it had not the high court had held that the two groups of claims were attributable to two separate original causes and therefore should not be aggregated together for the purposes of the application of the policy limits however the court of appeal reached the opposite conclusion it held that the relevant phrase was a traditional and well known formula in insurance policies intended to achieve the widest possible search for a unifying factor that there was no distinction between source and original cause and that original cause connoted a considerably looser causal connection than proximate cause though not every but for cause would amount to an original cause in this case the unifying factor was the surgeon who habitually acted in breach of duty and therefore both groups of claims were attributable to the same source or original cause in contrast in baines v dixon coles gill 17 the court of appeal held that multiple claims brought against a solicitors firm after a partner s theft of client funds over a long period could not be aggregated for the purposes of a claim under a policy on the solicitors regulation authority s indemnity insurance rules 2013 minimum terms and conditions the aggregation clause in that policy required claims to arise from one act or omission or a series of related acts or omissions the court of appeal held that each theft was a separate act and the partner s dishonest treatment of clients money was not a sufficient unifying factor for each theft to be considered part of a series of related acts or omissions and therefore the aggregation clause did not apply vi late payment of claims quadra commodities sa v xl insurance company se and others18 is the first judgment to consider the term implied by section 13a of the insurance act 2015 that insurance claims must be paid within a reasonable time which includes a reasonable time for the insurer to investigate and assess the claim section 13a 4 of that act also provides that where an insurer can show that there were reasonable grounds for disputing a claim it will not breach the implied term merely by failing to pay but its conduct in handling the claim may still be a relevant factor in quadra commodities the insured argued that the insurer s failure to pay a marine cargo claim for a period of 15 months from notification was a breach of the implied term and claimed losses calculated by reference to the return on its shareholders equity butcher j held that the burden of proof to establish that payment was made only after a reasonable time was on the insured as the party alleging breach but that the insurer had the burden of proving that there were reasonable grounds for disputing the claim on the specific circumstances of the claim which included the complexity of the underlying issues and certain factors beyond the insurers control butcher j concluded that a reasonable time was about a year from notice however he held that the insurer had reasonable grounds for disputing the claim even though those grounds were ultimately unsuccessful at trial and therefore there was no breach of the implied term vii subrogation subrogation enables an insurer to recoup all or some of the money from a third party that caused or contributed to a loss for which the insurer has indemnified the insured commercial insurance commonly involves multiple insurers underwriting part of the relevant risk often across multiple excess layers and therefore each having a partial several subrogated interest in any third party recoveries in royal and sun alliance insurance plc v textainer group holdings ltd 19 an insurer successfully applied for an order under rule 19 6 1 b of the english civil procedure rules to act as a representative for other insurers in a subrogated claim for recoveries from a shipping container leasing business the high court held that the insurer had the same interest in the claim as those insurers whom it sought to represent and it was appropriate for it to be granted permission to do so under rule 19 6 viii jurisdiction two recent decisions of the english courts illustrate the importance of consistency in policies within a tower of insurance when it comes to dispute resolution clauses in aig europe sa v john wood group plc20 the primary policy in a tower of insurance policies did not contain a choice of law or jurisdiction clause the excess policies then contained clauses that both purported to follow the choice of law and jurisdiction in the primary policy and separately provided for either the jurisdiction of the english courts or for london seated arbitration the insured was a defendant to a claim in the canadian courts and commenced proceedings against the primary and excess insurers in the canadian courts the primary insurer did not dispute the canadian court s jurisdiction but the english court of appeal upheld the high court s granting of an anti suit injunction against those proceedings in the excess insurers favour the court of appeal held that had the primary policy contained a jurisdiction clause the follow form clause in the excess policies would have superseded any separate jurisdiction clauses in those policies however as there was no jurisdiction clause in the primary policy the follow form clause did not apply and the various different jurisdiction clauses in the excess policies prevailed this case is a salutary reminder of the importance of ensuring consistency and coherence of dispute resolution clauses across any tower of insurance the outcome of this case left the insured pursuing substantially the same insurance claim against the primary insurer in the canadian courts against certain of the excess insurers in the english courts and against one excess insurer in separate english arbitration proceedings the english court also bifurcated the determination of a dispute that impacted multiple layers in axis corporate capital uk ii limited v absa group ltd ors 21 in which it held that in the context of reinsurance claims where there are differing jurisdiction clauses in the primary and excess layers there could be different proceedings in different jurisdictions the high court held that the primary reinsurance policy contained only a non exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the english courts whereas the excess reinsurance policies contained exclusive english court jurisdiction clauses therefore the insured was able to continue claim proceedings commenced in the south african courts against the primary reinsurers but was required to discontinue those proceedings against the excess insurers and pursue any such claims in england the insured subsequently sought a stay of the english proceedings on case management grounds pending the conclusion of the south african proceedings as both proceedings concerned substantially the same issues however the high court held that to grant such a stay would be to do by the back door what cannot be achieved by the front door as it would be in substance a stay on forum non conveniens rather than case management grounds it held therefore that it would be contrary to principle for the stay application to be granted leaving the insured to pursue substantially same claim in two different fora ix third parties rights against insurers act 2010 in irwell insurance co ltd v neil watson ors 22 the court of appeal held that an employment tribunal was a court for the purposes of section 2 6 of the third parties rights against insurers act 2010 therefore it was within its remit to deal with the question of an insurer s liability to a claimant under the act for a claim for unfair dismissal against the employer following the employer s insolvency the tribunal s statutory exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the employee s unfair dismissal claim also overrode the arbitration clause in the insurance policy therefore that clause did not prevent the employee pursuing its claim against the insurer before the employment tribunal trends and outlook as in last year s edition covid 19 and the challenges deriving from the pandemic have been a dominant theme in insurance disputes this year england and wales was one of the first jurisdictions to examine at speed the issues of recovery of losses for business interruption as a result of the covid 19 pandemic the first use of the financial markets test case scheme by the regulator the financial conduct authority for this purpose has meant that precedential clarity was obtained swiftly from the uk s highest court on the most common forms of policy in the market meaning that in 2022 insurers have continued to focus on resolving the large volume of claims against such policies resulting from covid 19 and the national lockdowns in the uk however inevitably the test case did not resolve all issues or deal with all policy wording variants and as we have covered above the follow on litigation on issues not resolved by the test case has now reached the high court and arbitral tribunals and further important judgments have been handed down or are imminent the major global event of 2022 has undoubtedly been the conflict in ukraine its effects on global markets have been widely felt and the insurance market is no exception we are already seeing filed in courts around the world the first claims against aviation insurers in relation to aircraft leased to russian airlines that have not been permitted to leave and have been re registered in russia the first case of this kind in england and wales is aercap ireland limited s us 3 4 billion claim against both its all risks and its war risks insurers which was issued in june 2022 and many more are anticipated although the insurance act 2015 has now been in force for over five years it remains to be seen precisely how certain provisions of the act will be applied the act potentially represents a major rebalancing of rights and obligations between insureds and insurers in favour of insureds but early indications are that insurers are seeking to contract out of many of the provisions of the act where possible in commercial policies the recent judgment on section 13a covered above gives the first important indication as to how damages for late payment of insurance claims will be approached by the courts warranty and indemnity insurance and cyber insurance are two of the fastest developing policy markets in england and the terms of both types of policy are becoming increasingly standardised there have only been a limited number of significant disputes in relation to these types of policies although we anticipate that will change in the next few years especially with the increasing importance of private capital in global mergers and acquisitions markets and as cyberattacks are becoming an increasingly common experience for businesses the coming into force of the general data protection regulation has also generated interest in the extent to which the risks of failing to comply with the regulation are insurable the position is likely to be that insurance will not be available for any fines imposed under the regulation or under the related data protection act 2018 either because english law prohibits the insurance of fines or because policies will specifically exclude them however insurance may be available for the costs of participating in an investigation by the information commissioner s office and defending any subsequent proceedings insurance disputes arising out of data protection breaches may also be a developing area in the coming years disputes relating to a failure to appreciate the effect of artificial intelligence also look likely to be a developing area the use of after the event insurance to cover costs risks in english litigation has also increased significantly in recent years both as a result of reduction in availability of legal aid at one end of the scale and the increased importance of litigation funding in english disputes at the other end in addition to these areas of potential development climate change remains an area where claims must surely begin to rise there appear to be no insurance claims before the english courts in this area as yet but all eyes are on that space individual directors or officers that find themselves targeted by third party claims or by regulators may also have cover under directors and officers insurance policies it is particularly noteworthy that the results of the bank of england s 2021 climate biennial exploratory scenario28 considered that directors and officers insurance policies were the most likely to pay out on climate change claims
tokyo japan the results of a survey released this week showed that japan s manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in nearly two years in november due to drops in demand and output caused by a global economic slowdown and high inflation as demand is steadily declining and major trading partner china grapples with a renewed covid 19 surge japan s economy will remain under pressure for some time the au jibun bank japan manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a seasonally adjusted 49 0 in november from october s 50 7 final and below the warning level of 49 4 this marked the first instance the index fell below the 50 mark which separates contraction from expansion over 22 months and was its weakest level since november 2020 laura denman economist at s p global market intelligence which compiles the survey said cooling market conditions sustained cost pressures and weak underlying demand both domestically and internationally were reportedly pivotal factors contributing to the declines as quoted by reuters the survey s subindexes showed that old and new orders slipped to their lowest levels since august 2020 with orders from overseas clients suffering the sharpest decline in 28 months the weak yen currency is also driving up import prices and increasing the cost of living stifling the japanese economy s recovery from the covid 19 pandemic concerns surrounding price pressures also dampened business sentiment which did weaken slightly from october denman added however the survey showed that overall manufacturers business sentiment remained resilient on expectations for a further improvement in japan s covid 19 situation

declines from overworked oilfields and less productive wells on sunday the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec meets to decide whether to hold the line or cut its output no longer afraid that their policy decisions might provoke a surge in shale production in the way they did in the years before the pandemic the sidelining of u s shale means consumers around the world may face

2016 opec price war put hundreds of oil companies into bankruptcy shale innovated with less expensive ways of operating their subsequent gains gave the united states by 2018 the title of world s largest crude producer a distinction it still holds fizzling out investors have put dividends and share buybacks ahead of more production gains in the past few years said executives that has changed the ability of shale producers to react to spikes in international oil prices said bryan sheffield who sold producer parsley energy nyse and now runs an energy focused private equity fund shale can t come back to become a swing producer sheffield said because of the investors unwillingness to finance growth the demand for payouts and repeated price busts have forced oil producers and service companies to cut back on science projects that fed past production breakthroughs he added technology development that led to innovations such as multi stage hydraulic fracturing will slow down and has slowed down said richard spears a vice president at researcher spears associates if you want to advance how far you can drill out and how fast that now becomes a problem the industry also has less

regaining control over the market said hess the u s government expects overall oil production to reach a new peak next year but it has several times this year cut its forecasts it recently slashed 2023 production growth outlook by 21 to a gain of about 480 000 barrels per day bpd to 12 31 million bpd that could mean less growth compared to the mere 500 000 bpd gain this year which is already

end of quote repeat the line joe biden reading from a teleprompter earlier this year we ve heard this line of argument before but not usually from somebody in the president s position it goes like this we don t want to take away anybody s hunting gun we just want to get rid of semi automatic weapons at that point many in the pro second amendment crowd stop listening because the speaker has just proven himself ignorant not stupid just ignorant of the mechanics of most hunting guns which is what president biden proved the other day the idea we still allow semi automatic weapons to be purchased is sick just sick it has no no social redeeming value zero none not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers oy to sum up automatic weapons are the ones in which you pull the trigger once and hold and the blasted thing fires every shell it can hold and they are so completely regulated that we don t know a soul who owns one or who will admit it to us but semi automatic weapons are the ones that load a shell after each shot and the user must pull the trigger each time he wants to fire a bullet from the thing these machines are used in deer hunting turkey hunting duck hunting dove hunting pig hunting squirrel hunting and maybe snipe hunting for all we know it s not just sick to own one most folks we know don t go duck hunting with a single shot 410 these guns have no social redeeming value zero none except for those who hunt regularly but we ll do something rare for this column and assume that the president of the united states misspoke again or was confused again or went off script again and his people will have to walk it back again but it s hard to do that considering this is the man who once advised somebody fearful for her safety to walk outside her front door and shoot a 12 gauge blast into the sky maybe the president meant to say automatic weapons but those things aren t the preferred weapons of choice for most mass shooters because they are so hard to come by maybe the president meant to say ar 15s in which case he d have more support for his position except that those things do have redeeming value to certain hunters from what we re told they come in handy in shooting feral pigs which gather in groups of a dozen or more and wipe out acres of rural arkansas each night we will stipulate that not all owners of these m 16 lookalikes hunt feral hogs rural homeowners wish they would many of these gun owners perhaps most of them like the ar 15 molds because they look cool but why call these target shooters sick questioned again by the press the president said he would take steps in the coming congressional session to ban certain guns from the white house s official transcript q can you do anything about gun laws during the lame duck sir the president i m going to try q what will you try and do the president i m going to try to get rid of assault weapons q during the lame duck the president i m going to do it whenever i i got to make that assessment as i get in and start counting the votes once again from the top for the president s benefit if everybody reading already knows this an assault weapons ban passed in the 1990s but the ban was allowed to lapse because it wasn t effective because the only real difference between an assault rifle and your pawpaw s deer gun is appearance and magazine size but magazines aren t weapons if you want a debate on ridding the country of magazines that hold dozens of shells or more you might be surprised to know how many pro gun people would agree with you even here the things that are categorized as assault weapons shoot not a bit faster than a deer rifle in fact most deer rifles are much more powerful another ban on these assault weapons wouldn t work a bit better than a ban did in the 1990s especially since there are so many on the streets today which legislation is sure to grandfather as legal all previous legislation has none of this is to say that nothing can be done red flag laws should be universal in every american jurisdiction with protections for due process all loopholes to background checks should be closed many guns go and come across the southern border so improving that would help matters bump stocks are just a way to get around laws against machine guns and should be outlawed in every precinct and as dr charles krauthammer once noted he was allowed to admit patients with mental conditions to hospitals without their signatures in the 1970s but now too many with those problems are allowed to die with their rights on and we d add kill we can also debate magazine size gun shows and other arguments but if we re going to have this debate and we d damn sure better everybody needs to understand the definitions cc the white house

lemon next to a stock photo of musk the headline read cnn elon musk could threaten free speech on twitter by literally allowing people to speak freely needless to say cnn s public relations department quickly posted a screenshot of musk s tweet which included a disclaimer saying that the tweet was in violation of twitter s rules in response musk brushed off cnn s response tweeting lmaoooo those are the initials for laughing my a off in addition to being funny the episode was also in some ways incredibly meaningful and emblematic in other words the fake headline was not so fake on the contrary it was a brutal and effective synthesis of the way liberals leftists and progressives approach the issue of freedom of speech they put things less crudely they are so often sophisticated intellectuals who speak elegantly and like to dance around things instead of getting straight to the point but the final result is always the same their reproach for the supporters of freedom of speech or what they call free speech absolutists is that free speech is not simply about saying whatever you want unchecked but about negotiating complicated compromises according to the critics of elon musk the rhetoric of free speech absolutists fails to understand that for some speech to be free other speech has to be limited it s curious that most of the time their arguments are self referential and self assertive statements and propositions like trump musk has become the tribune of fascists and racists by way of adolescent contrarianism an insatiable need to flaunt his control and a radicalising inability to cope with being told he s wrong on the internet for him free speech seems merely a vehicle for his delusional plan to make twitter into a fawning digital town square that he presides over do you remember the medieval ipse dixit argument he aristotle said it himself serving as a phrase capable of ending arguments now it has become we liberals progressives etc say so it s true because we say it s true and if you don t agree with us you are a fascist racist homophobe etc and we don t want your kind here it s the contrary o tempora o mores of the answer supreme court justice louis brandeis gave in 1927 to the question when someone says something we disagree with should we shut them up the remedy to be applied he said is more speech not enforced silence that s also the rationale behind what white house press secretary karine jean pierre once said when you are not with what majority of americans are then you know that is extreme that is an extreme way of thinking it s the triumph of self referentiality the definition of what is meant by the term extreme is entirely arbitrary and light years away from the principles of liberal democracy as we have known it the massive immune response to elon musk s commitment to free speech from left wing activists mainstream media and big tech prompted journalist colin wright to tweet that people should be frightened this is a battle they cannot be allowed to win he wrote musk responded this is a battle for the future of civilization if free speech is lost even in america tyranny is all that lies ahead that seems to be the best way to put things this is the armageddon of free speech if we lose it s the end of western civilization it s not by chance that on the one hand elon musk s 44 billion takeover of twitter is being investigated by federal authorities over national security concerns that his foreign partners may be able to access user data and on the other the e u commissioner responsible for implementing the upcoming digital services act dsa thierry breton recently said that twitter has huge work ahead to get ready for the bloc s strict new rules for online platforms he posted a short video clip of a meeting with ceo elon musk saying that he welcomed musk s intent to get twitter 2 0 ready for the dsa but twitter will have to implement transparent user policies significantly reinforce content moderation and tackle disinformation he also told the financial times that twitter needs to make a number of changes to meet the dsa s requirements it will need to aggressively tackle disinformation submit to an audit provide clear criteria about which users are at risk of being banned and carefully consider how it lifts bans in the future it s almost a declaration of war it s not just brussels that is on the warpath french digital minister jean noël barrot didn t appreciate twitter s change of policy on covid related information covid 19 and vaccination misinformation now freely available on twitter another milestone is reached in irresponsibility he tweeted in turn in an interview with u s broadcaster abc french president emmanuel macron called twitter s decision a big issue i think we need to take the issue head on i m in favor of the exact opposite more regulation he added in short the die is cast the armageddon of free speech has just begun samuel robert piccoli is a blogger

with sharp electricity rate increases less than one month away state officials are scrambling to try to soften the blow for ratepayers as they approach the cold winter months starting jan 1 the state s two largest electric utilities will be enacting 100 rate increases on the generation portion of their bills that will hike costs by about 85 per month for the average eversource customer and nearly 80 per month for united illuminating that covers 17 towns near the shoreline the increases can be traced all the way back to the state s switch to electrical deregulation that was approved in 1998 under then gov john g rowland deregulation reduced the powers of state officials to set electrical rates and opened the market to a wide variety of electrical generators who sell power on a competitive basis consumers started shopping around to get discounted rates from a variety of providers but many ratepayers eventually gave up over the years after receiving short term rates that were suddenly increased when their low rate expired as a result 90 of eversource customers now take the standard rate that is offered by the company according to the state s consumer counsel in the same way 83 of ui customers currently take the standard rate instead of shopping around those eversource and ui customers will see an increase of about 100 in the generation portion of their bill which is separate from the distribution portion charged by the utilities over the past five years the supply rates charged by the utilities in a pass through from the generators have been in a relatively narrow range of about 8 cents to 12 cents per kilowatt hour the prices have been nowhere near the new rate of 24 cents the level coming jan 1 that has sparked outrage around the state gov ned lamont says that eversource customers will receive a monthly credit of about 10 on their bills and the state will be working in future months to help low income ratepayers who qualify for assistance while many consumers have fallen out of the habit in recent years state officials say that they can avoid the price hikes by shopping around for a better price for their electricity sen norm needleman an essex democrat who co chairs the legislature s energy committee said there is an alternative with third party suppliers that are outlined at energizect com the companies include north american power and xoom energy ct among others compared to the coming 24 cents per kilowatt hour for eversource customers constellation newenergy inc recently has charged 13 79 cents per kilowatt hour for three years as of dec 1 the rate increased to 16 59 cents for the three year plan according to the company s website constellation is still a viable alternative in the market at below 14 cents or at least they were needleman told the courant this is likely to be a blip no one can guarantee it it s a volatile market if you lock in to get constellation s current offer and rates go back to 8 cents or 9 cents or 10 cents you re going to be angry about it some consumers have been burned over the past decade when trying to get the best generation rates part of the problem with the third party providers is that they demonstrated over the last 10 years that their approach to selling to consumers has been less than stellar needleman said in an interview you have door to door sales people who are predatory who provide you teaser rates you do a 12 month contract and save a little bit of money and in month 13 the average consumer isn t following this in month 13 any savings they had over the past 12 months they give back in one month before the bill can be changed attorney general william tong who was standing next to needleman during the interview added we pushed at least a couple of those bad actors out of the market in just the past 12 months at least two tong notes that eversource and ui do not collect profits from the supply rates because those are pass through costs from the electric generators but from the distribution rates the utilities earn profits that totaled 540 million in net income for eversource and 59 million for ui at the moment the price has skyrocketed far beyond what consumers have seen in the past it s the dark side of deregulation needleman said i can t tell you if you go over the last 20 years has the state benefitted from deregulation on the supply side my feeling is that the ratepayers of the state for an essential service like electricity not only deserve as close to the best prices they can get but they need stability what you see in a deregulated market is an inherent amount of volatility we ve created a market for electricity that is half regulated and half deregulated needleman and his fellow senate democrats have called upon the state s public utilities regulatory authority to hold a joint multistate hearing to examine eversource operations in new hampshire and massachusetts as well as connecticut no date has been announced for a public hearing this is not a problem that connecticut alone can solve the senators said we do not live in a vacuum and this crisis requires a regional solution connecticut must work with massachusetts and new hampshire the other states in which eversource operates together we can hold eversource accountable as our ratepayers demand broader issues on electricity state officials concede that far larger forces are at work that are impacting connecticut the main reason for the supply rate increase said state consumer counsel claire e coleman is the global impact of russia s invasion of ukraine which has caused higher prices for oil and natural gas globally and here in the u s connecticut like all new england states is heavily reliant on natural gas for electricity and therefore when the market price of natural gas increases supply rates also increase coleman added even though the united states only imports a small amount from eastern europe the disruptions are affecting prices worldwide including in the united states and particularly in new england where we still rely heavily on natural gas and on liquified natural gas lng which has been in higher demand in europe resulting in significant increases to the price of lng which sets the market price on the broader issues of energy policy state officials say they have been working on the problem in a variety of ways the state has taken several actions to help insulate residents from situations like this which is why we kept the millstone power station online providing a cheap reliable and carbon free source of electricity online that is generating net profits that are being returned to eversource and ui customers said katie dykes the state environmental commissioner this is why we employ strategic electricity procurement practices and why the governor has kept our energy efficiency programs funded it s also why the state is working hard to diversify its energy mix and has pursued past and ongoing procurements for clean energy resources such as solar and offshore wind that will reduce our reliance on fossil fuel resources over time tong has been following the developments closely and speaking with utility executives the challenge for us in the office of the attorney general is this is unconscionable right now to double the price from 12 cents per kilowatt hour to 24 cents per kilowatt hour tong said in an interview people are getting punished we expected some change from summer to winter in the cost of natural gas and the cost of the commodity but we didn t expect a doubling we re essentially at the mercy of the global energy market this underscores how important it is to move away from natural gas and to other sources i just toured millstone by the way not that long ago tong has agreed to settlements with eversource and ui in the past on the distribution portion of the bill that s where we can really lean on them and that s where we ll fight the utilities at pura on the distribution side tong said but on the fuel side it s ugly specifically i have asked them to contribute a percentage of shareholder earnings commensurate with the percentage increase their customers will pay this winter to keep their lights and heat on to date they have refused tong said we need to take a hard look at who is profiting and who is harmed as we search for long term reform senate president pro tempore martin looney of new haven and senate majority leader bob duff of norwalk jointly condemned the hikes eversource has doubled its stock price in the past 10 years and avangrid posts billions of dollars in profit each and every year they said it never ceases to amaze us how quarterly shareholder dividends and multimillion dollar ceo payoffs are always paid on the backs of consumers no matter what the circumstances no matter what the profits no matter what the payouts eversource and avangrid have failed their customers and we will explore every available avenue to oppose these rate hikes we cannot expect these profit driven out of state companies to do what s right for connecticut residents ways to get help based on income various assistance is available from the connecticut energy assistance program online applications can be found at ct gov heatinghelp apply assistance is also available at operation fuel assistance by calling 860 243 2345 or operationfuel org gethelp eversource is hosting a webinar at noon dec 8 that covers options for help registration is required by calling 800 286 2828 or at eversource com billhelp looking ahead legislators realize that consumers are highly concerned about their rates with less than one month before the price hikes take effect the average ratepayer needleman said cannot tolerate a doubling of rates and it has us all scrambling to figure out what we can do as legislators as the policymakers we have an obligation to look at that volatility and decide what the right approach is house republican leader vincent candelora of north branford said the state needs to take a more comprehensive view and develop more generation sources in order to solve its electricity problems pura he said needs to be removed from the department of energy and environmental protection and become a completely independent agency once again previously known as the department of public utility control the dpuc was independent until it was folded into deep in 2011 by then gov dannel p malloy critics say that relationship represents a conflict of interest the solutions he said can only come through creative ideas on a larger scale it s about the state of connecticut not supporting policies like fracking like piping liquefied natural gas and like hydropower candelora said new england has put itself on an island by not looking at those alternative energy sources to supply our generation plants we should be looking at more nuclear but you mention that word and the environmentalists go crazy i think it s a much broader problem than deregulation connecticut has to get serious about diversifying and stop focusing just on solar and wind candelora who will be the third longest serving house republican when the new session starts concedes the solutions are not simple no one reads these energy bills he said and it s one of the more complicated issues in connecticut while the major issues remain unresolved many customers will be paying higher rates on jan 1 short term the public is going to be left in the dark candelora said there are no good short term solutions christopher keating

a reasonably small amount of cash can go a long way when invested in top notch companies when the curtain closes on 2022 in less than four weeks it ll likely go down as one of the toughest years in history for investors the bond market has trudged through its worst year ever while the broad based s p 500 which is typically viewed as an all encompassing barometer of stock market health produced its worst first half return since 1970 yet there s a silver lining to this mess at least for long term investors despite the s p 500 enduring 39 double digit percentage declines since the beginning of 1950 every single one save for the current bear market was eventually cleared away by a bull market rally in other words bear markets are the ideal time to put your money to work perhaps the best thing about today s stock market is that it s freer and fairer than at any point in history since most online brokerages have done away with commission fees and minimum deposit requirements any amount of money even 300 can be the perfect amount to put to work if you have 300 to invest that won t be used to pay bills or cover emergencies buying these four sensational stocks would be a smart end of year decision walt disney the first smart way to put 300 to work right now would be to buy shares of media stock walt disney dis 0 82 shares of disney have been hurt by weaker theme park attendance and lower film revenue tied to the covid 19 pandemic as well as steeper than anticipated losses as it ramps up its streaming services thankfully none of these headwinds have anything to do with long term consumer demand shifts what walt disney brings to the table for investors is unsurpassed customer engagement within the entertainment space disney has successfully raised its prices and outpaced inflation for decades because it can easily cross generational gaps to connect with people the company s characters and content aren t duplicable which fueled decades of outperformance equally important is that the company is looking to the future walt disney closed out its fiscal 2022 year ended oct 1 2022 with over 164 million disney subscribers and more aggregate subs including espn and hulu than netflix in fact it s taken disney less than three years to reach its current subscriber count by 2024 streaming should be a profitable segment for the company lastly former ceo bob iger is back in the saddle iger oversaw disney s acquisitions of pixar marvel entertainment and lucasfilm which transformed and enhanced an already rich content library with iger at the helm walt disney should have no trouble regaining its former glory nextera energy a second sensational stock that would make for a rock solid buy with 300 is nextera energy nee 1 67 the nation s largest electric utility stock by market cap although higher bond yields have made utility stocks less attractive in 2022 nextera has demonstrated for years that it s the cream of the crop among electric utilities nextera energy s not so subtle secret to success is its all in focus on renewable energy no utility company in the world is generating more capacity from wind or solar power with over a decade of ultra low lending rates nextera used debt to its advantage to finance this energy transformation as a result the company s electricity generation costs have fallen and its adjusted earnings per share have grown by annualized 8 4 over 15 years for context most electric utility stocks grow by a low single digit percentage annually understand that nextera s investments in a green future are far from over the company plans to deploy more than 6 billion in florida over the next four years to install 30 million solar panels when it was announced in 2019 this 30 by 30 initiative was expected to be ready by 2030 but it ll be reducing electricity generation costs years earlier than expected as a final note nextera energy benefits from predictability homeowners and renters electricity consumption habits don t change much from year to year allowing the company to confidently put its capital to work without worrying about compromising its dividend or profitability meta platforms a third phenomenal stock that makes for a genius end of year buy with 300 is social media behemoth meta platforms meta 0 09 meta s biggest hurdle is that it generates over 98 of its revenue from ads and the u s economy began 2022 with back to back quarters of gross domestic product declines in short recessionary fears coupled with huge losses from the company s metaverse operating segment reality labs have skeptics worried however there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the skeptics especially given meta s assets and balance sheet despite short term fears that a recession could take shape the company s four prized social media assets facebook whatsapp instagram and facebook messenger are consistently among the most downloaded apps globally what s more meta s family of apps had 3 71 billion unique monthly visitors during the third quarter with more than half of the world s adult population visiting at least one of its owned sites each month it won t be hard for the company to extract a premium price from advertisers during long winded bull markets the other consideration with meta platforms is that its free cash flow and balance sheet allow it to take risks other social media providers don t have the privilege of taking when september came to an end meta had 31 9 billion in net cash when coupled with the ongoing profits from advertising this is more than enough to allow the company to be aggressive with its metaverse investments meta remains historically inexpensive at roughly 15 times wall street s forward year profit forecast crowdstrike holdings the fourth sensational stock that would make for a rock solid end of year buy with 300 is cybersecurity company crowdstrike holdings crwd 0 12 despite getting walloped last week following the release of its fiscal third quarter operating results crowdstrike has the tools and competitive advantages investors look for in winning stocks crowdstrike s big advantage stems from its artificial intelligence ai driven cybersecurity platform called falcon falcon oversees about one trillion events per day and with each passing event is growing smarter at recognizing and responding to potential end user threats even though crowdstrike s platform is costlier than others its gross retention rate has steadily climbed signifying that its services are finding the mark with subscribers perhaps just as important is that crowdstrike s subscribers have been purchasing additional services for years when fiscal 2017 came to a close the company had 450 subscribers and a single digit percentage of those subs were purchasing at least four cloud module subscriptions less than six years later it s surpassed 21 000 subscribing customers with 60 of those subs purchasing as least five or more cloud module subscriptions adding new customers is great but having existing clients consistently grow their spend by 20 or more annually is the real key to crowdstrike s success if you need one more good reason to invest in crowdstrike consider the evolution of the cybersecurity industry over a quarter of a century what was once a luxury has become a basic necessity for businesses of all sizes in any economic environment with businesses steadily moving their data online and into the cloud there s going to be persistent demand and steady cash flow waiting for crowdstrike
these stocks are a bargain for patient investors the holiday season is here and while the stock market has been far more naughty than nice this year the good news is that there are plenty of bargains worth stuffing into an investment portfolio s stocking ford motor company f 1 15 devon energy dvn 0 95 and baker hughes bkr 1 08 stand out as three dirt cheap dividend stocks to buy now here s why ford blends value and income daniel foelber ford motor company ford stock is down nearly 44 from its all time high set near the start of 2022 as painful as the drawdown has been it is arguably justifiable automakers fall into the consumer discretionary category as the economy weakens and consumer spending falls car companies run into trouble and if the recession gets really bad consumers are more likely to default on their car payments than say their apartment home utility bills food and other essentials the macroeconomic outlook isn t good for ford and its peers rising interest rates throw yet another wrench in the investment thesis because they make financing new projects like multibillion dollar electric vehicle ev expansion all the more expensive supply chain challenges make it difficult for legacy automakers to produce vehicles reliably all told ford is currently in a tough spot and the worst could be yet to come putting ford on your watch list instead of buying now makes perfect sense given the level of uncertainty but there are a couple of reasons why a starter position in ford stock isn t the worst idea right now for starters the stock is dirt cheap trading at a price to earnings p e ratio of just 6 3 and a forward p e ratio of 7 1 to be fair automakers like ford tend to trade below market multiples but ford s ev prospects give the company a nice blend of value and growth throw in ford s 4 3 dividend yield and you have a steady stream of passive income that matches the risk free treasury bill rate oil the wheels of your passive income generation with devon energy scott levine devon energy while the chinese government s implementation of strict covid 19 lockdowns to stymie the spread of the virus is the latest catalyst energy prices have dipped lower on the fear of waning oil demand for a variety of reasons this in turn led investors to shy away from devon energy a leading upstream oil company that operates onshore in the united states investors seem to be speculating that energy prices will continue to dip leading devon energy to reduce its mouthwatering dividend which currently represents a forward yield of 8 1 since there s a strong correlation between the movements in energy prices and those of energy stocks like devon energy the stock s 11 2 decline over the past month a period during which west texas intermediate crude oil an oil benchmark fell more than 9 is not all that surprising while it may be disconcerting for investors to see shares of devon dip lower it s important for prospective investors to recognize that the stock s decline isn t related to something materially wrong with the company s business model or operations thus it shouldn t preclude prospective investors from picking up shares as of this writing investors can pick up shares of devon for a song the stock is now valued at about 7 times forward earnings a steep discount to its five year average forward earnings multiple of 19 6 prefer to assess the stock s valuation using a cash flow metric no problem the stock still looks attractive valued at 5 3 times operating cash flow no need to wait for the gift giving holidays income investors have the opportunity to energize their passive income today with shares of devon energy baker hughes stock has the potential to outperform its industry lee samaha baker hughes the price of oil and by implication demand for oil equipment and services is highly cyclical as such it may not make sense to invest in the sector ahead of an engineered economic slowdown however all cycles are different and throw up different investment opportunities each time in this case i think it s time to risk uttering the most famous last words in investing it s different this time the reality is that despite a widely anticipated slowdown the price of oil is still around 80 a barrel that s not a price traditionally associated with a recessionary period instead it s a price associated with ongoing investment in baker hughes solutions the strength in the price of oil is possibly due to some factors that don t look like they are going away anytime soon for example according to companies like baker hughes and caterpillar energy companies are exercising restraint in spending possibly in fear of the long term future of the carbon fuel industry in the face of the threat from renewable energy environmental regulation and windfall taxes moreover increasing geopolitical tensions are creating conditions where powerful opec member saudi arabia is increasingly aiming to cut production to keep prices high while capital spending restraints may appear to be a negative for baker hughes it is over the near term it sets up the industry for a long graduated increase in oil prices and capital spending and possible avoidance of the traditional boom and bust cycles baker hughes is exciting because it s restructuring its operations and cutting costs of course there s no guarantee baker hughes plans will work but it s usually a good idea to restructure when end markets are buoyant and for now that looks like the case for the energy sector

a balanced portfolio should have some great dividend stocks dividend stocks are always popular and they belong in any well diversified portfolio but more investors have become interested in dividends which provide a certain amount of stability and income in this volatile market some dividend stocks are better than others that can mean several things such as how high the yield is how reliable the dividend is and whether or not the dividend is increasing coca cola ko 0 14 costco cost 0 32 and home depot hd 0 92 are three top dividend stocks to buy today 1 the classic dividend king coca cola is a dividend king which means it s been paying and raising its dividend for at least 50 years the company owns iconic brands that breed strong consumer loyalty and generate steady and high levels of cash these in turn allow it to try new ventures and pay its generous dividend coke was hit hard at the beginning of the pandemic more so than others since its away from home category accounted for around half of total sales but through its efficient distribution channels and manufacturing networks trained through decades of improvements and upgrades it was able to quickly adapt and meet changing demand with an organizational restructuring and brand consolidation the company streamlined further to face a new landscape and it s as well positioned as ever to maintain its beverage dominance and drive higher sales it has posted double digit sales growth for the past six quarters including a 10 year over year increase in the 2022 third quarter illustrating how well it has recovered and moved forward from the initial declines it even managed to grow earnings per share eps 14 despite the tough operating environment coca cola s dividend usually yields around 3 at the current price it yields 2 8 that s because yield is inversely proportional with stock movement and coca cola stock has done exceptionally well this year gaining 8 against the backdrop of the s p 500 down 14 coca cola s dividend is as reliable as they come and its high yield and growth make it one of the best on the market 2 the special dividend costco isn t usually renowned for its dividend but it s a great stock to own for other reasons the company has a differentiated model with its fee based membership program and rock bottom prices this drives high volume especially when there are economic challenges costco has enjoyed unusually high sales growth for the past two years and although that continued when inflation began to explode it s beginning to slow down it was still strong in the most recently reported quarter the fourth fiscal quarter ended aug 28 with a 16 sales increase over last year including a 13 7 rise in comps however costco reports monthly sales and growth has decelerated each month since then through to a 5 7 sales increase over last year in november with a 4 3 rise in comps costco stock fell after the november report came out but that looks like a great opportunity for investors costco stock had become expensive trading at a high price to earnings ratio that s come down a bit to 38 at the current price costco stock has been expensive because it has delivered high gains for investors in the past and it s a strong bet for more costco s dividend yields only 0 68 at this price but it has been growing for many years what make it stand out though is the special dividend that management issues every few years most recently in 2020 for 10 that makes the yield much juicier and although management hasn t announced a new one yet it did say it would issue it again when the time is right 3 the right combination of yield growth and reliability like coca cola and costco home depot has developed a reliable robust operating model that balances growth in the right places with cost efficiencies making it a retail superstar it has expanded to become the largest home improvement chain in north america and shareholders can count on it to keep racking up sales and turning them into cash to fund the strong dividend you don t have to look further than how home depot managed through explosive pandemic growth and the shift to decelerating growth to see how capable it is at meeting customer demand with balanced inventory after some of its best quarters ever it s still demonstrating competitive progress in the third quarter ended oct 30 sales increased 5 6 and comps increased 4 3 eps rose from 3 92 to 4 24 home depot stock is down 21 this year underperforming the market that looks like a reaction to the state of retail and the overall economic climate as well as the company s growth slowdown at this price shares trade at the low price to earnings ratio of 19 putting the stock into bargain basement territory also at this price the dividend yields 2 4 home depot has raised its dividend for the past 12 years and it s a great stock to own for its growth potential as well as its steady and growing dividend
the greatest prize and achievement in nascar and all motorsports is the end of the season championship because it is the culmination of months and months of struggle preparation and dedication with seasons getting longer and longer the satisfaction of winning a nascar championship will be even greater however some incredible and amazing drivers could never put it all together for a single season and take the top ranking sometimes it was just a matter of being good while others were great and other times luck was not on their side whatever the case we take a look at the best nascar drivers who never won a cup series championship mark martin arguably the greatest nascar driver to never win a cup series championship mark martin burst onto the scene in the early 1980s showing a lot of promise and potential however sponsors were not satisfied with him as a result he races sporadically throughout the mid 80s until jack roush comes to visit him just a year later mark martin was winning his first race after that the rest was history achieving a total of 35 wins and four runner up finishes in the championship alongside roush racing in 2007 he would take kind of a part time role as he was looking to retire still the racing fuel did not exit his blood yet and when rick hendrick from hendrick motorsports offered him a full time multi year contract for his number five car in 2009 mark martin could not say no as a result he will get five more wins and another championship runner up and will go part time again in 2012 in 2013 he would make his final start and call it a day he had won nearly 100 races in the top three divisions but not a single championship to show for in any of them it s incredible how he did not have at least one considering he had 17 top ten points finishes in the cup series which included 13 top five points finishes of those seven were in a row from 1993 to 1999 besides having amazing results he was always very consistent but a combination of bad luck and incredible competitions made him the best driver not to win a cup series championship junior johnson he won six championships as a car owner but not one as a driver despite winning 50 races in his career behind the wheel including the 1960 daytona 500 event at that race he famously discovered the properties and benefits of drafting things were indeed pretty different back then because they were racing two or three times a week so compared to more modern drivers it s not really comparable photo cnn but let me change your perspective because junior johnson achieved 50 wins in just 313 starts which from a percentage standpoint is astonishing besides johnson s attempts at a full time season were also diminished by a lack of rides and other non racing problems as a result he never really got the points and finishes he deserved he drove for a lot of car owners but his true talents were made obvious when he prepared his own cars learning everything he could from the veterans and more experienced car owners junior maneuvered his way around the rules with expert precision and eventually found the ultimate winning way the victories started to pile up and he solidified his position as one of the greatest drivers to never win a championship davey allison a driver whose life was tragically cut short right in his prime dave allison was destined to take the nascar world by storm and he did exactly that despite having run only six full time seasons and 191 total race starts he achieved 19 wins taking victory at the 1988 daytona 500 event with the help of this race wins they scored three top ten points actually just in his last two seasons 1991 and 1992 he scored ten wins and finished third in the points back to back besides going to the final race of the 1992 nascar cup series season he was the favorite to win the title unfortunately fate had other plans for davey allison davey s real strength was at the superspeedways track and places like daytona michigan or talladega were his playgrounds he was undoubtedly going to be one of the best drivers in history and if he had not died in that helicopter crash in 1993 who knows how many titles and wins he would have taken from the likes of dale earnhardt and others edward glen fireball roberts when you have the nickname fireball it means you are pretty good at what you are doing mr roberts was one of the greatest finishing runner up in the standings in his first ever nascar season all the way back in 1950 despite only running nine of 19 events in only 206 starts fireball won 133 races he had several attempts at putting together a full time season still as per usual during that era full time rides were extremely hard to come by and it was often when from a logistical standpoint it was too difficult to get from one race to another and it s understandable because in a 60 race schedule there were often three races per week photo orlando sentinel still roberts managed six top ten points finishes from 1950 to 1963 and in 1962 he won the daytona 500 event in 1964 he had more than a good season but in the world 600 he wrecked on the backstretch while trying to avoid another crash as a result his car hit the inside wall with the trunk first flipped and immediately caught fire unfortunately he was trapped inside and severely burned a couple of weeks later he passed away at only 35 years old due to his injuries from that moment nascar implemented several new safety regulations which included mandated fireproof coveralls for drivers and self sealing fuel tanks if he had never been involved in that horrible crash he would definitely have added many accomplishments and championships curtis turner he was considered by many of his contemporaries to be the best driver ever and he indeed lived up to the hype on a lot of occasions he had won on all types of tracks whether talking of small dirt ovals or superspeedways he took the pole position for the inaugural southern 500 and was extremely loved by nascar fans for most of his time in the sport he couldn t take home a title the main reason was the one we discussed earlier running full time back then was just kind of unheard of but that wasn t the main problem the biggest reason he never achieved a championship was that in 1961 he was banned from nascar for life for trying to start up a drivers union when full time grand national competition was starting to become a reality for many drivers curtis turner got the short stick because he wanted a cut of broadcasting rights revenue photo nascar legends twitter he raced for four years in the smaller promotions trying to make a living out of racing stock cars however in 1965 after nascar saw its biggest star richard petty turn his attention to drag racing and ford with chrysler boycotted nascar over some engine disagreements fans were not showing up to events as a result nascar s officials lifted the ban on curtis turner and he made one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the competition winning his first race back it would prove to be his last one in the cup series and he ended his career with 17 wins and 184 starts in the lower divisions he achieved a considerable number of victories he was one of the best drivers ever but unfortunately nobody let him prove that these were the best drivers never to win a cup series championship but if you know of other names please let us know in the comments

reliability stemming from resiliency is the key when your investments absolutely have to generate income if your growth investing days are over or nearly so and you re more interested in steady income start your search with all weather stock names that are capable of healthy dividends regardless of the economy you ll likely need such reliability when your work income stops here are three such prospects that would make great dividend stocks for retirement 1 duke energy consumers and corporations might curb spending when money gets tight but they try to keep the lights on no matter what that s what makes utility stocks so reliable in terms of dividends and relatively generic in terms of stock performance while this means most utilities stocks are so similar that they re almost interchangeable there is one standout within the category duke energy duk 1 34 currently has one of the sector s best dividend yields at 4 and it is preparing for the future more effectively than most the company which has 8 2 million customers in the southeastern u s is reshaping itself for greater fiscal efficiency as an example last month duke energy announced an agreement to purchase mississippi s wildflower solar project which upon completion is expected to generate as much as 100 megawatts of electricity it already has a commitment from a nearby automobile manufacturer to purchase much of that power and to comply with growing numbers of state based carbon emission reduction plans the company is increasingly working directly with customers to help them better manage their consumption in indiana for instance duke offers rebates on commercial electric vehicle ev chargers and provides credits to consumers who charge their evs at off peak times other utilities have similar projects but few seem as forward thinking as duke so its long standing dividend 96 years worth of uninterrupted quarterly payouts remains protected into whatever future awaits 2 blackrock blackrock blk 1 75 manages several traditional mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs under the blackrock banner and it is the same company behind the popular ishares lineup of etfs its ishares core s p 500 etf for example holds roughly 300 billion worth of equities on behalf of investors blackrock s revenue and earnings aren t linked to the performance of its funds and etfs rather they re largely tied to the amount of money its investors allow it to continue managing even in rocky market environments the company still collects management fees even when stocks are tanking despite this year s marketwide weakness blackrock took in more new investor money than it paid back in each of the first three quarters of the year it s a testament to how well the company manages investor expectations and promotes itself even in turbulent times that doesn t mean blackrock s top and bottom lines are growing while investors are still willing to invest in the company s funds the broad market weakness means the value of blackrock s revenue bearing asset base is shrinking last quarter s revenue was lower by 15 year over year and per share profits were down 16 this ebb and flow isn t dramatic enough to prompt a dividend cut though indeed blackrock s dividend has grown every year since 2010 because its long term revenue and earnings growth is so resilient the current yield stands at 2 7 3 realty income lastly add realty income o 1 65 to your list of dividend stocks well suited for a retirement portfolio with its 4 8 yield realty income is a real estate investment trust reit meaning it gets favorable tax treatment for passing along the majority of its rental income to shareholders the company specializes in commercial space with a penchant for finding reliable tenants its three biggest renters are dollar general walgreens and 7 eleven not too much further down its tenant list you ll find fedex walmart and kroger businesses built to last even when the economy s wobbling that shows up in one of the company s key metrics at the end of the third quarter 98 9 of its space was leased and even in the throes of the pandemic the reit s portfolio monetization and rent collection held up pretty well this isn t what a current or future retiree should be stoked about though the more compelling attribute of realty income is the fact that it pays dividends monthly rather than quarterly which it s done for 628 consecutive months over 52 years and it has more than 25 consecutive years of annual dividend growth qualifying the reit as a dividend aristocrat the kicker while inflation is finally starting to cool and the federal reserve is seemingly entertaining less aggressive rate hikes interest rates are still positioned to edge higher which tends to favor the performance of realty income shares

creative process behind your playfully named treats angelia han i like to take nostalgic flavors from childhood snacks and things like that and re create them with more asian flair one of my top flavors cookiesz n bae is ube with black sesame and oreo so it s like my take on an asian cookies and cream how do you keep them so moist we actually freeze our cupcakes immediately after we bake and decorate them so that they retain the moisture our frosting is made with a whipped cream base instead of a buttercream what makes nymc stand out if you go to the grocery store or an american bakery the sweets are very sweet because they re western desserts so i wanted to offer an alternative i let customers who have never tried our cupcakes know that they re not going to be anywhere near as sweet as any cupcake they ve had why do you keep baking i believe my cupcakes will help bridge barriers and facilitate connections at the table because the brand and everything within it is cross

starter cheesecake matt dulin is smitten with cheesecake and after tasting his basque version at getright s you will be too as a teenager matt dulin was so crazy about cheesecake that he wrote a lyrical ode to the dessert my friend and i had a rap group called hot sauce and cheese says dulin the owner of getright s a new bakery houseplant nursery and event space in wheat ridge the duo broke up but dulin s obsession endured cheesecake particularly a caramelized crustless style called basque is still one of his favorite sweets so naturally he added the specialty to the rotating lineup at getright s which after regularly selling out of pop up and delivery goods since 2020 is set to debut a storefront in early 2023 the secret to dulin s basque cheesecakes which feature the usual cream cheese egg sugar flour salt and heavy cream is that he removes them from the oven a few minutes early while the centers are still jiggly leaving them in longer results in a grainier new york style

the cream cheese is light and fluffy this indicates that the sugar has dissolved into the batter with the mixer on medium speed add the eggs one at a time wait until each egg is mixed fully into the batter before adding the next after the eggs are fully mixed in slowly pour in the cream and blend everything until it s the same smooth consistency throughout scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and stir the mixture manually or using the mixer to ensure there are no lumps line an eight inch cake pan with a sheet of parchment paper that covers the entirety of the pan and comes up above the pan by about two inches on each side spray the paper with the non stick cooking spray then lightly sprinkle the granulated sugar evenly over the paper add the cheesecake batter to the prepared cake pan it might come all the way to the top lightly tap the bowl on the countertop to level and remove any air bubbles bake on the middle rack for 18 minutes after that time the cake should begin to brown on top but needs to be broiled for another five to six minutes to reach the final caramelized look and taste check each minute after 18 the color goes from nicely toasted to burnt very quickly also be sure to watch the parchment paper and make sure it doesn t get too close to the heating element or it may catch fire the cake should be removed from the oven when the top has just set around the first one inch nearest to the sides of the pan but the center will still look very loose and jiggly this ensures a very creamy luscious and custardy interior if you want a more

thanks to the tripledemic it can be hard to find kids fever reducing medicines washington d c npr if you stroll the cold and flu medicine aisle these days you might notice shelves that are bare or nearly so some medicines that can be particularly hard to find are fever reducers for kids like children s tylenol motrin or advil drug manufacturers point to a big spike in demand that s not surprising given the surge in three respiratory viruses right now covid rsv and influenza what has been termed a tripledemic johnson johnson makes children s tylenol and children s motrin it says there is no nationwide shortage just a lot of demand consumer demand for pediatric pain relievers in the u s is high but there are no supply chain issues and we do not have an overall shortage in the u s company spokesperson melissa witt said in an email to npr the company says it is experiencing high consumer demand and are doing everything we can to make sure people have access to the products they need nationally sales of pediatric internal analgesics which includes drugs like acetaminophen and ibuprofen were up more than 26 in october compared with a year earlier that s according to data from the consumer healthcare products association chpa a trade group that represents manufacturers of over the counter drugs while there may not be a countrywide shortage there is one part of the u s where finding these meds is most difficult areas near the canadian border the buffalo rochester area of western new york is seeing the highest demand in the u s chpa says sales for such products in the buffalo rochester market surged 53 in october compared to a year earlier that s very likely the result of an ongoing shortage of kids pain and fever medications in canada with buffalo s close proximity to toronto making it an ideal place for canadians to buy such products in the u s a spot check on thursday in washington d c of four stores a giant supermarket a cvs a target and a bed bath beyond found low supplies of children s fever reducers though each had at least a few of such medicines available supplies were low of cold and flu products for adults as well the supply chain is strong says anita brikman a spokesperson for chpa but parents and caregivers may need to check more than one store buy a store brand instead of a name brand or order products online she suggests parents have a range of options for treating fevers so what to do if you have a fevered child and are struggling to find children s tylenol or a similar product there s a good chance you don t even need to use medicine says dr sean o leary a professor of pediatrics at the university of colorado school of medicine and children s hospital colorado as well as the chair of the committee on infectious diseases for the american academy of pediatrics aap these medicines are not curative they don t alter the duration of the illness or anything like that they are essentially purely for comfort he tells npr fevers from common respiratory viruses in and of themselves are not harmful he offers a scenario if temp is 103 but he s running around the room having a good time playing you don t need to do anything with that that s not going to hurt him fever is representing our body s immune response to an infection on the other hand if he doesn t have a fever but his throat is hurting something is bothering him he s pretty fussy then that s where things like ibuprofen or tylenol acetaminophen can be helpful aap has guidance on treating a child s fever as well advice on treating a fever without medicine often when kids do have a fever they do feel pretty crummy and so that s a time to use such medicines it s to treat how the child is feeling o leary says fever is a more serious concern in infants and children who experience febrile seizures fever in very young infants in newborns is actually a different situation and that s something that does need evaluation o leary says essentially the younger the child the more concerned you should be about a fever for example a 2 week old with a fever is something that that needs immediate medical attention a 6 month old with a fever that s otherwise doing well does not need immediate medical attention can simply call their child s pediatrician to get that checked out be very careful with adapting adult medications parents at home might be eyeing their bottle of adult acetaminophen or ibuprofen and wondering if they could give a smaller amount to their sick child but there s reason to be very cautious with that and to consult a doctor or pharmacist first to find out the correct dosage for your particular child for both acetaminophen and ibuprofen there are potential toxicities from taking too much some of which can be quite severe particularly for acetaminophen so you really have to be careful when you do that o leary says wendy mobley bukstein a professor of pharmacy practice at drake university and the president of the american pharmacists association academy of pharmacy practice and management agrees it s best to talk to the doctor or pharmacist she tells npr if a parent or caregiver can weigh at home tell us what they weigh on their scale at home we can figure out what an appropriate dose would be for them to take she says she explains that repetitively giving a child too large a dose could have liver implications with acetaminophen and kidney implications with ibuprofen and mobley bukstein has another piece of advice get kids vaccinated for covid 19 and flu even if you still get the flu or even if you still get covid it s definitely going to lessen the severity of the disease itself and so just making sure that they re getting their immunizations is really important she says psa please don t hoard the meds brikman at the chpa worries that the notion that there is a shortage will spur parents to buy more than they need if families start to stock up in worry as opposed to buying what they need we are concerned that that could amplify the situation she says and if you were thinking of stocking up on a bunch of fever meds just in case mobley bukstein has a practical warning these products do expire so putting a whole bunch of them in your medicine cabinet at home might not serve you if you don t get sick or if your kids don t get sick she says it s important for us to remember that they do have expiration dates that it can be dangerous to give expired medications and so only buy what you need when you need it and use up what you have at home before you go and buy new if it s still in date

with sharp electricity rate increases less than one month away state officials are scrambling to try to soften the blow for ratepayers as they approach the cold winter months starting jan 1 the state s two largest electric utilities will be enacting 100 rate increases on the generation portion of their bills that will hike costs by about 85 per month for the average eversource customer and nearly 80 per month for united illuminating that covers 17 towns near the shoreline the increases can be traced all the way back to the state s switch to electrical deregulation that was approved in 1998 under then gov john g rowland deregulation reduced the powers of state officials to set electrical rates and opened the market to a wide variety of electrical generators who sell power on a competitive basis consumers started shopping around to get discounted rates from a variety of providers but many ratepayers eventually gave up over the years after receiving short term rates that were suddenly increased when their low rate expired as a result 90 of eversource customers now take the standard rate that is offered by the company according to the state s consumer counsel in the same way 83 of ui customers currently take the standard rate instead of shopping around those eversource and ui customers will see an increase of about 100 in the generation portion of their bill which is separate from the distribution portion charged by the utilities over the past five years the supply rates charged by the utilities in a pass through from the generators have been in a relatively narrow range of about 8 cents to 12 cents per kilowatt hour the prices have been nowhere near the new rate of 24 cents the level coming jan 1 that has sparked outrage around the state gov ned lamont says that eversource customers will receive a monthly credit of about 10 on their bills and the state will be working in future months to help low income ratepayers who qualify for assistance while many consumers have fallen out of the habit in recent years state officials say that they can avoid the price hikes by shopping around for a better price for their electricity sen norm needleman an essex democrat who co chairs the legislature s energy committee said there is an alternative with third party suppliers that are outlined at energizect com the companies include north american power and xoom energy ct among others compared to the coming 24 cents per kilowatt hour for eversource customers constellation newenergy inc recently has charged 13 79 cents per kilowatt hour for three years as of dec 1 the rate increased to 16 59 cents for the three year plan according to the company s website constellation is still a viable alternative in the market at below 14 cents or at least they were needleman told the courant this is likely to be a blip no one can guarantee it it s a volatile market if you lock in to get constellation s current offer and rates go back to 8 cents or 9 cents or 10 cents you re going to be angry about it some consumers have been burned over the past decade when trying to get the best generation rates part of the problem with the third party providers is that they demonstrated over the last 10 years that their approach to selling to consumers has been less than stellar needleman said in an interview you have door to door sales people who are predatory who provide you teaser rates you do a 12 month contract and save a little bit of money and in month 13 the average consumer isn t following this in month 13 any savings they had over the past 12 months they give back in one month before the bill can be changed attorney general william tong who was standing next to needleman during the interview added we pushed at least a couple of those bad actors out of the market in just the past 12 months at least two tong notes that eversource and ui do not collect profits from the supply rates because those are pass through costs from the electric generators but from the distribution rates the utilities earn profits that totaled 540 million in net income for eversource and 59 million for ui at the moment the price has skyrocketed far beyond what consumers have seen in the past it s the dark side of deregulation needleman said i can t tell you if you go over the last 20 years has the state benefitted from deregulation on the supply side my feeling is that the ratepayers of the state for an essential service like electricity not only deserve as close to the best prices they can get but they need stability what you see in a deregulated market is an inherent amount of volatility we ve created a market for electricity that is half regulated and half deregulated needleman and his fellow senate democrats have called upon the state s public utilities regulatory authority to hold a joint multistate hearing to examine eversource operations in new hampshire and massachusetts as well as connecticut no date has been announced for a public hearing this is not a problem that connecticut alone can solve the senators said we do not live in a vacuum and this crisis requires a regional solution connecticut must work with massachusetts and new hampshire the other states in which eversource operates together we can hold eversource accountable as our ratepayers demand broader issues on electricity state officials concede that far larger forces are at work that are impacting connecticut the main reason for the supply rate increase said state consumer counsel claire e coleman is the global impact of russia s invasion of ukraine which has caused higher prices for oil and natural gas globally and here in the u s connecticut like all new england states is heavily reliant on natural gas for electricity and therefore when the market price of natural gas increases supply rates also increase coleman added even though the united states only imports a small amount from eastern europe the disruptions are affecting prices worldwide including in the united states and particularly in new england where we still rely heavily on natural gas and on liquified natural gas lng which has been in higher demand in europe resulting in significant increases to the price of lng which sets the market price on the broader issues of energy policy state officials say they have been working on the problem in a variety of ways the state has taken several actions to help insulate residents from situations like this which is why we kept the millstone power station online providing a cheap reliable and carbon free source of electricity online that is generating net profits that are being returned to eversource and ui customers said katie dykes the state environmental commissioner this is why we employ strategic electricity procurement practices and why the governor has kept our energy efficiency programs funded it s also why the state is working hard to diversify its energy mix and has pursued past and ongoing procurements for clean energy resources such as solar and offshore wind that will reduce our reliance on fossil fuel resources over time tong has been following the developments closely and speaking with utility executives the challenge for us in the office of the attorney general is this is unconscionable right now to double the price from 12 cents per kilowatt hour to 24 cents per kilowatt hour tong said in an interview people are getting punished we expected some change from summer to winter in the cost of natural gas and the cost of the commodity but we didn t expect a doubling we re essentially at the mercy of the global energy market this underscores how important it is to move away from natural gas and to other sources i just toured millstone by the way not that long ago tong has agreed to settlements with eversource and ui in the past on the distribution portion of the bill that s where we can really lean on them and that s where we ll fight the utilities at pura on the distribution side tong said but on the fuel side it s ugly specifically i have asked them to contribute a percentage of shareholder earnings commensurate with the percentage increase their customers will pay this winter to keep their lights and heat on to date they have refused tong said we need to take a hard look at who is profiting and who is harmed as we search for long term reform senate president pro tempore martin looney of new haven and senate majority leader bob duff of norwalk jointly condemned the hikes eversource has doubled its stock price in the past 10 years and avangrid posts billions of dollars in profit each and every year they said it never ceases to amaze us how quarterly shareholder dividends and multimillion dollar ceo payoffs are always paid on the backs of consumers no matter what the circumstances no matter what the profits no matter what the payouts eversource and avangrid have failed their customers and we will explore every available avenue to oppose these rate hikes we cannot expect these profit driven out of state companies to do what s right for connecticut residents ways to get help based on income various assistance is available from the connecticut energy assistance program online applications can be found at ct gov heatinghelp apply assistance is also available at operation fuel assistance by calling 860 243 2345 or operationfuel org gethelp eversource is hosting a webinar at noon dec 8 that covers options for help registration is required by calling 800 286 2828 or at eversource com billhelp looking ahead legislators realize that consumers are highly concerned about their rates with less than one month before the price hikes take effect the average ratepayer needleman said cannot tolerate a doubling of rates and it has us all scrambling to figure out what we can do as legislators as the policymakers we have an obligation to look at that volatility and decide what the right approach is house republican leader vincent candelora of north branford said the state needs to take a more comprehensive view and develop more generation sources in order to solve its electricity problems pura he said needs to be removed from the department of energy and environmental protection and become a completely independent agency once again previously known as the department of public utility control the dpuc was independent until it was folded into deep in 2011 by then gov dannel p malloy critics say that relationship represents a conflict of interest the solutions he said can only come through creative ideas on a larger scale it s about the state of connecticut not supporting policies like fracking like piping liquefied natural gas and like hydropower candelora said new england has put itself on an island by not looking at those alternative energy sources to supply our generation plants we should be looking at more nuclear but you mention that word and the environmentalists go crazy i think it s a much broader problem than deregulation connecticut has to get serious about diversifying and stop focusing just on solar and wind candelora who will be the third longest serving house republican when the new session starts concedes the solutions are not simple no one reads these energy bills he said and it s one of the more complicated issues in connecticut while the major issues remain unresolved many customers will be paying higher rates on jan 1 short term the public is going to be left in the dark candelora said there are no good short term solutions christopher keating

absolutely crushed its share price pushing it down 55 this year cannabis regulations continue to restrict operators access to capital so a company like innovative still has a lot of room to grow as it meets the market demand for capital and financing this was abundantly clear in its last earnings revenue was up 32 year over year stronger than expected third quarter earnings helped the stock rebound slightly but it s still trading near its lowest levels in three years today s beaten up price however is to investors advantage the stock s dividend yield at 5 6 is nearly quadruple that of the s p 500 plus the reit currently trades for around 22 times its funds from operations ffo a metric similar to the price to earnings ratio that provides a more useful metric of a reit s performance shares last year were trading at multiples 30 to 35 times ffo making today s pricing a steal of a deal take the road to gains mike price construction partners the ups and downs of the real estate industry are very closely tied to the economy as a whole and to interest rates it s why many saw record revenue and earnings in 2020 and 2021 and also why several saw a 50 drop in business once interest rates started going up in 2022 if unemployment goes up people don t have money to make mortgage payments if interest rates go up mortgage payments get too high because the industry is somewhat predictable this way it s pretty clear why the majority of reit stocks and other real estate stocks got crushed in 2022 traders anticipated a slowdown and sold off their holdings construction partners was one of the reits that took a hit saw its stock tumble from an all time high of 45 in november 2021 38 to a recent low of 18 89 per share when interest rates were hiked a 58 drop the stock has partially recovered since but it is still down 36 from its high what s unusual here is that construction partners business is mostly immune to the normal macroeconomic forces that affect the industry construction partners is an infrastructure company it focuses on short and medium term road projects this type of construction will almost always be necessary no matter what s going on with the economy in general construction partners is also partially immune to the supply chain problems that are affecting the industry because it s vertically integrated the company mines for its own materials operates the plants to turn them into asphalt owns the asphalt terminal and then manages the projects using subcontractors to do more specialized work when necessary the company grows mostly through acquisition it made 35 acquisitions over several years to roll up a fragmented industry in the six states where it operates this has led to rapid growth in revenue from 680 million in 2018 to 1 3 billion in 2022 the company is likely to keep expanding whether or not the broader real estate industry is doing well this reit offers a taste of farmland profits to stockholders kristi waterworth gladstone land if you re looking for a stock that can take a licking and keep on ticking gladstone land is definitely one to bet on for the long term the stock is currently down nearly 50 from its high in april largely over concerns about how rising interest rates might affect its tenants operations as well as the long term debt the reit carries but little about the business model for gladstone land has changed despite the dip in the share price if anything the company has accelerated its plans to expand its operations even further gladstone land is a farmland reit that owns and leases farmland to different kinds of producers as of the end of q3 2022 it owned 169 farms totaling 115 288 acres across the country with the largest holdings in california florida and michigan the farms the company leases produce over 60 types of crops including short term crops like annual berries and vegetables and longer term crops like almonds blueberries grapes and pistachios this kind of diversification helps to spread the risk should a particular crop not perform well in a specific year the focus on longer term crops also helps to ensure that tenants will renew their leases since things like almond trees can t simply be dug up and moved elsewhere so a farmer can start a new farm on another piece of land the reit reports a 100 occupancy rate on its properties the strength of this simple business model can t be overstated and despite current market conditions continues to show its strength for q3 operating revenue increased from 19 59 million in 2021 to 24 21 million in 2022 a 23 58 gain year over year net income followed with a 20 increase from q3 2021 to q3 2022 the growth is making its way to the bottom line and its monthly dividends 0 0458 per share for december continue to grow as well the dividend pays out 0 5496 per share annually and currently yields 2 67
wall street is bracing for a stock decline in 2023 as major three banks in the united states has predicted us stocks could fall by more than 20 per cent next year s p 500 stock index has so far managed to revive its october decline by gaining 13 and getting back to 4000 levels whereas major banks are of the opinion that it was a temporary rally of the stock market which will not last for a long time wall street stocks have been witnessing a bearish trend for long period mainly because of concerns among investors about the possibility of a recession in the next fiscal morgan stanley new york based morgan stanley states that s p 500 could fall nearly 24 in the first four months of 2023 pushing the stock index to somewhere between 3 000 and 3 300 as 2023 progresses the stocks will witness immense volatility as earnings will be hit by the recession mike wilson who is chief us equity strategist in morgan stanley said that the bear market is not over and 2023 is going to be a wild ride with high volatility and lowest lows bank of america according to bank of america stocks in s p 500 will tumble by nearly 24 from the current levels and hit 3000 the crash in stocks will be mainly catered by lower business and consumer spending which will adversely impact corporate earnings the banks also expect the us economy to suffer a 0 4 drop in economic growth in the first quarter of the next financial year quantitative tightening by federal reserve might also disrupt market liquidity as it trims around 95 billion in treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities each month from its 9 trillion balance sheet deutsche bank deutsche bank stated in its 2023 outlook that the global capital market will witness a huge decrease in value as the us economy will slow down mainly due to high interest rates imposed by federal reserve contrary to predictions by morgan stanley and bank of america deutsche bank expects us stocks to tank by over 25 in the third quarter of the next financial year its team likewise sees stocks recovering by the end of 2023 as long as the recession doesn t last beyond several quarters high inflation triggered by an increase in oil prices had forced us federal reserve to hike key interest rates higher interest rates are used as a monetary tool to bring down inflation in the economy as interest rate increases cash flow in the economy decreases which will bring down demand for commodities as demand goes down inflation will also come down with it but one major problem with higher interest rates is that it might push the economy into a recession where people do not spend money on commodities as consumer spending decreases the revenue of companies is falling down which will be taken as a bad sign by the stock market

investors can find market beating investments even when most stocks are down the s p 500 is down 14 year to date as of this writing as it stands this is the worst year for the stock market since 2008 and it s the third worst year for stocks since 1974 with depressing results like these you might think the market is comprised entirely of losers but you d be wrong shares of beverage company celsius holdings celh 1 32 shoemaker crocs crox 2 17 and law enforcement technology company axon enterprise axon 0 99 have already more than doubled from their 52 week lows and look poised for future gains 1 celsius up 180 since jan 27 celsius sells energy drinks it claims will burn calories even when resting the company has been around for about two decades but only gained meaningful distribution and market share in recent years and with its recent gains the stock has roared higher it s up not only 180 from this year s low but also up over 2 000 in just the past three years obviously it s not enough to just increase distribution consumers must also buy the product but that s what s happening with celsius year to date celsius has been the top driver of growth in the u s energy drink category consumers apparently love it so it s not surprising the company s top line is soaring as well with year to date revenue up 126 compared to the same period in 2021 if it s true that increased distribution is driving gains for celsius stock shareholders better hold onto their hats the company signed a distribution deal with pepsico that celsius management says will take the business to the next level pepsi only took over celsius distribution on oct 1 so the impact of the deal wasn t felt during the third quarter of 2022 however celsius management noted an immediate increase in sales metrics in the weeks following the change which bodes well for the fourth quarter and beyond in my opinion the most tantalizing aspect of celsius deal with pepsi is international expansion through the first three quarters of 2022 celsius has generated net sales of 476 million 94 of which came from north american markets by contrast pepsi is a global brand and it has the international network to propel celsius to worldwide prominence i wouldn t expect 180 returns in 2023 but celsius still has a long runway for future gains even if another doubling isn t imminent 2 crocs up 111 since june 16 i believe crocs stock can double faster than celsius the path is clear a big component of my investment thesis relates to croc s 2 5 billion acquisition of peer heydude for starters i believe it paid a great price the heydude brand alone is expected to generate revenue of 940 million to 980 million in 2022 meaning crocs paid just 2 6 times sales for the fast growing brand for perspective heydude s revenue was around 570 million in 2021 giving it about 68 year over year growth heydude will help crocs fuel its top line in the coming years but the crocs brand itself is still growing nicely as well management expects full year crocs brand revenue of over 2 6 billion in 2022 up 13 and by expanding into new geographies gaining market share and raising prices management believes it can achieve over 6 billion in total company revenue in 2026 just four full years from now crocs profit margins are better than heydude s in the third quarter crocs brand had a gross margin of 54 9 whereas heydude s gross margin was just 48 8 but i m betting crocs more experienced management team can squeeze greater profitability out of heydude in the coming years long term management is shooting for an operating margin of at least 26 if it surpasses 6 billion in revenue the company s operating income could reach 1 5 billion and if the stock trades at a multiple of just eight times its operating profit a below average valuation crocs would have a market capitalization of 12 billion in 2026 that s double where crocs stock trades today so no it s not too late for long term investors to buy crocs stock 3 axon enterprise up 120 since may 11 on nov 8 axon enterprise reported financial results for the third quarter of 2022 and it was the company s best quarter this year the company grew revenue 34 year over year to 312 million earned 12 million in net income and raised revenue guidance for full year 2022 but these aren t the numbers that impressed me the most most of axon s revenue comes in package deals agencies can get nonlethal tasers body cameras cloud storage and software services all in one contract these contracts are signed for long periods some even 10 years giving investors great visibility into future revenue but this also means the business generates a large percentage of recurring revenue these are the numbers that impressed me axon s annual recurring revenue arr at the end of the third quarter was 403 million up 9 5 quarter over quarter that s axon s largest quarterly jump in arr this year moreover the company s remaining performance obligations rpo sit at 3 7 billion up 400 million from the second quarter and the biggest quarterly jump in 2022 of these stocks i believe it will take axon the longest to double from here because of its price tag some might point out its valuation is comparable to celsius however celsius should see stronger growth in the near term thanks to its partnership with pepsi by contrast axon stock looks like it might be getting ahead of itself that said if you told me i had to invest in only one of these three companies and couldn t touch the investment even once for the next 10 years i d invest in axon as noted its long term contracts make this an incredibly predictable business it s gaining momentum with new customer bases including federal agencies like the secret service and the company is loaded with 371 million in cash equivalents and investments with no debt to be clear i like celsius crocs and axon as long term investments but axon is as strong of an investment opportunity as they come
a reasonably small amount of cash can go a long way when invested in top notch companies when the curtain closes on 2022 in less than four weeks it ll likely go down as one of the toughest years in history for investors the bond market has trudged through its worst year ever while the broad based s p 500 which is typically viewed as an all encompassing barometer of stock market health produced its worst first half return since 1970 yet there s a silver lining to this mess at least for long term investors despite the s p 500 enduring 39 double digit percentage declines since the beginning of 1950 every single one save for the current bear market was eventually cleared away by a bull market rally in other words bear markets are the ideal time to put your money to work perhaps the best thing about today s stock market is that it s freer and fairer than at any point in history since most online brokerages have done away with commission fees and minimum deposit requirements any amount of money even 300 can be the perfect amount to put to work if you have 300 to invest that won t be used to pay bills or cover emergencies buying these four sensational stocks would be a smart end of year decision walt disney the first smart way to put 300 to work right now would be to buy shares of media stock walt disney dis 0 82 shares of disney have been hurt by weaker theme park attendance and lower film revenue tied to the covid 19 pandemic as well as steeper than anticipated losses as it ramps up its streaming services thankfully none of these headwinds have anything to do with long term consumer demand shifts what walt disney brings to the table for investors is unsurpassed customer engagement within the entertainment space disney has successfully raised its prices and outpaced inflation for decades because it can easily cross generational gaps to connect with people the company s characters and content aren t duplicable which fueled decades of outperformance equally important is that the company is looking to the future walt disney closed out its fiscal 2022 year ended oct 1 2022 with over 164 million disney subscribers and more aggregate subs including espn and hulu than netflix in fact it s taken disney less than three years to reach its current subscriber count by 2024 streaming should be a profitable segment for the company lastly former ceo bob iger is back in the saddle iger oversaw disney s acquisitions of pixar marvel entertainment and lucasfilm which transformed and enhanced an already rich content library with iger at the helm walt disney should have no trouble regaining its former glory nextera energy a second sensational stock that would make for a rock solid buy with 300 is nextera energy nee 1 67 the nation s largest electric utility stock by market cap although higher bond yields have made utility stocks less attractive in 2022 nextera has demonstrated for years that it s the cream of the crop among electric utilities nextera energy s not so subtle secret to success is its all in focus on renewable energy no utility company in the world is generating more capacity from wind or solar power with over a decade of ultra low lending rates nextera used debt to its advantage to finance this energy transformation as a result the company s electricity generation costs have fallen and its adjusted earnings per share have grown by annualized 8 4 over 15 years for context most electric utility stocks grow by a low single digit percentage annually understand that nextera s investments in a green future are far from over the company plans to deploy more than 6 billion in florida over the next four years to install 30 million solar panels when it was announced in 2019 this 30 by 30 initiative was expected to be ready by 2030 but it ll be reducing electricity generation costs years earlier than expected as a final note nextera energy benefits from predictability homeowners and renters electricity consumption habits don t change much from year to year allowing the company to confidently put its capital to work without worrying about compromising its dividend or profitability meta platforms a third phenomenal stock that makes for a genius end of year buy with 300 is social media behemoth meta platforms meta 0 09 meta s biggest hurdle is that it generates over 98 of its revenue from ads and the u s economy began 2022 with back to back quarters of gross domestic product declines in short recessionary fears coupled with huge losses from the company s metaverse operating segment reality labs have skeptics worried however there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the skeptics especially given meta s assets and balance sheet despite short term fears that a recession could take shape the company s four prized social media assets facebook whatsapp instagram and facebook messenger are consistently among the most downloaded apps globally what s more meta s family of apps had 3 71 billion unique monthly visitors during the third quarter with more than half of the world s adult population visiting at least one of its owned sites each month it won t be hard for the company to extract a premium price from advertisers during long winded bull markets the other consideration with meta platforms is that its free cash flow and balance sheet allow it to take risks other social media providers don t have the privilege of taking when september came to an end meta had 31 9 billion in net cash when coupled with the ongoing profits from advertising this is more than enough to allow the company to be aggressive with its metaverse investments meta remains historically inexpensive at roughly 15 times wall street s forward year profit forecast crowdstrike holdings the fourth sensational stock that would make for a rock solid end of year buy with 300 is cybersecurity company crowdstrike holdings crwd 0 12 despite getting walloped last week following the release of its fiscal third quarter operating results crowdstrike has the tools and competitive advantages investors look for in winning stocks crowdstrike s big advantage stems from its artificial intelligence ai driven cybersecurity platform called falcon falcon oversees about one trillion events per day and with each passing event is growing smarter at recognizing and responding to potential end user threats even though crowdstrike s platform is costlier than others its gross retention rate has steadily climbed signifying that its services are finding the mark with subscribers perhaps just as important is that crowdstrike s subscribers have been purchasing additional services for years when fiscal 2017 came to a close the company had 450 subscribers and a single digit percentage of those subs were purchasing at least four cloud module subscriptions less than six years later it s surpassed 21 000 subscribing customers with 60 of those subs purchasing as least five or more cloud module subscriptions adding new customers is great but having existing clients consistently grow their spend by 20 or more annually is the real key to crowdstrike s success if you need one more good reason to invest in crowdstrike consider the evolution of the cybersecurity industry over a quarter of a century what was once a luxury has become a basic necessity for businesses of all sizes in any economic environment with businesses steadily moving their data online and into the cloud there s going to be persistent demand and steady cash flow waiting for crowdstrike

by fergal smith toronto reuters as the bank of canada considers ditching oversized interest rate hikes it is dealing with an economy likely more overheated than previously thought but also the bond market s clearest signal yet that recession and lower inflation lie ahead canada s central bank says that the economy needs to slow from overheated levels in order to ease inflation if its tightening campaign overshoots to achieve that objective it could trigger a deeper downturn than expected the bond market could be flagging that risk the yield on the canadian 10 year government bond has fallen nearly 100 basis points below the 2 year yield marking the biggest inversion of canada s yield curve in refinitiv data going back to 1994 and deeper than the u s treasury yield curve inversion some analysts see curve inversions as predictors of recessions canada s economy is likely to be particularly sensitive to higher rates after canadians borrowed heavily during the covid 19 pandemic to participate in a red hot housing market markets think the canadian economy is about to suffer a triple blow as domestic consumption collapses u s demand weakens and global commodity prices drop said karl schamotta chief market strategist at corpay the boc has opened the door to slowing the pace of rate increases to a quarter of a percentage point following multiple oversized hikes in recent months that lifted the benchmark rate to 3 75 its highest since 2008 money markets are betting on a 25 basis point increase when the bank meets to set policy on wednesday but a slim majority of economists in a reuters poll expect a larger move resilient economy canada s employment report for november showed that the labour market remains tight while gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2 9 in the third quarter that s much stronger than the 1 5 pace forecast by the boc and together with upward revisions to historical growth could indicate that demand has moved further ahead of supply economists say but they also say that the details of the third quarter gdp data including a contraction in domestic demand and a preliminary report showing no growth in october are signs that higher borrowing costs have begun to impact activity the boc has forecast that growth would stall from the fourth quarter of this year through the middle of 2023 the depth of canada s curve inversion is signaling a bad recession not a mild one said david rosenberg chief economist strategist at rosenberg research it reflects greater risk to the outlook in canada than the united states due to a more inflated residential real estate market and consumer debt bubble rosenberg said inflation is likely to be more persistent after it spread from goods prices to services and wages where higher costs can become more entrenched still 3 month measures of underlying inflation that are closely watched by the boc cpi median and cpi trim show price pressures easing they fell to an average of 2 75 in october according to estimates by stephen brown senior canada economist at capital economics that s well below more commonly used 12 month rates the yield curve would not invert to this extent unless investors also believed that inflation will drop back down toward the bank s target said brown like the federal reserve the boc has a 2 target for inflation the curve is telling us the bank of canada will be forced into a reversal by late 2023 with rates remaining depressed for years to come corpay s schamotta said reporting by fergal smith editing by andrea ricci
with sharp electricity rate increases less than one month away state officials are scrambling to try to soften the blow for ratepayers as they approach the cold winter months starting jan 1 the state s two largest electric utilities will be enacting 100 rate increases on the generation portion of their bills that will hike costs by about 85 per month for the average eversource customer and nearly 80 per month for united illuminating that covers 17 towns near the shoreline the increases can be traced all the way back to the state s switch to electrical deregulation that was approved in 1998 under then gov john g rowland deregulation reduced the powers of state officials to set electrical rates and opened the market to a wide variety of electrical generators who sell power on a competitive basis consumers started shopping around to get discounted rates from a variety of providers but many ratepayers eventually gave up over the years after receiving short term rates that were suddenly increased when their low rate expired as a result 90 of eversource customers now take the standard rate that is offered by the company according to the state s consumer counsel in the same way 83 of ui customers currently take the standard rate instead of shopping around those eversource and ui customers will see an increase of about 100 in the generation portion of their bill which is separate from the distribution portion charged by the utilities over the past five years the supply rates charged by the utilities in a pass through from the generators have been in a relatively narrow range of about 8 cents to 12 cents per kilowatt hour the prices have been nowhere near the new rate of 24 cents the level coming jan 1 that has sparked outrage around the state gov ned lamont says that eversource customers will receive a monthly credit of about 10 on their bills and the state will be working in future months to help low income ratepayers who qualify for assistance while many consumers have fallen out of the habit in recent years state officials say that they can avoid the price hikes by shopping around for a better price for their electricity sen norm needleman an essex democrat who co chairs the legislature s energy committee said there is an alternative with third party suppliers that are outlined at energizect com the companies include north american power and xoom energy ct among others compared to the coming 24 cents per kilowatt hour for eversource customers constellation newenergy inc recently has charged 13 79 cents per kilowatt hour for three years as of dec 1 the rate increased to 16 59 cents for the three year plan according to the company s website constellation is still a viable alternative in the market at below 14 cents or at least they were needleman told the courant this is likely to be a blip no one can guarantee it it s a volatile market if you lock in to get constellation s current offer and rates go back to 8 cents or 9 cents or 10 cents you re going to be angry about it some consumers have been burned over the past decade when trying to get the best generation rates part of the problem with the third party providers is that they demonstrated over the last 10 years that their approach to selling to consumers has been less than stellar needleman said in an interview you have door to door sales people who are predatory who provide you teaser rates you do a 12 month contract and save a little bit of money and in month 13 the average consumer isn t following this in month 13 any savings they had over the past 12 months they give back in one month before the bill can be changed attorney general william tong who was standing next to needleman during the interview added we pushed at least a couple of those bad actors out of the market in just the past 12 months at least two tong notes that eversource and ui do not collect profits from the supply rates because those are pass through costs from the electric generators but from the distribution rates the utilities earn profits that totaled 540 million in net income for eversource and 59 million for ui at the moment the price has skyrocketed far beyond what consumers have seen in the past it s the dark side of deregulation needleman said i can t tell you if you go over the last 20 years has the state benefitted from deregulation on the supply side my feeling is that the ratepayers of the state for an essential service like electricity not only deserve as close to the best prices they can get but they need stability what you see in a deregulated market is an inherent amount of volatility we ve created a market for electricity that is half regulated and half deregulated needleman and his fellow senate democrats have called upon the state s public utilities regulatory authority to hold a joint multistate hearing to examine eversource operations in new hampshire and massachusetts as well as connecticut no date has been announced for a public hearing this is not a problem that connecticut alone can solve the senators said we do not live in a vacuum and this crisis requires a regional solution connecticut must work with massachusetts and new hampshire the other states in which eversource operates together we can hold eversource accountable as our ratepayers demand broader issues on electricity state officials concede that far larger forces are at work that are impacting connecticut the main reason for the supply rate increase said state consumer counsel claire e coleman is the global impact of russia s invasion of ukraine which has caused higher prices for oil and natural gas globally and here in the u s connecticut like all new england states is heavily reliant on natural gas for electricity and therefore when the market price of natural gas increases supply rates also increase coleman added even though the united states only imports a small amount from eastern europe the disruptions are affecting prices worldwide including in the united states and particularly in new england where we still rely heavily on natural gas and on liquified natural gas lng which has been in higher demand in europe resulting in significant increases to the price of lng which sets the market price on the broader issues of energy policy state officials say they have been working on the problem in a variety of ways the state has taken several actions to help insulate residents from situations like this which is why we kept the millstone power station online providing a cheap reliable and carbon free source of electricity online that is generating net profits that are being returned to eversource and ui customers said katie dykes the state environmental commissioner this is why we employ strategic electricity procurement practices and why the governor has kept our energy efficiency programs funded it s also why the state is working hard to diversify its energy mix and has pursued past and ongoing procurements for clean energy resources such as solar and offshore wind that will reduce our reliance on fossil fuel resources over time tong has been following the developments closely and speaking with utility executives the challenge for us in the office of the attorney general is this is unconscionable right now to double the price from 12 cents per kilowatt hour to 24 cents per kilowatt hour tong said in an interview people are getting punished we expected some change from summer to winter in the cost of natural gas and the cost of the commodity but we didn t expect a doubling we re essentially at the mercy of the global energy market this underscores how important it is to move away from natural gas and to other sources i just toured millstone by the way not that long ago tong has agreed to settlements with eversource and ui in the past on the distribution portion of the bill that s where we can really lean on them and that s where we ll fight the utilities at pura on the distribution side tong said but on the fuel side it s ugly specifically i have asked them to contribute a percentage of shareholder earnings commensurate with the percentage increase their customers will pay this winter to keep their lights and heat on to date they have refused tong said we need to take a hard look at who is profiting and who is harmed as we search for long term reform senate president pro tempore martin looney of new haven and senate majority leader bob duff of norwalk jointly condemned the hikes eversource has doubled its stock price in the past 10 years and avangrid posts billions of dollars in profit each and every year they said it never ceases to amaze us how quarterly shareholder dividends and multimillion dollar ceo payoffs are always paid on the backs of consumers no matter what the circumstances no matter what the profits no matter what the payouts eversource and avangrid have failed their customers and we will explore every available avenue to oppose these rate hikes we cannot expect these profit driven out of state companies to do what s right for connecticut residents ways to get help based on income various assistance is available from the connecticut energy assistance program online applications can be found at ct gov heatinghelp apply assistance is also available at operation fuel assistance by calling 860 243 2345 or operationfuel org gethelp eversource is hosting a webinar at noon dec 8 that covers options for help registration is required by calling 800 286 2828 or at eversource com billhelp looking ahead legislators realize that consumers are highly concerned about their rates with less than one month before the price hikes take effect the average ratepayer needleman said cannot tolerate a doubling of rates and it has us all scrambling to figure out what we can do as legislators as the policymakers we have an obligation to look at that volatility and decide what the right approach is house republican leader vincent candelora of north branford said the state needs to take a more comprehensive view and develop more generation sources in order to solve its electricity problems pura he said needs to be removed from the department of energy and environmental protection and become a completely independent agency once again previously known as the department of public utility control the dpuc was independent until it was folded into deep in 2011 by then gov dannel p malloy critics say that relationship represents a conflict of interest the solutions he said can only come through creative ideas on a larger scale it s about the state of connecticut not supporting policies like fracking like piping liquefied natural gas and like hydropower candelora said new england has put itself on an island by not looking at those alternative energy sources to supply our generation plants we should be looking at more nuclear but you mention that word and the environmentalists go crazy i think it s a much broader problem than deregulation connecticut has to get serious about diversifying and stop focusing just on solar and wind candelora who will be the third longest serving house republican when the new session starts concedes the solutions are not simple no one reads these energy bills he said and it s one of the more complicated issues in connecticut while the major issues remain unresolved many customers will be paying higher rates on jan 1 short term the public is going to be left in the dark candelora said there are no good short term solutions christopher keating

some of the world s wealthiest investors have been buying stocks in the face of heightened economic uncertainty the stock market hasn t been easy to navigate this year there haven t been many places to hide particularly for technology investors with the nasdaq 100 index shedding 27 of its value year to date so what should an investor do at a time like this first it s critical to maintain a long term focus history is proof that the broader market always recovers to new highs given enough time but investors can also watch what the professionals are buying particularly those who have achieved billionaire status that s why three motley fool contributors think apple aapl 1 92 datadog ddog 0 90 and okta okta 0 83 need to be on everybody s watch lists ahead of the new year betting big on america s largest company anthony di pizio apple he s widely considered as one of the greatest investors ever so it seems fitting that warren buffett through his investment company berkshire hathaway would own shares in apple america s largest company but to take things a step further apple has become berkshire s biggest holding and it has regularly increased its position throughout the year berkshire was most recently a buyer of apple in the second quarter of 2022 and it now holds 915 million shares a stake worth over 135 billion in the recent third quarter berkshire also made a first time bet on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing stock curiously apple is that company s largest customer it uses taiwan semi to manufacture the chips that power its portfolio of devices so the move could be interpreted as an indirect bet on apple s success but what is it about apple that buffett finds so attractive the company sells products that consumers love it s highly profitable and it has returned a significant amount of money to shareholders which flows directly into berkshire s coffers in fact apple returned over 104 billion to shareholders during fiscal 2022 ended sept 24 alone through dividends and stock buybacks the company s fiscal 2022 results were a little sluggish in aggregate thanks to the slowing economy with revenue growing by just 7 8 year over year but there was some robust growth beneath the surface during the fourth quarter specifically with mac sales jumping by 25 wearables by 9 8 and iphone by 9 6 all of those segments caught a boost from apple s september product launch which revealed the next generation airpods the apple watch ultra and the iphone 14 apple s services segment which includes apple music apple news and apple pay will remain in focus during 2023 as it s the fastest growing and most profitable part of apple s business but for now the consumer electronics giant is finding a way to tread water in one of the most difficult economies in recent memory and that sets up a great opportunity if the broader environment improves in the new year the company that keeps on growing jamie louko datadog datadog has caught the eye of one of the most famous investors in the world stanley druckenmiller druckenmiller bought almost 790 000 shares during the second and third quarters totaling 82 million invested in this application and performance monitoring platform he s so confident in datadog that it is now his ninth largest holding it s not surprising that datadog has caught his eye because the company has been posting stellar results this year while many software companies have seen demand plummet customers continue to buy datadog s tools in q3 revenue soared 61 year over year to 437 million datadog s cash flow has also continued to shoot higher trailing 12 month free cash flow reached 364 million which is 45 higher than the year ago period datadog s stable results during this uncertain time should be no surprise the company s application performance monitoring tools are vital to customers imagine running a business without understanding user behavior reducing application downtime and monitoring infrastructure performance that would be pretty hard right datadog provides these tools to 22 200 customers and considering these abilities are always needed no matter the economic environment datadog has continued to see stable adoption according to gartner s magic quadrant datadog is the leader in this space this is likely due to its large and growing product suite the company has over 35 tools with more likely to come this makes datadog the one stop shop for all application monitoring performance and security needs given how much free cash flow the company is generating it will be able to continue investing heavily in product innovation to maintain its top dog status druckenmiller doesn t seem too concerned with the company s high valuation of 64 times free cash flow given how high quality the business is he is willing to load up on shares now and you might want to consider doing the same the leader in identity and access management trevor jennewine okta billionaire hedge fund manager israel englander tripled his stake in okta in the third quarter and he has increased his position fivefold since the beginning of 2022 that buying spree is especially noteworthy because okta s share price has plunged 70 this year evidencing englander s confidence in the company okta specializes in a branch of cybersecurity known as identity and access management iam its platform leans on artificial intelligence to authenticate users based on context like device location and behavior it then authorizes users based on the permissions granted to them by administrators ensuring that only the right people can access sensitive applications and data in november it research company gartner named okta a leader in access management citing more robust product capabilities and a greater ability to execute than any other vendor including tech titan microsoft that recognition highlights the power of neutrality whereas microsoft has a clear incentive to steer customers toward its own cloud infrastructure okta engineered its software to be compatible across private data centers public clouds and hybrid environments additionally okta addresses workforce and customer identity use cases its platform integrates with more than 7 000 applications and it infrastructure providers allowing businesses to secure products from vendors like salesforce or even microsoft but okta also provides developer tools that allow businesses to embed identity into custom software collectively its neutrality and broad utility have propelled okta to the forefront of the iam market the company recently reported solid third quarter results its customer count increased 22 to 17 050 and the average customer spent 22 more over the past year in turn revenue climbed 37 to 481 million and okta reported non gaap adjusted earnings of 0 00 per diluted share a slight improvement from a non gaap loss of 0 07 per diluted share in the prior year investors have good reason to be optimistic iam is a crucial component of zero trust security and digital transformation has made effective cybersecurity an imperative for virtually every business okta estimates its addressable market at 80 billion leaving a long runway for growth and with shares trading at 6 1 times sales a bargain compared to the three year average of 27 2 times sales now is a good time to buy a few shares of this growth

ship such goods in one or two days a service that had not been widely available in that region before mercado envios taking on such challenges continues to result in rapid growth mercadolibre generated 7 5 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2022 that is an increase of 53 compared with the same period in 2021 also net income for the time frame came in at 317 million rising 146 slower growth in the cost of revenue and modest growth in income tax expenses led to a significant increase in its profits also while mercadolibre stock has fallen 25 over the last year its price to sales ratio has dropped to less than 5 a range last seen in 2009 over time that valuation and its profit growth should boost mercadolibre s antifragility as well as its stock price paypal isn t getting the respect it deserves justin pope paypal holdings the financial sector is a multitrillion dollar industry which gives a sprawling fintech conglomerate like paypal holdings a lot of room to operate the company has fingerprints all over the sector it offers digital banking peer to peer payments money transfers and more paypal has 432 million active accounts today processing 1 25 trillion in total payment volume last year in this bear market wall street has shunned the stock the shares have fallen 74 from their high due to worries over competition from companies like block and its competing payment platform cashapp losing its place as ebay s primary payment processor and single digit account growth but as you can see below paypal is still putting up huge financial results including getting 5 6 billion in free cash flow from its 27 billion in annual revenue a robust 20 conversion rate sure paypal might not be the fastest growing fintech stock today but the outlook is anything but grim analyst estimates call for earnings per share eps growth averaging 15 over the next three to five years that s faster than what the s p 500 historically averages yet paypal s stock trades at a lower valuation its forward price to earnings p e ratio of 19 is less than the s p 500 s multiple of 21 that doesn t seem to make much sense given paypal s significant profitability and growth outlook but the market doesn t always make sense in the short term and things can get weird in a turbulent market as we ve seen throughout this year that could make paypal a wise choice for investors looking for year end opportunities microsoft is a coiled spring ready to pop back in 2023 jake lerch microsoft when i think of no brainer stocks for 2023 microsoft stands out the software giant has shed a whopping 24 of its value so far this year that amounts to a staggering 600 billion loss of market capitalization and yet when you examine microsoft s fundamentals the stock s price action looks like an overreaction the company has met or beat earnings estimates in three of its last four quarters revenue over the last 12 months stands at 203 billion with earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda at a staggering 99 billion both figures are all time records sure revenue growth has cooled from its pandemic induced high of over 20 to around 11 but that should be seen as what it is a reversion to the long term average not a collapse what s more analysts see blue skies on the horizon wall street expects microsoft s sales to increase to 212 billion in 2023 and 240 billion in 2024 earnings are expected to increase to 9 55 a share in 2023 and 11 18 in 2024 applying a price to earnings multiple of 29 the company s 10 year average p e to microsoft s expected 2023 earnings would result in a 277 stock price however the shares are trading for around 250 as of this writing that looks like a bargain to me and that s why microsoft is my pick as 2023 s no brainer stock to buy now
reliability stemming from resiliency is the key when your investments absolutely have to generate income if your growth investing days are over or nearly so and you re more interested in steady income start your search with all weather stock names that are capable of healthy dividends regardless of the economy you ll likely need such reliability when your work income stops here are three such prospects that would make great dividend stocks for retirement 1 duke energy consumers and corporations might curb spending when money gets tight but they try to keep the lights on no matter what that s what makes utility stocks so reliable in terms of dividends and relatively generic in terms of stock performance while this means most utilities stocks are so similar that they re almost interchangeable there is one standout within the category duke energy duk 1 34 currently has one of the sector s best dividend yields at 4 and it is preparing for the future more effectively than most the company which has 8 2 million customers in the southeastern u s is reshaping itself for greater fiscal efficiency as an example last month duke energy announced an agreement to purchase mississippi s wildflower solar project which upon completion is expected to generate as much as 100 megawatts of electricity it already has a commitment from a nearby automobile manufacturer to purchase much of that power and to comply with growing numbers of state based carbon emission reduction plans the company is increasingly working directly with customers to help them better manage their consumption in indiana for instance duke offers rebates on commercial electric vehicle ev chargers and provides credits to consumers who charge their evs at off peak times other utilities have similar projects but few seem as forward thinking as duke so its long standing dividend 96 years worth of uninterrupted quarterly payouts remains protected into whatever future awaits 2 blackrock blackrock blk 1 75 manages several traditional mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs under the blackrock banner and it is the same company behind the popular ishares lineup of etfs its ishares core s p 500 etf for example holds roughly 300 billion worth of equities on behalf of investors blackrock s revenue and earnings aren t linked to the performance of its funds and etfs rather they re largely tied to the amount of money its investors allow it to continue managing even in rocky market environments the company still collects management fees even when stocks are tanking despite this year s marketwide weakness blackrock took in more new investor money than it paid back in each of the first three quarters of the year it s a testament to how well the company manages investor expectations and promotes itself even in turbulent times that doesn t mean blackrock s top and bottom lines are growing while investors are still willing to invest in the company s funds the broad market weakness means the value of blackrock s revenue bearing asset base is shrinking last quarter s revenue was lower by 15 year over year and per share profits were down 16 this ebb and flow isn t dramatic enough to prompt a dividend cut though indeed blackrock s dividend has grown every year since 2010 because its long term revenue and earnings growth is so resilient the current yield stands at 2 7 3 realty income lastly add realty income o 1 65 to your list of dividend stocks well suited for a retirement portfolio with its 4 8 yield realty income is a real estate investment trust reit meaning it gets favorable tax treatment for passing along the majority of its rental income to shareholders the company specializes in commercial space with a penchant for finding reliable tenants its three biggest renters are dollar general walgreens and 7 eleven not too much further down its tenant list you ll find fedex walmart and kroger businesses built to last even when the economy s wobbling that shows up in one of the company s key metrics at the end of the third quarter 98 9 of its space was leased and even in the throes of the pandemic the reit s portfolio monetization and rent collection held up pretty well this isn t what a current or future retiree should be stoked about though the more compelling attribute of realty income is the fact that it pays dividends monthly rather than quarterly which it s done for 628 consecutive months over 52 years and it has more than 25 consecutive years of annual dividend growth qualifying the reit as a dividend aristocrat the kicker while inflation is finally starting to cool and the federal reserve is seemingly entertaining less aggressive rate hikes interest rates are still positioned to edge higher which tends to favor the performance of realty income shares
rapid growth is not dead despite the bear market the recent bear market dampened a lot of the interest in hypergrowth stocks as a result many of the top growth names lost more than three fourths of their value over the past year or so as traders shifted their focus more toward loss avoidance despite the stock price drops some names continue to post phenomenal growth numbers particularly stocks in the cloud sector these hypergrowth stocks have suffered in the bear market but the drops will allow long term investors to buy companies such as mercadolibre meli 1 27 and snowflake snow 1 10 at a discount let s take a look at why these two stocks are buys in 2022 and beyond 1 mercadolibre mercadolibre is an easy hypergrowth stock for u s investors to overlook for one it operates exclusively in latin america meaning the average american investor would likely not interact with the company moreover news from latin america may involve high inflation in argentina or election turmoil in brazil which might lead investors to assume the region is not a robust e commerce environment still mercadolibre managed to drive hypergrowth by addressing latin america s challenges amid market obstacles the company s 7 5 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2022 rose 53 versus the same period in 2021 and investors need to learn about the real reason behind mercadolibre s wild success the hypergrowth comes from its fintech segment mercado pago the company created mercado pago so its cash dependent customers could buy online however that has evolved into a business meeting the fintech needs of customers and businesses outside mercadolibre total payment volume surged 76 year over year in q3 a testament to the company s success in the fintech space this does not mean mercadolibre escaped the bear market the stock lost more than half of its value since early 2021 but in recent months it sold at around a price to sales p s ratio of 5 the last time it was that cheap was during the financial crisis since the stock has proven its ability to grow rapidly under challenging economic and political conditions one might consider adding shares while mercadolibre is still inexpensive 2 snowflake snowflake provides data cloud services helping businesses store manage and secure data in a central location this allows enterprises to keep data safe without compromising data integrity or worrying about multiple versions of siloed data that may or may not be up to date instead the concerns about snowflake pertain to its competitors it competes with amazon s aws the microsoft platform azure and alphabet s google cloud companies that all boast market caps above 900 billion in comparison snowflake s market cap stands at 47 billion however snowflake holds one advantage above its competitors data clouds it can manage data regardless of the infrastructure platform it uses that was likely one factor that attracted a pre ipo investment from warren buffett s berkshire hathaway another is the growth itself in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 which ended oct 31 the company generated almost 1 5 billion in revenue this was an increase of 77 versus the year ago quarter since cloud services tend to save enterprises money a sluggish economy has not significantly slowed adoption nonetheless the stock is down by more than 60 from its november 2021 high likely on valuation concerns and even after that decline snowflake trades at an astounding 29 p s ratio while that is a high sales multiple in a brutal bear market it is also near record lows in the growth tech stock s two year trading history given the stock s massive revenue growth and straightforward value proposition this may be as close to cheap as snowflake gets for the foreseeable future
some of the world s wealthiest investors have been buying stocks in the face of heightened economic uncertainty the stock market hasn t been easy to navigate this year there haven t been many places to hide particularly for technology investors with the nasdaq 100 index shedding 27 of its value year to date so what should an investor do at a time like this first it s critical to maintain a long term focus history is proof that the broader market always recovers to new highs given enough time but investors can also watch what the professionals are buying particularly those who have achieved billionaire status that s why three motley fool contributors think apple aapl 1 92 datadog ddog 0 90 and okta okta 0 83 need to be on everybody s watch lists ahead of the new year betting big on america s largest company anthony di pizio apple he s widely considered as one of the greatest investors ever so it seems fitting that warren buffett through his investment company berkshire hathaway would own shares in apple america s largest company but to take things a step further apple has become berkshire s biggest holding and it has regularly increased its position throughout the year berkshire was most recently a buyer of apple in the second quarter of 2022 and it now holds 915 million shares a stake worth over 135 billion in the recent third quarter berkshire also made a first time bet on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing stock curiously apple is that company s largest customer it uses taiwan semi to manufacture the chips that power its portfolio of devices so the move could be interpreted as an indirect bet on apple s success but what is it about apple that buffett finds so attractive the company sells products that consumers love it s highly profitable and it has returned a significant amount of money to shareholders which flows directly into berkshire s coffers in fact apple returned over 104 billion to shareholders during fiscal 2022 ended sept 24 alone through dividends and stock buybacks the company s fiscal 2022 results were a little sluggish in aggregate thanks to the slowing economy with revenue growing by just 7 8 year over year but there was some robust growth beneath the surface during the fourth quarter specifically with mac sales jumping by 25 wearables by 9 8 and iphone by 9 6 all of those segments caught a boost from apple s september product launch which revealed the next generation airpods the apple watch ultra and the iphone 14 apple s services segment which includes apple music apple news and apple pay will remain in focus during 2023 as it s the fastest growing and most profitable part of apple s business but for now the consumer electronics giant is finding a way to tread water in one of the most difficult economies in recent memory and that sets up a great opportunity if the broader environment improves in the new year the company that keeps on growing jamie louko datadog datadog has caught the eye of one of the most famous investors in the world stanley druckenmiller druckenmiller bought almost 790 000 shares during the second and third quarters totaling 82 million invested in this application and performance monitoring platform he s so confident in datadog that it is now his ninth largest holding it s not surprising that datadog has caught his eye because the company has been posting stellar results this year while many software companies have seen demand plummet customers continue to buy datadog s tools in q3 revenue soared 61 year over year to 437 million datadog s cash flow has also continued to shoot higher trailing 12 month free cash flow reached 364 million which is 45 higher than the year ago period datadog s stable results during this uncertain time should be no surprise the company s application performance monitoring tools are vital to customers imagine running a business without understanding user behavior reducing application downtime and monitoring infrastructure performance that would be pretty hard right datadog provides these tools to 22 200 customers and considering these abilities are always needed no matter the economic environment datadog has continued to see stable adoption according to gartner s magic quadrant datadog is the leader in this space this is likely due to its large and growing product suite the company has over 35 tools with more likely to come this makes datadog the one stop shop for all application monitoring performance and security needs given how much free cash flow the company is generating it will be able to continue investing heavily in product innovation to maintain its top dog status druckenmiller doesn t seem too concerned with the company s high valuation of 64 times free cash flow given how high quality the business is he is willing to load up on shares now and you might want to consider doing the same the leader in identity and access management trevor jennewine okta billionaire hedge fund manager israel englander tripled his stake in okta in the third quarter and he has increased his position fivefold since the beginning of 2022 that buying spree is especially noteworthy because okta s share price has plunged 70 this year evidencing englander s confidence in the company okta specializes in a branch of cybersecurity known as identity and access management iam its platform leans on artificial intelligence to authenticate users based on context like device location and behavior it then authorizes users based on the permissions granted to them by administrators ensuring that only the right people can access sensitive applications and data in november it research company gartner named okta a leader in access management citing more robust product capabilities and a greater ability to execute than any other vendor including tech titan microsoft that recognition highlights the power of neutrality whereas microsoft has a clear incentive to steer customers toward its own cloud infrastructure okta engineered its software to be compatible across private data centers public clouds and hybrid environments additionally okta addresses workforce and customer identity use cases its platform integrates with more than 7 000 applications and it infrastructure providers allowing businesses to secure products from vendors like salesforce or even microsoft but okta also provides developer tools that allow businesses to embed identity into custom software collectively its neutrality and broad utility have propelled okta to the forefront of the iam market the company recently reported solid third quarter results its customer count increased 22 to 17 050 and the average customer spent 22 more over the past year in turn revenue climbed 37 to 481 million and okta reported non gaap adjusted earnings of 0 00 per diluted share a slight improvement from a non gaap loss of 0 07 per diluted share in the prior year investors have good reason to be optimistic iam is a crucial component of zero trust security and digital transformation has made effective cybersecurity an imperative for virtually every business okta estimates its addressable market at 80 billion leaving a long runway for growth and with shares trading at 6 1 times sales a bargain compared to the three year average of 27 2 times sales now is a good time to buy a few shares of this growth stock
these companies are operating at the intersection of secular and cyclical trends given enough time most quality stocks will eventually double triple quadruple and even quintuple their value that s just how capitalism works no stock will necessarily reach these milestones at the same time as any other equity though some will move faster than others with that backdrop here s a closer look at three tickers with great shots at turning a 1 000 investment today into 5 000 as soon as 2030 notice that each company brings something special to the table at an ideal time monster beverage the world needs a serious pick me up if the recent sales growth achieved by energy drink outfit monster beverage mnst 1 07 is any indication the company s top line is up nearly 16 through the first three quarters of this year extending a span of comparable revenue growth underway for over a decade now analysts don t see any real slowdown on the horizon either modeling 11 sales growth next year that s apt to be topped when all is said and done yes monster beverage is the outfit behind energy drinks of the same brand name but it s not just monster the company also manages nos full throttle predator and a handful of other energy drink brands monster is its flagship though making up the lion s share of its annual top line of around 6 billion it s not a lot but that s the point there s room for the entire category to continue growing and it is mordor intelligence estimates the energy drinks business is on pace to grow by more than 8 per year through 2027 jibing with other growth outlooks for the industry monster has something of a secret weapon however helping it win more than its fair share of this growth that s coca cola coke has been a monster stakeholder and partner since 2015 the relationship is still being increasingly leveraged for growth though and yet there s so much more that could be done going forward take cannabis for instance while coca cola doesn t offer cannabis based drinks right now it is entering new and once unlikely markets for example early this year coca cola entered the alcoholic beverage fray by inking a developmental deal with constellation brands the same constellation reportedly mulling an acquisition bid for monster it s noteworthy simply because constellation also owns a sizable stake in cannabis company canopy growth corp and coca cola has at least entertained the possibility of entering the cannabis arena in the recent past it s unclear how or if any of these possible combinations and partnerships will shake out what is clear is that monster beverage is well positioned for whatever the future holds on this front amazon perhaps the biggest reason amazon amzn 0 16 shares could quintuple their current value by 2030 is that shares are down a whopping 46 from last year s peak simply recovering that loss would mean nearly a 100 gain on its present price nevertheless this company s backstory has far more potential than a mere recovery of the stock s recent setback this backstory is no longer about e commerce however while selling stuff online remains its biggest business as measured by revenue it s not even close to being its biggest moneymaker that honor belongs to its cloud computing arm amazon web services aws even prior to this year when soaring expenses dragged its e commerce operation into the red its cloud computing division was driving roughly two thirds of its operating income the company s cloud computing profitability profile hasn t really changed much since then it s just grown aws revenue through the first three quarters of this year is up 32 pulling its operating income up 33 with it in light of technavio s expectation for annualized growth of 19 for the cloud computing market through 2026 amazon doesn t necessarily even need its e commerce business s paper thin profit margins to be restored to their pre pandemic levels to continue growing its bottom line at a double digit pace the kicker whether or not e commerce itself is ever profitable again for amazon may be irrelevant its advertising business fueled by the shopping site s traffic is a fast growing profit center in and of itself the company did a hefty 9 5 billion ad sales last quarter alone up 25 year over year and it s still largely learning the advertising business autozone finally add autozone azo 0 23 to your list of stocks that could turn 1 000 today into 5 000 by 2030 surprised as unbelievable as it seems the auto parts and car care business isn t just consistent but also high growth autozone s revenue growth of 11 for the fiscal year ending in august is both impressive and in line with the industry s long term norms the stock s performance is equally impressive autozone shares are up 50 for the past five years despite their steep and likely temporary sell off since the end of last year and are more than twice their value 10 years ago those are solid numbers but hardly a quintupling there s good reason to believe the next eight years could prove remarkably more fruitful for autozone than the past eight have been however that s the sheer cost of a new car there was a time when consumers recognized that it made more sense to purchase a new automobile than continue spending more and more money just to keep an aging vehicle running with kelley blue book reporting that the average price for a new car sold in the united states rose to a near record 48 281 in october though the math of the matter changes it s once again making increasingly more sense to invest in the automobile you already own even more so when the economy is wobbling as it is now underscoring this argument is s p global s estimate that the average vehicle being driven on u s roads is a record breaking 12 2 years old while it s a testament to their quality and durability it also suggests they re highly fixable it all plays right into the hand autozone is holding of course particularly in light of the likelihood that car prices won t be meaningfully dropping anytime soon
the market is down on these stocks despite the fact that they continue to grow through a challenging environment as we head into year end it s clear that 2022 will not go down in the books as a banner year for growth stocks for example the growth oriented nasdaq composite and vanguard growth etf are both down 27 year to date the silver lining is that after years of strong performance 2022 s sell off hit the pause button and gives investors a chance to get on board some of these top growth stocks at lower prices before they return to their winning ways as we turn the page on 2022 here are three beaten down growth stocks that look poised for better returns in the years to come 1 floor decor holdings down 40 in 2022 floor decor holdings fnd 1 97 certainly fits the beaten down moniker yet it s also a monster growth stock floor decor is a retailer that specializes in hard flooring products like tile wood and natural stone and the stock is down at a time when the market has sold off anything housing related investors are understandably fearful about rising mortgage rates cooling down the housing market and inflation hurting consumer demand this makes sense but look beyond the narrative and you ll see that floor decor is growing right through the heart of this challenging period during the second quarter floor decor grew revenue 26 7 year over year right at the time when concerns about rising mortgage rates and inflation were reaching a crescendo floor decor followed up on this with year over year revenue growth of 25 2 during the third quarter the company has a long track record of growth and is closing in on 14 straight years of comparable store sales growth floor decor is not growing at the expense of profitability the company grew adjusted earnings per share at a 37 1 compound annual growth rate cagr between 2017 and 2021 the best may be yet to come as floor decor continues to expand its store count the company has grown from 83 locations in 2017 to 191 in 2022 over the long term management sees room for 500 stores in the united states seeing that floor decor has grown profitably and continued to increase same store sales while growing from 83 to 191 locations so far i believe that it can continue to grow profitably as the company grows toward 500 locations at which point the stock could be worth considerably more than it is today 2 silvergate capital like floor decor silvergate capital si 2 56 is a stock that continues to post strong growth despite the market turmoil surrounding it but shares of the california chartered bank are down 83 year to date silvergate is a regulated fdic insured bank that makes loans and provides other services to the crypto industry exchanges like coinbase rely on its silvergate exchange network to settle trades efficiently and to enable the transfer of u s dollars to and from customers so silvergate is like a pick and shovel play on the crypto space as a whole silvergate has grown revenue at a 31 3 three year cagr between 2018 and 2021 top cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are down significantly from their highs and prominent crypto exchanges like ftx have filed for bankruptcy so it is unsurprising that silvergate has sold off however silvergate has managed to grow earnings per share each quarter so far in 2022 from 0 47 during the first quarter to 0 85 for the second quarter and 1 28 for the third quarter these strong results are all the more impressive against the backdrop of the crypto market s struggles silvergate is profitable and it trades at just 6 5 times earnings indicating that much of the bad news from the crypto meltdown is already priced into the stock with growing profits a reasonable valuation and an important role in the industry silvergate looks like an interesting beaten down growth stock for risk tolerant investors who believe in the long term potential of cryptocurrency 3 dutch bros if you re seeking one more beaten down growth stock look no further than dutch bros bros 0 34 shares of the fast growing drive thru coffee chain are down 43 from their 52 week high as the market worries that inflation and rising gas prices will take a bite out of discretionary income for consumers despite these challenges the company is growing revenue 53 year over year dutch bros has managed to increase prices 10 3 over a year ago without suffering from a decline in revenue so the company s products are clearly in demand dutch bros is achieving this scorching revenue growth primarily by opening new locations at a rapid rate the company has grown its store count by a remarkable 27 year over year and now has 641 locations it opened almost as many shops in the third quarter alone as it did in all of 2019 so growth is accelerating this is impressive growth but this could just be the tip of the iceberg the company has its sights set on opening 4 000 stores in north america if dutch bros can continue to grow toward this target increase profitability as it scales and increase same store sales by upselling customers on customized drinks and leveraging its loyalty program this beaten down growth stock should evolve into a long term winner this has been a challenging year for growth investors but 2023 is just around the corner and these stocks have shown that they can deliver growth in the midst of a challenging environment long term investors stand to be rewarded for buying these beaten down stocks before the market comes back around to them
these growth stocks took a hit in 2022 but each has the potential to make a huge comeback in the years ahead the ups and downs of real estate stocks tend to have a close relation to the ups and downs of interest rates real estate prices and demand grew by double digit percentages in 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic led to lowered rates in turn real estate stocks with direct exposure to this fast growing industry soared but the federal reserve raising the prime lending rate in early 2022 to help combat outsized inflation immediately put pressure on real estate stocks as well as most of the stock market traders react swiftly to bad news and sometimes they overreact three stocks that have taken an especially tough beating are innovative industrial properties iipr 2 31 construction partners road 2 25 and gladstone land land 1 66 all three stocks are trading down 23 or more over the past year short term traders punished these real estate stocks making for a potentially great opportunity to buy for long term investors here s a closer look at each company and why three motley fool contributors believe they are fantastic buys for growth in the coming years this beaten down cannabis stock still has a lot of growth left in it liz brumer smith innovative industrial properties innovative is a cannabis focused reit that uses a special sale leaseback structure to acquire industrial properties then lease them back to licensed medical marijuana operators through long term net leases these operators have trouble obtaining capital through traditional means because of concerns about the unclear federal legality of the cannabis they produce the cannabis industry s difficulty in obtaining traditional financing helped send innovative s business soaring the reit consistently achieves strong year over year growth this in turn helped grow its share price by 1 300 from 2016 to late 2021 but 2022 was exceptionally challenging for the stock on top of general market volatility innovative faced its first major default by one of its top 10 tenants and a class action lawsuit alleging a lack of transparency in innovative s business model and performance these absolutely crushed its share price pushing it down 55 this year cannabis regulations continue to restrict operators access to capital so a company like innovative still has a lot of room to grow as it meets the market demand for capital and financing this was abundantly clear in its last earnings revenue was up 32 year over year stronger than expected third quarter earnings helped the stock rebound slightly but it s still trading near its lowest levels in three years today s beaten up price however is to investors advantage the stock s dividend yield at 5 6 is nearly quadruple that of the s p 500 plus the reit currently trades for around 22 times its funds from operations ffo a metric similar to the price to earnings ratio that provides a more useful metric of a reit s performance shares last year were trading at multiples 30 to 35 times ffo making today s pricing a steal of a deal take the road to gains mike price construction partners the ups and downs of the real estate industry are very closely tied to the economy as a whole and to interest rates it s why many saw record revenue and earnings in 2020 and 2021 and also why several saw a 50 drop in business once interest rates started going up in 2022 if unemployment goes up people don t have money to make mortgage payments if interest rates go up mortgage payments get too high because the industry is somewhat predictable this way it s pretty clear why the majority of reit stocks and other real estate stocks got crushed in 2022 traders anticipated a slowdown and sold off their holdings construction partners was one of the reits that took a hit saw its stock tumble from an all time high of 45 in november 2021 38 to a recent low of 18 89 per share when interest rates were hiked a 58 drop the stock has partially recovered since but it is still down 36 from its high what s unusual here is that construction partners business is mostly immune to the normal macroeconomic forces that affect the industry construction partners is an infrastructure company it focuses on short and medium term road projects this type of construction will almost always be necessary no matter what s going on with the economy in general construction partners is also partially immune to the supply chain problems that are affecting the industry because it s vertically integrated the company mines for its own materials operates the plants to turn them into asphalt owns the asphalt terminal and then manages the projects using subcontractors to do more specialized work when necessary the company grows mostly through acquisition it made 35 acquisitions over several years to roll up a fragmented industry in the six states where it operates this has led to rapid growth in revenue from 680 million in 2018 to 1 3 billion in 2022 the company is likely to keep expanding whether or not the broader real estate industry is doing well this reit offers a taste of farmland profits to stockholders kristi waterworth gladstone land if you re looking for a stock that can take a licking and keep on ticking gladstone land is definitely one to bet on for the long term the stock is currently down nearly 50 from its high in april largely over concerns about how rising interest rates might affect its tenants operations as well as the long term debt the reit carries but little about the business model for gladstone land has changed despite the dip in the share price if anything the company has accelerated its plans to expand its operations even further gladstone land is a farmland reit that owns and leases farmland to different kinds of producers as of the end of q3 2022 it owned 169 farms totaling 115 288 acres across the country with the largest holdings in california florida and michigan the farms the company leases produce over 60 types of crops including short term crops like annual berries and vegetables and longer term crops like almonds blueberries grapes and pistachios this kind of diversification helps to spread the risk should a particular crop not perform well in a specific year the focus on longer term crops also helps to ensure that tenants will renew their leases since things like almond trees can t simply be dug up and moved elsewhere so a farmer can start a new farm on another piece of land the reit reports a 100 occupancy rate on its properties the strength of this simple business model can t be overstated and despite current market conditions continues to show its strength for q3 operating revenue increased from 19 59 million in 2021 to 24 21 million in

there s an old saying that a watched pot never boils and that description seems to apply to recession risks right now americans have been awaiting and fearing an economic downturn all year and yet a prolonged slump still hasn t arrived it now seems highly unlikely that a recession will materialize before 2023 and maybe not even then part of the problem a lot of us are watching the wrong pots heat up each time a negative economic report comes out it fans the flames of recessionary worry but a lot of those indicators and releases don t factor directly into the recession expansion calculations the national bureau of economic research a nongovernmental group composed largely of university economists is the organization that determines when recessions arrive and how long they endure here s what they focus on and what they largely ignore what s out the backdrop for all of the economic angst of late has been the spike in inflation this year and federal reserve efforts to quash it by raising interest rates aggressively inflation has been trending slightly lower since midsummer but the fight isn t over with at least a couple more rate hikes probable for at least a few more months but inflation and interest rates aren t factors that the nber economists focus on at least directly interest rates are tracked in other economic gauges such as the index of leading economic indicators and they certainly matter read more by russ wiles make these tax moves before the end of the year to save you money one rule of thumb gauge known as the inverted yield curve is flashing recessionary warning signals right now normally long term interest rates are higher than short term rates and when this relationship reverses it s seen as a cause for alarm for various reasons recently six month treasury bills yielded about 4 7 compared with 3 8 for 30 year treasury bonds an abnormally wide and potentially alarming pattern the inverted yield curve has a good historic track record of coinciding with recessions and some economists are predicting a recession based on this measure but it s not a factor directly examined by the nber so too for asset prices from stocks and housing to cryptocurrency all of which have weakened this year but they re not directly tracked by the nber on its recession watch either the stock market in particular often tumbles on recession fears but these downturns aren t always followed by economic slumps what s in the nber says its economists focus on six measures that can be simplified as follows personal income less transfers personal consumption spending retail wholesale sales and industrial production plus two measures of national employment unemployment there is no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions the bureau explained on its website however in recent decades the two measures we have put the most weight on are real personal income less transfers and nonfarm payroll employment it said the bureau often makes recession determinations many months after a downturn started and it is cautious in its calls the nber economists are looking for signs of a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months that isn t the case currently over the past six months through september five of the six measures have shown gains with wholesale retail sales the exception reports j p morgan asset management which tracks the indicators monthly none of the six has shown much change up or down over that stretch the economy is like a giant oil tanker that usually takes a lot of time to change course and it s still moving forward notably the nber points out that expansions are the normal state of the economy and that most recessions are brief where we stand now all of this doesn t mean boom times are at hand millions of americans are feeling economic pain income inequality has been widening for example and there are fresh signs that many people are running up credit card balances and having trouble paying off debts and the fed continues to tighten the screws yet jobs remain plentiful which is perhaps the key litmus test of recessions economic downturns usually coincide with periods of mass layoffs that swell the ranks of the unemployed think back to peak recessionary jobless rates of 10 in 2009 or 14 7 in 2020 for example layoffs have started to rise lately notably in parts of the technology sector but they re hardly widespread the u s jobless rate which stood at 3 7 in the latest reading as of october is actually slightly below where it started the year despite fed efforts to push it higher nor have consumers turned off the cash spigots the holiday shopping season is off to a robust start with the national retail federation estimating a record 197 million americans made purchases online or in stores over the long thanksgiving weekend the group forecasts a 6 to 8 holiday spending increase this november and december compared with the same stretch in 2021 what got me thinking about all this was an announcement nov 28 by s p global that its economists are predicting a recession in 2023 with an economic decline drumroll please of 0 1 all of which begs the question of whether a drop of one tenth of 1 percentage point is really a downturn or just a rounding error or whether most americans would even notice a decline of such a small magnitude you can make your own call on that one or let the nber economists do it
the latin american e commerce giant s stock is far down from its peak but still trades above 900 per share over the past year several closely watched tech companies including amazon alphabet and tesla have split their stocks those splits didn t make the stocks fundamentally cheaper but they still generated a lot of buzz among retail investors some of whom weren t willing to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a single share however one tech giant that has never split its high priced stock is mercadolibre meli 1 27 the largest e commerce company in latin america mercadolibre went public at 18 in 2007 and soared to a peak closing price of 1 984 34 in january 2021 now though it trades in the 900s could a stock split attract new investors to the company mercadolibre s main challenges before we discuss a potential stock split we should review mercadolibre s strengths and weaknesses as a business like many other e commerce companies it experienced accelerating growth throughout the pandemic as many brick and mortar stores were temporarily shuttered however that growth spurt also set it up for tough year over year comparisons once social distancing efforts were relaxed and people transitioned back toward their pre pandemic shopping behaviors to make matters worse inflation has had a severe impact across its three largest markets brazil argentina and mexico and the strengthening u s dollar widened the gap between its constant currency and reported growth rates over the past year but despite all those challenges mercadolibre continued to grow faster than most of its e commerce peers in 2021 its revenue rose by 78 to 7 07 billion its operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 6 2 and it generated a net profit of 83 million compared to a net loss of 700 000 in 2020 its number of unique active users grew 5 to 139 5 million in the first nine months of 2022 revenue grew another 53 year over year to 7 54 billion its operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 9 1 and its net income surged by 146 to 317 million its number of unique active users rose by 6 year over year to 127 million for the full year analysts expect its revenue to grow 49 its operating margin to land at 7 8 and its net income to rise nearly fivefold management attributed that robust growth to the strength of its logistics network and digital payments ecosystem which gave the company an edge over foreign competitors like amazon alibaba s baba 1 43 aliexpress sea s shopee as well as its smaller regional rivals the fact that its operating margins are expanding also indicates that economies of scale are kicking in by comparison analysts expect amazon s revenue to grow by 9 this year and foresee it generating a net loss on the bottom line alibaba which is struggling with particularly tough macro and regulatory headwinds in china is expected to generate just 3 revenue growth and nearly flat adjusted earnings in 2022 could a stock split breathe fresh life into its shares mercadolibre trades at 70 times next year s forecast earnings and about 4 times next year s expected sales those are pricier valuations than amazon or alibaba command but its stronger growth rates arguably justify them splitting mercadolibre s stock won t make it any cheaper in a valuation sense if it undertook a 10 for 1 split for example its trading price would drop from around 940 to around 94 but the new shares would simply confer an ownership stake in the company that was one tenth as large as the pre split shares did that might make them more appealing to smaller investors who would be able to buy more shares or invest in mercadolibre without buying fractional shares the real difference though would be felt in the options market where a single options contract is tethered to 100 shares at its current price a single options contract for mercadolibre is linked to about 94 000 worth of shares so executing a 10 for 1 split would reduce that minimum threshold to 9 400 that would lower the barrier to entry for would be options traders which could generate more liquidity for mercadolibre s shares that heightened activity could also attract more active traders it doesn t matter if mercadolibre splits its stock or not as long term investors we shouldn t care if mercadolibre s stock looks cheaper or gets more actively traded instead we should remember that the underlying company is growing like a weed that it remains the clear leader in the underpenetrated latin american e commerce market and that its margins and profits are soaring as it finally reaps the benefits of its earlier investments mercadolibre s stock isn t a screaming bargain and a stock split won t change its underlying valuations however i own shares of mercadolibre and believe it still has plenty of upside potential even if it doesn t jump on the stock split bandwagon anytime soon

the market is underestimating this cloud identity leader after a brutal year for okta okta 0 83 investors finally got some good news on thursday dec 1 shares of the cloud identity specialist soared 26 as it easily beat estimates in its third quarter earnings report revenue rose 37 year over year to 481 million compared to estimates at 465 3 million and the company posted a breakeven adjusted loss compared to estimates of a per share loss of 0 24 its guidance for the fourth quarter was also much better than expected as the company called for adjusted per share profit of 0 09 to 0 10 compared with expectations of a loss of 0 11 per share the results and strong guidance showed the company taking control of its cost structure at a time when much of the software sector is struggling with macroeconomic headwinds okta controls its own destiny okta didn t deny that macroeconomic headwinds are affecting the business the company has said before that it started to see sales cycles lengthen cfo brett tighe said on the earnings call that there was some softening in demand from small and medium sized businesses in north america and that its pipeline was more weighted to upsells showing that new customers were more reluctant to sign on however the company has been proactive about controlling costs as it said it would in its second quarter earnings report in the third quarter management slowed its pace of hiring and rationalized its real estate footprint helping to drive the better than expected bottom line results in the third quarter headcount grew by 261 people to 6 037 its slowest pace in six quarters and on a year over year basis the number of employees was up 32 the company indicated that the growth rate would continue to slow in its preliminary guidance for fiscal 2024 which begins in february management stressed that it expected the macro environment to get worse before it gets better consequently it is forecasting revenue growth of just 16 to 17 to between 2 13 billion and 2 145 billion that was significantly worse than the analyst consensus at 2 31 billion or 26 7 revenue growth though okta has historically been conservative with its guidance the company s bottom line forecast for fiscal 2024 was much better than expected management said it sees an adjusted operating margin of 1 to 3 which means adjusted operating income of roughly 20 million to 60 million analysts expected a per share loss of 0 31 the business still has a lot of momentum okta is the leading independent cloud identity provider the company provides tools for businesses that allow employees and customers to securely connect and stay logged into the apps they need the company is targeting an 80 billion addressable market which is made up of 35 billion from workforce identity 30 billion from customer identity and 15 billion from newer products identity governance iga and privileged access management pam okta launched iga last year and the response has been positive so far ceo todd mckinnon said it s exceeded all expectations and according to comments from guggenheim analyst john difucci some customers are waiting for the release of pam to buy the whole okta suite okta expects to release pam in next year and the privileged access product could be a significant driver when it comes out okta s revenue run rate is only just hitting 2 billion and its addressable market of 80 billion implies that the company has a huge growth opportunity in front of it which it looks well positioned to capitalize on as the independent cloud identity provider while 2023 may present challenges the company is delivering ahead of expectations on the bottom line and it should get a boost from the launch of privileged access management okta stock was clearly oversold coming into the third quarter earnings report and at a price to sales ratio of just 6 the stock still has a lot of upside potential especially once the recessionary headwinds fade
investors can find market beating investments even when most stocks are down the s p 500 is down 14 year to date as of this writing as it stands this is the worst year for the stock market since 2008 and it s the third worst year for stocks since 1974 with depressing results like these you might think the market is comprised entirely of losers but you d be wrong shares of beverage company celsius holdings celh 1 32 shoemaker crocs crox 2 17 and law enforcement technology company axon enterprise axon 0 99 have already more than doubled from their 52 week lows and look poised for future gains 1 celsius up 180 since jan 27 celsius sells energy drinks it claims will burn calories even when resting the company has been around for about two decades but only gained meaningful distribution and market share in recent years and with its recent gains the stock has roared higher it s up not only 180 from this year s low but also up over 2 000 in just the past three years obviously it s not enough to just increase distribution consumers must also buy the product but that s what s happening with celsius year to date celsius has been the top driver of growth in the u s energy drink category consumers apparently love it so it s not surprising the company s top line is soaring as well with year to date revenue up 126 compared to the same period in 2021 if it s true that increased distribution is driving gains for celsius stock shareholders better hold onto their hats the company signed a distribution deal with pepsico that celsius management says will take the business to the next level pepsi only took over celsius distribution on oct 1 so the impact of the deal wasn t felt during the third quarter of 2022 however celsius management noted an immediate increase in sales metrics in the weeks following the change which bodes well for the fourth quarter and beyond in my opinion the most tantalizing aspect of celsius deal with pepsi is international expansion through the first three quarters of 2022 celsius has generated net sales of 476 million 94 of which came from north american markets by contrast pepsi is a global brand and it has the international network to propel celsius to worldwide prominence i wouldn t expect 180 returns in 2023 but celsius still has a long runway for future gains even if another doubling isn t imminent 2 crocs up 111 since june 16 i believe crocs stock can double faster than celsius the path is clear a big component of my investment thesis relates to croc s 2 5 billion acquisition of peer heydude for starters i believe it paid a great price the heydude brand alone is expected to generate revenue of 940 million to 980 million in 2022 meaning crocs paid just 2 6 times sales for the fast growing brand for perspective heydude s revenue was around 570 million in 2021 giving it about 68 year over year growth heydude will help crocs fuel its top line in the coming years but the crocs brand itself is still growing nicely as well management expects full year crocs brand revenue of over 2 6 billion in 2022 up 13 and by expanding into new geographies gaining market share and raising prices management believes it can achieve over 6 billion in total company revenue in 2026 just four full years from now crocs profit margins are better than heydude s in the third quarter crocs brand had a gross margin of 54 9 whereas heydude s gross margin was just 48 8 but i m betting crocs more experienced management team can squeeze greater profitability out of heydude in the coming years long term management is shooting for an operating margin of at least 26 if it surpasses 6 billion in revenue the company s operating income could reach 1 5 billion and if the stock trades at a multiple of just eight times its operating profit a below average valuation crocs would have a market capitalization of 12 billion in 2026 that s double where crocs stock trades today so no it s not too late for long term investors to buy crocs stock 3 axon enterprise up 120 since may 11 on nov 8 axon enterprise reported financial results for the third quarter of 2022 and it was the company s best quarter this year the company grew revenue 34 year over year to 312 million earned 12 million in net income and raised revenue guidance for full year 2022 but these aren t the numbers that impressed me the most most of axon s revenue comes in package deals agencies can get nonlethal tasers body cameras cloud storage and software services all in one contract these contracts are signed for long periods some even 10 years giving investors great visibility into future revenue but this also means the business generates a large percentage of recurring revenue these are the numbers that impressed me axon s annual recurring revenue arr at the end of the third quarter was 403 million up 9 5 quarter over quarter that s axon s largest quarterly jump in arr this year moreover the company s remaining performance obligations rpo sit at 3 7 billion up 400 million from the second quarter and the biggest quarterly jump in 2022 of these stocks i believe it will take axon the longest to double from here because of its price tag some might point out its valuation is comparable to celsius however celsius should see stronger growth in the near term thanks to its partnership with pepsi by contrast axon stock looks like it might be getting ahead of itself that said if you told me i had to invest in only one of these three companies and couldn t touch the investment even once for the next 10 years i d invest in axon as noted its long term contracts make this an incredibly predictable business it s gaining momentum with new customer bases including federal agencies like the secret service and the company is loaded with 371 million in cash equivalents and investments with no debt to be clear i like celsius crocs and axon as long term investments but axon is as strong of an investment opportunity as they come
